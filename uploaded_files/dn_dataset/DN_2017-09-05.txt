There are no abductions under good governance: Ganesan
Under the present good governance there are no abductions, no disappearances, no murders and we are enjoying the benefits of bringing this regime in to power, said National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan.
He said so after distributing materials to the families of missing persons in the Batticaloa District during the mobile service conducted at Onthachchimadam Sri Vinayagar Maha Vidyalaya in the Manmunai South and Eruvil Pattu Secretarial Division, organized by Institute for National Languages Education and Training, on Sunday (3).
He further said, If any politicians say that there is no war, I will not agree. We are finding solutions to problems; this is the fact. We are gifting books to the children of missing persons, and we are doing this because we are concerned about them. We are also trying to solve the language barriers in obtaining copies and translations of documents such as birth certificates, marriage certificates and death certificates.
The Batticaloa District has suffered from the war. Even though the war is no more, the reason for the war are still unsolved. We have a duty to find the whereabouts of the missing persons. In the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, these persons were unaccounted for. Now we bear the burden for these acts. People with various religions and ethnic groups live in Sri Lanka and we are all children belonging to our Mother Lanka, he added.
Manmunai South and Eruvil Pattu Divisional Secretary Sivapriya Vilvaretnam presided. Batticaloa District TNA Parliamentarians G. Sirinesan, S. Viyalendran and officials from the Ministry were also present.

Treasury Bond issue : Palisena instructed PTL Chief dealer Salgado to crash voice logger of call recording system
Chief Dealer of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Nuwan Salgado yesterday revealed before the Treasury Bond Commission that PTL CEO Kasun Palisena instructed him to crash the voice logger computer of his companys telephone call recording system.
In the morning session of the commission, PTL IT Executive Sachith Devatantri admitted that he crashed the Acer computer under instructions of PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado.
Following Devatantris testimony, Salgado took to the witness box and unraveled as to from which high rank officer in the PTL he received instructions, which he later on conveyed to Devatantri.
According to Salgado, himself, Devatantri and Palisena have decided on crashing the voice logger computer and replacing it with another PC.
According to evidence led before the commission, Devatantri has pointed out to Salgado that deleted data can be recovered, so removing the original computer will be advisable.
When Commissioner P.S. Jayawardena asked the witness if Kasun Palisena would have crashed the computer without informing Arjun Aloysius, Salgado said he was not sure, but he (Arjun Aloysius) would have known.
Salgado also disclosed to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue, that PTL CEO Kasun Palisena instructed him to listen, identify and delete the call recordings which are harmful to the interest of the PTL because they have relevance with Treasury Bond auctions held on March 29, 30 2016 worth around Rs. 40 billion transactions.
Salgado said over 100 calls were deleted in the process.
According to previous evidence led before the PCoI, PTL IT executive Sachit Devatantri deleted telephone calls in PTL call logger system on 6 July 2017 as well, when the Criminal Investigation Department commenced investigations on PTL.
Salgado further said that the instruction to listen and identify the call recordings which were harmful to the PTL came in November 2016.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda: What did Palisena instruct you You can even keep your hand on the Bible. I have seen you contemplating, which I do not like to see. You have done it with me before as well.
Salgado: Kasun Palisena asked me to delete some call recordings.
ASG: Did you comply
S: Yes. I listened to calls and marked the index numbers of the relevant calls which I thought were harmful.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodgoda, who was leading evidence, pointed out the time period sequels to Central Bank beginning investigations regarding the Treasury Bond issue and imposing regulatory measures on the PTL.
Salgado failed to divulge the identities of outside parties who were involved in these deleted conversations. He said some of the deleted telephone conversations were between Kasun Palisena and Arjun Aloysius.
Commissioner Supreme Court Judge P.S.Jayawardena then questioned the witness regarding the telephone conversations that Salgado thought were harmful to the interest of the PTL.
Justice Jayawardena: How long did it take you to identify and delete these calls
Salgado: I did it continuously.
JJ: Who were these calls with PTL dealers and
S: I cannot remember. I listened to many calls.
JJ: What do you mean by a harmful phone call to PTL
S: Conversations which give an impression that PTL has done something wrong.
JJ: Can you name at least one party
S: I cannot remember.
JJ: You cannot know. It is difficult for us to believe what you are saying. You consciously decided that these calls were harmful to PTL. Do you think Kasun Palisena did this on his own
S: I do not know.
JJ: Tell me at least one person who was involved in these conversations.
S: May be Kasun and Arjun Aloysius.
JJ: No, I meant one person outside PTL. Honestly you cannot forget!
Justice Jayawardena then questioned the witness as how to define harmful calls.
JJ: I am trying to understand what is meant by harmful. For example, if a conversation indicated that PTL is getting a bargain advantage to PTL and a disadvantage to another party, would you call it harmful
S: Yes, I would.
JJ: If PTL raise yield rates upwards or downwards and influence the market, would it also be considered harmful to PTL interest
S: Yes.
JJ: If insider information happens to be in these conversations
S: Yes.
ASG Kodagoda asked the witness if he has gained anything personal from his involvement in the process of destroying evidence. Salgado denied and said he has not received anything other than his salary and the bonuses.
Justice Jayawardena: Was it the same kind of bonus that other people will generally receive
Salgado: I am not aware of other peoples bonuses.
ASG Kodagoda: you cannot say you do not know, I showed you some documents. Did you receive any rewards for involving yourself in this case
S: No I did not.
It was also observed that anybody who has access to the call logger computer, could have deleted telephone call recordings.
Salgado produced four compact disks containing unaltered call recordings from 20 May 2015 to 31 March 2016.
The notes indicating serial numbers relevant to the telephone call records, which were given to Devatantri by Salgado were also marked before the PCoI.
Meanwhile, Salgado apologised to PCoI for misleading the commission. It was not my personal decision. It came from above me. I did not want to purposely mislead the commission. He said.
ASG Kodagoda informed Salgado that he is entitled to receive witness protection from the CID, since he has testified against his employer. Counsel for Arjun Aloysius Anuja Premaratne PC and Palisenas lawyer Kalinga Indatissa PC are to cross examine the witness on Wednesday (06).

Treasury Bond issue: Perpetual Lawyer to step down
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL)Lawyer Nihal Fernando PC said that he could not continue to represent the company and will make a decision by Wednesday following the revelation of deleted phone calls by Perpetual Treasuries. It is matter of my professional reputation. I did my best with regard the transactions but this was beyond me he said. He further said that he completely relied on the instructions given to him by his client, Perpetual Treasuries.
I told them to give everything they had.The notices were first sent to the holding company, but still I told them to give everything that they have. That is all I can do he said.
Commissioner Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said that he did not doubt the integrity of Fernando.
We dont doubt your integrity for a moment. We have the highest regard for you, Jayawardena said.
Earlier during an exchange between ASG Dappula De Livera, Yasantha Kodagoda and Fernando, De Livera said that Fernando had given an undertaking that all the recordings were provided.
Fernando said he did and that he complied with the undertaking to the best of his knowledge relying on the instructions given to him.
Kodagoda, thereafter asked Fernando if his client had lied to him to which Fernando said  yes.
Fernando further said that it was not professionally correct to walk out of the proceedings as he had an obligation to his client. However, he said he will talk to his client and step down.  They can find someone else instead of me he said.
Fernando also observed that if there is a criminal aspect to the issue it would be difficult him to represent PTL.
The Commissioners thereafter asked Fernando to make his decision by Wednesday.
Giving evidence today Perpetual Treasuries Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado said that they had planned to  crash the computer which recorded the calls.
He together with Kasun Palisena- the Chief Executive Officer of PTL nd the Head of IT Sachith Devathantri had discussed the crashing if the computer.
When questioned as to if Arjun Aloysius was aware of the decision to crash the computer, Salgado said he assumed he was.
Yes he should have been aware he said.
Salgado also said that he was instructed by Kasun Palisena to delete recordings which were bad for PTL in the event an investigation was carried out.
The instructions from Palisena was given after the Central Bank placed restrictions on PTL in November 2016.
Salgado also said that even though he was the Chief Dealer for Perpetual, he was not involved in any of the transactions with Saman Kumara, the Chief Dealer of the Employees Provident Fund.
He said all the dealings between Saman Kumara and PTL were handled by Palisena.
Salgado further said that he was not involved in the February 27 Bond transaction. He said the transaction was conducted by Palisena.
When questioned by the Commission as to if Arjun Aloysius was involved in the decision making of the February 27 transaction, Salgado said,  yes he should have been.

Virtuous fragrance before rain
With a heritage of glorious history from Buddhas times, this gives a unique opportunity to thousands who wait eagerly to gain merit by partaking in giving along attending to the daily needs of the Sangha during the vassana season. The early Buddhist monk was a mendicant and he depended on the generosity of the laymen for his existence
Ayan Vassana Kalo! This is the vassana period believed to be the highest merit bestowing religious ceremony performed in the Buddha Sasana coming down from the days of Thathagatha the Perfect One, the supremely enlightened one. We see Buddha Dhamma and Sangha indivisibly together during this period. There is no other time that the Triple Gem is venerated by the Buddhists so much.
We have no doubt one who sees the Dhamma sees the Thathagatha and vice versa. The Buddha has already passed away into Parinibbana. But his teachings still remains. It is nothing but Dhamma.
Loving kindness
Boundless are the virtues and goodness of the Buddha, Boundless is the excellence of Dhamma, Boundless are the virtues of Buddhas enlightened disciples  the Sangha with their mission to teach the multitude of Buddhists. This awakened awareness endlessly generating loving kindness and compassion in them is very well seen during the vassana period.
With a heritage of glorious history from Buddhas times, this gives a unique opportunity to thousands who wait eagerly to gain merit by partaking in giving along attending to the daily needs of the Sangha during the vassana season. The early Buddhist monk was a mendicant and he depended on the generosity of the laymen for his existence.
This became all the more important during the rainy season during which time they are confined to the temple. According to the Buddha, those who have become Bhikkhus, having given up worldly pleasures are free to devote their full-time energy, effort to concentrate on Dhamma. They meditate during vas time as the achievement of Sila is what is expected of them. There was also the belief that merit could be acquired by the laity by making offerings to the Sangha venerating Dhamma and finally the Triple Gem.
Sacred religious event
Binara full moon poya day occupies a significant place in the history of Buddha Sasana. It is on this day, Bhikkuni Sasana was founded. Vinaya Pitaka and Anguttara Nikaya make mention of setting up of the monastic order for women. At one time when Buddha was in Kapilavaththu, his step mother Maha Prajapathi Gothami asked for permission to go forth into the homeless life. The Buddha refused saying: no Gothami do not wish for women to enter homeless life in this doctrine and discipline of Thathagatha. She made the same request on two other occasions and she was disappointed as the Buddha gave a negative answer each time.
On a later occasion when the Buddha was residing in Vesali Maha Prajapathi Gothami Rahula Matha and a large group of Sakyan ladies cut their hair, dressed in ascetic clothes and traveled a long distance to Vesali to show their profound determination. At this juncture, Thera Ananda made a new request on their behalf. The Buddha now gave permission to Maha Prajapathi Gothami to enter the order on condition that she would accept the Eight Great Conditions.
Hence they got the opportunity to follow [the Noble one, who is steadfast, wise, learned dutiful and devout. one should follow only such a Noble Man who is truly good and discerning even do the moon follow the path of stars The Dhammapada].

VW recalls 1.8 million cars in China


More than 1.8 million Volkswagen cars are being recalled in China because of a faulty fuel pump.
China's consumer watchdog said the recall affected vehicles made by VW and its two Chinese joint ventures with SAIC and FAW.
The defect can cause the engine to stall due to an electronics failure in the fuel pump.
The makers will replace the fuel pump control modules free of charge starting in December.
It was not immediately clear whether it was part of a previously announced global recall.
The recall applies to Magotans made between 2007 and 2014 and the CC produced domestically by FAW-Volkswagen between 2009 and 2014, as well as the 2011-2015 Passat made by SAIC Volkswagen.
About 19,000 imported models are also affected, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said.
VW apparently became aware of the latest defect after an investigation by Chinese authorities that began in April 2016.
Last week, the company told US regulators that it was recalling 281,000 vehicles due to similar problems with the fuel pump.
The recall is the latest embarrassment for the world's biggest car maker.
In March VW recalled nearly 680,000 Audi cars in China over defects in coolant pumps that could lead to engine fires.
And in May FAW recalled almost 580,000 Golf and Sagitar cars because of a headlight fuse defect.
VW is still struggling to recover from the controversy after admitting that it had installed "cheat" devices in its diesel cars to evade emissions tests.
In March the company pleaded guilty to charges stemming from "dieselgate" and agreed to pay $4.3bn (3.3bn; 3.6bn euros) in penalties, as well as $17.5bn in compensation and fixes for owners.
Volkswagen still faces legal challenges in Germany and worldwide, and has set aside more than 22bn euros ($24.4bn) to cover costs, although the final bill from the scandal could be even higher.
In June, VW said it would offer a two-year guarantee for the cars in Europe that it is modifying. A number of UK consumers have complained that the modifications have affected performance and reliability.

Whatever happened to the monastic Sangha
In a traditional Buddhist country like Sri Lanka, it isnt unusual for lay people to become Dharma teachers. They give discourses, they conduct classes, they give meditation instructions, and sometimes conduct meditation courses and retreats; but when they do so, theyre almost always nested within a system that gives priority to the monastic order. Usually they will have studied and trained under monastic teachers, and theyll continue to pay homage to the monastic sangha as such, not merely to individual monastic teachers. If any lay teacher turns against the monastic sangha, those lay devotees who have faith in the sangha will steer clear of them
Bhikkhu Bodhi
First I should say, not as an excuse but by way of explanation, that I learned that I was to be a presenter only two days ago. I was a bit disoriented when I learned this, for I hadnt prepared anything to speak about in advance. At first, I decided to make it easy for myself and give a presentation based on a paper that I already had on hand. But one statement that Venerable Heng Liang made yesterday, at the end of her talk, kept on ringing through my mind. It was the statement: If a monastic sangha doesnt become well established in America, I dont see much hope for the Dharma here.
Today I woke up long before dawn and those words immediately popped into my mind. I felt that I had somehow to address this topic in my talk. Suddenly ideas started to come together in my mind, at that very early hour. I sat down and started jotting down notes, and before long the draft of a paper was taking shape. Due to this mornings activities, I could type out my notes only after lunch, and I just managed to print out a version to refer to during my talk ten minutes ago. The ideas arent well organised, but I will present them anyway. Please dont mind if they are a bit out of sequence.
In my talk I want to consider how we can move in a direction whereby the sangha assumes its special role as the torch-bearer of the Buddhas message, yet does so in a way that doesnt alienate lay people, but on the contrary can win their trust, confidence, and devotion.
Here in the United States, and maybe more broadly in the West, we have a rather unusual situation, matched perhaps only by Japan, where the most prominent teaching roles in several Buddhist traditions have been taken over by the laity, and not seldom this has been done with the blessings of members of the monastic sangha. Sometimes, in fact, lay teachers train and even certify monastic sangha members as teachers. It seems to me that the training in the sangha should prepare monks and nuns to serve as Dharma teachers, for they have dedicated their lives to this purpose; yet in todays world, we also have to prepare earnest lay people to understand, practice, and teach the Dharma, which implies a respect for their potentials as practitioners and teachers. Yet this should be done within a system that recognizes the monastic sangha as the custodian of the Dharma as well as the field of merit for the lay community.
Monastic order
Now, in a traditional Buddhist country like Sri Lanka, it isnt unusual for lay people to become Dharma teachers. They give discourses, they conduct classes, they give meditation instructions, and sometimes conduct meditation courses and retreats; but when they do so, theyre almost always nested within a system that gives priority to the monastic order. Usually they will have studied and trained under monastic teachers, and theyll continue to pay homage to the monastic sangha as such, not merely to individual monastic teachers. If any lay teacher turns against the monastic sangha, those lay devotees who have faith in the sangha will steer clear of them. Such teachersand there are a sprinkling of them nowadays in Sri Lankaare usually recognizable by the idiosyncratic character of their teaching.
In traditional pre-modern Buddhism, the roles for laity and monastics are clearly defined, and there is also a clearly defined version of the Dharma for each. This structure, though, can be rigid and limiting. The laity see their primary task to be that of acquiring merit, which will ensure them a favourable rebirth in their next existence and provide supporting conditions for the attainment of the ultimate Buddhist goal, nibbana.
The practice for the laypeople that goes along with this task is primarily giving (dana), which usually means giving food to monks, observing precepts, undertaking devotional practices, and practicing short periods of meditation, usually on special observance days. The meditation practiced is primarily recollection of the Buddha, recollection of the Sangha, and loving-kindness meditation. Asian lay Buddhists who have been subject to modern influences emanating from the West have developed a new understanding of their roles, and so, while they continue to support the monastic order and look up to the monks as the custodians of the Dharma, they are also intent on learning the Dharma in depth and on practicing intensive insight meditation.
Asian Theravada countries
The roles of monastic persons in theory are intensive study of the Dharma and meditation, as well as performing services for the laity. What happens in practice, however, in most temples in Asian Theravada countries, is that the role of performing services for the laity gains the upper hand; it has even become the major function of temple monks. Even intensive, in-depth study of the Dharma has faded out, and the practice of meditation has almost vanished, so that it is reduced to just five or ten minutes of quiet sitting in the daily devotional service. Forest monks often place more emphasis on meditation in the hope of reaching true attainment.
For all its shortcomings, in traditional Asian Buddhism, these activities take place against a long-standing background that includes trust and confidence in the Three Jewels as objects of devotion and a world view that is determined largely by the teachings of the suttas and the commentaries. It is built upon solid trust in the law of karma and rebirth and upon an aspiration for nibbana as a state of world-transcending realization.
Modern Westerners, in contrast, come to the Dharma from an entirely different stance of consciousness. They generally have a much higher level of education than traditional village Buddhists. Many Westerners will have read widely in psychology and in fields that might be grouped under the heading of spirituality and higher consciousness. They also approach the Dharma with different problems in mind and they therefore naturally seek different solutions.
When Westerners come to Buddhism, they bring to their encounter with the Dharma an acute sense of what I shall call existential suffering. By this expression, Im not referring to clinical depression, or a disposition to morbid states of mind, or any type of psychopathology. What I mean is a gnawing sense of lack, a feeling of incompleteness or inadequacy, that cant be filled by any of the ordinary sources of enjoyment. This sense of existential suffering can coexist with a personality that is, by all other criteria, quite sound and healthy.
Sometimes existential suffering takes the form of a feeling of loneliness that cant be eliminated by any number of social contacts or human relationships; sometimes its a feeling that my life is empty, devoid of meaning and purpose; or sometimes its just a conviction that there has to be more to life than acquiring rewards and trophies in the great American success story. For those who come from a deeply religious background and have lost their faith, it can manifest as a feeling of infinite absence, the absence of God that has to be filled with something else to give an ultimate meaning to life, an objective source of meaning or purpose without which life seems pointless and absurd.
This sense of existential suffering, or fundamental lack, is the primary motive that drives most Westerners to seek the Dharma. People troubled by existential suffering come to the Dharma in search of what I would call radical therapy. Since they generally arent psychopathological, they arent using the Dharma as a psychotherapy.
Though some have criticized them for doing so, in my observation this isnt the case. But they are approaching it as what we might call an existential therapy. They are trying to fill a hole at the bottom of their existence. They are seeking above all a practice that they can integrate into their daily lives in order to transform the felt quality of their lives.
They arent seeking explanations; they arent seeking a new religion; and generally, they arent seeking a new system of beliefs.
They come to the Dharma seeking a radical therapy, a method that will provide them with concrete, tangible, and immediate changes in the way they experience their worlds. And most Buddhist teachersor rather, let me say, most Dharma teachersare presenting the Dharma as exactly that. They are presenting the Dharma as a practice, a way, a path, that will help ameliorate this disturbing sense of existential suffering. They are presenting it as a radical, pragmatic, existential therapy that does not require any beliefs, that does not ask for any more faith than a readiness to apply the method and see what kind of results one can get from it. What is being given is something that is ably captured by the title of an extremely popular book on Buddhism, a title and a book that encapsulate very well the nature of this lay Dharma practice. The title of the book is Buddhism Without Beliefs.

Where sanctity reigns: History of Kathina, the Buddhist Robe Offering Ceremony
The Kathina festival is a major observance of Theravada Buddhism. It is a time for laypeople to offer cloth for robes and other necessities to the monastic sangha. Kathina takes place every year in the four weeks following the end of Vassa, the rains retreat.
Appreciating Kathina requires going back to the time of the Buddha and the first Buddhist monks. We begin with the story of some monks who spent a rainy season together.
This story is from the Mahavagga, which is a section of the Pali Vinaya-pitaka.
Sodden countryside
The historical Buddha spent most of his life in India, which is known for its summer monsoon season. As the number of his followers grew, he realized that hundreds of monks and nuns traveling on foot through the sodden countryside could damage crops and injure wildlife.
So the Buddha made a rule that monks and nuns would not travel during the monsoon, but would spend the rainy season together in meditation and study.
This was the origin of Vassa, the annual three-month rains retreat still observed in parts of Asia with a rainy season. During Vassa, monks remain inside their monasteries and intensify their practice.
Once thirty forest-dwelling monks wished to spend the rainy season with the Buddha, and they traveled together to where he would be staying. Unfortunately, the walk took longer than they anticipated, and the monsoons began before they had reached the Buddha's summer dwelling.
The thirty monks were disappointed but made the best of it. They found a place to stay together, and they meditated and studied together. And after three months, when the monsoon season ended, they hurried to find the Buddha. But the roads were thick with mud, and rain still drizzled from the clouds and dripped from trees, and by the time they reached the Buddha their robes were muddy and drenched.
They sat some distance from the Buddha, uncomfortable and probably embarrassed to be wearing such wet, dirty robes in the presence of their revered teacher. But the Buddha greeted them warmly and asked how their retreat had gone. Had they lived together harmoniously Had they had enough food Yes, they said.
Buddhist Monks' Robes
At this point, it must be explained that it wasn't easy for a monk to get new robes. Under the rules of the Vinaya, monks could not buy cloth, or ask someone for cloth, or borrow robes from another monk. Buddhist monks' and nuns' robes were to be made from "pure cloth," meaning cloth no one else wanted. So, monks and nuns scavenged in rubbish heaps looking for discarded cloth that had been scorched by fire, stained with blood, or even used as a shroud before cremation.
The cloth would be boiled with vegetable matter such as bark, leaves, flowers, and spices, which usually gave the cloth an orange color (hence the name "saffron robe"). Monks sewed the bits of cloth together to make their own robes. On top of that, the monastics were allowed to possess only the robes they wore, and they needed permission to take the time to scavenge for cloth. They were not allowed to keep the leftover cloth for their own future use.
So our muddy forest-dwelling monks resigned themselves to wearing moldy, muddy robes for their foreseeable futures.
The Buddha Initiates Kathina
The Buddha perceived the sincere dedication of the forest-dwelling monks and felt compassion for them. A layperson had just given him a donation of cloth, and he gave this cloth to the monks to make a new robe for one among them.
He also temporarily suspended some of the rules for all disciples who completed the Vassa retreat. For example, they were given more free time to see their families.
The Buddha also established a procedure for giving and receiving cloth to make robes. In the month following the end of Vassa, gifts of cloth may be given to a sangha, or community, of monastics, but not to individual monks or nuns. Usually, two monks are designated to accept cloth for the entire sangha.

Young players deliver their best at Asian Rugby Sevens - skipper Muthuthanthri
Sri Lanka rugby sevens captain Sudarshana Muthuthanthri praised his team mates and said they all delivered their best for the country at the first leg of the Asian Rugby Sevens tournament concluded in Hong Kong recently. They showed their prowess, but unfortunately lost to China in the Cup quarter-finals due to mistakes at crucial stages. China has improved a lot in recent times and beat experienced Sri Lanka side in last years Asian Sevens in Colombo, Muthuthanthri mentioned.
Our youngsters lacked experience and were unable to win kick off balls and made blunders in the rucks. But the experience gained in this Sevens tourney will stand them in good stead in the second leg in Korea in two weeks time.
Sri Lanka finished fifth in the first leg in Hong Kong after beating Malaysia in the semi-finals and Philippines in the final of the Plate Championship. This was as a result of fielding a young side but even winning the Plate Championship was a big achievement.

Australia recognises strategic significance of Indian Ocean
We want to work with all our partners in the region to create a strong Indian Ocean personality that will draw the diverse countries of our region together, Secretary of the Australian Governments Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Frances Adamson said.
She was addressing the Indian Ocean Conference in Colombo recently
Adamson said all countries should work together to shape a strong regional order based on adherence to international law.
We need to consult and collaborate on regional challenges. We need to build stronger regional institutions. We need to step up our engagement with regional partners on our own terms and where it is in our long-term interests, she said
She said she was pleased to have the opportunity to present an Australian perspective on peace in the Indian Ocean, whose waters wash the shores of Western Australia. Australias search and rescue region stretches halfway across the Indian Ocean and borders the search and rescue regions of six other Indian Ocean countries.
She said European nations found themselves at war a century ago. It was a time of intense great power rivalry, driven by rapid industrialisation and shifts in global economic power. It was a time of rapid technological change and sharp military competition. It was also a time of unprecedented globalisation, which made life substantially materially better for many people, but there were also many people all over the world left behind and there were pockets of instability, she said.
The idea that a conflict could arise out of Europe today is very unlikely  Brexit changes nothing in that calculation. Global disparities are nowhere near as stark as they were a century ago. There are many more successful societies these days, on the back of decades of peace and prosperity, including here in the Indo-Pacific, she said.
Three characteristics  great power rivalry, rapid technological change and unprecedented globalisation  are all present today, as weve been reminded very forcefully in the past few weeks with heightened global concern around North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile tests.
Today, intensifying great power rivalries are found here in the Indo-Pacific. Seventy two years since they were last deployed in war, nuclear weapons are now held by the widest grouping of states in their history. Nations across the Indo-Pacific are modernising their military forces in accordance with their newfound economic strength. The international community is more globalised today than ever before, but economically, politically, socially, North Korea is deeply isolated, Adamson said.
She said that when it was thought about what sort of Indian Ocean region needed to build in the decades ahead, it was not one characterised by conflict. |On the contrary, we dont want the Indian Ocean to become a militarised arena for great power rivalry,| she said.
At this years Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Prime Minister Turnbull put this question to the countries of the Indo-Pacific: even when the risk of war remains remote  what kind of peace can we maintain Adamson said.
All countries represented here today have a fundamental national interest in fostering peace and security in the Indian Ocean region. But peace, stability and security do not just happen. They require collective, proactive efforts to shape a stable rules-based regional order. They require all countries to establish and uphold norms and mechanisms for dealing peacefully with risks and threats before they become existential. With the global order in a state of flux, the countries of the Indian Ocean rim need to step up our collective efforts to shape the future of our region, the Secretary said.
She said competition between littoral states had defined the geopolitical character of the Atlantic and Pacific. and historically, the character of the Atlantic had been shaped by rivalry between great powers and a grand alliance between North America and Europe, NATO. She said that over centuries, it had been marked by a sharp divide between North and South, particularly regarding the experience and legacy of imperialism and colonialism.
Since the Cold War, the Pacific has been a story of Asian powers rising against a backdrop of strong US leadership. The countries of the Pacific have built extensive architecture to strengthen habits of dialogue, cooperation and consultation. Australia played a key role in building APEC and (around the ASEAN core) the East Asia Summit, and we are active in supporting their continuing development, she said.
It is in no-ones interest to see the Indian Ocean militarised for great power rivalry. We dont see here maritime and territorial disputes like those in the South China Sea. It is in our interests to maintain that approach, as India and Bangladesh did in their UNCLOS conciliation. It is in our interests to build peace on our own terms, by establishing and reinforcing the norms and rules we want, including freedom of navigation and overflight, before they are established for us.
We need to work together proactively to shape a rules-based regional order that protects national sovereignty, and promotes collaboration and consultation. We want to encourage all states to respect international law, including UNCLOS, and we need to recognise the complexity of our strategic environment, which is why Australia is preparing a Foreign Policy White Paper for release this year, she said
Adamson said it was necessary to work harder to build regional security architecture for the Indian Ocean. Countries of the Indian Ocean could learn lessons from ASEANs success, she said.
She said Indian Ocean architecture had been limited at present.
The Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) is the regions premier forum for high-level dialogue. We must continue to support and strengthen its role in tackling regional challenges but we need to work to sharpen IORAs strategic focus.
Australia welcomes the work of sub-regional forums, such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), she said.
We are working together with regional partners on informal trilateral and small groupings such as the Secretary-level India-Japan-Australia trilateral dialogue, which last met in April, and a 1.5 track Australia-India-Indonesia Trilateral Dialogue due to take place in November.
In these efforts, we welcome Indias leadership role, and that of South Africa, through IORA, she said.
India is an emerging great power and a natural leader in the Indian Ocean region and globally. We support the role India has played in helping shape the strategic and economic environment in the Indian Ocean region. We welcome Indias strengthened relationship with the United States and increased engagement in the broader Indo-Pacific, including with ASEAN-centred forums, she said.
She said Indias trajectory boded well for our region and all stood to benefit from Indias rise.
We welcome Indias growing ties with Indonesia. Indonesia is a long-standing partner for Australia on regional challenges in the Asia-Pacific and, increasingly, the Indian Ocean region. It too is an emerging regional and global power with tremendous potential for growth. As Chair of IORA since 2015, Indonesia has showed vision and ambition in bringing together leaders for IORAs 20th Anniversary. The Jakarta Concord, signed by leaders at the IORA Leaders Summit in March, was an important affirmation of our shared commitment to building peace, stability and prosperity in our region.
We look forward to working with South Africa when it becomes IORA Chair next month. Although Australia will move out of the IORA Troika, we intend to continue to play an active role in building IORA into a stronger, more effective and influential organisation.
It isnt only the regions four G20 countries that have a leadership role to play in the region. Australia applauds Sri Lankas ambition to become a trading hub.
Geography is on its side. As economic power in the world shifts from West to East, with the rise of India and China, Sri Lanka is in a box seat. As it moves forward its economic and constitutional reform agenda in order to progress reconciliation, we see great promise for this island country, she said.
In the decades ahead, external powers will have legitimate interests in our region. Indian Ocean shipping lanes are crucial to the energy security and economies of other countries around the world. Over 80 per cent of Chinas crude oil imports and up to 90 per cent of Japans oil imports are shipped through the Indian Ocean. Half of the worlds container traffic transits through the Indian Ocean.
We should welcome constructive engagement from external powers. It is in the regions interests to increase dialogue, links and cooperation with partners around the world.
We should also welcome greater engagement from outside our region on regional development initiatives, including initiatives to improve regional connectivity and infrastructure. These must be transparent, uphold existing international standards, provide genuine commercial opportunities for business and respect the sovereignty of Indian Ocean countries, Adamson said.

Hypocritical attitude of politicians done away with under Yahapalana govt
All necessary steps were taken to eliminate the hypocritical attitude of politicians soon after establishing the Yahapalana Government  on the mandate of the people, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalata Athukorale said.
She said so at a reception accorded to her by the United National Party supporters and citizens in the Eheliyagoda area at a reception held at the Eheliyagoda PS auditorium.
Prior to the reception, Minister Athukorale received blessings of the Maha Sangha at Eheliyagoda Sri Madarasingharamaya Temple.
Minister Athukorale said although she has to handle two different ministries, she will try to perform her duties honestly for the well-being of the people.
A group of narrow-minded persons says that the present government did nothing for the past two years. However, the establishment of peace and harmony throughout the country and taking steps to rebuild the nation by our government is admired by the critically-thinking citizens, she pointed out.
She added that during the period of the previous regime, their henchmen were allowed to cheat the people and earn money under the so-called development. We have already finalized arrangements to provide 10,000 land deeds for the landless, pave the way to create more employment opportunities and to supply electricity for the needy, Minister Athukorale said.
She said in order to end the Eheliyagoda town garbage disposal problem, another plot of land from Beruwana Estate will be allocated for the Pradeshiya Sabha.
Iddamalgoda Denagamuwa Viharadhipathi Ven Pohorabawe Wimalatissa Thera, Sabargamuwa Provincial Councillors Siripala Kiriella, Nimal Wijenaike and K. L. Ratnaike also spoke.

PMs attention drawn to victims of political violence
Prime Minister's attention has been drawn towards the payment of compensation to UNP supporters who underwent suffering and property damage due to political violence. UNP supporters in Ratnapura endured untold suffering and property damage, particularly during the time of the Nalanda Ellawala assassination and justice should be meted out to them, said Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
She was addressing the gathering at a reception accorded to her near the Ratnapura clock tower on September 2. It was organised by Parliamentarian A.A. Wijetuna and Ratnapura Municipal Council former Opposition Leader Lakshman Munasinghe.
Athukorale said that she never considered the new Ministry entrusted to her as an ornament, but as an opportunity to serve the people better. Today, the people of this country who wanted a change in 2015 had been afforded the opportunity to live in peace and freedom under an independent judiciary.
The Government had done a great amount of service during the last two years in office, but unfortunately, no one highlighted it. Investigations had been completed against wrongdoers of the previous regime and relevant reports and files had been forwarded to the Attorney General who will file indictment in Court against them. When action was taken against corrupt individuals in the former regime, the Joint Opposition was trying to interpret as political victimisation.
She said the Government had given an unprecedented amount of relief to victims of natural disasters during the last two years. Parliamentarians A. A. Wijetunga and several others also spoke.

Bangladesh reach 253-6 despite Lyons five wickets
Chittagong: Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon claimed five wickets but Bangladesh fought back to reach 253-6 at stumps on the opening day of the second Test. Lyon decimated Bangladeshs top order with four consecutive lbws before Sabbir Rahman and Mushfiqur Rahim put on 105 for the sixth wicket to steady the hosts in Chittagong.
Monsoon rain could disrupt play on the second day, putting pressure on Steve Smiths men to polish off Bangladeshs tail early as they seek a win to equalise the two-Test series. Australia lost their first-ever Test against Bangladesh last week and dropped a fast bowler in Chittagong to strengthen their spin attack on a turning wicket.
Lyon claimed his fifth wicket in the last session when Sabbir was stumped.
But skipper Mushfiqur Rahim remains an obstacle for the tourists, unbeaten on 62 and patiently holding together the innings.
Nasir Hossain, the last recognised batsman, was the other not out player with 19 at close of play at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium. Rahim and Sabbir displayed contrasting styles in their stand, with Sabbir playing adventurous shots and Rahim anchoring. Sabbir scored his 50 off only 62 balls but slowed as Rahim became more confident, smashing his own half-century off 124 balls. Sabbir, 25, dispatched Lyon for a six over long-on and Rahim hit two consecutive fours against Steve OKeefe.
The wicket isnt easy to bat on, but we did try to play till the end of the day, he told reporters.
I am not really sure what is a good score here. We just have to bat as long as possible.
Lyon, the first off-spinner to open the Test bowling for Australia since 1938, finally removed Sabbir in the 82nd over when he was stumped by Mathew Wade. Lyon, who finished with figures of five for 77 off 28 overs, said Australia bowled very well to pick off six Bangladeshi batsmen on a pretty docile wicket.
We got a bit fatigued in the later end of the day and gave too many free hits away, he said, describing Monday as up there with the hardest Test match cricket days Ive ever had.
This would be my 69th Test match and I dont think Ive been tested like that physically.
Lyons scalps included Tamim Iqbal, one of the architects of Bangladeshs historic victory over Australia, who fell for just nine runs on his home ground.
He also sent back Mominul Haque, who boasts the highest batting average of the Bangladesh team. Left-arm spinner Ashton Agar got the other wicket for Australia, as a three-pronged spin attack took the battle to the hosts.
Agar dismissed Shakib Al Hasan, whose all-round heroics earned him man of the match in the first Test, for 24. AFP

Being unpredictable can make you lethal  Kohli
What keeps the present Indian cricket team ahead of other nations is their unpredictability to keep experimenting with players so that the opposition is left thinking all the time.
If you go out to play against India you know that theres going to be one pattern thats going to be followed. So people can prepare. Once we start playing like this (experimenting with a few guys going up and down the order) and get more confident with the roles that were given then we can be more unpredictable, said Indian captain Virat Kohli after his team had completed a 5-0 whitewash of the one-day international series against Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.
With the kind of talent that we have in the side if we can be unpredictable as well then it becomes a lethal combination. Teams will find it difficult to set a pattern against us and well always stay ahead of the game or at least try to, and more often than not well end up executing those things.
But its important to embrace that change and the guys have done it. Some guys will perform and some guys wont - that goes in limited-overs cricket and its not an alarming thing for us, well keep doing these things in the future as well before we reach the World Cup, he said.
When asked the difference between the two sides Kohli replied, We didnt analyse the opposition at any stage in this series, we only wanted to focus on our strengths and make sure we keep repeating those things out in the middle. That way the opposition is not something that you need to focus on. We just wanted to execute the plans we made for ourselves as a team regardless of the opposition.
It didnt matter to us whether we were playing Sri Lanka or were going to play Australia back home. For us it was focusing on our team. We didnt sit and think what the difference between the two sides. If you have an opportunity to win international games youre going to pounce on those opportunities and win, and perform as well. So thats exactly what we did and we never thought at any stage that this is the difference between the two sides or we didnt analyse anything. We were just looking for improvements on our side of things.
Kohli said that Jasprit Bumrah who was named the man of the series has been Indias most effective short-format owler in the last 18 months.
He has really worked on his bowling a lot, especially his length ball has picked up more pace. Thats very heartening to see because it never lets the batsmen get settled. Its not only about yorkers and slower balls any more. He can bowl a good length ball and nick you off as well, which I think is the biggest improvement in his bowling. Credit to him for shaping his game in that way, said Kohli. Getting a man of the series award in the subcontinent as a fast bowler, its always a great thing to achieve. He bowled in really good areas and he deserves to be the man of the series. I hope he can continue the same way against Australia.
India next series after the Sri Lanka tour is at home against Australia where they play a series of 5 ODIs and 3 T20Is.

BRICS countries meet to discuss road to future
CHINA: Five major developing countries opened a summit Monday to map out their future course after host Chinese President Xi Jinping called on them to stand up together against a growing tide of protectionism across the world.
Leaders of the BRICS nations -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- are meeting in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen through Tuesday.
Ahead of the summit, Mr Xi gave a speech to BRICS business leaders on Sunday calling for those nations to work with others around the world to deal with problems arising from globalisation.
BRICS was formed as an association of fast-growing large economies about a decade ago to advocate for better representation for developing countries and challenge the Western-dominated world order that has prevailed since the end of World War II. It soon achieved agreement to increase the share of voting rights for emerging markets in world financial bodies the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. It has also started operating its own development bank.
Xi wants BRICS to play a more important role in international affairs, even as some observers suggest its power is waning given rivalry between China and India and the economic woes of Brazil, Russia and South Africa. BRICS country cooperation is not a talking shop but a task force that gets things done, Mr Xi said in his speech Sunday. Our goal is to build a big market of trade and investment, promote smooth flow of currency and finance, improve connectivity of infrastructure and build close bonds between the peoples.
All broadly support free trade and oppose protectionism, although particularly China, the world's second-largest economy, has been accused of erecting barriers to foreign competition.
Yet clear political and economic differences exist among the countries. They range from democratic to autocratic, with some maintaining heavy government control over the economy and civil society. And the economies of Brazil, Russia and South Africa are driven largely by raw
material exports and have been hit by slumping commodity prices, while China and India are oriented more toward manufacturing and services.
Suggesting disagreements lie ahead in Mr Xiamen, South African President Jacob Zuma said that despite a doubling of his nation's trade with BRICS countries from $15 billion in 2010 to $31.2 billion in 2016, it had been inequitable.
The character of trade has been highly inequitable, he said in remarks to the BRICS Business Council on Sunday.
Exports from South Africa have been driven particularly by raw materials. This dominance of raw material exports has adversely impacted South Africa. He called on the other BRICS nations to invest in supply and development programs in Africa and skills development and technology transfer, and engage in projects that would support inclusive development and equal partnerships.
He also called on the New Development Bank, which was created by BRICS in 2014 and started operating last year, to lend more to Africa. Some observers say admitting other countries to BRICS would answer some of its problems. While no formal progress is expected on that at this summit, China has invited the leaders of Egypt, Guinea, Mexico, Tajikistan and Thailand to attend a dialogue with the BRICS' Presidents and prime ministers on Tuesday.- AFP

CAA South collects over Rs. 1 million in fines
Investigation Officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority of the Southern region have accumulated a revenue of over Rs. one million from errant traders by way of Court fines in mobile raids and inspections throughout the Southern region last month.
According to investigation officials, 95 sudden raids were carried out in the Matara district, 76 raids in the Galle district and 108 raids and mobile inspections in the Hambantota district. The total number of raids carried out in all three districts last month was 297. The total income collected was Rs. 1,031,500.
Errant traders were prosecuted before the Magistrates Courts in Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts.
The fraudulent vendors were indicted on counts of sale and display for sale food items unsuitable for human consumption, sale and display of expired food items, selling rotten food and food eaten by rats, weevils and insects, altering set prices marked on labels and selling them at excessive rates, selling electrical appliances without issuing warranty cards, sale of rice and cement above set prices, non- display of price tags, hoarding essential food items and violating orders, rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority.
According to the CAA, complaints on fraud, malpractice and corruption committed by unscrupulous traders are pouring into the Authority. Under these circumstances, the CAA has enhanced its raids and mobile inspections to nab traders committing fraud and offences throughout the Southern region, investigation officials said. Awareness programmes on consumer rights are also being held for schoolchildren, members of voluntary organizations, people and the trading community by the Authority.
On the instructions of District Secretaries of Galle, Matara and Hambantota, the CAA investigation officers are conducting raids covering the Southern region, they added.

Cabinet approval to upgrade roads in North, East
The Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for the rehabilitation and upgrading of 66 roads in the conflict affected Northern and Eastern Provinces based on a Cabinet Memorandum submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. This was a long-felt need of the Northern and Eastern Provinces which were affected by conflict over a period of 30 years.
Unreliable and inadequate road infrastructure is a major impediment for the economic growth in these two Provinces. To create a conducive environment for private sector investments, it is important to consider the road improvements as a high priority strategic investment. This would promote and expand export of agricultural, fisheries and livestock products etc. and enable the regions to make a bigger contribution to the country's GDP.
Under phase one, it is planned to develop and upgrade approximately 2,500 Km of RDA, RDD, and rural roads at a cost of over US $ 200 million, as part of national integration and reconciliation efforts in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to bring a strong bridge between North and the South to enhance unity, harmony, coexistence and to build sustainable peace among communities and ensure economic growth and poverty reduction said V. Sivagnanasothy, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.
Under this project in the Jaffna District roads such as Valukkaiyaru Punguduththivu - Kurikadduwan Road, Jaffna Manipai- Karainagar Road and Punnalai - Point Pedro Road, Eluthumadduwal  Nagarkovil Road including many Road Development Authority (RDA), (Road Development Department) RDD and rural roads, Nainathivu and Kurikadduwan Jetties are to be rehabilitated.
In the Kilinochchi District roads such as Murikandi Kanagapuram Paranthan Road and in the Mullaitivu District the bridge across Kokkilai lagoon, Vadduvaikal bridge, and Vattapalai main road and in the Mannar District, Mahilankulam Pallamadhu Road, Peramanalankulam Road, and Periyapandivirichan Road  Mullikulam Road and in the Batticaloa Kiran bridge, Santhiveli Thikiliveddai bridge and Marine Drive Batticaloa  Kalkuda Road will be rehabilitated and upgraded.
Further, Trincomalee and Ampara Districts has also been included and many rural and RDD roads in the Northern and Eastern Districts are to be covered under this initiative.
The project is to be executed by the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation with other relevant line Ministries and agencies including the Road Development Authority (RDA). The project was formulated under the guidance of the Prime Ministers Northern and Eastern Provinces Development Committee and recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and got the endorsement of the Cabinet of Ministers.
The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation directly comes under the purview of President Maithripala Sirisena and these road interventions will be executed under the Presidents guidance. Action is being taken to call for tenders with financing arrangements on soft terms said Sivagnanasothy, Secretary, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.

Kandyan dancing and cheerleading

The Sri Lankan cricket encounter with India in the Micromax cup has left the hard-core cricket fans of Sri Lanka devastated. But in the fringes of the stadium is something that devastates the true lovers of Kandyan dancing as well. The Kandyan dancers in the fringe of the stadium, dancing whenever a boundary or a six is scored or a wicket falls is hard to miss. But whether Kandyan dancing should be used for cheerleading is a question.
True that cheerleading promotes ones team and help boost the team spirit and is frequently seen at sports events around the world. The cheerleaders use varying forms of dancing and acrobatics in their performance. Kandyan dancing on the other hand is more than just a dance. It is an art which is most honoured and respected by the Sri Lankans and is a major part of cultural identity, with an origin associated with religious festivals. It is very structured and the learning is done with utmost respect for the art and high discipline is maintained.
The Kandyan dancer graduate in the art through ves mangalya or kalaveny mangalya (according to their gender), only after which they can wear the headgear. And they are also governed by written and unwritten rules and customs closely associated with culture and religion. For such artists to be seen in sport events as mere dancers, in my opinion, is degrading to the art itself.
A dance still performed at highest religious festivals to be also performed at every cricket stadium takes away its dignity and value. It shouldnt be misunderstood that I am hereby condemning the practise of cheerleading. It can, by all accounts, be practised here in Sri Lanka, only that, they should either use the western dancing styles which are commonly used by cheerleaders, or if they want to be original, they can perhaps create dances incorporating Sri Lankan dancing traditions, but it should be done in such a way that they preserve the dignity and value of traditional dancing. I genuinely hope that authorities take steps against this new addition to Sri Lankan cricket experience.

Cricket set to miss  Commonwealth Games 2022
Plans to include cricket in the Commonwealth Games of 2022 have been abandoned.
While womens cricket was originally set to be included when the Games were awarded to Durban, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is determined to achieve gender parity and is reluctant to include disciplines which will not be contested by men and women.
Now, with Durban having surrendered its right to host the Games and the ICC still deliberating whether they want mens cricket to be included, it appears the sport has run out of time.
The 2022 version of the Commonwealth Games is scheduled for July and August, meaning it would clash with the CPL, the new-team domestic T20 competition in England and an international tour of England by India. As a result, several Full Member nations within the ICC were far from convinced of the virtues of involvement in the Commonwealth Games. Combined with that, it seems any bid to include cricket might have been seen as non-compliant as it would have taken the number of athletes involved in the Games above the threshold allowed by the CGF. Cricket is no longer scheduled to be part of the Games, Warwickshire chief executive, Neil Snowball, confirmed. Weve just run out of time, really.
The Commonwealth Games Federation want gender equality and discussion within the ICC about whether members want to send mens teams is unresolved.
Combined with issues over the number of athletes, I dont see any way cricket can be included in 2022.
The news suggests crickets involvement in the Olympics is still some way distant; involvement in the Commonwealth Games had been seen as a step in that direction. Cricket is not currently one of the mandatory events incorporated into the Commonwealth Games. But it is on the list of optional sports that host cities can add to their staging of the event, along with the support of the relevant sports governing body.
England did not send a team on the only previous time cricket was included in the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia in 1998. On that occasion South Africa defeated Australia in the final.
A decision on where the 2022 Games will be staged is expected to be announced shortly.

Elephants on 'hostile territory' in Sri Lanka

Udawalawe National Park, Sri Lanka-It is difficult to predict when the elephants will come.
As darkness falls aroundSri Lanka's Udawalawe National Park, the 52 villages that speckle its borders go on alert. Thin wire fences hum with the threat of electricity.
Across the dry zone, farmers climb up into rudimentary treehouses overlooking their paddy fields. They must try to stay alert as the darkness deepens. Armed only with torches, fireworks, and their voices - loud and hoarse - they may be forced to face down giants.
Ashoka Ranjeewa, an elephant researcher, has spent many nights out here. When he first arrived in Pokunuthanna, there were few friendly faces. Bordered on two sides by the national park, and on one side by the Dahaiyagala sanctuary, this village of some 100 families has seen more than its fair share of elephant attacks. Farmers here allege the compensation they are paid is meagre and comes late. Outsiders only come to gawk, taking pictures, commiserating.
None of this stops the elephants from coming.
The foragers are most often male elephants - bulls - on average weighing in at 5,000-6,000 kilogrammes, and reaching over three metres tall, these are among the largest land animals alive.
The villagers of Pokunuthanna used to believe just four to five bulls took turns invading their land. But when Ranjeewa installed some infrared night vision cameras, he raised the count to 35.
A single animal may still be scared off, but a bull group of three or more is simply terrifying. It can be suicide to stand in their way. The marauders can devastate a family's fortunes in one night: a full season's harvest torn up by the roots; a house holding a family's entire store of paddy raided, its clay walls knocked over and its roof trampled.
"People invest most of their money to buy seeds and agricultural chemicals," PP Ariyaratna, a local farmer, tells Al Jazeera. He explains big crop losses can send them into debt or force them into tenuous jobs as wage labourers.
Just last week, elephants visited Ariyaratna's paddy fields multiple times. In one case, circles of devastation mark the spot where they feasted. In another, an elephant reached sneakily under a live fence to pull paddy out by the roots.
Ariyaratna knows what they are capable of - he has woken to find a long trunk testing the integrity of the walls that shelter his family.
The farmer lives encircled by a ring of electricity but says the animals are adapting. "They are clever and smart," he says, explaining that he now tries to clear the land around his fences so there is no stick or branch lying around. Elephants have learned how to use these tools to break the wires.
Ariyaratna has a long list of other techniques that used to work, but aren't reliable any more. Ambulance lights that flash red and blue, recorded sounds of other animals, firecrackers, torches: elephants would be frightened initially, but all too soon returned to raiding.
They even seem to recognise when a fence is live - perhaps sensing a slight heat or an electric charge - and they know when a power cut has rendered the wires ineffectual. When a fence is torn down it might take days to repair, and the farms are defenceless all the while.
Like everyone else in this village, Ariyaratna knows someone who was killed: most often it is a man, who, walking down these dirt roads one night, came face to face with an elephant in the dark.
In 2016, elephants killed 88 people in Sri Lanka, according to Department of Wildlife Conservation statistics.
Vijitha Perera runs the Elephant Transit Home located inside theUdawalawe National Park. He knows what happens along the borders of the park.
"It is complicated because people and elephants are trying to share the same resources," he says. "In the elephant scenario, there is no idea of private property. People think the land is theirs, the water and crops are theirs. But elephants don't think like that."
Currently, a drought has left all the smaller watering holes depleted. The animals come out of the park, desperate for food.
"Their habitat is completed changed," says Ranjeewa, who also studies the animals inside the park. "Their scrub lands have been covered with invasive species like lantana." The farmers' paddy, on the other hand, is a rich source of nutrition.
As they roam outside the boundaries at night, Ranjeewa says he can see the stress on the elephant's faces. They know they are in hostile territory and make as little noise as possible.
His research has given Ranjeewa a deep admiration for these animals. "They are so intelligent. They take risks and they are bold. They have been deprived of their lands, surrounded by electric fences, and shot at. Still, they do not give up."
Ranjeewa grew up near Udawalawe and has seen the human elephant conflict escalate over the years. He knows of the violence against the elephants: they are poisoned, electrocuted and wounded by bullets. Planks studded with nails are left on jungle paths. Haka patta, small explosives, are camouflaged in food.
Elephant calves are most likely to bite into such a temptation. When the bomb goes off, it has just enough force to shatter the jawbone. No longer able to eat, death comes at the end of a long nightmare of infection and starvation.
In 2016, people killed 279 elephants in Sri Lanka, the Department of Wildlife Conservation statistics show.
Perera welcomes baby elephants at the Elephant Transit Home.The calves are usually very close to collapse - always orphans, separated from their mother either by death or chaos. The calves are too young to know how to avoid the dangers of a deep well or irrigation canal. People bring noise and terror, and they hide.
"When we find the babies, they are usually weak. They've undergone severe stress, dehydration and starvation," says Perera. "Some have infectious wounds and serious parasitic infections. Most are close to death."
Perera welcomes these orphans to the Elephant Transit Home, the only one of its kind in Sri Lanka. Here, the animals receive tender care. As they grow into adults, human contact is kept to a minimum.
"They are introduced into a herd,"says Perera. The babies are fed nutritious milk, but otherwise the herd is left to its own devices. Each animal is welcomed into a complex social structure and they learn from each other.
"They find their own food and water, and when they turn five years old we release them back into the wild."
In their time at the centre, the young calves form deep attachments. "It is like a classroom, and they all have their friends. They form a social network and show no aggression toward each other."
The researchers identify these little units of camaraderie and release them together so they can forge a new life in the wild. They track them carefully to ensure their survival.
"Our first birth in the wild was in 2008," says Perera, adding that they have released 110 animals in total and seen 17 births in the wild.
Prithiviraj Fernando scrambles down a slope into a field cultivated by a farmer's society in Orukemgala, Mattara. The chairman of the Centre for Conservation and Research, Fernando has helped set up a solar-powered electric fence here.
Unlike the so-called administrative fences that surround parks and are the property of the departments of Wildlife Conservation and Forests, this is a privately constructed ecological fence that protects just this patch of about three hectares of farmland. This distinction is key, says Fernando.
"Sri Lanka has more than 3,500km of fencing put up by the Wildlife Department and a lot of it is not working. The main problem is that it is in the wrong place."
In comparison, the location of this ecological fence has been carefully chosen with easy maintenance in mind. The farmers watching over it say it is the one thing that has allowed them to cultivate on this land for the last three years.
The solar panel powers not just the fence, but ensures that the posts are also charged, so they can't be uprooted or kicked over. In a programme run in collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Conservation, 10 such fences are being trialled across villages and farms in the south. They seem to be working. "A successful solution had to be simple," says Fernando.
Fernando has spent years immersed in the human-elephant conflict. By putting radio collars around elephants and tracking them, Fernando and other researchers were able toestablishthat the vast majority of elephants in Sri Lanka actually roamed outside the areas protected by the Wildlife Department.
This is crucial considering Sri Lanka's preference for translocation as a solution to conflict. Translocation is the method adopted when large development or irrigation projects are scheduled or land is being claimed for farming. Elephant drives are organised to chase the animals out of the area.
"You have hundreds of people going into the forest and creating a huge din, lighting thousands of crackers," says Fernando. "Sometimes, this goes on for days, sometimes for months, something for over a year."
What the researchers found was that try as people might, they never succeeded in driving away all the elephants. Moreover, those who were forcibly translocated to national parks, do not stay in the parks - instead they try to return or wander elsewhere, raiding new farms.
They tend to become more aggressive and human deaths that resulted were usually an accident. Fernando believes that "80 percent of deaths can be avoided," saying that it is clear translocation moves not just the elephant, but the problem as well.
Looking at this fence in Hambantota, Fernando doesn't think the solution lies in either moving people or elephants. Instead, it is in finding ways for them to co-exist right where they are.
Back in Pokunuthanna, Ranjeewa has been making efforts to help people understand why the animals behave as they do through discussions at the Dahaiyagala temple, house-to-house visits and the formation of a Young Conservationists Society. Ranjeewa has pushed local authorities to install street lights to help prevent people running into the animals at night.
In fact, his friend Ajith Sandanayake has decided to see how the village can profit from the nightly incursions - he has guests from all over come to spend the night at his ecolodge. There is even a treehouse. On those days, he actually hopes the elephants will come to visit.
"We have to convert the farmer's attitudes," says Sandanayake, "They have to start seeing the elephant not as a pest, but as a resource."
He describes how the whole village turns out to marvel when a particularly large herd gathers at a lake just across them, within the borders of the national park. "We all go to look at them. The truth is people do not hate the elephants. Like us, we know they also need to eat."

Enshrouded in mysticism
Having rejected the idea of a god and taking up Buddhism and the practice of Buddhism, a few years later as a monk in Thailand when I asked some senior monks or some teachers about this thing called Nibbana, what is it, they said, well, just believe in it. It is very hard to know, you cant really explain it. Straight away I saw that there was a correspondence there, a similarity, a disturbing similarity with the way that God was described to me as a young man. There I was having abandoned one sort of theory or unattainable mystery and then put my life on the line for another mystery
It is an interesting subject, and one that I havent dealt with before, and it will give an insight into the way of Buddhism and how we deal with mysticism, what mysticism is, its dangers and also its benefits. It gives a nice framework for a talk on an aspect of Buddhism which is not so often talked about and also puts it into place with all the other religious experiences which one may come across throughout this world, the good ones and the bad ones.
One of the reasons for giving a talk on mysticism this evening is that I have only just returned from Sydney this afternoon. I was giving a retreat at a retreat centre outside Sydney and one of the talks I gave was a clear explanation of this thing we call Nibbana or Enlightenment and the question time which followed afterwards, one of the questions I received was from a person who preferred Nibbana to remain a little mysterious rather than something as clearly described as I gave. It brought me to a little discussion at question time about the nature of such things as Nibbana, Buddhist Enlightenment, this idea of a god and all these other little things which sometimes people can lump together as mystical experiences, is it just out of faith or what are these things anyway.
I started my answer to the question when I recalled the time when I was still a student investigating the different religions and paths of practice in this world and came to point where I rejected the idea of a god simply because whenever I asked anyone, whether it was a priest or a teacher of religion or anyone who was supposed to know, they could never give me a straight answer on what god was supposed to be or supposed to mean. They always say things like, it is beyond your knowledge; something which cannot be expressed, and to me that was never satisfactory. To me something which didnt exist would also be something you cant express or you cant know. It seemed to be an excuse for believing in something which couldnt exist. I always thought that if something does exist, if its something real then there must be some way for you to know about it.
Practice of meditation
However, having rejected the idea of a god and taking up Buddhism and the practice of Buddhism, a few years later as a monk in Thailand when I asked some senior monks or some teachers about this thing called Nibbana, what is it, they said, well, just believe in it. It is very hard to know, you cant really explain it. Straight away I saw that there was a correspondence there, a similarity, a disturbing similarity with the way that God was described to me as a young man. There I was having abandoned one sort of theory or unattainable mystery and then put my life on the line for another mystery. Really, I wasnt very satisfied with that, but thankfully there was a path of practice which kept me going as a monk. There was a path of practice of meditation which at least made me happy which gave some joy into my mind and into my life, and that was enough to keep me going until I got some deeper understanding of these things.
One of the important things which you do understand in this practice of Buddhism is that there is no mystery that you cannot see for yourselves through direct experience. The point of this practice of Buddhism from the beginnings of just being generous, being virtuous, being kind, meditating, becoming deeply peaceful in the mind, becoming wise, all these parts of the gradual training which we call the practice of Buddhism actually do lead to the wisdom, the direct experience, the insight which sees all of these things which can be seen, which knows all that can be known, and all of these things which the Buddha talked about, whether it is past lives, whether it is devas, divine beings, if you wish to call them that, and enlightenment itself. All of these things are something which can be known and experienced for yourself, clearly experienced, and not something which just has to be believed in or talked about in a very mysterious way. It is nice to be able to hear someone talk clearly about these things because very often a person talks in mysterious words when they are trying to cover up a lack of knowledge about the subject.
If they say that Nibbana, Enlightenment is like ineffable, indescribable, just beyond words, very often it means that they have no idea what it means anyway, so it is like an excuse to cover up some ignorance or lack of experience but the great monks which I eventually got to know could describe and explain. Obviously one had to have some experience of the mind of deep meditation before one could appreciate the words which the great teachers were using, but certainly all these things were explainable, were describable. And these experiences which the Buddha talked about, once they were experienced by these great monks, the whole of these teachings, the deep teachings the part of religion which the world calls mysterious or mystical, is all made very clear and very understandable and very reachable. That of course was immensely satisfying. One didnt just have to believe as an act of faith or an act of trust, but one could see and hear and experience all these things.
Western culture
So lets go back to the beginning of mysticism, and all the different experiences, which come under that heading of mysticism which you may have heard about, read about, or sometimes even experienced. You will find that in our western culture, mysticism always depends upon people not living as it were in the world and thinking about things, but the mystics were the people who removed themselves from the world for a time or for their whole life.
In Christianity, these were people who lived in mountains, in deserts usually; in Buddhism, in forests. But in any culture, people who wander alone live in solitary places. Of course what they would be developing in those places is a meditation of like letting go. This is why it is so important to understand these things, to develop some degree of deep meditation. Because all of that which is called mystical in our culture, is developed from a very peaceful and still mind. And it is there that one can start to understand where mysticism arises from, the experiences which are called mystical, and how they all fit together, as it were in the scheme of things. What happens for a person who is meditating, is that your goal is to let go of so much of the external world, which is so coarse and gross compared to the world of the mind.
I sometimes describe the world of the mind to the world outside like coarse signals on a radio frequency which block out the very fine and subtle signals. Therefore, if one wishes to see that which is subtle and refined, you have to filter out the coarse, the gross, and you do find this is the way of meditation. When you let go of the coarser things of the world, the busyness of life, then you are able to see that which is far more refined. Even on a small level, if you can just stop for a while thinking of all you have to do and the places you have to go and you can pause, then you can be able to appreciate the beauty of the tree in the park on the corner. You have time in your mind to look up at the stars, and just see the heavens. But so often it is the case that people are running around too fast, they are so engrossed with the coarse, that they never see that which is refined and very beautiful.

Establishment of the Bhikkhuni Order: Mothering a sage
The Buddha always stressed the fact the woman can always achieve Nibbana being a laity. Women entering the monk establishment will lead to more complications. If the monk order has the life span of 10,000 years, the Buddha went on to say, it will go down to 5000 years when women join it. He likened the Bhikkhuni participation as a house full of women being vulnerable for smugglers. It will disturb the peace of the monk's mind and make the path for misuse, mostly
The Buddhas initial rejection for a Bhikkhuni Sasana is scoffed at by feminists from some quarters. They question if the woman cannot achieve the Nibbana. This shows their lack of common sense as well as ignorance of teachings. The Buddha was only reluctant to install the Bhikkhuni order, but he preached to women such as his mothers and wife: Maya, Prajapati, and Yasodhara.
Prajapati had the support of 500 wives of princes. They all shaved their heads, wore yellow robes, and met monk Ananda. Only following monk Anandas continuous request did the Buddha accept the Bhikkhuni Sasana on a Binara Poya. Prajapati became the first nun in the Buddhist order, but on eight conditions:
1. The monk shall be given priority in respect and deference over the nun.
2. The nun shall spend rain retreat away from the monks.
3. The nun shall seek consent from monks about Uposatha and teaching of Dhamma.
4. Upon violating a rule, the nun shall be punished before the community of both nuns and monks.
5. The nun shall confess any wrongdoing before the community of nuns and monks.
6. The nun shall be ordained before a gathering of nuns and monks.
7. The nun shall not treat a monk badly.
8. The nun shall not teach a monk.
Maha Prajapati Gothami  the name goes on to mean that she would have a large retinue - played an instrumental role in the Buddhas lay life, by bringing him up following Queen Mayas death. She was Mayas younger sister. Dandapani and Suppabuddha were her brothers. She had Nanda and Sundari Nanda from King Suddhodana, hence they became the Buddhas step siblings.
Bhikkhuni participation
The Buddha always stressed the fact the woman can always achieve Nibbana being a laity. Women entering the monk establishment will lead to more complications. If the monk order has the life span of 10,000 years, the Buddha went on to say, it will go down to 5000 years when women join it. He likened the Bhikkhuni participation as a house full of women being vulnerable for smugglers. It will disturb the peace of the monk's mind and make the path for misuse, mostly.
Suddhodanas death left no reason for Prajapati to remain laity since she was already a Sotapanna. She was looking out for a chance to approach the Buddha on initiating the nun order.
The Blessed One visited Kapilavatthu to settle the row between Sakyans and Kolyans on obtaining water from River Rohini.
The Buddha preached the Kalahavivada Sutta, and 500 princes became monks leaving their wives alone. Gothami had the support of these wives.
The validity of Gothamis ordination became an issue because some nuns did not like to become nuns under her. The Buddha interfered and declared the validity of Gothamis Bhikkhuni status.
Gothami once made an elegant looking robe for the Buddha with a distinctive material. The Buddha refused to accept it alone and suggested it should be given to the whole order. Gothami was feeling down, but then she realised it was to her own benefit  to accrue more merits.
No more re-becoming
Andrew Olendzki translates a stanza from Theri Gatha which is uttered by Prajapati Gotami. The stanza is reproduced along with the translators introduction.
The woman who is said to have composed this poem was Prajapati, the Buddha's stepmother and a Queen of the Sakyas. Her younger sister was Maya, married to King Suddhodana only after Prajapati herself was unable to conceive an heir. Queen Maya died in childbirth, and it was Prajapati who raised Gotama as her own son. After his enlightenment, Prajapati also left the palace and became the first of the Bhikkhunis, the order of nuns.
The third stanza suggests that her attainments included the recollection of past lives, by which she was able to verify empirically the truth of continual rebirth the flowing on (samsara) from one life to another. This process, as she mentions in her poem, is fueled by craving and by not understanding. In the second and fourth stanzas, Prajapati declares her attainment of Nibbana, of final and complete liberation in this very life.
It is remarkable to think that when Maya is remembered in the last stanza, the author has in mind not the icon of motherhood and sacrifice that Maya became in the Buddhist tradition, but a dearly-loved younger sister who died tragically young without ever seeing what her son had become.
Buddha! Hero! Praise be to you!
You foremost among all beings!
You who have released me from pain,
And so many other beings too.
All suffering has been understood.
The source of craving has withered.
Cessation has been touched by me
On the noble eightfold path.
I've been mother and son before;
And father, brother  grandmother too.
Not understanding what was real,
I flowed-on without finding [peace].
But now I've seen the Blessed One!
This is my last compounded form.
The on-flowing of birth has expired.
There's no more re-becoming now.
The Buddha proved his gratitude by attending to Gothami when she was ill. He preached to her consolation. When it comes to discipline, however, the Buddha seems to have been stricter for the Bhikkhuni by making 311 rules for Bhikkhunis, whereas 227 for Bhikkhus.

Fighting for your rights
Information is precious. As journalists, its our work to chase it, and publish it.
In my last column, I wrote about our newspapers initial requests under the Right to Information Act, and how the different public agencies responded to us. As a quick scorecard: the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is great, and really knows how the law is supposed to work.
The office of the Registrar or the Supreme Court, however, repeatedly hung up on me, and has not responded to our written request within the 14-day window.
But, thats for another time.
This week, well look at how people are using the Right to Information Act in their own lives, to hold government agencies accountable in a way that was never possible before.
No land, no money
Heres the story of a man from Gampaha, who is a client of Transparency International Sri Lankas legal aid clinic. They asked that I withhold his name, as his case is currently before the Right to Information Commission, the legal body which rules on disputed RTI requests.
According to his application, this man owned a piece of land in Gampaha, which was seized by the government to build the Colombo-Katunayake highway. But he says he was never paid for it. When he went to get an answer on why he never received compensation, he says details about his title to the land had been changed in the registry.
For the past seven years, hes been trying to figure out why. He says hes submitted multiple letters to the District Office in Gampaha, and has never received an answer.
After the Right to Information Act went into effect in February, he crafted an RTI request with Transparency International and submitted it to the District Office. Finally, he received an acknowledgement that his questions were received, and that they were going to the RTI Commission for assistance.
The RTI Commission, which acts like a court of appeal, has been influential in making the Act actually work on the ground. The Commission has already ruled on over 50 major appeals, and reviewing records of the proceedings shows that the commissioners often side with the release of information when government officers want it withheld.
Privacy versus public interest
Take the case of E. A. N. D. Edirisinghe, a Principal at the Technical College of Matale. Edirisinghe requested information from the Director-General of the Department of Technical Education and Training about the qualifications for promotion.
According to Commission records, Edirisinghe was a Grade II officer, trying to be promoted to a Grade I. He wanted to see letters outlining the qualifications for the position he and 18 others applied for.
But when he asked for the documents in an RTI request, the information officer denied it, saying it was an unwarranted invasion of privacy under Section 5 of the Act.
Edirisinghe appealed that decision within the department, and did not hear back for over a month, much longer than the 14-day timeline required by law.
When he appealed to the RTI Commission, Department officers said they were not sure about their authority to release the letters, because they contained information about third parties.
The commission, in June, ruled in favour of Edirisinghe. The Act states that where a public authority is in possession of the information requested they are bound to provide such information, Commissioners wrote in their decision.
They said the information should be released and the private information about third parties redacted.
But cases before the Commission are not always so clean.
Right to Education
M. G. Lalith Ananda submitted an RTI request to the Ministry of Education, looking for information about school admissions. He believes, court documents show, that the sons and daughters of powerful people are being let into National Schools contrary to the government circulars which dictate school placement.
So he submitted a request asking for the things like the names and professions of doctors, judges, university lecturers, and government servants whose children were admitted to national schools because school officials made exceptions.
But it appears he ran into trouble pretty quickly. He never heard back from the Ministry of Education. At a hearing before the RTI Commission, the ministrys information officers said they had responded to Ananda, but the letter was sent back to them in the mail without ever reaching him.
They argued that they could not give Ananda the information he wanted, because it didnt exist. According to the ministry, no students had been admitted to national schools contrary to the law.
Curiously, though, the ministry representatives added on that the Secretary to the Ministry had discretion in that regard.
The whole proceeding seems to have put the RTI Commission in a tough spot. On the one hand, Ananda continued to say that he believed students had been admitted to schools against government circulars, despite what the ministry said.
But on the other, there was no evidence before them that Ananda was right.
The Appellant states that it is his firm belief that admissions had taken place contrary to the said circulars, the Commissioners wrote in their ruling. But it appears that this is only his belief.
But they left words of warning with the representatives from the ministry. In terms of the discretion the Secretary of the Ministry of Education may be able to show in admissions, it is a principle of settled law that unfettered discretion cannot be exercised by a public functionary, they said.
They also said that if any facts had been misrepresented in front of the Commission, ministry representatives could be sanctioned.
They said they couldnt proceed any further with the current appeal.
In the hearing records, Ananda indicated he would file a new, more specific RTI request with the ministry, focusing only on girls schools in the Colombo area.
I tried to make contact with Ananda multiple times by phone and email to discuss his request, and to talk about why he believes some children are getting preferential placements, but I was unable to reach him by press time.
RTI Commissioners say citizens are filing requests at a steady clip, and that their caseload grows by the day.
If youre reading, and you have questions for your local Road Development Authority office, or the Election Commission, or any other government agency: file a request.
There are submission forms available in Sinhala, Tamil, and English at www.rti.gov, and non-profit organisations like Transparency International can provide legal advice from its offices in Colombo, Matara and Vavuniya.
Access to information is your right: so why not use it

Garbage dumps surround Akkaraipattu Arasayadi junction
Residents of the Akkaraipattu Arasayadi area complain that the garbage dumped in the area has caused a serious health hazard.
The garbage dumped at Arasayady junction in the Alayadivembu MOH area along the Akkaraipattu  Ampara main road permeates an unbearable foul smell, they said.
Environmental pollution due to garbage dumped recklessly has a direct link with a large number of dengue patients in the area in recent past, they said.
The Alayadivembu MOH Dr. A. M. Ismail instructed the people to draw special attention to the cleanliness of the environment aiming to curtail the spread of dengue.
Residents who have mosquito breeding locations were identified and were warned to clean their premises. Garbage dumped without clearing for a long time is another cause of the spread of dengue, he added.
The Alayadivembu MOH is also taking action to combat the disease. The bare lands are also cleaned to prevent the disease.
Residents were warned that legal action will be taken against offenders.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) rejects and opposes the composition of the committee appointed by the President to resolve the SAITM issue, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said all the members of the committee are pro SAITM and therefore a justifiable solution cannot be expected from the committee. According to Dr. Ananda, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the State Medical Faculty deans have not been given the representation in the committee and therefore a final solution cannot be obtained through the committee.
No solution can be given from the proposals submitted by the Sate Medical Faculty deans. Whatever solution given by the committee will be a politically influenced solution, Dr. Ananda said.

Govts economic vision
The governments vision is to make Sri Lanka a rich country by 2025. The government will do so by transforming Sri Lanka into the hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge based. Highly competitive, social market economy. The government will create an environment where all citizens have the opportunity to achieve higher incomes and better standards of living. To achieve this the Government will create the conditions which will generate economic growth with equity.
The structural transformation necessary to achieve this vision is currently under way. The Empowered Sri Lanka document laid the foundation for this transformation by identifying the priorities of raising incomes, ensuring employment and housing for all, and improving the quality of life for all citizens.
The Government will position Sri Lanka as an export oriented economic hub at the centre of the Indian Ocean.
The government recognises the fundamental reality that Sri Lanka has a domestic market of only 20 million consumers with a modest per capita income, and must rely on external demand for sustained, high, and long term growth.
The Government will strategically position Sri Lanka as the hub of the Indian Ocean, securing opportunities for local businesses in Global Production Networks (GPNs).
This outward looking approach will increase the efficiency of the domestic economy, contributing to a better life for all Sri Lankans.
The Government will stamp out corruption by encouraging competition and enabling transparency to give all Sri Lankans an equal chance at prosperity.

Harvest of Buddhist books
Renowned scholar Chamika Munasinghe recently published a host of Buddhist books: Sathiya, Bhavana saha Nivan Maga (by Tilaka Kudahetti) and Prayogika Budu Dahama (by Venerable Dodampahala Sri Rahula Thera) primary among them. The other books include Karmaya Pala Dena Heti (by Venerable Pathegama Gnanissara Thera), Karmaya Saha Dharmaya (by Venerable Dodampahala Sri Rahula Thera), Prayogika Budu Dahama (by Asanka Atigala) and Devatha Namaskaraya (by Dr Indika Gamhewa).
In these books, the publisher presents essays, study guides and practical advice on the practice of Buddhist Dhamma, commonly known as Vinaya in Buddhist parlance, by both the lay Buddhists, new initiates and experienced bhikkhus. Buddhism is essentially a religion of the mind. Mindfulness and meditation are the most talked about subject in the practice of Buddhism on the eightfold path for the final deliverance from the bondage of birth and death. Most of the articles in this section are written by venerable Buddhist monks out of love and compassion for the humanity. Even if we do not practice this religion, some of the essays in this section can be immensely beneficial for achieving inner peace and equanimity of the mind by practicing mindfulness.
The quality of our lives is conditioned by the quality of our actions. Buddhism teaches us to have a firm conviction in human potential. It says that we are creatures that possess the wonderful ability to take responsibility for what we think, do, and say, and to make our lives expressions of wisdom and compassion, rather than selfishness, fear, and greed.

Lawsuit claiming SLFP Chairmanship fixed for order
The Colombo District Court yesterday set September 29 to deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections raised against a lawsuit that sought an order to re-instate the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
The SLFP General Secretary through his counsel yesterday filed written submissions in Courts citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the case.
The lawsuit had been filed by two Plaintiffs K.D. Aruna Priyasantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath citing the SLFP General Secretary and the Election Commission Chairman as defendants.
In his written submissions, the SLFP General Secretary stated that plaintiffs are indirectly challenging the acts of the current President of the republic done in his capacity as chairman of the SLFP.
It is common ground that the chairman of SLFP is the President of the Republic. In terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution, the President of the Republic has immunity from suit except in an action filed in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution, SLFP General Secretary added.
The second defendant Anura Priyadarshana has resigned from his position as the General Secretary of SLFP and cannot be named as party defendant in this action. The caption of the action identified third defendant as Sunanda Deshapriya, the Election Commissioner. There is no person who can be reasonably identified as such and in fact no such person used to act as the Commissioner of Election, SLFP General Secretary further added.
The SLFP General Secretary maintained that the plaintiffs are seeking to circumvent the provisions of immunity from suit accorded to the President of the Republic and as such the plaintiffs action is liable to be dismissed in limine.
The plaintiffs alleged that the former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had sent a letter to the EC on or around January 16, 2015 over the appointment of a new Chairman to the SLFP.
The plaintiffs further alleged that the Executive Committee of the Party without holding a proper committee meeting, had taken the decision to make new appointments to the SLFP leadership.
Counsel Lanka Dharmasiri appeared for SLFP General Secretary.

## Title: Leading a life of simplicity

Leading a life of simplicity
For all of us, its time to convert to simplicity in lives; at least if we want some peace of mind and joy in our lives! Many people say they want to live a simple life, but based upon statistics about stress levels, not that many are actually following through with their expectations.
For most of us, life is getting busier. Especially for those who have children to take care of. I see parents scurry here and there to work, school activities, the dentist, grocery store, vocal lessons, etc. Its never-ending.
Living more simply is not a new idea. Its actually been around for thousands of years. Our ancestors lived simple lives, accumulating just what they needed and giving the rest away.
It has been over time that the endless pursuit of things has edged out simplicity and peace in our society. The concept of open economy started off sounding great, but keeping up with the Joneses has cost many men and women their peace and joy; the drive to push and push, to get more and more, and be the best. And, that has depleted numerous people leaving them empty, cold, and very fatigued. Many Buddhist teachings will help you to find out how to create that balance in life.
Dighajanu
A townsman named Dighajanu once approached Buddha and asked him the following: We are lay people enjoying sensuality; living crowded with spouses & children. May the Blessed One teach us what contributes to our happiness and betterment in our present lives here, and hereafter."
The Buddha in reply said: "Dighajanu, there are four factors that contribute to the happiness of a person in this world". What are the four
(1). Utthana - sampada (2). Arakkha - sampada (3). Kalyana-mittata (4).'Samajivikata.
You should be skilled, efficient and energetic in whatever your profession and you should know it well. You should make maximum effort in your profession and work on it with sustained courage. This is 'Utthana-sampada'.
You should protect your income, which you have righteously earned on your own sincere effort. This does not mean living miserably. You should be generous and free at the same time. This is 'Arakkha-sampada'
You should have good friends who will help us along the right path away from evil. The friends should be faithful, learned and virtuous. Associating good friends has been given much importance in Buddha Dhamma. This is Kalyana-mittata .
You should spend reasonably in proportion to your earnings, neither too little, nor too much. In other words, you should not hoard riches nor should you be spending recklessly. You should keep to a balanced life, within your means. This is Samajivikata'.
The above advice relates to Happiness in this life. In the same sutta, the Buddha identifies four traits conducive to happiness in future lives.
Those are (1) saddha  faith in the fully enlightened Buddha; (2) sila - virtue as exemplified by the five precepts; (3) caga - generosity giving charity and alms; (4) panna - wisdom having insight into the arising and passing of things
Anatha pindika
Once, the householder Anatha pindika went up to the Buddha, saluted him, and sat down at one side. As he was sitting thus at one side, the Buddha One spoke:
Householder, there are these four kinds of joy to be won from time to time, as the occasion arises, by a lay person who enjoys sense-pleasures. What are the four (1) The joy of ownership (atthi sukha); (2) The joy of enjoying his wealth (bhoga sukha); (3) The joy of being a debtless person (anana sukha); (4) The joy of blamelessness (anavajja sukha).
And what, householder, is the joy of ownership Here, householder, when one has wealth gained by hard work and obtained in a lawful way, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This is the joy of ownership.
And what, householder, is the joy of enjoying his wealth Here, householder, when one has wealth thus gained, both enjoys his wealth and does meritorious deeds, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This, householder, is the joy of enjoyment. And what, householder, is the joy of being a debtless person Here, householder, when one owes no debt, great or small, to anyone, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This, householder, is the joy of being a debtless person. And what, householder, is the joy of blamelessness Here, householder, when one is endowed with blameless actions of body, blameless actions of speech, blameless actions of mind, he attains pleasure, he attains happiness. This, householder, is the joy of blamelessness.
Hindrances
The Patta Kamma Sutta is a remarkable little discourse on the ideal lay practitioner, heading for accomplishment or excellence both on the worldly and spiritual levels. It closely parallels the Digha Janu Sutta. Both these suttas deal with the fourfold noble growth of faith, moral virtue, charity and wisdom.
The importance of overcoming the five hindrances in lay life is pointed out in the Patta Kamma Sutta. (1) rampant greed (visama lobha), (2) ill will (vyapada), (3) sloth and torpor (thina middha), (4) restlessness and remorse (uddhacca kukkucca), and (5) doubt (vicikiccha). In the Patta kamma Sutta the manner in which a person should spend his wealth is also given in detail as follows: (1). Expenditure on food and clothing and other needs, (2). Maintenance of parents, wife and children and servants, (3). For illness and other emergencies. (4). For charitable purposes. (5). For the performance of the following: (i) treating one's relatives; (ii) treating one's visitors; (iii) offering alms in memory of the departed; (iv) offering merit to the deities; (v) payment of state taxes and dues in time.
Buddhism teaches us to consume wealth moderately otherwise it would lead to an excessive indulgence on sensual pleasures. Buddhism prescribes righteous and systematic methods of earning wealth which are devoid of extremist path and prejudices
Kula sutta
Buddhist teachings on the progression of wealth can be clearly understood through the Kula Sutta. It is a short teaching dealing with basic home management. The wisdom taught is simple and practical:
(1) Look for what is lost; (2) Repair what needs repairing; (3) Eat and drink in moderation, and (4) Have someone virtuous to manage things.

Mahamevna network turns 18: Gift to a spent humanity
Fatigue is very much a given in the modern society. That is a part and parcel of our lifestyle, yet most of us are clueless as to how to get rid of it. When tiredness affects humans it knows no humanity. The humans are occupied with a ceaseless struggle. About two millennia ago, the Buddha emerged in this world to show the path to steer clear of tiredness.
Since then, various Buddhist masters surfaced and resurfaced to elaborate the Buddhas path in simple language. That said, Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera is no stranger to Sri Lankan Buddhists.
He was, however, a lesser known figure about 18 years ago. When he established a small abode in Polgahawela in August 1999, he had monastic relaxation in mind. The Venerable Thera had been fed up with his pursuits for the truth in the Himalayas. When he began studying the Buddhist Suttas, Venerable Gnanananda Thera was overwhelmed by the joy of discovering a lost treasure. He wanted to pass that knowledge in simple terms.
In this small abode, completed in wattle and daub, the Venerable Thera began preaching the Buddhas teachings. The people grew attracted to him, little by little. Within no time, he became a trendy figure among the local Buddhist masters. Consequently, he was being invited to preach the Buddhas Dhamma from various quarters of the island.
His Dhamma programmes were usually held over the weekend. Throughout the day, the participants were engaged in meditation, listening to the Dhamma and studying the Buddhas teachings. The philanthropists of the area came to the fore to offer alms to this crowd. Alms were no issue at all, thanks to a large number of generous donors.
The crowds swarmed from distant areas such as Kandy, Colombo, Bandarawela, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, and Kegalla. The Dhamma Salas were erected to accommodate that large crowd. And then the urge to build branches across the island surfaced. The donors willingly donated lands to erect monasteries as branches of Mahamevna.
As the programme slowly expanded its wings, another crowd grew interest in taking up robes. They were mostly the youths, already occupied in employment following proper education. They had been taking part in the Mahamevna programmes consecutively. However, becoming a monk was not done in haste. They had to live an Upasaka life for a period of one year in the company of the Buddhist monks according to a strict timetable. If they still find it comfortable to stay in sync with the monk schedule, they will be ordained as novice monks.
The Mahamevna now has about 790 monks with 51 branches in Sri Lanka and 26 branches worldwide. Venerable Kekirawe Bodhi Thera, currently the Abbot of Polgahawela Monastery, spoke to Daily News about the 18th anniversary of Mahamevna.
When the Mahamevna turned 10 years, Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera spearheaded a project to look after the sickly.
A maternity ward was completed and handed over to a hospital in Ratnapura.
Another project initiated by the Mahamevna programme is donating clean water to the CKDu-affected areas.
The kidney disease is becoming a huge issue. Many people approach our monastery in search of a new kidney. Some other people come in search of funds to cure their sicknesses. So we chose areas such as Rajarata and Eastern province to execute this project. We got the philanthropists to donate clean water. Within a year we have donated more than 10 millions of litres of clean water.
And now the reports Kidney-affected cases are becoming lesser thanks to the ability to consume filtered water.
Sraddha and Lakviru Radio are two electronic media projects initiated by the Mahamevna in addition to the newspaper Mahamegha.
Tavatimsa programme has been initiated to expel the common myths among the humans about the celestial worlds. While engaged in social charity, the members of the Tavatimsa programme are supposed to conduct a virtuous lifestyle.
We used to have a common myth about the celestial world. What is it That the devas cannot understand the Dhamma and reach its fruition. That is a common myth. Because of this, most people abandoned the idea of being reborn in the celestial world. When that happens, our fate is more dangerous. Our chances to reborn in the hell realm are more when we give up the idea of being reborn in the celestial world, Venerable Bodhi Thera explained.
The mission is to engage in various meritorious deeds faith, charity and wisdom in order to reach the celestial world. Sakkha, the chief of the gods, dwells in Chatummaharajikaya and Tavatinsaya. Tavatinsa Yathra is the vehicle to reach the Tavatinsa.

Minister Dissanayake commends HelpAges free cataract surgery programme
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake, during an inspection tour at HelpAge Eye Hospital recently, commended the free cataract surgeries conducted for poor and destitute elders in the country.
The visit was organized by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) Communication Manager Ananda Kannangara, while HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge briefed Minister Dissanayake about the progress of the ongoing free cataract surgery programme.
During his short stay, Minister Dissanayake visited every section of the hospital including the patients waiting rooms, eye examining section and the operation theatres.
The Minister also had the opportunity to speak to many patients who visited the hospital from distant areas including Galle, Ratnaputa, Matara, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Mawanella.
A 64-year-old female patient from Kaduwela told the minister that the HelpAge free cataract surgery programme paved the way for her to continue her employment in a tile factory where she earns Rs. 900 a day.
She said she got to know about the hospital from a person who had a cataract surgery from the hospital three years ago
Another patient thanked the minister for visiting the hospital and said the eye hospital conducted a surgery on his left eye and it was a dream of having such a costly surgery done free.
Minister Dissanayake, who arrived at the hospital in the early hours (about 7.30 am), gave a patient hearing to many elderly patients and their guardians and valued the free service rendered by HelpAge Eye Hospital.
Executive Director Liyanawaduge said over 30,000 cataract surgeries have so far been performed by the hospital and highlighted that majority of the elders are not in a sound financial background to have their cataract surgeries done in private hospitals.
He told Minister Dissanayaka that the hospital performs 20 free cataract surgeries everyday, with donations and assistance received from donors. HelpAge Eye Hospital Manager Ajitha de Alwis also briefed Minister Dissanayake about the free cataract surgery programme and said the hospital has so far conducted over 30,000 cataract surgeries for poor and destitute elders in the country.

Mustapha suggests new mixed electoral system is applied to all elections

Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Faizer Mustapha will table a cabinet memorandum proposing to apply the new mixed electoral system introduced for the local government bodies, to all elections including Provincial Council election and parliamentary election. 
Issuing a statement, Minister Mustapha says he will table the memorandum at the Cabinet meeting tomorrow.
The new mixed electoral system for the Local Government bodies follows a First-Past-the-Post (FPP) representation 60 percent and Proportional Representation (PR) 40 percent ratio.
The Constitutional Steering Committee has already proposed to hold the parliamentary election under this 60:40 ratio electoral system. By introducing the same system to Provincial Councils will ensure that we have a consistent method applied to all elections. Minister Mustapha observes.
He also says that all political parties in the parliament have consented to this proposal.
Minister Mustapha further states that the new electoral system will pave way to a better political culture. Mustapha also states that he is willing to discuss about the proposal with all political parties and other parties concerned of the matter. The statement also says that the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Council will seek recommendations from an expert committee on the proposal as well.

Next three years will be development era: Prime Minister
The groundwork is now being laid to transform next three years into an era of development, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting held at the Kaduwela Divisional Secretariat on September 1 to mark the distribution of certificates to 3,000 women who had completed a sewing training course and the distribution of sewing machines to 80 of them. The programme was organised by International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe.
The Prime Minister said investors would set up industrial zones in Horana, Kaluatra and Avissawella to open garment industries.
He said 100 acres were allocated in Horana for the purpose and the area would be increased to 1000 acres. Industrial zones would be set up in Kalutara, Avissawella, and Hambantota, he said.
Women will be able to seek employment in factories set up in the zones without facing various problems and vicissitudes by seeking employments abroad, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said he highly appreciated the programme organised by Minister Senasinghe to provide job training to women in the area. He said steps would be taken to initiate a loan scheme for women trainees to enable them to start self-employment schemes.
The Prime Minister said the Government increased the salaries of state-sector servants by Rs. 10,000.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said more opportunities would be provided for women to enhance their economic standards and even enter the political field. He said the next local elections would be held according to a mixture of the Preferential and First Past the Post Systems. There will be 28 candidates from each party contesting the Kaduwela Municipal Council election on the Ward basis and 25 percent of them should be women candidates, the Prime Minister Said.
Minister Senasinghe said he was fully satisfied with the ministry post offered to him and he would never betray the party or its policies.

No interest rate rise for at least a year, economists say
Many economists do not expect UK interest rates to rise until 2019 despite inflation remaining above target, according to a BBC snapshot.
They believe that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will be reluctant to raise rates during Brexit negotiations.
Inflation stood at 2.6% in July - well above the Bank's official target of 2%.
Half the economists contacted by the BBC think wages growth will outpace inflation in the first half of 2019.
Last week, one MPC member, Michael Saunders, said a "modest rise" in rates was needed to curb high inflation.
The base rate has stood at a record low of 0.25% since August 2016 - the first move since March 2009, when it was reduced to 0.5%.
In June, three MPC members voted for a rate rise - the first time since May 2011 that so many had wanted to tighten policy.
The same month the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, also made a call for a rate rise this year.
However, Mark Carney, the Bank governor, said in his Mansion House speech in late June that "now is not yet the time" to start raising rates once more.
"We believe that policymakers will be reluctant to tighten monetary policy until greater clarity emerges around the UK's post-EU trading framework, and our expectation of declining inflation through 2018 should also reduce the pressure for an interest rate rise," he said.
Others expect it to be even longer, with economists at Morgan Stanley not expecting any movement until March 2019 at the earliest, with Andrew Goodwin at Oxford Economics suggesting it would not happen until the third quarter of that year.
Similarly, Fabrice Montagne, at Barclays, expects rates to stay on hold until "at least 2019".
But there are those who argue that the Bank will raise rates sooner. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY ITEM Club, said he had one increase, to 0.5%, pencilled in for late 2018, adding: "I would not be at all surprised if it was delayed until 2019."
Michael Lee, at Cambridge Econometrics, expects a rise to come in either the second or third quarter of next year as he thinks inflation will stay above the Bank's 2% target for the next two to three years.
Philip Rush, at Heteronomica, is more specific, settling on May 2018.
The one outlier is George Buckley at Nomura, who expects the MPC to jump in November.
The BBC also asked the economists when they expect inflation to peak in the UK. Both Rush and Archer think it will hit 2.9% in October, with the latter predicting it will then start to fall back "as the impact of the sharp drop in sterling following the June 2016 Brexit vote increasingly wanes".
Several others, such as Green, Lee and Goodwin, expect inflation to hit 3% in the final three months of the year before starting to retreat.
Morgan Stanley is more pessimistic, however, predicting a peak of 3.2% in Spring 2018.
Holiday makers planning trips to the continent in the next few months should prepare themselves for more pain, according to Morgan Stanley.
Its currency strategy team expect sterling to weaken against the euro by a further 10% by March 2018.
Green at Santander also forecasts more weakness for the UK currency over the course of the next year, with an average of $1.25 to the pound and just 96 euro cents in the final quarter of 2018.
Archer thinks the pound will sink to about $1.25 by Christmas, but recover to trade about seven cents higher by the end of 2018.
Heteronomica's Rush is also a little more optimistic about sterling, expecting it to be stronger within a year.
The last time interest rates went up was 5 July, 2007. They rose by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75%. The next month the credit crunch struck, and so began a series of cuts, down to 0.5% in March 2009.
These were supposed to be emergency measures. Then came the Brexit vote, and in August 2016 the official rate dropped to a fresh record low of 0.25%. That compares to a typical range of between 5% and 13% for most of the 1990s.
Emergency rates are the new normal. That carries dangers. If we hit another slump, we've run out of road; there won't be much the Bank of England can do to help by cutting interest rates.
While some members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee think we should start restoring interest rates to non-emergency levels this year, that is a minority view, as our snapshot of economists' forecasts shows.
You could draw a number of conclusions. You might decide interest rates aren't effective on their own - so the government should rely less on the central bank stimulus and instead use fiscal policy such as cutting taxes or raising spending.
You might take the view that rates should rise to help savers and pension schemes.
Or you might take the view that an early rise could worsen the economic slowdown. You might even believe that we need to find ways to get the official rate below zero (so that I, the lender, pay you, the borrower, to take my money).
Take your pick, but whichever you choose, normality ain't what it used to be.

Pest-resistant new paddy strains
The Batalagoda Paddy Research Station has formulated two fresh varieties of paddy.
According to project officials attached to Batalagoda Paddy Research Station, these two novel varieties of paddy are named BG 369 and BG 3R. Out of them, BG369 is a white variety. Through the successful cultivation of this variety in an acre of land, a harvest of 100 to 125 bushels of paddy could easily be yielded.
It is highly resistant to pests and insect diseases. These paddy plants would not fall even until the point of reaping the harvest.
BG 3R is a red samba strain and the grain of rice is small. About 140 to 150 bushels of paddy could be obtained in successful cultivation in an acre of land. This is highly resistant to pests and other paddy diseases. They could be cultivated even in brackish and salty lands. It is the exception of this strain of paddy, researchers commented.
Within a period of less than three and half months, the harvest could be reaped and they are in high demand among paddy farmers, they further added.

Poor turn outs  we failed  our fans says Tharanga
Sri Lankas one-day skipper Upul Tharanga admitted that his team had let their fans down by not performing to their potential during the five-match one-day international series against India and called for them to continue backing them despite the recent losses.
For the first time in their history Sri Lanka suffered the ignominy of a 5-0 whitewash at the hands of India in the ODI series that concluded at the R Premadasa Stadium on Sunday. This followed at the heels of a 3-0 drubbing in the three-match Test series against the same opposition.
Following a near capacity turnout of 21,000 at Pallekele for the third ODI where spectators vented their anger at the loss and pelted plastic bottles onto the field, the fourth and fifth ODIs at the 35,000 capacity R Premadasa Stadium was played in front of half empty stands.
We have to admit that as a team we werent up to the mark. The Test series was a huge disappointment and then we failed in the ODIs as well. When we lose, the fans move away from us. They would like to see us winning, said Tharanga at the post-match press conference.
We all want to win games, but there are mistakes that happen. We saw that in the series. We need the backing of the fans. The nation has to back us. That is our biggest strength. We failed to do well as a team. Well try to do well from the next series onwards. We have a months break before the next ODIs and we need to rectify the mistakes and move forward.
Explaining where his team erred during the series Tharanga said, We committed too many mistakes. As a batting unit we failed to post decent totals. Even after five games we failed to post 250 runs even once. Feeling very disappointed with that. These batting displays are worrying. Even today we could have made about 270 or 275. We were well placed, but like in the last few games we collapsed.
We lost seven wickets for 53 runs. That has been something that is happening frequently now. Throughout the series, our batsmen failed after getting starts. We have to be concentrating more on making big ones One of the top four batters need to make a century then only we can go and get something like 280 or 300. Most of our players have played less than 30 matches. Thats something that you gain with experience. Virat Kohlis batting was a good example for us. We talk about these things. We need someone who is set to get a big one. But we failed to achieve that. In ODIs, if you fail in one department it is very difficult to compete.
Tharanga cited the bowling of Jasprit Bumrah and Buvneshwar Kumar as the reasons for Sri Lankas batting debacles.
Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jaspreet Bumrah bowled really well. They are very good white ball bowlers. They have played a lot of IPL matches. They are playing with the worlds best players. They have improved because of that. Slow balls and yorkers, their bowlers were very crafty, said Tharanga.
When you play against good teams, you cannot bowl four good balls and give away two bad balls. When you are playing against quality batsmen, you have to be consistent with your line and length. Akila Dananjaya tried to mix things up and we planned things as well. But we couldnt execute them, he said.
From an overall point Tharanga stated, We lacked consistency. We didnt bat well. We didnt bowl well and we didnt field well. We were outplayed in the series. Disappointed with the batting. India were very consistent. We failed to get big scores. The Indian top order was making plenty of runs.
Tharanga spoke of the need to strengthen the lower order batting that India outshone Sri Lanka.
When we are playing white ball cricket we should have eight or nine guys who can bat. We need to have a couple of all-rounders. There was little support from the tail. Moving forward that will be a vital thing we need the tail to fire and that didnt happen in this series. We will need all-rounders.
Tharanga said that he didnt see any reason for him to step down as captain and said, The next set of selectors will decide how we will move forward. The last two years we have not played well. Only this set of players can make us come out of it. We need to plan better. We need to identify what are the areas we can improve on.
For the current 2017 calendar year Sri Lanka has won only four of the 21 ODIs they have played to-date and they are precariously ranked eighth in the ICC ODI standings awaiting the outcome of the West Indies-England five-match ODI series to see whether they will have to qualify for the 2019 World Cup.
As a player and captain I feel very bad about it. If you take the last two years we were not up to the mark. We were not consistent, said Tharanga. In ODIs you have to read the game well. By reading the situation only you adjust to situations. We have to try and get out of it.
Tharanga who returned to lead his country in the final ODI against India after missing out on the third and fourth through suspension for slow overrate said, Not only the bowlers, the entire team is responsible. Bowlers need to quicken things up and the fielders need to back them up. Bowlers take some time and fielders take time. Not only the captain but the entire team should come under the spotlight.

Practical Buddhism: Taking responsibility for our lives
We can develop the power and skill to refrain from acts of body, speech, and mind that cause ourselves and others pain. We can learn to perform those acts of body, speech, and mind that lead to happiness and peace. We can purify our minds. Thus Buddhism is concerned with the nature of our lives and the means by which we can eradicate the discontent and hollowness which so afflicts them. Consequently the teachings of Buddhism are not to be seen as dogmas to be adhered to, but tools to be used to develop our inherent potential.
Buddhism is a religion that considers wisdom, rather than faith, to be the single most important virtue. The Buddha said that if we look at ourselves very closely and honestly, we find a well of disease and conflict within our mind. He said that the underlying root of that pain is our ignorance of and the fundamental misconceptions that we cherish about the true nature of our existence. The way to true happiness thus lies in remedying our wrong ideas about the way things are, and for this task we need a wisdom founded on generosity and morality and fortified by a calm clarity of mind. In Buddhist perspective our lives have dignity and meaning to the extent that they incline towards and testify to truth.
GENEROSITY
On its most basic level, our wrong understanding of life, characterised by a tenacious clinging to the sense of me and mine, manifests externally as selfishness and possessiveness. The first level of Buddhist practice entails undermining our foolishness by countering its expressions. We develop a generous heart. The Buddha encouraged us to give, wisely and selflessly, not seeking for any kind of reward.
He spoke of three kinds of giving: the giving of material things to those deserving of it, e.g., food to mendicant monks, alms to the poor; the giving of forgiveness to those that have wronged us; and lastly and most excellently, the giving of truth, gladly sharing any worldly knowledge or spiritual understanding that we have acquired.
Generosity, apart from eroding selfish concern, gives a joy and lightness to the mind and creates bonds of love and friendship within a society. The less grasping at things we have, the more we can open up to the world around us and contribute positively to it.
MORALITY
Morality, the second aspect of Buddhist training, is also deeply concerned with the things we do and the things we say. Action and speech that proceeds from unwholesome mental states harms both ourselves and others. In Buddhism, morality is defined as the will to refrain from all such words and deeds. By not reinforcing the power of ne.g.ative emotions through internal repression or outward expression, but by simply observing and calmly enduring through them, the hold of the afflictions over us is weakened, and we be.g.in to free ourselves from them.
The training in morality consists of a commitment to certain precepts as guiding principles in ones daily life. For lay Buddhists these precepts are five in number, namely:
to refrain from taking life
to refrain from stealing
to refrain from sexual misconduct
to refrain from false speech
to refrain from use of intoxicants.
These precepts are not commandments or to be blindly obeyed but are tools to be skilfully used to harmonise the way we live with spiritual truths.
Although framed ne.g.atively the precepts naturally engender virtues of kindness, honesty, contentment, truthfulness, and heedfulness. One who keeps the precepts purely finds feelings of guilt and self-reproach supplanted by those of well-being and self-respect. Ones mind inclines toward peace and clarity. Morality is thus the firm basis for all spiritual endeavour and can be seen to provide the indispensable foundation for an intelligent and caring society.
MEDITATION
The third aspect of Buddhism is meditation, the development of mental calm and insight. In their normal state, our minds are scattered and out of control. We find it hard to stop thinking even for a moment. The tremendous energy of the mind is thus never harnessed and put to good use. Meditation is a way to focus the mind, so as to enable it to withdraw from its usual preoccupations, and penetrate the truth of our existence.
Meditation is not merely a means of relaxation, nor is it a technique to escape from stressful responsibility into blissful trance. It is rather a precise means for sharpening, strengthening, and ultimately purifying the mental faculties. Initially one concentrates the mind on a particular object, just as to tame a wild animal, one might tie it to a post. There are many possible objects to use for this purpose. One that many people find useful is the sensation of the breath at the tip of the nostrils, but whatever object is employed, the important point is to maintain a close, alert, and continual awareness of it.
At first, of course, we cant. Concentration is difficult. It goes against the grain of our distraction. But with patience, perseverance, and good humour, it is not impossible. When the mind strays away from the object one gently but firmly brings it back again - again and again and again.
Eventually the concentration becomes more or less effortless and the mind bright and firm. Here, fore.g.oing the initial object, one merely maintains a sharp, bare awareness of whatever is arising consciousness - be it a physical sensation, a feeling, a thought, a perception, or whatever - staying with the changing nature of each phenomenon rather than its content.
If the mind has been sufficiently stabilised by concentration one is able to maintain an equanimous gaze on the present reality and a direct non-conceptual appreciation of the true nature of our existence be.g.ins to grow. As we come to realise the changing, unstable, and inconsequential nature of all that goes to make up our lives, our wrong ideas and assumptions about ourselves fall away and our grasping attachment to things is completely undermined. It is here that true peace and liberation, the highest achievement of human beings and the goal of Buddhism, is finally achieved.

PRESIDENT, PM SPELL OUT VISION 2025
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe observed that the Unity Government proved a success during the past two years as the only one of its kind in the global political history since the two main rival political parties had joined together to ensure development while guaranteeing the rights of the people.
They made these observations yesterday in response to the queries of five youth during a Question and Answer session at the ceremony to launch the eight year economic plan Vision 2025 of the Unity Government, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday. Five youth from different parts of the country representing various youth organisations raised questions from both the President and Prime Minister in the presence of the audience.
President Maithripala Sirisena responding to Sri Lanka Youth Society Convention Chairman Shehan Kannagara who queried as to whether he was satisfied with the progress of the first Cabinet of the Unity Government said that the concept was novel.
It had brought the two main and rival political parties in the country together after 60 years, the President said.
This was so hard as we had experienced massive destruction housing and property, political vengeance at work places, even rape after some past lections. When two political parties come together, it is impossible to achieve 100 percent success overnight. But, we have been able to run the last two years under such challenging circumstances,President Sirisena said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe responding to the same query said that the two political parties could have gone down the path of destruction.
The Premier also said the youth feel a change and they have hope.But, we needed to give the youth something new and constructive, the Premier said. President Maithripala Sirisena making a great sacrifice by joined us. The new development was a challenge to all of us. Earlier, attempts to do so ended in failure.Therefore, those who tried before and failed should hail our success,the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said eventhough we have not chieved all our goals, the Unity Government has made great strides.
The Premier in response to Speaker of the Youth Parliament Sachintha Dulanjana who queried of the governments strategy in its bid to improve the economy by creating one million jobs for the youth by 2025, said they had already implemented the strategy.
The Prime Minister stated that the two main parties and several other parties were brought together.
S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike obtained a two thirds majority but he got only 48 percent of the votes. The UNP got a five sixth majority but it only secured 51 percent of the votes, the Premier said. But, in order to implement important policies and goals,the two main parties should come together. There should be political stability to bring about development.
President Sirisena in response to Dinushi Deerasinghe who queried if he thought that the country obtained the maximum benefit by the joining of the countyrys two main parties, said that it has not yet achieved all its objectives.
We have to go further to get the maximum benefits, the President said.
We are making these efforts amidst various obstacles by certain elements. We can make this a success when all think of their responsibilities and commitment towards their Motherland.
The President also said that a project cannot achieve 100 percent success overnight. President Sirisena responding to the query as to what measures the government has taken to arrest corruption as in line with the election pledge, said corruption and waste that was practiced during the previous regime cannot be eradicated in a day or two. We have strengthened the laws. The institutions that deal with corruption and waste such as the Bribery Commission have been strengthened. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution was also was introduced in support of it, the President said.
Politicians fear to commit corruption waste and frauds because of the legal measures we are taking today.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in response to Thilini Medagoda who queried about the Unity Governments means to write off Sri Lankas debt burden accrued from the previous regime said that the government could at the least meets its loan repayments through its revenue and eanings at the time the unity government was elected.
But, now we are stable enough to settle the premiums, the Prime Minister said.
We will have to obtain loans on some occasions. But,the country hopes to repay all its outstanding loans by 2025. The income from the massive investments that we would get during the next three years will be added to the revenue in 2025. Thereafter,it will not be a difficult task to settle the loan premiums. In such a situation,we would solve these issues and hand over developed country to our future generations,the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said the country would then undergo a greater development drive than it experienced in 1977. The Prime Minister added that the North,South,West and East could be developed on an equeal footing as there would be no conflict situation.
Responding to the query as to what the strategy would be in creating one million job opportunities and increasing the per capita income to US$ 5000,the Premier said that first we need investment and for investments, investors are needed. For them technology is needed. We need technology for the agriculture,service and health sectors etc.
If we do not have the proper technology, investors will not be forthcoming, Premier said. That is why stability was created. There is no religious or racial conflict in the country. We have to provide training to boost the countrys human resources. Then they will be able to compete in the international market, the Prime Minister said.
President Sirisena responding to Jaihuja Ilmanadan who queried as to what the government would do to bring about reconciliation and development with the regained international recognition, said we were able to gain international trust and recognition as we maintained democracy, human rights, fundamental rights media freedom, independence of the judiciary etc,.
The previous government could not obtain international support as it failed to maintain these rights and standards, President Sirisena said.
The 18th Amendment was rejected by all the educated people not only in the country but outside the country.
The Premier responding to the same question said that Sri Lanka had to maintain a non-allied policy. But, we had problems with the UN and other countries and we lost many facilities and opportunities.
Our exports dropped as we did not have markets. The garment industry was dealt a severe blow as a result, the Prime Minister added.

Prez on MRs failed gamble
President Maithripala Sirsiena, addressing the 66th anniversary celebrations of the SLFP said he gave his predecessor six reasons as to why the latter should not go for a premature election. One of the reasons was that Rajapaksa had miserably failed to introduce democratic reforms and a proper reconciliation process to build the shattered lives of the people in the North and East, after the conclusion of the war. It is this very fact that alienated the country from the international community, earning for it a multitude of sanctions and reprimands. The President said the threat of war crimes charges, economic sanctions and the hostile attitude of the global community against Sri Lanka was the direct result of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime's failure to create an atmosphere of reconciliation. He asked as to what would have been the situation, under this extremely hostile environment, if there had been no regime change and the status quo allowed to prevail.
He said it was left to him, as the new President, to convince the world leaders to afford him time to set things right and effect the necessary reforms, restore democracy and put the reconciliation process in motion. These leaders responded positively and gave the new government ample breathing space to set matters right by pulling the country from the parlous state it had plunged into.
The President could not have been more correct. The Rajapaksas took the flood of the popularity generated by the war victory at the tide and bulldozed their way, trampling over all norms of decency, values, ethical standards and democratic ideals which were replaced by autocratic rule, nay an oligarchy. Democracy gave way to family rule, with the law and order machinery and the justice system undergoing total collapse. Crime and murder, sanctioned by members of the first family, went by default, with no investigations carried out or details suppressed, as is now being unraveled. Plunder of the national wealth continued unabated, with no one called to account.
Minorities mattered no more to the rulers and the Tamils were treated as a vanquished race, to be at the mercy of the majority community. The first parliamentary session, after the war victory, presided over by the emperor, provided an inkling as to what awaits the minorities and Tamil community in particular. It was clear that Rajapaksa was not letting this opportunity go without being harnessed to his maximum political advantage, both for the present and the continuation of Rajapaksa rule deep into the future. The text was drafted to appeal to the core element of the nationalist sentiment, exclusively targeting the southern electorate.
Rajapaksa declared from the throne that there was no longer a majority or minority community in Sri Lanka but only those who are with us and those who are not. He also hectored that a solution to the ethnic problem would certainly be found, but strictly on our terms and not those imported from outside. Military parades took the form a spectacle, to celebrate the war victory, held at regular intervals, giving the whole affair the patina of an army on the march after conquering a foreign enemy and aptly termed victory parades. President Sirisena should be commended for doing away with the practise and converting this into a commemoration day, of sorts, in remembrance of ALL those who sacrificed their lives in the war, both, civilians and combatants.
Other steps too were taken to slight and hurt the feelings of the Tamil community, such as doing away with the practice of singing the national anthem in Tamil, in schools and government institutions in the North. No action was taken when a burial ground of the LTTE's dead in the North was bombarded, allegedly by the unruly elements in the military, nor any form of commemoration permitted, to mourn the dead of their loved ones, to the people of the North.
Not just the Tamils, even the Muslims were targeted by the regime by inaction in the face of open hostility towards the community by saffron robed marauders. The police were made mere onlookers when mobs stoned Muslim establishments and businesses. They (the police) would not dare take any action, what with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa seen in the exalted company of the monk who led the mob.
President Sirisena also spoke of the assault on the judiciary and justice system in general. No doubt he would have had in mind the numerous instances where the wrong doers, against whom there were cases pending, were allowed to go scot free, curtsy the Attorney General's Department which was under the head of state. Nor, how the country's only lady chief justice was hounded out of office for failing to rule in favour of a Rajapaksa sibling who was an all powerful minister.
President Sirisena appealed to the SLFP supporters to help him cleanse the party and rid it of the rot that had set in. He wanted their assistance to rescue the party, that had been infected with corruption, nepotism, crimes and waste in the recent past and take it to victory in 2020.

Raviraj murder appeal case fixed for support on Dec.12

The appeal filed by the wife of former TNA Jaffna district MP Nadaraja Raviraj challenging the Colombo High Courts judgment to release the five accused, including three Navy intelligence officers, in the Raviraj murder case was yesterday re-fixed for support on December 12 by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench bench comprising Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena were informed that the second respondent accused, a navy officer was evading court.
The aggrieved party, Sasikala Raviraj, wife of the slain MP filed this appeal seeking an order to set aside the verdict of the Colombo High Court dated December 23, 2016 to acquit and release all accused from the case.
On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
The verdict which was delivered by High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke as per the unanimous decision reached by the jury, following a month long trial. The jurys decision was that the accused cannot be convicted based on the evidence in the case.
The petitioner further sought an order to set aside the order of the High Court allowing the request of the accused for the case to be tried before a jury. The petitioner stated that a trial by jury cannot be accepted in this case since three charges out of five had been levelled under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
The High Court allowed the Raviraj murder trial to proceed in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code. Three accused who were not present before Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction. Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.

So many captains in such a short time, a world record
There were six tosses of the coin during the recent series against India and there were five Sri Lankan captains. This I feel is a world record. No wonder Sri Lankan higher-ups are scraping the barrel for captains. Upul Tharanga has twice been penalised for slow over rates, will he ever learn, Dinesh Chandimal is plagued with injuries and Chamara Kapugedara is the latest casualty. Are they dreading the captaincy! It is too much of a coincidence.
Have you ever heard of a captain fighting for his place When I reminisce back to school cricket, a captain was selected for the whole season and when I captained my school, there was no big brother looking over my shoulder with an axe to grind, so my mental tuning was spot on. International cricket and school cricket could be poles apart but the basics are the same.
Angelo Mathews like Mike Dennis of England a few years back both gave up the captaincy before they were sacked and both were gentlemen cricketers. Mike Brearley was brought in by the English selectors to replace Ian Botham as the England captain and this was a rare occasion. Although Botham was a brilliant cricketer as a captain he could not produce the goods, Brearley was an astute captain and he was a psychoanalyst who was educated and cultured, who never went hell for leather to get the best from his team. On the other side of the coin there are captains who are born leaders, take for example, Ian Chapell, Ted Dexter, the late Sir Frank Worrell, Arjuna Ranatunga, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and on a lower bracket the present Indian captain Virat Kohli who looks very promising.
A captain like Arjuna Ranatunga we might never get, he had qualities of Ian Chappell and Mike Brearley put together. Thats how we were able to galvanise a team of world beaters.
It is pathetic to note; our cricket has hit rock bottom. I take my hat off for the selectors for stepping down after this disastrous series with India. Please note that this Indian team are no. 1 in the world and everything they touch turn to gold. The Indian cricket set up is well organised and ably led from their top man down to Virat Kohli. They have established a pool of players, who are talented, brimming with confidence and focussed.
In the Sri Lankan pool they have talented players no doubt, but the confidence in them and focus is not there. As a result, team spirit is down in the doldrums.The crowds will start deserting the stadiums, like what happened at the R.Premadasa Stadium last time around.
International cricket has become a mind game and to captain an International cricket team and to succeed you need to handle pressure at the highest level. As a result most famous cricket captains have given up their mantle of captaincy eg, A.B. de Villiers, Alastair Cook and Angelo Mathews. All three of them are doing well since.
I feel that there is an out of the box solution to lift our cricket, and to raise it to a much higher level. We have to bring a person like Mike Brearley, but he should be a home grown guy who could communicate well in Sinhala. His qualifications should be as follows: a cricket enthusiast, preferably retired so that he could give 100% of his time, qualified or experienced in sports psychology, well versed with the local culture, and down to earth.
Communication plays a very big part in our daily lives as well, thats why the person should be able to communicate effectively and the medium should be Sinhala. Almost all our cricketers are not fluent in English and find it difficult to understand English. The Indian cricketers can understand English much better and they can communicate effectively.
The person has to be a cricket enthusiast and patriotic as well. I suggest a retired person because he can devote himself much better. He will have to gel the team together without interfering much with the technical aspects of the game.
We have uncut gems in the team such as Kusal Mendis, Akila Dananjaya, Niroshan Dickwella, Dhananjaya de Silva, Lakshan Sandakan, Dushmantha Chameera, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dilshan Munaweera, Dhanushka Gunathilaka etc these players will benefit most from this man concerned. Except for the first three mentioned all the others need some psychoanalysis since they are young and fighting for their places.
In my book Dinesh Chandimal for Tests and Chamara Kapugedera for the shorter versions are the best bets for captaincy.
I fervently hope the men up above will look for a psychoanalyst sooner than later.
