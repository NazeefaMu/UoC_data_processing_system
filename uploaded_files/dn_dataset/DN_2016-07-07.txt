With the passage of time it embedded itselfin to society as a form of a game specially, among fun loving younger generations. While playing, the players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with paintballs. Today the games popularity has gone beyond borders and paintball competitions have become another popular worldwide event.

The Cabinet has also decided to advise relevant parties to accelerate the relief activities for the residents in the Western Province, including the Kolonnawa area, which was recently affected by the floods.
Construction of Indigenous Medical Research Hospital and Herbal Garden
A considerable trend can be observed among Sri Lankans, taking indigenous and ayurvedic treatments. As the ancestral indigenous medicine is a valuable gift that should be given to the future generations, the government has taken steps to conserve and develop indigenous medicine. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senarathne, to establish an Indigenous Medical Research Hospital and Herbal Garden adjacent to the Vedagama Model Village in Dompe Divisional Secretary Division, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Improvement of Storm water Drainage within Western Megapolis Region
The area of the Western Province is only 5.7% of the island, but its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product exceeds 50% and acts as the important industrial, commercial and administrative centre of Sri Lanka. As 5 main river valleys are situated in the Western Province, it confronts constant floods, and therefore it is important to develop the storm water drainage in the Western Megapolis Region, in developing it to international standards. About 30% of the Weras Ganga Storm Water Drainage and Environment Improvement Project has been completed. The proposal made by the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Patali Champika Ranawaka, to implement 08 projects in this regard immediately, including construction of two tunnels for drainage storm water to the sea and two pump houses to pump storm water to the sea, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Establishment of the Engineering Council to regulate the Profession of Engineering by registering Engineering Practitioners

Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Patali Champika Ranawaka, to establish the Engineering Council which is responsible for maintaining professional status and regulating engineers, and to publish in the gazette the Engineering Council, Sri Lanka Bill for enacting provisions for registration of engineers and related tasks and to present the same in parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
07. Holding United Nations Vesak Day Celebrations in Sri Lanka  2017
Prof. Gunapala Malalasekara had proposed that the Vesak Day should be celebrated internationally throughout the world in 1950 during the World Buddhist Congress held in Sri Lanka, and later in 1999 the proposal made to the United Nations General Assembly by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Lakshman Kadiragamar, was adopted and the tradition of celebration of the International Vesak Day was accepted. In 2016, the celebration was held in Thailand. The joint proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Minister of Buddha Sasana, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, to hold the United Nations Vesak Day Celebrations and the Conference 2017 in Sri Lanka in May 2017 and to appoint a Committee to make necessary arrangements to in this regard, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979
The proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, to publish in the gazette and present in parliament the drafted Code of Criminal Procedures (Amendment) Act, for enacting provisions enabling a detainee to obtain the service of a desired legal counsel by his expenditure, before presenting before a Magistrate, and to provide that service through a legal counsel of the Legal Aid Commission, for any detainee who cannot afford the expense, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Consolidation of Core Legislation
Legislations enacted in the past have amended frequently and understanding such laws have become a complex and difficult task. As a solution the Ministry of Justice will consolidate five core legislations and redrafted in Sinhala, Tamil and English with the assistance of United Nations Development Programme. When considering Evidence Ordinance, Criminal Procedure Code and the Penal Code, they include many words and declarations that have been outdated and they could be misunderstood by the public. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, to substitute or revise such terms in those legislations to suit the present linguistic context, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Amendment to Assistance to and protection of victims of crime and witnesses act no. 04 of 2015
The above act was brought into operation on May 16, 2016. There have been requests to give witnesses from overseas under this act. Accordingly it has been decided to amend the above act enabling victims and witnesses to give evidence from outside the country through audio visual media, without being present at the courts. Such evidences may be given at a Sri Lankan Diplomatic Mission in the respective country and provisions should be enacted to protect the freedom of witnesses and prevent any influence. The proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, to draft amendments to the above act on the above purposes, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Enforcement of new regulations in terms of the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea
Common and distinct laws and regulations were introduced for safety of life at sea that should be followed in international merchant shipping affairs by the above convention in 1974 by the International Maritime Organization. All member states have agreed to follow these regulations. Accordingly, a certificate that denote the gross weight of all containers should be provided with the view of improving the protection of container ships, maintaining the stability/balance of the ship storing containers in due manner and minimizing the environmental impact. Currently the gross weight is stated in documents but a certificate is not issued. Hence, legislations which were made with the consultation of all parties by the Merchant Shipping Secretariat, should be drafted through the Legal Draftsman to issue licence for Container Weight Verifiers and Container Transporters. The proposal made by the Minister of Ports and Shipping, Arjuna Ranatunga, to draft above legislations and thereafter publish in the gazette and present in parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Resettlement of Protracted Internally Displaced Persons in the Northern Province
IDPs were seen since the 1980s due to the conflict situation. These include Tamil as well as Sinhala and Muslim families in the Northern Province. After the end of the conflict these IDPs began to return to their homeland but with the lack of infrastructure the process was not successful. Muslim and Sinhala IDP families need 16,120 and 5,543 houses respectively. Being IDPs their political rights including the right to vote were affected, and they face difficulties in accessing services rendered by the Divisional Secretariat, registration of Births and Deaths as well as enrolling children for schools. Accordingly the Cabinet approved to appoint a Task Force in this regard with the Co-Chairmanship of the Ministers of Industry and Commerce and Provincial Councils and Local Government and to proceed according to its recommendations.
Development Projects on Rehabilitation and Resettlement - 2016
A special budgetary provision of Rs. 14 billion was allocated by budget proposals 2016. Accordingly, many projects including construction of new houses, renovation of damaged houses, provision of sanitary facilities, providing safe drinking water, provision of livelihood assistance, rehabilitation of roads, and improvement of infrastructure, were implemented under the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs in 2016. The above information presented by the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, D.M. Swaminathan, was noted by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Creating a special Head in Annual Budget Estimates for effective implementation of the Official Language Policy
The Constitution of Sri Lanka has accepted Sinhala and Tamil as official languages and affirm the right of obtaining services from any public institution in the desired official language. Accordingly, all public institutions are bound to render services in both official languages. The proposal made by the Minister of National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages, Mano Ganeshan, to create a special head in budget estimates of each ministry from 2017 to implement the Official Languages Policy with the view of facilitating citizens to obtain services in their desired language at 2020, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Leasing of the old Chancery Building of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Washington D.C.
The above building which the Embassy of Sri Lanka was located earlier is vacant at present and it has been observed that it could be used in economically beneficial manner. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mangala Samaraweera, to appoint a Technical Evaluation Committee Chaired by the Sri Lankan Ambassador for consultation on regulations and conditions for leasing the building and to proceed with relevant activities, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Kaduruwela Town Expansion Project  Phase I
Economic activities in Kaduruwela area have increased after the end of war. As a result it is confronted with issues such as traffic congestion, lack of parking facilities, as well as environmental and social issues due to unplanned construction. The Urban Development Authority has planned the above project as a solution to these problems and a number of sub-projects are to be implemented.
Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Patali Champika Ranawaka, to award activities of the first phase of this project such as planning, development of lands, preparing the drainage system, and land filling to the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Maintaining a pool of elephants for cultural activities
The perahera culture of Sri Lanka has a great history and has attracted the worlds attention. It has been observed that it is essential to use elephants in peraheras to maintain its pride and devoutness. When several cultural activities are held together with the Dalada Perahera, the number of elephants are insufficient. Therefore, a pool of about 35 elephants is proposed to be established under the Zoological Department, with elephants obtained from Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and Udawalawa Eth Athuru Sevana, with the objective of training for perahera purposes. The proposal made by the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, on the above matter, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Schools body decides to hold rugby final at neutral venue

Match could be moved to Kandy - Nittawela or Bogambara
Following the meeting Isipathana College representatives had with the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) officials at Lumbini College yesterday, the SLSRFA have been forced to take the decision to hold the Milo inter-schools president trophy knockout tournament final match between Isipathana College and Royal College at a neutral
SLSRFA officials had met on Monday to take up the protest lodged by Isipathana to move the venue for the final from the Royal Sports Complex as it gave their opponents an unfair advantage and after much deliberation invited reps from Isipathana for a meeting yesterday.
Isipathana had lodged a protest over the venue two weeks ago on June 22 and followed it up with another reminder to the SLSRFA after Royal College entered the final beating arch rivals S. Thomas College ML last Sunday at the Royal Sports Complex. In the history of Sri Lanka schools rugby never has a school team who had come to the inter-schools knockout final been given the luxury to play at their home venue. It has always been played at a neutral venue.
Denzil Darling, the secretary SLSRFA told the Daily News yesterday that as a result of the discussions between the SLSRFA and Isipathana representatives, the association had finally decided to hold the final at a neutral venue.
We are presently searching for a neutral venue. Havelock Park and Longden Place are definitely out as both grounds have been used by Isipathana College before as their home venue, said Darling.
The Sugathadasa Stadium is also out with renovations and the Racecourse together with the Air Force grounds in Ratmalana are not favourable for security reasons. We will most probably try to book the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Diyagama and confirm it tomorrow, he said.
Even though Darling mentioned Diyagama as a probable venue for the final what he has overlooked is the fact that it is not possible to play the match there since it will be used to host the 3-day National Athletic Championships from July 8-10.
A Isipathana rugby committee media spokesman said, We had a very bad experience on two consecutive occasions last year when we played against Royal in the league decider final as well as the Milo knockout final. When we arrived at the Royal Sports Complex we were suspicious about the ground conditions. We found that the ground had been over watered and become really muddy which hampered our three quarters and our pattern of play. Why we requested the schools association for a neutral venue for the final is because we dont want undergo that experience for a third successive time. We dont want to fall into the same trap again.
Meanwhile the Daily News reliably learns that the schools knockout final could be moved to Kandy and played at either the Nittawela or Bogambara stadium.
