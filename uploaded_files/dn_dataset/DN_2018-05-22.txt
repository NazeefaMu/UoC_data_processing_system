Adapt new technology or perish
Companies and service providers should move with new technology or they will be left behind and would be a part of history.
This sentiment was expressed by new CEO IFS, Darren Roos making a presentation at their World congress recently. He said that the classical example for this is the London Black taxi against Uber taxi.
Its not the price that made the difference but the service and the connectivity.
He said that when a person orders a London taxi he has to give several follow up calls giving the location to connect with the cab driver. The customer also does not know how much he has to pay in advance and has to carry hard cash to pay.
However in the case of Uber the driver not only finds the location, gives an estimate for the drop off point and also takes the money from the credit card and even goes to the extent of giving a receipt. Hence Uber provided a different experience and it became a hit.
This proves that its not the voice that gets a customer closer but its technology.
Darren joined IFS from SAP where he led the companys cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) business. Hes previously held leadership and board positions at Software AG. He will continue to be an independent, non-executive Board Director for Micro Focus International.
Darren brings significant experience and skills in building global software business to IFS. He has earned a reputation as a customer advocate, industry thought leader and cloud expert, with a track-record and ability to consistently deliver results.
Roos said that IFS they invented and launched Applications 10, the new version of its enterprise applications suite to enable companies to embrace with new technology.
This was built to help customers capitalize on disruptive industry trends such as automation, connected devices (IoT), and servitization and this new version helps companies connect their business to a digital backbone, IFS CEO Roos said.
The new core version has been developed in close collaboration with our customers and brings to the market a vast amount of innovation that will ensure maximum business value from day one.

New to IFS Applications 10 are, IFS Aurena, (A state-of-the-art browser-based user experience that offer users an intuitive interface.) AI/human-machine interaction, (Drawing on artificial intelligence (AI) technology, IFS Applications 10 features the IFS Aurena Bot that empowers users to interact with the system via voice or textual input in an intuitive and efficient way.) Service-centric capabilities, (IFS Applications 10 includes major investments to support service-focused organizations, especially for manufacturers with service or aftermarket operations as well as service companies that need an integrated enterprise applications suite tailored to their business model) Demand-driven MRP DDMRP (This is an extension of traditional MRP that helps companies deal with todays challenges caused by short product lifecycles, long lead times and high demand variability) Manufacturing functionality, Enhancements for global business and Modern and cloud-friendly APIs.
IFS Applications 10 has already been implemented by five early adopter customers who have also provided feedback on the system. Representing a range of different industries and geographies, the early adopters are Chief Industries, Inc. (USA), Hexpol (Sweden), Portsmouth Aviation (UK), Volac (UK), and Valmont Industries (USA).
Meanwhile , Vice President GartnerPlummer delivering a captivating presentation at the IFS World Conference on whats next in an ever-transforming world said that, today business as usual is no longer an option and change to technology is a must.
He said it was IPhone which was one of the bigger players who changed technological landscape while Kodak Company could not adopt to change and perished. However Android came forward to challenge Apple and this technological competition helps customers to assess new technology.
He also identified Google, Amazon, Apple, Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook and Ali Baba payment platform as game changes in the world.
He said that Google went to the extent of introducing driverless cars while Ford had no clue to it until it was launched. He also cautioned not to be concerned about driverless cars and its technology as 95% of accidents happen by human error.
Plummer has over 35 years experience on a strategic, executive and state level in IT and computing. As Chief of Research for emerging trends at Daryl leads all research into cloud computing and is a primary analyst on business process management, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web.
He said that though most of the companies in the world are adopting to change heritage customers (Family owned Businesses) are still not looking at new technology and cloud comfortably. This is because they still value their privacy and think that adopting technology will give away their secrets which is a myth.
He said today there are several stores in USA which allows the customer to pick up merchandise and simply walk away from the store without any human intervention. They are billed from their special APP installed in their mobile. This Pick and Walk powered by IOT devices will be the future of shopping.
He said that by 2021, early adopter brands that re designing their web sites to support visual and voice search will increase digital commerce revenue by 30%.
By 2021 more than 50% of enterprises spend more on BOTS and CHAT BOTS creation than traditional mobile APP development, he said.
By 2021 40% of IT staff will be versatility holding multiple roles most of which will be business, rather than technology  related. Also in the same year he predicted that IoT Technology will be in 95% of electronics for new designs.
In another presentation, Director of IT at CDF Corporation, Alex Ivkovic, said that change for technology a must. Manufacturing companies have always been concerned that traditional enterprise software is slow and complex to install, often disrupting critical and time-sensitive operations during roll-out. This is wrong.
Headquartered in Plymouth, Mass., CDF Corporation is a global leader in semi-rigid and flexible liquid packaging for the chemical, petrochemical, cosmetic, food and beverage and industrial markets.
He said that manufacturing sector would be soon taken over by Robots and even today over 58% of manufactures in USA are using some kind of robotic technology. Globally the USA has the 7th most robots per 100, 000 employees (189) compared to world average of 74. Economics have calculated that over 50% US annual GDP growth is attributed to increase in innovation. Jobs will be taken by Robots but better jobs will be created for humans.

Dead in war must be commemorated
Parliamentarian Chandrasiri Gajadeera yesterday said people died on both side in the war and they must be commemorated regardless of which side in Sri Lanka they lived,
Gajadeera was addressing a press conference organised by the Socialist Alliance at the N.M. Perera Center in Borella yesterday.
The Parliamentarian said he saw nothing wrong in commemorating the war dead in the North or South. He said he was against commemorating the terrorists who tried to divide the country.
The government has no plans; the country needs a change in its economic policy, he said.
He said the government cannot control the nature. Throughout the history, the government has not taken proper action to mitigate calamities of the natural disasters, he said. The government needs national policies, but they do not have any today, Gajadeera said.

Equity bid to help Sunshine Holdings
Sunshine Holdings PLCs (A-(lka)/Stable) plan to bring in new equity of Rs 775 million from a private placement of shares should help the company deleverage and strengthen its balance sheet, Fitch Ratings says.
However, we expect Sunshines ratings to remain unchanged as the projected fall in net leverage will be insufficient to trigger an upgrade.
Sunshine used mostly debt in 2017 to fund a Rs. 2.9 billion purchase of an additional stake in its plantation business, which drove up leverage substantially.
We estimate that a successful private placement would see the companys net leverage improve to twice in the financial year ending March 2019.
Sunshines net leverage is defined as lease-adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR, including proportionate consolidation of Estate Management Services (Private) Limited, the holding company for the agriculture and consumer goods segments, Fitch said.
On May 17, 2018, Sunshine, through a stock-exchange filling, announced an issue of 11.9 million ordinary shares by way of a private placement to SBI Ven Holdings Pte Limited (SVH).
According to the public announcement, the proceeds will be used to reduce the companys net debt by partly repaying debt at the holding company, while maintaining any balance in term deposits.
Following this transaction, SVH will increase its stake in Sunshine to 18%, from 11%. Sunshine expects the share issue to be completed by end-June 2018 subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.

Realise Grama Shakthi goals
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday made a fervent appeal to all parties and sections to eschew political differences and join hands for the realisation of the objectives spelt out by the Grama Shakthi Janatha Vyaparaya (Peoples Movement).
He made this request when he attended the progress review meeting of the Grama Shakthi movement in Uva, held at the Badulla public library auditorium on May 21.

The President highlighted the importance of using that rainfall for agricultural development through proper management.

The President emphasized that all regional politicians should dedicate themselves towards the fulfillment of this objective.
Peoples representatives of all hues who attended this meeting assured the President of their unreserved support and assistance to ensure the success of the Grama Shakthi movement.

Initiated by the Department of Government Information and SLRC
Towards Democracy in Sri Lanka  documentary series  to be launched
A documentary series titled Towards Democracy in Sri Lanka will be launched at the Department of Government Information (DGI) auditorium on May 24 at 3pm.
This documentry series was put together by the Department of Government Information (DGI) and Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC).
Democracy is a system of rule by laws and values backed by the contribution of individuals. In a democratic country, the rule of law protects the rights of citizens, maintains order, and limits the power of government. All citizens are equal under the law. The four main pillars Equity, representation, freedom and justice are vital for democracy. Sri Lanka is on a steady march achieving these goals.
During the last regime Sri Lanka witnessed an authoritarian practice, weakening of the rule of law due to centralization of power by the executive, shrinking of space for human rights and dissent and the exacerbation of the culture of impunity. Politicization of independent institutions and the lack of investigation and prosecution into serious human rights abuses were seen. The political interferences hindered the operations of various independent institutions that included the Human Rights Commission and National Police Commission. Thus they were unable to play a significant role in taking action against perpetrators. These developments resulted in brining a negative image on Sri Lanka in the face of international community.
A major concern relating to the Independence of the Judiciary was the impeachment of former Chief Justice by Parliament and the Executive disregarding the Supreme Court judgment and the Court of Appeal order and protests by Bar Association of Sri Lanka. Also the time witnessed several appointments made to the Superior Courts of individuals who were perceived as close to the Executive. Freedom of association and assembly were subject to severe threat. Attacks against journalists and the failure to address the impunity for crimes against journalists particularly those attacked and killed in the Northern and Eastern provinces was a failure. Similarly worrying trends of surveillance, intimidation and militarization, continued attacks against religious minorities and the inability or unwillingness to hold perpetrators to account for a range of rights violations have contributed to an apprehension among many at the prevailing culture of impunity and the states inaction, with concerns raised of the inability to reign in extremist forces.
Justification:
The situation with regard to democracy since January 2015 has seen a remarkable improvement under the leadership of President MaithreepalaSirisena and Prime Minister RanilWickremesinghe through the unity government. The government intention is to re-establish the lost democracy and it had various cardinal measures in this regard. However, it is not an easy thing to achieve democracy overnight as it is a continuous and time consuming process.
The benefits of democracy are not a short time that people can feel or see but it has a long time impact and benefits for the people. With the change of government in January 2015 and subsequent introduction of a few reforms, some structural changes and improvements are evident. For further developing the path towards democracy it is vital to educate and engage the public in the discourse. Thus SLRC and DGI along with the support of the Ministry of Mass Media are proposing a docu-drama series on democracy.

Almost 200 Games athletes,  officials seek Australia asylum
Sydney, Monday: Nearly 200 people who travelled to the Gold Coast for last month's Commonwealth Games have applied for asylum in Australia, an official said Monday.
Several participants from Africa vanished during the international event held on the east coast from April 4-15.
A handful of African athletes resurfaced and sought legal advice on how to apply for asylum last week after their Games visas expired on May 15, refugee advocates said at the time.
Some 205 competitors or support staff "are now lawfully in the country because they've applied for a visa of some type", Malisa Golightly from the Home Affairs Department told a parliamentary hearing in Canberra.
She said some 190 "have applied for a protection visa", while around 10 to 15 had sought other types of visa.
All remain in the country on bridging visas while their applications are assessed, Golightly said, without giving a time frame on when they will know if they are successful.
Some 50 others were also in Australia after their Games visas expired but had yet to get in touch with authorities or apply for another visa, Golightly said.
She added that even though they did not have a current visa, they could likewise seek asylum if they met the application criteria.
Golightly did not say where the competitors and officials were from, but they were previously reported to hail from Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. AFP

## Title: Asoka R. de Silva

Asoka R. de Silva
He was one of the best leg spinners Sri Lanka had in the eighties; later on he became one of the pioneer umpires in the elite panel. He was none other than Asoka R de Silva, the guy with a perpetual grin on his face who never showed even a semblance of a frown during the one hour interview I had with him in his office at the noisy Sri Lanka Cricket Headquarters.
At present he is the Manager Umpires development and coaching and has been in this position from 2016. I must thank Mohan de Silva, the Vice President, Sri Lanka Cricket for facilitating this interview.
Although Asoka was a product of Galle he started schooling at Embilipitiya Maha Vidyalaya, this was mainly due to his mother being a teacher and was prone to transfers. He thanked his mother for the discipline and good mannerisms which he possessed.
Eventually Asoka ended up at Isipathana Vidyalaya and in his last year in 1971 he was their best bowler. After leaving school Asoka Joined Moratuwa Sports Club and played Sara cricket in the company of Pemlal Fernando, Wirantha Fernando, Hemal Mendis and Priyantha Jayasekera. Seeking further honing to his career he joined Nomads and came under the watchful eyes of Dr Sarath Seneviratne who was a brilliant schoolboy cricketer at S. Thomas. Asoka mentioned that he learned the mental side of the game from the good doctor, this made him a well-rounded cricketer leading him to become the leading leg spin and top spin bowler in the country who was also no mug with the bat.
From 1976 to 1997 he joined NCC and captained that side in 88/89 and bagged all the silver ware on offer at the time. Asoka became the best bowler in 1984 his forte was nagging accuracy as a result of this he bowled line and length, he was also adept in using the crease.
The other side of his career saw him join Department Of Small Industries and then National and Grindlays Bank and finally at Nawaloka Group. He said he was indebted to Jayantha Dharmadasa and Upali Dharmadasa who gave him all the encouragement to further his cricketing ambitions. During Asokas tenure there and under his captaincy Nawaloka won the Mercantile championships in 1984.
Asoka came out on top at the interview held to select the Manager Development and Coaching by beating Sena Nandiweera, Gamini Dissanayake and Ravindra Kottachchi. He was in the ICC elite panel of umpires from 2000 to 2011. His debut as an International umpire was in 1999 in a ODI Sri Lanka vs Australians in Galle. Asoka had 50 Tests and 12 ODIs under his belt.
Other umpires whom he admired were David Shepherd, Steve Bucknor, Rudy Koetzen and Simon Taufel. Asoka also had a word of praise for our present elite panelist Kumar Dharmasena. Asoka noted that umpiring was much harder than as a player because they were under the scrutiny of 24 cameras going at 1000 frames per second in top matches, so one mistake by them would turn the match upside down. He also stressed the fact that top class umpires had less time to relax between matches since their schedule was much tighter. According to Asoka an umpire should be good in man management, team management and also teamwork since the on field umpire has to coordinate with his fellow umpire, TV Umpire and the 3rd and the 4th umpires as well as the Match Referee.
Asoka also indicated that when he tours as an umpire he feels like a total stranger in the sense, the surroundings, the people the grounds the spectators etc. As an umpire one has to be totally unbiased, cool calm and collected.
Umpires in general gets a snarl or two from pace bowlers when their appeals are turned down or be given wides or no balls when they think that they are within limits. Asoka recalled one such incident when Andrew Nell bounced repeatedly at Jacob Oram who was defending stoutly to save a Test match, he was batting with the last man in. Oram was hell bent on getting to the other end, but Nell was bowling absurdly wide and too high and Asoka had to reprimand him and Nell retaliated by snatching the cap from Asoka and came out with some choice Afrikaner filth which Asoka could not decipher fortunately and he was duly reported to the Match Referee Clive Lloyd and was reprimanded.
Asoka made it clear that the on field umpires and the third umpire are paid twice as much as a top class Test player and the 4th umpire is paid half of that amount.

Avirat takes on Garments without Guilt
Avirat - an international fashion brand owned by Timex Garments is making waves yet again for achieving the Garments without Guilt certification- a first for a Sri Lankan Retail Brand.
Back in August of 2017, Avirat stirred things up in the retail industry with the launch of the first ever Virtual Mirror in Sri Lanka- a high tech mirror that allows customers to try on in-store garments without having to undo a single button.
Followed by the launch of an Omnichannel in their Flagship Store to provide customers with a seamlessly integrated shopping experience whether they are shopping online from a desktop or mobile device or physically at the store.
Furthering their efforts in redefining the in-store shopping experience in Sri Lanka, Avirat launched their 3D Virtual Store a 24-hour open virtual walkthrough that allows customers to walk through the Flagship Store and purchase items straight from the comfort of their homes. Avirat recently has shifted its focus towards Garments without Guilt, aninitiative launched by Sri Lankas Apparel Manufacturers, who came together through the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF).
The intention behind this initiative is to make the Made in Sri Lanka label synonymous with not only quality and reliability but also social and environmental accountability. The initiative promotes the need for positive and ethical working conditions among the garment factory workers in the country and educates the global fashion community of the positive steps taken to uplift environment and labour force conditions in Sri Lanka.
Following this initiative, Timex Garments (Pvt) Ltd - an apparel designer, manufacturer and exporter of womens garments,an active member of JAAFand the sole manufacturer of Avirat garments - was quick to follow suit and implement systems that ensured that all factories operating under them adhered to the key requirements needed to achieve the Garments without Guilt certification.

Fernando and Hugh Nevilles manuscripts from the 19th century. She demonstrated the songs Singale Nona, Chikothi, Coran Janita, Yaman Sel and a few more on Piano with her husband Hemal on vocals accompanying Bongo.
Shihan continued to present on the Portuguese colonial legacy;Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandras definition of Kaffirinha; the Kaffirinha dancers in the 1950s; Manhas of the Kafirrs of Sirambiyadiya; Vaada Baila of Sri Lanka and the music of Wally Bastianz: Lankawata baila gena Wally Bastien, Baila walin rata hollapu baila champion...//.
Baila is not an import from Portugal. Baila is a new genre of music, composed in Sri Lanka. Baila conveys a new postcolonial identity says Shihan, concluding her lecture demonstration and the audience were invited for any questions.
An impressive collection of information gathered by Baila lovers who joined Shihan andHemalin singing Ran Pota Thelambuwa at the closure.

Business school for the poor
The struggles of the poor are compounded by a lack of knowledge of English and poor educational achievements. The lack of proficiency in English keeps a whole class of people down. Its a recipe for social discontent and even expressions of violent dissent. Eleven years ago, three American women with no business training started BeadforLife, a fair trade organisation in Uganda that paid women living in poverty to make colourful earrings, necklaces and bracelets out of recycled paper
The title of this article might seem misleading at best if not strange. The background to it is a recent set utterance by the Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy. His comments were - absolute poverty in Sri Lanka is at a low level of 3.3 percent, which is based on a poverty line of US $1.30 per day. However, when you increase the poverty line to the US $2.50, which is less than Rs.400, more than a quarter of the population in Sri Lanka falls below the poverty line with earnings just above the US $1.30 per day.
Entrepreneurship is critical to transforming the livelihood of people in the rural sector who at the moment are trapped in low-productive and low-income livelihoods. He said rural entrepreneurship is key to get these masses beyond the income of US $2 per day while emphasising that the future of the economy is in the hands of the young entrepreneurs.
He noted that 60 percent of the population live in rural areas and 27 percent of the countrys population is employed in the agricultural sector, which only contributes to 7 percent of the economy.
Meanwhile, Dr. Coomaraswamy pointed out that despite various parties having numerous programmes to promote small and medium enterprise (SMEs), most of these programmes have not been successful as they remain fragmented while marketing remains the biggest challenge for SMEs, which has not been properly addressed in these programmes.
He noted that these programmes need to provide four types of support to SMEs, which includes; training with necessary skills, access to inputs and technology, access to finance and most importantly marketing in order to link up with rural, regional, national and international value chains.
In addition, he said these programmes need to provide continuous support for entrepreneurs, at least for two to three years to get their businesses off the ground.
Referring to Harvard research, he pointed out that Sri Lankas employment in the agriculture sector needs to decrease from the current 27 percent to 15 percent in order to reach the average of countries with economies on par with Sri Lanka.
When you look closely at his comments its clear we have a problem, with the bottom 25% of our population struggling. Several years back this writer sat as a Trustee of the Samurdhi Trust Fund which in theory is meant to help and uplift those affected by poverty.
The struggles of the poor are compounded by a lack of knowledge of English and poor educational achievements. The lack of proficiency in English keeps a whole class of people down. Its a recipe for social discontent and even expressions of violent dissent.
Eleven years ago, three American women with no business training started BeadforLife, a fair trade organisation in Uganda that paid women living in poverty to make colourful earrings, necklaces and bracelets out of recycled paper.
Entrepreneurship is the path out of poverty
As soon as a woman enrolled in the bead-making programme, she started getting trained to create a business that would be sustainable in the local economy. The programme was called Beads to Business -- something the founders thought of as transformational trade.
Follow-up studies show that 81 percent of these businesses have remained open after two years, compared to an 80 percent failure rate for businesses in Uganda as a whole.
Thats great news, of course, but Beads to Business ability to scale was limited: The number of women who could be enrolled in its education programme was limited by the volume of beads the organisation could sell.
After struggling with this challenge, the schools organizers realized that beads were merely a means to an end -- the physical manifestation of the work of empowering women and fighting against poverty. The school had gotten good at business training, and there was no reason that education had to be tied to beads alone.
Street Business School is born
This led to the birth of the Street Business School -- a mobile business school that delivers its powerful entrepreneurship curriculum to women who have never rolled a single bead for the organisation. The courses are delivered right in the communities where the women live and take place over a period of six months. In addition to classroom sessions, the new entrepreneurs get one-on-one coaching from BeadforLifes trainers, who visit their businesses several times to make sure the lessons are being applied.
As happened with Beads for Life and Beads to Business, success followed yet again, with the founding of Street Business School. But, still dissatisfied with the number of women being served, organisers determined to start a global expansion of the school.
Bunker Roy and the Barefoot College
Roys vision was to educate the local people who would then be able to use the skills and knowledge to raise themselves from poverty. The only pre-requisite for admission to the Barefoot College is that there are no pre-requisites, not even to speak the language.
Lessons Learnt:
Lesson 1
Any middle-aged illiterate woman from any part of the world who has never left her village can be trained in six months in India to be a competent and confident solar engineer.
Lesson 2
Prepare the community first by involving them in taking major decisions on behalf of the whole community and only then bring in the technology in the village. This will reduce the dependency on urban skills from outside. It will also give a sense of ownership.
Lesson 3
Keep all urban-based paper qualified solar engineers away from the inaccessible non-electrified village because their top-down approach is doomed to fail. They have neither the vision nor the courage nor the faith to select and train illiterate women as engineers. They also do not have the communication tools to speak as equal to poor communities.
Lesson 4
What makes the barefoot approach fundamentally different is that NO certificates, diplomas or degrees are issued after training to the women. The certification is done by the community they serve. The issuing of certificates is one major reason why migration takes places from the villages to the cities.
Lesson 5
To reach the very poor only a Partnership Model will work. Where providing the hardware is the responsibility of governments/donors and the repair and maintenance is the responsibility of the poor rural communities.
The barefoot approach has worked in three continents, 17 countries and over 100 villages across the globe. Between 2005-2008, the total amount spent has been close to $ 2 million. Less than what is being wasted on ONE Millennium Village in one country in Africa.
The narrative of poverty reduction in Sri Lanka is a graveyard of not so successful efforts extending decades. The narrative and approaches have to change. This article has shown two examples of how to potentially address the issues. We quite simply cannot afford to leave people behind.

The Cabinet of Ministers approved to increase bus fares by 12.5 percent a short while ago.

Accordingly the minimum fare will hike from Rs. 10 to Rs. 12.

Earlier this month the Cabinet of Ministers approved to only increase bus fares by 6.56 percent due to the recent fuel price hike.

But taking into account the Lanka Private Bus Owners demands to furtherincrease bus fares (to increase the minimum fare to Rs. 15), the government decided to hike bus fares only by 12.5 percent.

A proposal to supply fuel to members of the fisheries industry at the previous price under a subsidy scheme will be submitted to Cabinet at its meeting today, in the form of a Cabinet memorandum by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa.
The memorandum is submitted in respect of fishermen using both kerosene and diesel for their boats.
There are a total of 4532 multi day boats and 897 one day boats using diesel and 24,850 one day boats with small nets using Kerosene. Under the previous Cabinet memorandum submitted by the Fisheries Minister, Rs.4 billion was allocated to provide the kerosene subsidy for one day boats.
Following the displeasure shown by fishermen towards this subsidy the Fisheries Minister along with State and Deputy Ministers and the Director General of the Fisheries Department commenced discussions with the representatives of fisheries unions.
At these discussions the fisheries representatives demanded that fuel be supplied at the previous price. They also objected to the proposal to credit the subsidy to the bank accounts of fishermen.
Fisheries Department Director General Prasanna Ginige said his department has taken steps to provide a fair and just solution to this problem and the result is the Cabinet memorandum submitted by the Minister.

Dayasiris dream
The 16 SLFP ministers and state/deputy ministers who quit the unity government following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are to meet former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tomorrow, it is being widely reported. According Dayasiri Jayasekera who was in the forefront in the campaign to oust the Premier their discussions with Rajapaksa will be centred on exploring the possibility of the SLFP and the pohottuwa working together in unison under a common programme with a view to capturing power. They were also planning to meet leaders of other political parties within the pohottuwa such as Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and also D.E.W. Gunasekera in furtherance of this strategy. Jayasekera also said: meeting the former President is part of our attempt to forge a broad coalition of progressive forces.
Those who have been observing the conduct of these 16 SLFPers during the three and half years they were in the government would find nothing extraordinary in them meeting Rajapaksa. They had been honeymooning with the Rajapaksas all along and now it is time for the grand homecoming. Nay, people like Susil Premajayantha and John Seneviratne were openly supporting the former ruling clan while Dayasiri Jayasekera was seen in the company of Rajapaksa at temple ceremonies. All this while remaining in the government, holding ministerial office and enjoying the perks and privileges that go with it.
This playing of footsie with the Joint Opposition had to come to an end sometime and the results of the local government election propelled them out of this hide and seek game to take a more open stance in a move pregnant with sheer opportunism.
But many questions remain unanswered in Jayasekeras bid to unite the SLFP and the pohottuwa to grab state power. Both, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake have unequivocally stated that President Maithripala Sirisena will be the SLFPs Presidential candidate in 2020. The President too has more than hinted that he will stand for re-election. On the other hand Mahinda Rajapaksa, it was, who led the pohottuwa to victory against both the UNP and the SLFP of which President Sirisena holds the leadership, on February 10. Rajapaksa though is disqualified from holding Presidential office and if the SLFP and the pohottuwa is to unite will have to remain under President Sirisenas command as the leader of the SLFP.
The former President has already openly stated that he has embarked on a different journey api venema gamanak aramba karalie thiyenne implying that the pohottuwa, under his de-facto leadership has come to stay and will be an entity separate from the SLFP. One has to give-in to the other if Jayasekeras project is to work.
But will it work under the present scenario To begin with, corruption cases against the Rajapaksa family members are now being pursued in earnest. The setting up of the special courts for the speedy disposal of cases involving serious acts of financial crime is a good indicator. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera on Sunday listed out in detail the alleged corrupt acts of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, as Defence Secretary.
Will Mahinda Rajapaksa agree to play second fiddle to President Sirisena if the SLFP and pohottuwa unite as is the intention of Jayasekera Equally, will President Sirisena agree to drop all the charges against the Rajapaksas in the quest for unity of both factions For, Jayasekera can bet his last penny that the Rajapaksas will want their names cleared before agreeing to any such rapprochement.
President Sirisena is also on record saying that he would have been six feet under terra firma had the Presidential election results on January 8 been different, clearly implying that he would have been a goner had Mahinda Rajapaksa won the election. How will he (Sirisena) reconcile this just for the sake of unity Or has Jayasekera got everything cut and dried for the grand union Is he also of the opinion that Chandrika too will be amenable to this reunion and let bygones be bygones
True, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies in politics. They also say that politics is the art of the possible. Who would have ventured to suggest that CBK will one day join forces with Ranil Wickremesinghe to oust a Presidential candidate contesting from the very party her father founded.
But the odds here are heavily stacked against a makeup. For starters it is difficult to imagine either President Sirisena or Mahinda Rajapaksa to blink first. For there cannot be any reunion without either of them compromising. With Rajapaksa out of the equation in the Presidential bid it is next to impossible to imagine him working towards a Sirisena victory in 2020 - a man whom he accused of betraying him. Equally President Sirisena will not want to have any member of the Rajapaksa family close to him even in the remote possibility of unity, going by what he has already said about them with regard to his life. There can be no give and take under such a scenario.
Hence, Dayasiri Jayasekeras dream of a SLFP, pohottuwa unity will remain just that. A dream.

Dogs cuteness peak at eight weeks
Dogs appear most attractive to humans at roughly eight weeks, the point at which their mother weans them and leaves them to fend for themselves, a study has found.
There are around a billion dogs in the world, 80 per cent of whom are feral, said Clive Wynne, professor at Arizona State University in the US. For those dogs, human intervention is crucial to their survival.
Researchers wondered if there was a connection between pups weaning age - when they are at their most vulnerable - and their level of attractiveness to humans.
So he designed an experiment to test his query.
It came out exactly as Id hoped it would - that there is indeed an optimal age of maximum cuteness, and that age does line up pretty closely with the age at which mothers wean their pups, Wynne said.
This could be a signal coming through to us of how dogs have evolved to rely on human care. This could be dogs showing us how the bond between human and dog is not just something that we find immensely satisfying in our lives - but for them, its the absolute bedrock of their existence, he said.
Being able to connect with us, to find an emotional hook with us is what actually makes their lives possible, he added.
The study, published in Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions of People and Animals, was carried out using a series of photographs of puppies at different ages, from the first weeks of life through young adulthood.
Fifty-one participants were asked to rank the puppies level of attractiveness in each photo.
Three distinctive-looking breeds were ranked: Jack Russell terriers, cane corsos and white shepherds.
Results showed that the pups attractiveness was lowest at birth and increased to a maximum before 10 weeks of age before declining and then levelling off. Cane corsos showed a maximum attractiveness at 6.3 weeks of age; Jack Russell terriers showed a maximum attractiveness at 7.7 weeks of age; and white shepherds showed a maximum attractiveness at 8.3 weeks of age.
Around seven or eight weeks of age, just as their mother is getting sick of them and is going to kick them out of the den and theyre going to have to make their own way in life, at that age, that is exactly when they are most attractive to human beings, Wynne said.
The findings provide insight into the depth and origin of the relationship between humans and dogs, the oldest and most enduring of any human-animal relationship. Though humans and other animals, such as cats and birds, have the capacity to form strong bonds, dogs in particular are especially suited to the task because of their gregarious nature.
Even in hand-reared wolves, the species from which all dogs are descended, the willingness to engage humans does not match that of the domestic dog. The study doesnt mean to say that we stop loving our dogs past eight weeks, he said.
The eight-week point is just the point where the hook is biggest, the ability of the animal to grab our interest is strongest. But, having grabbed our interest, we continue to love them all their lives, he said.

A fhrer calls
In the crucible of chaos, there is a simulated search for a strong man - a fhrer - to take us to greatness, to preserve our culture, our values.
Hoopla is a European carnival game where competitors throw hoops around pegs. On Sunday, May 13, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa played hoopla at the Shangri-La. He put the hoop round the peg  the Presidential candidacy of the Pohottuwa party.
The hoopla at the Shangri-La two Sundays ago, suggested that there is a strong and substantial body of thought in our polity, firm in its conviction that we are in need of a strong man, a man of action, a man who delivers.
On May 13, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa delivered two messages. The first was to us  we the people. He defined our problem for us. He told us that we are too infantile to understand our problem. So, he explained what our problem was.
Our problem was structural. Structural problems called for structural solutions. He was kind enough to present the first-person plural point of view. We must make structural changes to the manner in which we think, to the manner in which we address basic economic issues, etc.
Now, you must remember that he defined the structure of the problem and offered us the structure of the solution. Now, what is the solution
Aha! Not so fast, my friends. Solutions will come after 2020 when I am on the saddle on the white stallion  the Presidency.
Right now, this is the viyath maga  the erudite way to place the bridle on the beast.
The second message was for his brother  the former President, who, restricted by the 19th Amendment, must propose a candidate for the Presidency to his undoubtedly sizeable constituency that awaits his counsel, caution, direction and instruction.
Look around you! Into this place that bears the brand and the name of the mythical kingdom of abundance and plenty - the Shangri-La - I have summoned the barons of industry, commerce and finance, the brave soldiers of the realm, the thought leaders of the motherland. Behold the sight. Digest how docile and attentive they are!
Make no mistake. Here is a man who has a clear and a tight grip of conceptual power. He knows the difference between the government and the state. The government changed hands. The state moves on. He knows how it works. He knows, because he once ran it single-handedly under the dispensation of his brother, Mahinda, who presided over a fractious government, listening to the smooth ticking of his watch, never quite realizing the full genius of his brother - the watchmaker.
At the Shangri-La on May 13, he discovered how the watchmaker assembled the intricate parts of the watch. And more! Mahinda heard the wake-up alarm.
The Shangri-La gathering was a prelude to the possibility of our society being subject to an oligarchic collectivism. The term was coined by George Orwell in his novel 1984.
It describes a society that was already in the making before it was rudely intercepted by the change on January 8, 2015.
Then the new rulers decided to open the vaults of the Central Bank and all hell broke out. Greed to carve out political territory, mismanagement and sheer imbecility in governance prevented the dismantling of the edifice that was in place.
In the preceding five years  the post-war years of development leaps and construction booms, government institutions, media and corporate interests moved under the control of a handful of individuals, linked together, collaborating to direct, regulate and benefit from each other and derive its share of profit, from the toil of the silent many - we the people.
It is all about control. It is control that this government lacks. Although the government changed, the state mechanics remained intact.
Mahinda Rajapaksas Presidency ended, but Gotabhayas shadow state persisted. It was cemented too deep. It held onto its group mind.
What we saw at the Shangri-La is a phenomenon  a modern-day Bonapartism. A determined man wants to replace the post-independence comprador class with post-2005 rent seekers, wealth extractors and wealth creators of exceptional talent.
They are distinguished by their willingness to serve the state. Mind you, they will serve the state, not the government. And you know who the state is.
The mainstream political parties have disintegrated into power-seeking, vote-gathering machines operated by political freebooters.
As Hannah Arendt has painstakingly explained in her elegantly insightful prose, totalitarian movements are possible wherever there are masses who for one reason or another have acquired the appetite for political organization.
That was the spectacle we watched at the Shangri-La on May 13. What we saw gathered in the hugely opulent, hugely accommodative epitome of luxury was a great flaccid body destitute of political education, almost inaccessible to ideas capable of ennobling action ready to listen to a new Pied Piper.
In our current context, we should pay heed to Hannah Arendt, one of the 20th centurys great intellects, who survived fascist tyranny and authored the classic political tract - Origins of Totalitarianism.
As Arendt explains, the masses are not held together by a consciousness of common interest. They do not have the capacity to either define their goals or articulate them.
The ambitious manipulator and strong man not only notices this reality, but takes into account their sheer numbers, stupidity and indifference as factors that make up the equation of total control.
This indifferent segment of our society has begun to wake up after the hoopla in the Shangri-La.
Those kapuwath kola UNPers and kapuwath nil SLFPers on both sides of the barricade waiting for the crumbs off the patronage table do not make or unmake regimes.
It is the party neutral, indifferent majority who bring about regime change. They alone constitute the majority that matters.
This has happened before in other lands. That it will happen here, is now a real possibility. There may arrive a day, when Parliament will wake up to discover its total and absolute disconnect with the great mass that is apathetic and indifferent.
Then, those in Parliament can go home with the assurance of the Strong Man that he will take upon himself the terrible and horrible responsibility for the conduct of public affairs in an orderly manner.
It is in that sure knowledge, that the merchant princes marked their presence in the front row at the hoopla at the Shangri-La.

Flu outbreak, result of unqualified Chief Epidemiologist - GMOA
The main reason for influenza reaching the epidemic level in the Southern Province is the appointment of a doctor without the relevant medical knowledge to the post of Chief Epidemiologist, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that controlling communicable diseases is the task of the Epidemiology Unit and thus far the post of the Chief Epidemiologist has been held by a qualified epidemiologist with required medical knowledge.
But for the first time in the Sri Lankan history, a doctor without the required medical knowledge has been appointed to this position.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA opposed this appointment and trade union action has already been taken by doctors against this appointment.
The doctors are not ready to follow the medical instructions given by a doctor who does not have the requisite knowledge. The influenza started to spread in the Southern Province one month ago, but nothing was done to control it, he said.
The Chief Epidemiologist kept mum when the media asked questions about the epidemic. Therefore myths and rumours started to circulate in the country. Now it is up to the parents and the school authorities to control the outbreak and prevent it from spreading all over the country.
The Epidemiology Unit and the Chief Epidemiologist is not ready to face any possible disease outbreak that could occur as a result of the present floods, he said.
The GMOA will extend its fullest cooperation towards controlling influenza and outbreak of any other disease, Dr. Aluthge added.

Tri-Service personnel have been deployed to provide immediate relief to those affected by the inclement weather experienced during the past few days.
The Army has deployed around 125 personnel and around 20 boats for rescue operations in the Ratnapura and Southern parts of the country.
Speaking to the Daily News, Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said 32 Army personnel and four boats had been deployed in the Ratnapura area to assist those affected by the bad weather.
In Kalutara, around 40 Army personnel have been deployed to the Palindanuwara area while around 20 Army personnel have been deployed for relief operations in the Bulathsinhala area.

GENE - ius!
A woman has revealed how she went from having one last blood relative to a family of over 100 people - after taking an 80 online DNA test.
Bronia Sandell, 58, from East Halton, Lincolnshire, took the test two years ago, as she was keen to track down her father - whose identity was kept from her growing up.
Bronia, a therapist, first found a match with a first cousin living in Minnesota, USA.
After linking up with him online, she discovered that, while her father had died, she had four siblings and hundreds of cousins  taking her relatives from one to over 100.
She said: It has been life changing.
I never thought that taking a simple DNA test online would finally uncover a side of my family that had been unknown to me for over 50 years.
Just 17 when she had Bronia in 1959, her mother married a local man when her baby was 18-months-old. After he adopted her, Bronia grew up thinking he was her father  only discovering the truth when she was nine and he stormed out of the house, after an argument with her mother.
She explained: He and my mother hit a bad spot and they eventually divorced.
They argued one evening when I was around nine-years-old. He stormed out of the house and I cried and said I wanted to go with Daddy, but Mum turned round and said he wasnt my father.
I asked who was and she just said she didnt know  brushing it under the carpet and never speaking about it again.
I always had a sense that I didnt belong to my family and we had a difficult relationship. I also sensed that I had siblings somewhere out there and used to wish they would come and rescue me.
It wasnt until she was in her mid-20s that Bronia started to ask more questions about her real dads identity.
She continued: I asked my grandmother and she told me that she thought my father was an American serviceman. She couldnt give me a lot of information, other than that my mother would go up to the base to the dances.
She told me that when I was born, some Americans came down and wanted to speak to my mother in private, but she never knew much more than that.
I couldnt see where I was going to get any more information.
My mother and I didnt have the greatest relationship and I just knew there was no point in asking, so I didnt push it any further.
Bronias mother died in 1995, leading her to believe that she had missed her chance to discover her fathers identity. Then, in late 2016, she found an advert online for a company called Ancestry DNA.
She said: I believed it all died with her. I remember walking away from the grave and thinking that was it.
Then, years later, I saw the online advert and told my husband Dennis, 71, I would just get one which would, hopefully, at least tell me I was American and answer that part of the mystery.
I didnt have particularly high hopes when I sent off the vial of my saliva, though. 
Six weeks later, Bronia received her results.
She said: It gives you a little pie chart and mine said 46 per cent British and the rest was Scandinavian, Western European, Russian, European Jewish and Native American.
I looked at it and I thought, It doesnt show anything about American. I think it is a lie.
But, the next screen showed matches with other people who had taken a test with the company and revealed that Bronia was matched with a full cousin. She said: It gives you the facility to contact that person, but it doesnt tell you where they are, so I Googled him  finding him in Minnesota.
Then I sent an email to him, asking if he happened to have an uncle who had served in the UK in around 1957/1958.
I didnt hear anything for about a month and had given up and then out of the blue, I got a reply.
He told me it was a shock and that my dad had passed away, but he was called Darryl. Then he said, Welcome to the family.
Told by her cousin that her father was called Darryl Haugen, she discovered that he had died in 2011.
She added: I asked if I had any siblings.
He explained that I did, but it was quite difficult. I discovered that my father was married and already had a child when he met my mother in the UK.
Within a fortnight, I found out I was one of five children. I was in such a state. It was such a rollercoaster. I was elated, but upset that so much time had passed. Bronia found out she had three brothers, from her fathers first marriage, who are still coming to terms with the news, but her sister, Colleen Haugen-Ortiz, now 28, was incredibly excited to discover she had a sister.
She said: I thought I had one living blood relative  an 88-year-old aunt, who lives in Norfolk  but, as well as my siblings, I discovered I had hundreds of cousins in the US, so I suddenly gained this huge family of over 100 people.
Keen to meet people face-to-face, Bronia and Dennis booked a trip to the USA to meet them at a huge family reunion in Wisconsin, last September. She explained: It meant I got to meet my sister for the first time. It was weird, because it felt like we had always known each other.Its so nice to go from being an only child and to sharing this incredible bond.
Now Colleen and Bronia talk almost every day and she is planning to come to the UK this summer to visit. Bronia, who is speaking out for World DNA Day on April 25, said: DNA tests are an opportunity to find out more about ourselves and make new connections with relatives we never knew existed.
Its been life changing. We dont think my father knew that I existed, but when I found all this out, I went to see my aunt in Norfolk, who believes that a chaplain from the base came while my mother was pregnant, to see if it was true. He said he was going to send the person who was responsible home. I wish I could have met him, but at least I now have the chance to make up for lost time with the family I never knew existed.

Hawaii volcano lava reaches ocean
US: Authorities in Hawaii have warned of dangerous laze fumes as molten lava from the erupting Kilauea volcano reached the Pacific Ocean.
Two lava flows reached the ocean along the southeast Puna coast overnight, on Hawaiis Big Island, the US Geological Survey, which monitors volcanoes and earthquakes worldwide, said in a statement Sunday.
A crack however opened in the ground under one of the lava channels, diverting the lava... into underground voids, the statement said.
When the hot lava flow hits the water it produces acid fumes known as laze - lava and haze.
The plume is an irritating mixture of hydrochloric acid gas (HCl), steam, and tiny volcanic glass particles, the USGS said.
This hot, corrosive gas mixture caused two deaths immediately adjacent to the coastal entry point in 2000, when seawater washed across recent and active lava flows. The USGS also warned that volcanic gas emissions have tripled as a result of the voluminous eruptions. Moderate winds means that areas downwind from the volcano may experience varying levels of vog, or volcanic smog, a haze created when emissions react to oxygen, moisture, dust, and sunlight, the USGS said.
One giant lava flow grew to 20 feet (six meters) in height and blocked a portion of Highway 137, seriously impacting area residents, Hawaii News Now reported.
Kilauea is the worlds most active volcano and one of five on Hawaiis Big Island.
It started erupting on May 3, prompting about 2,000 people to flee from their mountainside homes.
Scientists believe the volcanic activity may be a precursor to a major eruption similar to the one that shook the island in the mid-1920s.
But they say they expect no loss of life given that the most exposed residential areas have been evacuated and the region where the volcano is located -- on the southeastern part of the island -- is lightly populated.
Authorities have warned residents to stay away from the evacuated neighborhoods, warning that toxic sulfur dioxide seeping out of nearly two dozen fissures could prove deadly.

Hayleys, first listed company  to cross US$ 1 bn turnover
Hayleys PLC announced a record breaking top-line performance as revenue expanded by 47% Year-on-Year to Rs. 163.2 billion during the 12 months to 31st March 2018.
Supported by addition of 6 months of operations from its recently acquired subsidiary, Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC, the conclusion of the financial year marked two important milestones for the Hayleys Group, as it became the first listed entity in the country to surpass annual turnover of US$ 1 billion while celebrating its 140th year of business in Sri Lanka.
To page vDuring the year in review, the Hayleys Group made numerous bold new investments across the sectors which the diversified conglomerate operates in, with a view to repositioning its subsidiaries to capitalize on new growth opportunities over the medium-long term.
The Group posted strong operating profits which expanded by 18% YoY to Rs.11.4billion. However, increased borrowings, combined with the prevalence of higher interest rate conditions throughout the financial year resulted in net finance costs increasing to Rs. 5.93 billion, leading to a reduction in profit before tax (PBT) to Rs. 5.76 billion during the period in review
Commenting on the performance of the group over the past year, Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive, Mohan Pandithage commended the determined efforts of all of the groups subsidiaries in achieving the US$ 1 billion revenue milestone and outlined plans to leverage investments made during the period in review to generate new growth opportunities over the coming financial year.
At the outset, I wish to commend the strong performances across Hayleys which has enabled our group to emerge in its 140th year of operations as the first listed Sri Lankan entity to surpass the US$ 1 billion turnover milestone.
This is truly a remarkable milestone that serves to highlight the scale of our operations and the vital contributions that Hayleys continues to make as an engine of growth and innovation in the Sri Lankan economy.
I would also like to thank the Co- Chairman Dhammika Perera, the Board of Directors and the Group Management Committee in achieving this milestone.

Truth or Dare
Horror  horrible!
The story unfolds in Mexico as a teenager pulls over her vehicle and enters a wayside kiosk for cigarettes. The cashier puts on a strangely courteous face and poses a plain question: truth or dare The teenager reacts weirdly. She torches the shop. The next scene introduces another, the ingnue version of the former. Are they identical No, we are about to find out as the movie moves on.
The teenager of the opening scene is now an old woman named Giselle Hammond whereas the ingnue with short hair is Olivia Barron, a college student absorbed in some humanitarian mission. She is disturbed by her close buddy, Markie, and soon becomes a part of a partying gang. In all likelihood for a horror movie, the pack of friends soon runs into trouble. Venue: an old castle. Cause: a seemingly harmless game called Truth or Dare. Conditions: no lies, no feigned dare and no refusal. Consequences: death in the event of failure to abide by conditions.
That is quite the grist for the mill in terms of a horror movie. Yet what Truth or Dare offers to the viewer upon leaving the cinema hall is a daring doubt. And for that matter, one can conclude that the work is neither truthful nor daring.
A movie is the offshoot of an excellent teamwork. But everything collapses if the director and scriptwriter fall through in their job. Sadly that is the case with Jeff Wadlows Truth or Dare. With all horror elements present, the movie somehow fails to live up to its genre.
Horror is a prickly subject as old as Hollywood. It has offered a queer delight for generations. Suicide or possession-driven murder is becoming another keystone of the entertainment industry. This is where Jeff Wadlow, with his cartel of four screenwriters (including himself), seems to have missed something vital. Much better horror movies of a similar setting and theme have been produced in the Hollywood, Bollywood and Kollywood.
Horror movies deal with imagery quite a lot to generate creepy emotions. We are all too familiar with how an ordinary human face morphs into a scary one taking on a different hue, veins enlarged and eyes beginning to sparkle about to emit some ray. Now that distils some fear with advanced technological effects. But it is not so for Wadlow and his team. They take the lazy route. It takes some time for us to realise that the face of each character warped into a funny one is the dangerous game devil. Scary or not, we have to clinch the deal with that warped face halfway through. When the face of a character warps into funny lips and eyes, yes there goes the demon in possession. We are supposed to get scared of this funny-looking zombie now.
Forget horror. We are forced to digest many gory and ungainly scenes. The medical student pierces his eye with a pen and bangs his head on the head for a deep penetration. And next flows a pool of blood under the door. Why The game devil punishes him for having written a fake prescription or two. How that clumsy bit of a scene props up the plot, only Wadlow and his team would know.
Such scenes tiptoe forward with dullness. Yet thanks to that altruistic girl, Olivia, we are in for some adventure. Altruistic, puritan, and name all those words related to a Good Samaritan, Olivia deserves such a description. But then she has her dark secret too, which she dares not divulge to anyone. She deliberately chooses dare because she would not dare say the truth. Now her character syringes some brash spirit into the plot.
But her characterisation has gone haywire owing to the unnecessarily loaded characterisation of her associates. For instance, Brad is forced into the plot seemingly to support homosexuality. His sexual orientation does not go much far apart from confessing to his father and openly kissing another guy. In essence, it does not contribute much to the progress of the script.
Now, what has the viewer missed Or what have the scriptwriter and the director missed In this typical hero/heroine type plot, the so-called heroine emerges as a failure. She does not give the audience the thrill of beating the evil. All the good men end up dead. And the remaining pair, Olivia and Markie, cannot save the world. The audience is forced to leave in a depressed state of mind.
The intricate relationship between Olivia, Lucas and Markie could have been ideal for a drama classic. But then that opportunity is missed for the sake of a flunked out horror movie.
The challenge before a thriller movie director is heavier than that of his counterparts of romance, classic and drama. The horror thriller not only demands herculean imagination but an acute sense of visual effects. On the contrary, what you get to see in Truth or Dare is a bunch of vagrants in the guise of college students killed one by one on some clumsy ground.
Truth or Dare, for that matter, could stand a cut above the rest as just another daily low-budget film.

Indias ICT ranking could rise if smartphones are included
The new draft telecom policy released by the Department of Telecom is a lucid, comprehensive attempt that balances the present hard realities with the aspirations of the future. There is a wide base of population that needs to connect while the already connected want to climb up the technology ladder to stand at par with global advances.
The focus of the policy looks at Connect and Propel. That is how our telecom ecosystem exists. One of the six strategic objectives to be achieved through this policy guide by 2022 is to propel Indias rank on the International Telecom Unions Global ICT (Information and Communication Technology) Development Index in top 50 nations from its lowly 134th rank in 2017.
To make India advance in this global benchmarking framework, the government has to do more than putting impetus through a policy document. There is in fact a flaw in the present methodology that will always skew the results in favour of early adaptor nations of ICT. With the present framework, India can never rank high on this global benchmarking measure.
For countries like India, the mobile phone is the first and only computing device for a majority of the population. Todays smartphone is more powerful than the supercomputers of yesteryear. They have 2.7 Ghz clock rates and deca-core processors with 8 GB RAM -- something which even the most powerful computers a couple of decades ago did not have.
The point being made is that smartphones are no less capable in computing power and there is no reason to exclude them while gauging the ICT infrastructure and access of any country. There will be complexities like taking into account that many households have a PC as well as a smartphone, and in many families each member has at least one Smartphone.
Globally emerging economies led by India have to take up this matter with ITU and get the framework of ICT Development Index corrected for this aberration that may have arisen over a period of time. Much of this is going to hold true for nations in Africa, which are following us in the developmental cycle. The emergence of an overlapping category like smartified featurephone adds another dimension, which could merit to be as good as a rudimentary PC equivalent.

Its showtime!
Most films featured in the films have already travelled in many other film festivals. Kshitij, 28 and Serga Mathang are few such special attractions.
No matter how far the palm-held device has invaded our territory, the dark cinema hall continues to hold that special allure. With an unsealed paper bag of popcorn in hand, the fans slowly escape into the genre of their choice: action, thriller, horror, war, drama, epic and so on. That massive wide screen has kept the movie aficionados on the edge of the seat. That has never been replaceable.
The movie aficionados now have that once in a year opportunity to a cinematic indulgence with the SAARC Film Festival. With the input from eight countries of the organisation, the festival will commence on May 22 and last till May 26, for the eighth consecutive time at the Tharangani Cinema Hall as a collaboration of the National Film Corporation and the SAARC Cultural Centre.
Cultural imagination
The centre has forwarded a formal invitation to nominate films from each member state: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The festival hosts the cinematic works that display the cinematic imagination and the cultural expression of the South Asian Region with dramatic and diverse award-winning submissions from the SAARC Member States.
According to SAARC Cultural Centre Deputy Director (Programmes) Kishani Jayasinghe, the SAARC Film Festival is the most successful programme organised by the SAARC Cultural Centre. The festival hosts three categories of films: feature, short and master. The master films are the ones specifically nominated by the designated countries. The Centre has no involvement n the selection process.
The Festival will screen a minimum of 26 films with entrance free of charge. A masterclass will also be held in the middle of the festival with the participation of international experts on cinema.
Master class
In addition to the films being screened throughout the festival, a master class will also be held by three international experts on cinema: Paolo Bertolin, Han Sunhee and Amable Tikoy Aguiluz. They will offer their choice at the SAARC Film Awards Ceremony on May 27 at the National Film Corporation.
Dr Soumya Chavan, a visiting researcher, maintained that film festivals are an integral part of any culture.
Each film is a must watch. They offer knowledge and culture of the particular country. In India, film festivals are quite a popular element. About 1500 films are produced this year. And that has led the way to grand festivals.
Festival Consultant Danushka Gunatilaka offered insights on the role of producers. Although the role is confined to someone investing money in Sri Lanka, the producer has a wider role in the international platform. Most festivals bank on excellent producers. Of all the films, Wasanthe Obeysekaras Aganthukaya is the only 35-mm film.
Most films featured in the films have already travelled in many other film festivals. Kshitij, 28 and Serga Mathang are few such special attractions.
SAARC Cultural Centre Director Wasanthe Kotuwella emphasised on the need to have training workshops for budding filmmakers of Sri Lanka with the resource people from the member states. Kotuwella indicated that the festival will be held in remote areas the next time.

Lancashire hammer Durham in One-Day Cup
LONDON, Sunday : Lancashire opener Alex Davies hit his first one-day century to help his side hammer Durham by 192 runs on Sunday.
After losing their One-Day Cup opener to holders Nottinghamshire on Thursday, the Red Rose responded well, enjoying their biggest runs victory in this competition in 28 years. Davies (147) and Keaton Jennings (73) set the platform for the hosts 314-7.
Tom Bailey, Stephen Parry, Joe Mennie, Matt Parkinson and Liam Livingstone all took two scalps as Durham made 122.
Davies knock was Lancashire's highest-ever individual score at Old Trafford in one-day cricket - and their best against a fellow first-class county, beating Neil Fairbrother's 145 against Hampshire at Old Trafford in 1990.
Nottinghamshire suffered their first defeat as defending champions of the One-Day Cup, losing by 49 runs to Northamptonshire at Market Warsop.
Josh Cobb (78), Alex Wakely (72) and Adam Rossington (50) all contributed half-centuries as the the visitors posted a healthy 339-9. Notts lost regular wickets in their chase, although captain Steven Mullaney's 71 kept them in contention. But they ended up comfortably short, all out for 290 with 3.4 overs left.
Warwickshire captain Jeetan Patel took 4-33 and Sam Hain hit a ton as Warwickshire made it two One-Day Cup wins out of two against Yorkshire at Headingley.
After openers Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Adam Lyth put on 80 inside the first 12 overs, Yorkshire were reeled in when both went in the space of three balls, Che Pujara top-scoring with 73. Having limited the Tykes to 247-9, Hain then made a fine unbeaten 102. Jonathan Trott hit 50 as Warwicks made 248-5 to win with 25 balls to spare.
James Hildreth blasted a superb career-best 159 off just 125 balls as Somerset beat Glamorgan by 83 runs for their second One-Day Cup win. Hildreth, who was dropped on 63, smashed eight sixes and 13 fours as Somerset raced to 372-7.
Glamorgan were bowled out for 289 in reply, Colin Ingram top-scoring with 85 off 70, but rarely looked likely to threaten their target.
Paul Stirling struck 125 as Middlesex beat Kent by 70 runs to register their first One-Day Cup win of the summer.
Stirling's 115-ball knock, including 13 fours and five sixes, helped his side make 313-9 - as England white-ball captain Eoin Morgan chipped in with 50. Kent looked to be falling well short when they slipped to 159-6, with Tom Helm's 4-49 doing much of the damage. Heino Kuhn's 90 from 92 deliveries revived their hopes but, after he fell to Helm, they slipped to 243 all out.
Gloucestershire battled to a four-wicket win over Essex after a successful run chase in Bristol.
Gareth Roderick's unbeaten 87 from 89 balls saw the hosts pass their target of 288 with 11 balls to spare. Roderick added 79 for the fifth wicket alongside Ryan Higgins (47), after opener George Hankins had made 77.
Ashar Zaidi's 82 from 77 balls and a 50 from Ravi Bopara had given Essex hope as they posted a solid 287-7, but they were unable to halt Roderick's reply.

Mood for metal
Neurocracy are metal band whose metal journey is in its infancy but already have an awesome following due to their sensational music and spirit. Melodies speaks to Chathuranga Pitigala of Neurocracy who puts their success down to the fact that they are thick as theives and also because they are very talented.
I joined Neurocracy about two years ago. I was working at TNL and I was contacted by Gayan the lead guitarist and composer of Neurocracy who is incidentally a doctor in Ragama Hospital. He told me that they are looking for a drummer and if I would be interested in being that drummer From the first practice onwards I felt pretty good about the guys. They seemed very professional and organized and the music sounded brilliant! There was a real sense of camaraderie and brotherhood. It was pretty cool, said Pitigala.
The band have two main themes they touch on, which are the adverse effects of organized religion and politics. Currently it is probably more political than religious.
We are definitely a Metal band. More accurately we are a progressive death metal band. We are all very passionate about Metal. In regards to how I got into music, well music kind of discovered me. Music is the greatest escape there is, and it is also totally therapeutic. It is a language that transcends almost everything. There is a unique connection that music has with a person and with people. It is inspirational. Personally, I do it because I like to drum, listen to metal and play metal. It is something I am passionate about, explained Pitigala.
Neurocracy can never forget their loyal and devoted following. The fans have been with them right throughout, listening to their music.
So far the response from our fans has been pretty overwhelming. We have fans in places I have never anticipated about and that do surprise me. The first time I played for Neurocracy was in Gampaha. That was an awesome gig because the place was pretty packed. I am amazed at how quickly our band progressed in the music scene, especially in how we grew in such a short space of time. I guess its because despite being a new band, our members are pretty seasoned in the local scene. Our fans are enthusiastic and it is a pleasure to have such loyal fans. I regard that as a blessing and a privilege, and I feel the same way about being a part of this band, pointed out Pitigala.
Pitigala added that he does not really think there is a music industry in Sri Lanka, and that so far Neurocracy has so far received one radio interview and a few publications. Right now they have played three or four shows but their main focus is their upcoming album.
Our journey is only beginning. In addition to Metal we delve into a lot of other genres as well. As progressive Metal musicians we are exposed to a wide variety of outside influences. Our album has a few jazzy parts as well and then there are some Latin parts as well, at least as far as drums are concerned. I can say all of us to a great deal love exploring new ventures and influences, but our back bone and foundation will always be Metal, added Pitigala.
He pointed out that one of the main strengths of the band was that they are very balanced.
Overall I would say our band is very well balanced. Everyone is on the same page. Everyone works together in order to attain the goal of the group. I am so thankful that everyone is committed. We have no weak links in the chain. I am so humbled to be in this band where everyone is on the ball. Like any family, team or brotherhood we have disagreements every now and then, but 90 percent of the time we are working towards the same thing and everyone holds their weight which is really inspirational for me, explained Pitigala.
Gampaha will forever be etched in his memory as a milestone in his life. That was a memorable day and a memorable performance.
All our gigs are very important and special but for me what stands out is the Gampaha show. That was the first time I played in Gampaha. Then we played the Maelstrom Festival which was pretty big. The frontman of Rudra, a Singaporean band joined us. We got to share the stage with some pretty renowned musicians like Darkest Horizon from Germany and Court of Arms from Dubai, said Pitigala.
Neurocracy are very much in touch with the happenings in the country through their music. They are also very much in touch with their emotions.
We just focus on the music we love and we compose songs. But we are all very angry at the state of the country, the political situation and the civil unrest. There is a lot chaos occurring in the country at the moment, and many are willfully blind to it. So in a way we are channeling anger and frustration that into our music. At least I am where my drumming is concerned, stated Pitigala.
With an album coming out they are really making their presence felt in the music scene in Sri Lanka.
The journey for us is still at its infancy and we have not even put out our first album as yet. That will come out this year. Being able to work with my bandmates is a blessing. Every time I get on stage I am really surprised at how many people I see! So the audience has been really amazing. It makes me proud.
We are really ambitious and I am hoping we can put out another album like next year, because we are working on some new songs as well. The singles we have released are Anatomy of Skin and Freedom Fighter and we recently launched a music video for Totalitaria. Theres this one song coming up which is called Divine Massacre which will be really interesting and I think our fans are really going to like it. It is one of our most ambitious songs, explained Pitigala.
Pitigala truly loves being a Metalhead. It is who he is and it is his passion.
I am a fairly spiritual person so this is actually a journey for me. Sometimes life makes things happen and there is no organized structure really. I think sometimes it is just fate. Metal as a whole, as a concept and a culture, is like a religion to me, although that might not make sense for anyone who is not a Metalhead, summed up Pitigala.

National Export Strategy  for Cabinet nod soon - Malwatte
Sri Lankas exports in 2017 has grown by 15% to US$15.4 billion and the challenge would be to keep it going and further increasing it, said Indira Malwatte, Chairperson Export Development Board.
Now we have a challenge of increasing exports by 15% every year for a period of 20 years, she said addressing the launch of the 100th issue of the Sri Lanka Exporter Magazine recently in Colombo. Malwatte said the export target for 2018 has been set at US$ 17.8 billion.
The National Export Strategy which has been drawn up would be presented for Cabinet approval soon and it should be a national policy, she said. The Chairperson also made an appeal to exporters to make it happen because as a government they may not be able to continue certain things. The National Export Strategy was drawn up by consulting almost 600 stakeholders right from the North to South, East to the West with everyone possible, she said.
It is your strategy and we have to get this implemented for our country. Each time the Prime Minister speaks, he speaks about exports and FDIs. So it is a challenge for all of us to keep it going.
Malwatte said that they were very proud that as a result of the National Export Strategy which was drawn up, the Budget has approved Rs 1.2 billion for development outside the EDB budget to implement some of the proposals brought up in the National Export Strategy. She said her officials were already working on setting up a launching pad for boat builders in Weligama as part that initiative.
The EDB head said a market access program for productivity improvement and market development has been introduced and the Cabinet paper for this will be presented at the next Cabinet meeting. Malwatte here expressed optimism saying she did not envisage any issue for the approval of it. A matching grant of up to Rs five million for productivity improvement or market development programs of exporters has also been proposed.

NEW economic growth prospects among nations in Asia
On the threshold of another decade ending in the 21st century, countries around the world, particularly those of Asia, where large populations live and work, would like know where they are heading and what prospects are in coming decades. Each country and each generation, would like to know in particular, their would be socioeconomic conditions, prospects of employment and high income earnings in future, given the trends of new economic growth in various countries and in Sri Lanka. Will the future holds better prospects of material life and general living conditions.
This is a universal expectation of people in modern times. In particular among countries that had experience conflicts, wars and uncertain conditions these expectations are very ripe and potent. They generally expect better times and do engage in political activities with such thinking in mind and expect the governments or regimes that they change to deliver economic developments that bring out their rising expectations of better living and not economic stagnation and gloom. This essay is meant to focus of economic growth trends and prospects, well beyond 2020 and explore what can be expected in the Asian region and elsewhere in the world and what trends can bring change in the Asian region and elsewhere. Economic Growth and Development:
Economic Growth is defined as the rate at which the Gross Domestic Product, the GDP OF a country grows over time and economic development is the consciously planned efforts on the part of government and people and their agencies and organizations do in expectation of increasing the GDP. The GDP growth and its distribution is the ultimate outcome of any meaningful economic development. People expect the benefits of development to reach them in terms of better living conditions, employment and incomes and a wide range of goods and services. However countries in Asia numbering 51 show different rates of economic growth. of these countries can be categorised into three broad income classes; namely low income, middle income and high income levels.
The low income level countries are those with per capita GDP of U.S dollars up to 2,000, PPP terms, middle income countries are those with above US$ 2,000 up to US$ 7250, per capita GDP and the countries with per capita GDP above US$ 7,250 but below US$ 11,750 per capita as higher middle income countries and finally those countries above US4 11,750 per capita GDP as high income countries. Further in terms of economic growth the countries with growth rates ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 percent per annum of the GDP can be termed as low growing economies, while those with growth rates above 2.5 percent per annum up to about 7.5 percent as moderately growing economies while those achieving growth rates above 7.5 percent annually as rapidly growing economies.
As will be discussed in the following sections of this essay, what matters for a country to achieve a high income level, leading to sustainable high socio/ecominc progress with satisfying material comforts and living standards for its people is to maintain a sustainable stayed rate of economic growth, say 6.5 to 8.5 percent per annum over a decade, without discontinuity. It will then propel the economy to higher levels with a momentum that pushes the economy to a fundamental economic and social transformation and may be within a generation. As will be explained, there is some kind of magic in economic growth process in terms of its compounding effect.
It is really the momentum of the growth process present in the change of the economy, which shows as its compounding effect. To some extent countries like Japan and South Korea had demonstrated this, achieving high income status within a short period and joining the club of developed high income countries. Indeed they have shown the way as a few determined Asian nations, and now China and Vietnam appear to follow suit to become the miracle economies in East ASIA.
Economic growth and development.
Economic Growth is defined as a rate at which the Gross Domestic Product , GDP, grows overtime and economic development is then, the conscious efforts on the part of people and their government to facilitate the progressive growth of the economy, to satisfy, the peoples expectations and aspirations for better socioeconomic levels of life. It is for this people change governments and regimes and for nothing else. A steady increase of real GDP for many years, in sustained manner will render the country to attain the status of high incomes, for people, to enjoy material comforts, good education, health facilities and comfortable housing for all the people in the country.
Within such societies there emerge persons and groups who bring new innovations, inventions and new products and ideas that would push the economy to still higher levels with improvements, in a sustained manner, managing change, without major disruptions. Such societies promote fair play, justice and indeed spiritual values and generally bring out a better attitudes and manage state of affairs among people, communities and indeed among nations. On the other hand, when a high levels of anxiety .fear, and uncertainty of future, prevailing among people, due to slow economic growth and mismanagement on the part of government , those who are then driven by poverty and sense of deprivation would tend to go rebellious and violent on various issues, sacrificing thereby the avenues of dialogue and discussions to settling disputes. Democracy fails and violence in society emerges. In many situations it is the lack of steady development and satisfactory economic performance led by government and the failure of equitable distribution of benefits of any development, that is taking place, in the country, are factors that shed light on these crucial issues. This essay will focus of the nature and significance of GDP which is the bed rock of economic development in most situations, which countries face from to time.
GDP and its history
GDP as a single measure of a countrys economic performance in a given period, in terms of socio economic outcome, may appear as somewhat lopsided, as an overall measure of human progress in a given country. This because GDP as a measure, statistically constructed, is meant to be primarily, of physical measure, in value terms, of an economy, affecting the life of peoples in a particular year or period. GDP when estimated by the practitioners, indicates the availability of produced and traded goods and services in a countrys economy, in value terms, it is really a measure of value added, each year to the countrys economy, in income in real terms. In this respects it would be interesting to peep into history and see how this measure as a concept in economics came to be used.GDP as measure of overall economy is really the outcome of the inter; war years and the Depression of 1930s which affected the US and the other major economies very badly, throwing millions of people unemployed and industries closed due to lack of demand and disruption to trade and shipping.
Following these economic negatives, the U.S congress asked Simon Kuznet, the Russian born economist, to estimate the national income of USA in preceding four years, up to 1933.
It is reported that until he produced the estimate for 1933, no one had a clue to the extent of the damage of the depression to the US economy. During this period a British economist, John Menyard Keynes of Cambridge University, made a plea to collect systematic collection of statistics on production of military goods and civilian goods and showing its importance and proceeded to define the modern concept of GDP as the- sum of private consumption and investment and the government spending plus the country-s foreign trade.
As one could see it was a measure conceived during years of anxiety and fighting for survival, hence finer points economic evaluation of depreciation of capital stock and pollution other implicit negatives being overlooked. In 1950 Richard Stone, a follower of Keynes, was asked by United Nations to prepare a template for estimating GDP of a country and it followed the move towards adopting a uniform method of estimating GDP worldwide and enabling comparison between countries and making it more meaningful. Keynes writing his most famous work on economic theory, the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, spelt out the nature and significance of National Income of a country and explained how to manage it to be steady and growing without running into depressions and mass unemployment. His ideas came to be developed into what is called macro economic management and public policy which respectfully came to be known as Keynesian economics or Keynes in model of economic management, through aggregate demand management in the economy.
Thus GDP has emerged as the major measure of a countrys national economy, its production level of goods and its increase overtime, which is the economic growth of the country to determine, the level of production, employment, incomes and living standard of the people in the country.
Hence increasing the GDP became the most important goal of countries across the world, necessitating economic development, and engaging people, governments and business community to increase production of output of goods and services. What came to be known as economic strategies, policies, prescriptions and indeed what is today called good practices are all supposed to lead to, increase in the quantity and quality of output of the goods and services in a country and its distribution among people.
GDP as grand measure of a countrys economy and its composition came to formalised as an equation where Y = C I G M X, where Y is GDP, C is consumption, Is investment, G is government purchases off goods and services, M and X are imports and exports foreign trading balance in a given period. These various components in the GDP are taken as market values of all final goods and services produced in the country in a year and this grand measure remain generally accepted as the norm concept, measuring economies. However this concept GDP entails some criticisms which can be briefly reviewed as follows.
Some issues related to GDP concept.
The first criticism is related to its restricting to goods and services that are produced and traded and exclusion of non traded goods and services, ignoring a host of goods and services which are produced and consumed at household level without a market being involved ( trading being involved. This is particularly relevant in developing countries like Sri Lanka, where a range of economic activities like home gardening , cottage crafts, self help and housing keeping and domestic services, all of which are not traded but produced and consumed at house hold level.
Some of these are to found even in developed economies wherehouse keeping services including personal services can be substantial and involve resource uses. In recent times with digital communication and production involve several areas as, in use of Face book, Twitter, Wikipedia output, though all have lot of economic values are ignored as they are considered zero-price goods and not counted for estimating GDP. Recently economic researchers at MIT in U.S have estimated the welfare gain of free internet products like Wikipedia, estimated to add value to US economy by a factor of .74 percent annually and this can be substantial in future years.
Following this the Economist Journal claims that U.K economy should get an annual increase of about 0.7 percent to its GDP by this engagement. The rationale behind this proposition is that GDP should be made to reflect the benefit of digitization service products at house hold level and elsewhere. Further the conventional estimate of GDP ignores the variety of aspects of products as in branding and its contribution to welfare and use of resources.
It is pointed out that under the conventional method of estimation just one million pairs of shoes of same size and colour is equal to one million pairs of shoes of different sizes and colours and no account is made as regards consumer preferences and welfare effects on account of variety and quality.
Many other problems are related to price adjustments to remove inflationary impact. It has been pointed out that a US advisory committee headed by Michael Boskin of Stanford University, showing that missing the improvement of performance quality of new products like smart phones can create problems if only price changes are used. Qualitative changes tend to be gloss over in the estimation of values. Despite these deficiencies GDP is used to measure countries economic performance and status. Given the size of GDP of a country, annually measured in constant unit of money, in US dollars in PPP terms it then become easy to size a country and make inter-country comparisons and assessments.
The growth of GDP overtime and comparing with population growth rate is taken as a measure of changing living standards of the country, reflecting its economic performance over a period. GDP when divided by population is per-capita GDP and this is taken as readymade of measure of improving living standard, without taking distribution into serious consideration. These two measures, GDP growth rate and its per capita measure can then be compared with other countries for comparison and assessment.
Such comparisons are meaningful when the countries are of relatively of same size and had similar historical and political circumstances and facing different development challenges. If countrys economy is unable to grow overtime, then obviously, it would lead to stagnation, resulting in increased poverty, social degradation, frustration and conflicts among people and groups. Such a state of affairs when persists, particularly after conflicts and wars, need to change under stable political systems and change regime where necessary should be under a strong and reliable leadership, to promoting certainty, and clarity of purpose, and give correct direction. A countrys socio-economic progress and its status over time is, in the final analysis is how fast it is growing economically, compared to its own past records and in relation to other countries in the geographic region it is located.

Shades  of Blue  end is bittersweet
Jennifer Lopez has "mixed emotions" about walking away from her hit police drama Shades of Blue, because her character had really become a part of her.
The superstar has portrayed Detective Harlee Santos on TV since 2016, but last month, network bosses at NBC announced the upcoming third season would be its last.
Jennifer, who also executive produces the series, has now revealed she made the decision to end the show on a high because she is itching to "move on" to new projects.
"It's mixed emotions with it (Shades of Blue ending) because I haven't really done a character that I've stayed with for three years like that in the longest time...," she told breakfast show Today.
"This Harlee Santos really became a part of me for three years, and to let it go, and move on to do other things (was tough)."
J.Lo explains continuing with another season would have further delayed other ideas she's been eager to develop, so she had to make a choice.
"We have so many projects we put on hold during those three years (doing Shades of Blue)," she shared.
"Every time, we were like, 'Should we do another season...' and NBC were into it... and I was just like, 'I can't, I have to go do some other things.'"
Likening the move to her previous stint as a judge on American Idol, the singer/actress continued, "It's almost like when I was doing Idol, I was like, 'I have to go tour, I have to go (do other things)...' You know when it's time to move on."
Lopez, who is putting the finishing touches to her upcoming Spanish album, is also wrapping up her hugely successful Las Vegas concert residency, and she's excited for the next chapter of her career.
"I'm done with Vegas this year, I'm done with Shades this year," she said, "and moving on to a bunch of new projects that we have lined up over the next two years that I'm really excited about - and music, always music."
The final run of Shades of Blue, which will consist of 10 episodes, premieres in the U.S. in June. Music News

Incumbent president Sumathipala seeks another term
SLC elections: The same old faces to contest
Sri Lanka Cricket released the nominations received for the annual general meeting scheduled to be held on May 31.
Whether all the names received will be eligible to contest remains to be seen as there could be room for objections to be filed against candidates and if there are any an inquiry will be held to justify their participation.
The Elections Commission will receive any objection to proposed nominees/candidates by member clubs till 3 pm today (May 22).
What the nominations reveal is there are no new names surfacing to contest the main office-bearer posts but the same old faces who have been in and out of cricket administration over the years.
For the post of president for instance incumbent president Thilanga Sumathipala is seeking another two-year term in office. Contesting along with him are Jayantha Dharmadasa, Mohan de Silva and Nishantha Ranatunga.
Dharmadasa and De Silva have been past presidents of Sri Lanka Cricket while Ranatunga was a past secretary who contested the post of president the last time and lost to Sumathipala. This years elections could also see a similar confrontation between the two.
What is so strange about the nominations is that there are three candidates contesting for three posts which in all probability the five-member Election Committee might disallow.
Mohan de Silva apart from contesting for the post of president is also coming forward for the post of vice president as well as secretary.
Shammi Silva who is contesting the post of vice president is also coming forward for the posts of secretary and treasurer, and Bandula Dissanayake who is contesting the post of secretary is also coming forward to contest the posts of assistant secretary and treasurer. Contesting for the assistant secretarys post is incumbent assistant secretary Ravin Wickremaratne against whom there are allegations of fixing the Premier Division I cricket match between Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC. All current office bearers are coming forward to contest and win another term.

A kiss is a lovely trick, designed by nature, to stop words when speech becomes superfluous. - Ingrid Bergmen

A smooch on the cheek, when executed properly is usually between family, friends, relatives or couples that have been together a long time.
Also, grandmas and aunts like this kind of buss which is a form of filial affection. Ok, but when is a kiss not technically a kiss That is when two people lean in close near each others face and make a kissing noise but dont actually make contact. This is reserved for annoying friends and acquaintances considered too gross to greet with a smack on the cheek.
And when we kiss someone from above such as kissing their forehead - its a symbol for patronage and protection. Thats why we can see it in situations where one side comforts and supports the other. Very much like a parent soothing a distressed child.
The whole thing can be deucedly awkward for the uninitiated. It occurs mostly when one person swings his or her head then tries to anticipate the reaction. The next step is crucial because one has to carefully lean in and execute a kiss on the perfect spot of the cheek.
And remember it should be not too near the eye, ear or nose by being careful to signal this is not a romantic advance. But accidents can happen especially when one will misidentify which cheek the other is heading for and oops! There will bound to be a near kiss on the kisser.
It can happen to us all, this type of uncoordinated misconnection. And sometimes you can be quite lucky when the kiss goes awry and you start puckering your lips while you kiss thin air. Thats what is known as the accidental kiss and miss.
My childhood friend Malka explains with clarity what happened to her once when this guy tried to kiss her cheek. I offered him my cheek but we went in opposite directions and Blamo! Actually you can avoid this type of mishap by moving your face far to the side signifying a kiss on the cheek. But make sure you avoid the face collision which is also in the family of the accidental kiss, only this smooch is intended.
The collision kiss happens when one or both of the people miscalculate the angle and noses collide or you get a jaw in your eye socket or teeth clack together like Spanish castanets. Whatever face parts manage to get in the way, this kiss is never fun. It can even be painful. There is another type of accidental kiss I shall describe. It relates to this exasperating Asian journalist named Sammy Jacks about who I once wrote an entire column which was neither flattering nor charitable.
Agreed, Sammy used to enjoy his tipple in excess. He now confines his drinks to a modest couple following a monumental binge in which he made a proper jackass of himself. Sammy was so sloshed that he lost his bearings while seated on a barstool in the Hong Kong Press club between a hulking bald-headed male New Zealand editor and a comely woman feature writer he fancied.
Completely sloshed and disorientated, he stood tiptoe on the bar foot-rail and planted a wet, frothy smooch on the bald napper of the male editor. Which simply goes prove that when you are off target, a miss is as good as a mister
A former British colleague, Tom Kennedy once described an accidental buss with his characteristic wit and elegant prose: I was at a wedding reception when a woman with whom I had a very friendly but entirely platonic relationship leaned in to kiss me on the cheek. I zigged when I should have zagged and we smacked right on the lips.
In our mutual awkwardness, and without a word, we tried again to get it right. This time I zagged when I should have zigged. Awkwardness increased tenfold. This was in front of a significant crowd comprising lots or friends. Of course, I should have said something cool like, Im sorry, that was unintended and completely my fault.
We have ceremonial kisses, affectionate kisses, clumsy off target air kisses, Judas kisses, kisses of death and at least in fairytales, pecks that revive princesses. And talking of princesses heres another fascinating yarn from Tom who had worked on several British newspapers and spun this yarn which he had actually chronicled for his newspaper.
It was about Britains most blue-blooded male and the late Princess Diana on the brink of the royal marriage breakup. To keep up pretences at a fundraiser Charles moved in to plant a seemingly affectionate kiss on his wifes cheek.
Diana was having none of it. She made a point of ducking her head away at the last moment, leaving Charles to land the awkward smackeroo somewhere behind the Princesss ear.
But when she handed an award to Charles he committed yet another inexplicable faux pas  and forgot to kiss her. When he attempted to make up for the painful gaffe, returning to kiss Diana on the cheek, the Princess chose that moment to take her public revenge, leaving Prince Charles hanging with his puckered lips in the air.
And there was my good pal Dommie who always tried to curry favour with his affluent grandmother.
He never failed to pay her a birthday and Christmas visit. But he was so excited in her presence that he threw his arms around like a twirling windmill while approaching her with his falsetto voice hitting the high Cs. Screeching Graneeeeee he would begin his greeting smooches about six feet away all blowing fruitlessly in the air until he finally hit cheek target.
His siblings and cousins whispered that Dommie appeared to be playing Russian roulette with the family matriarch while firing more than a dozen kiss and miss blanks before finally scoring a single bulls-eye.

SMSPU to meet all religious leaders
The State Medical Students Parents Union {SMSPU} met several leading Buddhist Bhikkus and scheduled to meet all religious leaders.
But President Maithripala Sirisena, the Higher Education Minister and some other politicians have not given an opportunity for the union to meet them, State Medical Students Parents Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
He said the union informed Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera and Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera about the danger posed to the free education by the proposed Sir John Kotelawala Defence University Act (2017). This act violates human rights of Sri Lankans and militarises free education, he said.
The President may not be aware of the conspiracy in bringing in the new act. Prominent people who backed the SAITM are behind the issue. They try to get full advantage by bringing in the act. They tarnish the image of tri-forces while privatising the free education, he said.
We are against the private medical faculty to be opened inside the Batticaloa Campus. We do not need Muslim or Buddhist private medical faculties and fight against them.
We are against the Cabinet paper presented to recruit medical students with three simple passes to the medical faculty, he said.

The Spice Girls are reportedly set to release a tell-all documentary.
According to British newspaper The Sun, the girl group has taken inspiration from former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, who released his film As It Was at this year's Cannes Film Festival.
The film, directed by Charlie Lightening, details Gallaghers journey from his time with the indie rock group he co-fronted with his estranged brother Noel Gallagher, to his success as a solo artist.
Melanie Brown, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Chisholm are reportedly working on the explosive new project to hit cinemas in 2019.
And the former girl band has already signed on to voice characters in an animated superhero movie, according to the newspaper.
Brown recently confirmed all five women would be reuniting for a live tour, despite fashion designer Beckham previously shutting down tour talk
We are in the works of figuring the stuff out, the America's Got Talent judge explained. I dont want to say too much, but all five of us have signed with Simon Fuller. Its all very exciting. The Wannabe hitmakers, who split in 2000 but have reformed on numerous occasions, got fans excited earlier this year when they agreed to an unspecified 'reunion', and were all snapped together for the first time in years at Horners house.

Tribute to Prof. Siri Gunasinha: The poet who popularized free verse genre
Gunasinha was a novelist, revolutionary poet, literary critic, film director,painter, multilingual scholar, archaeologist and a make-up designer. He has done a great service to Sinhala literature and to other fields. Most critics, therefore, accept Gunasinha as a great literary man who has contributed much to the progress of Sinhala literature, towards the latter half of 20th century. This article expects to consider the service rendered by Gunasinha to enrich Sinhala poetry field. In 1949, he wrote a class of poem titled apasuwa which was published in the magazine named Aruna. Although Gunasinha has shown his abilities on various aspects in Sinhala literature, he became popular as a poet who hasgiven a new colour to Sinhala verse
Siri Gunasinha was one of the ablest Sinhala literati of Sri Lanka. He was born on February 15, 1925, at the remote village named Bulatkohupitiya in Ruwanwella. His father moved from Southern province to Ruwanwella for business activities. He got married and settled down in Ruwanwella.
The eldest son of the family was Siri Gunasinha.
Some relations of Gunasinhas father accompanied this child to Galle. He entered the Nagabodhi College in Akmeemana for his primary education. Later, this student was lucky enough to enter the Mahinda College in Galle. While Gunasinha was studying at the college, he attended to writing short stories and poems. In addition, this pupil showed his colours on painting. Guansinha became the first at the island-wide Pali examination held during this period. The College Principal E A Wijesooriya encouraged Gunasinha for higher education.
Having gone through the University Entrance Examination, Gunasinha entered the Colombo University in 1945. He selected Sanskrit as the main subject and got ready for an Honours degree. In addition, he learned Aryan subjects such as Pali, Sinhala and Buddhist Civilisation. In that era, Professor Gunapala Malalasekara was the head of Sanskrit Department. Gunasinha followed Malalasekaras character tremendously. This talented youth was able to obtain a first class division for his degree.
He received the scholarship which was to be conferred to the student who gained the highest marks of the Faculty of Oriental Languages. This capable student was recruited to the same university as an assistant lecturer. Within a short period, Gunasinha left for Sorbonne University in France to read for his PhD. Upon obtaining the doctorate, Gunasinha returned to Colombo University. He was later attached to Peradeniya University Sanskrit Department as a senior lecturer. In 1970, Gunasinha joined the Victoria University in Canada. Since then, Sri Lanka was deprived of his service.
Sinhala literature
Gunasinha was a novelist, revolutionary poet, literary critic, film director, painter, multilingual scholar, archaeologist and a make-up designer. He has done a great service to Sinhala literature and to other fields.
Most critics, therefore, accept Gunasinha as a great literary man who has contributed much to the progress of Sinhala literature, towards the latter half of 20th century. This article expects to consider the service rendered by Gunasinha to enrich Sinhala poetry field. In 1949, he wrote a class of poem titled apasuwa which was published in the magazine named Aruna. Although Gunasinha has shown his abilities on various aspects in Sinhala literature, he became popular as a poet who has given a new colour to Sinhala verse.
Actually speaking free verse system is not a new thing to Sinhala literature. Free verse system was introduced in a short story book of another famous Sinhala writer, G. B. Senanayake. In fact, Senanayake could be named as the first Sinhala writer who brought in free verse system to Sinhala literature. However, Gunasinha identified the free verse genre really and popularized it throughout the country. This poet for the first time in the history of Sinhala poetry literature composed a collection of poetry introducing the new style.
Poetic revolution
Gunasinhas book Mas Le Neti Eta which was written in 1956 is a landmark in the history and it affected a breakthrough in the conventional system of poetry in the country. With the introduction of Mas Le Neti Eta, Gunasinha became the most controversial poet of the day. At the same time, he became the pioneer of a new direction of Sinhala poem with this book. Gunasinha created a new era in the history of modern Sinhalese poetry. Really speaking, it was a revolution in the field of poetry. Many poets afterwards began to follow him.
After Mas Le Neti Eta, Gunasinha wrote three other poetry books. In 1958, Abinikmana was published. A few years later this poet composed Ratukekula (1962). After a considerable period, Alakamandawa (1998) was published. Out of these collections, Mas Le Neti Eta is the best. It created a poetic revolution in the field of poetry. There are significant new features in his work. Many modern Sinhala poets have imitated them.
The influence of Gunasinhas work on the successive generation and Sinhala poets is remarkable. Siri Gunasinhas poems are beneficial to those who are interested in modern Sinhala poetry.
Gunasinhas knowledge of Sanskrit, English and French Literature seems to have influenced his work. He gained the free verse form from French literature and subject matters from our own literature and foreign literature. As a result, foreign features, as well as local features, could be seen in his poems. Towards the end of the 19th Century, French poets like Malame, Walane, and Rimbor were very influential in French literature. They used symbolism in their creations. This symbolism influenced Gunasinha in his writings. In his all collections of poetry, western, as well as eastern influence, could be noticed.
This versatile artist passed away on May 24, 2017. His departure is a tremendous loss.

U.S. Department of Agriculture launches Rs. 2.2 bn Market-Oriented Dairy Project
The Rs. 2.2 billion program ($14.1 million) Market-Oriented Dairy project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was launched by the U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Ambassador Atul Keshap last week.
The Market-Oriented Dairy project will benefit more than 15,000 Sri Lankan farmers and will focus on the commercial sustainability of the dairy sector and the quality and safety of dairy products.
Activities funded through this Food for Progress Program will help small scale farmers strengthen livestock management capacity and adherence to quality and hygiene best practices, while expanding access to veterinary services, said Ambassador Keshap.
The project will enhance the capabilities of Sri Lankas dairy farmers and partners and is intended to lead to an average annual growth of 18% in milk production by 2022. During the course of the four-year project, milk production is expected to grow by 94% overall. Strengthening the dairy sector will also contribute significantly towards the national initiative of reaching self-sufficiency in dairy production.
Approximately 80% of the beneficiary farmers will receive a quality-based price premium for their milk. Additionally, participants will receive training to help them create sustainable and profitable businesses. The project will also facilitate financing and investment opportunities and provide support to the newly created All Island Dairy Association under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
Since 1956, the United States has been privileged to be a partner in helping develop Sri Lanka and over the past 60 years.
The launch is a 14 million dollar commitment (Rs.2.2 bn) builds on the significant investment that the United States has already made and that complements the efforts by Sri Lankas government and the private sector to help increase dairy production and modernize processing.
The United States Department of Agriculture will fund project work in the Northern, Northwestern, North Central, Eastern, Central, and Uva Provinces to directly benefit more than 15,000 small-scale and medium-scale Sri Lankan farmers.
This project is a sign of the strong bilateral partnership and deepening American engagement in Sri Lanka.

Wanted pro-poor policies
Last week the private passenger service omnibus owners had a windfall. They received more than they wished for. One owner Union asked only a 10 percent increase in fares. Another asked for 20 percent. Ultimately they received 12 percent. Now it is customary for unions to demand a higher percentage than they require under the circumstances for they are leaving some room for hard bargaining. It is a case of aiming at the moon to hit the church spire. Hence it is safe to conclude that 10 percent was more than they really expected out of their threatened action.
Working out the arithmetic of price increase we showed last week that even the six percent earlier prescribed by the authorities was quite sufficient. Then the owners demanded more and before sunrise the next day, lo and behold they got 11 percent as if by an act of providence. There as almost no bargaining.
The owners were not given a chance to strike for only then the Government could have gauged its strength. It was as if everything was pre-arranged according to which a nominal increase would be followed immediately by a huge increase when the case came before the Cabinet level. No outcry against inconveniencing the public and the denial of their right of movement as is usually done when even a small demonstration is held along roads. No tear gas and no water cannons or live bullets or hired thugs. It was entirely gentleman like. The deal was so peaceful, so quiet, so secretive.
This is a clear case in which the Government has openly taken the side of the owners against the commuting public. In earlier similar instances such increases were coupled with at least formal request to provide a better service. This time, even that practice was discontinued. It would be an interesting study to find out the ownership pattern of private passenger transport services. Perhaps the key to many a mystery would lie there.
Neo-liberal prescriptions
One has to compare this conduct of the Government with its conduct in the case of the SAITM issue or the petroleum workers strike. The first issue is yet to be resolved despite a formal agreed upon solution for the Government back-tracked and clings on to outworn dogmas. The solution to the second issue was after failing to succeed by strong arm tactics including the use of hired thugs to intimidate the strikers.
In any case, transport costs are too dear in the country. It is also the middlemen who benefit the most, especially in agriculture. The government should enter into transport activities without intransigently clinging on to worn out neo-liberal prescriptions.
Further, more than a third of the agricultural produce is wasted due to lack of proper storage and packing facilities. The problem has been identified for more than 50 years but still nothing is being done. Except for conferences and workshops held in star class hotels nothing tangible has been done on the ground to change this sad situation.
Sri Lanka is a country blessed with more than sufficient rainfall and there is no reason for it to suffer from drought if there is proper water management. Experts both foreign and local have drawn up river basin development projects that would also control regular floods but they are either kept in cold storage or truncated before implementation causing new adverse effects. Such is the fate of Kalu, Gin and Nilwala coordinated development project.
No government has chosen its priorities scientifically and rationally. They have always acted with electoral prospects and personal benefits in mind. Neither the present government nor its much acclaimed immediate predecessor is an exception.
Mega projects
The pro-employer or the pro-Mudalali bias is seen in most governmental actions. It is quite sympathetic to requests for price increases by business concerns, be they national or multinational.
There is another weakness of our politicians, especially the ruling ones. They have an obsession with mega projects and disdain for small and medium ones. Even if they want to erect a Buddha statue or prepare a festive cake they want to erect the worlds tallest statue or prepare the worlds largest festive cake with no regard to their cost and utility value. It so happens that larger the project the larger is the largesse that relevant authorities could get privately as santhosams, commissions etc. For example, even such projects as rainwater harvesting which can be done with local resources is not popularized. The Maldives is using rain water in a big way.
Some time ago there was a craze for drilling for underground water with its disastrous environmental consequences. Instead of it what is encouraged is mass scale production of bottled water. Production of bio-gas and bio-fuel could be easily carried out with the active participation of local residents by local government authorities.
Despite the ever flowing stream of rhetoric from the holy mouths of politicians promising to uplift the poor, no government has a rational programme for their uplift except for handing out few handouts which evaporate in no time given the high prices of essentials and lack of means of living. A clear example is the excess of indirect taxes over direct ones in the Government Budget which amounts to robbing the poor to pay the rich.
Given the precarious position of our debt ridden crisis hit economy it is a criminal offence to waste the poor mans money for a jumbo Cabinet and extra special perks for politicians and spend lavishly on unnecessary ego-building exercises and tamashas. The media is full of reports of such wastage of public funds but that is only the tip of the iceberg.
The talk of the town is that leaders who have insulated their lives from high cost of living are enjoying life as jolly good fellows and making money while the ordinary masses are getting fried by high living costs and the country is siding down to an abyss. It cannot be much far from the truth.

Referees Society refuses to assign officials
Wesley  College pays heavy price for hooliganism
The Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society (SLRRS) yesterday decided not to assign any referees for future matches involving Wesley College at any level of rugby.
The SLRSS said that their referee Dinka Peiris received threats from spectators after the second round inter-school league rugby match between Wesley and Royal played on Saturday at Longdon Place.
At the end of the match which Wesley lost by a point (17-18) a section of Wesley spectators behaved in an unruly manner setting upon last years Royal College league winning rugby captain Ovin Askey, who was present as an official of the Royal College team.
Earlier the match was stopped for about 15 minutes as referee Dinka Peiris wanted Wesley fans to step away from the fence during the second half. Nizam Jamaldeen, chairman of Sri Lanka Rugby Referees Society (SLRRS) said. We have decided to temporarily suspend assigning referees for Wesley matches.
SLRRS has also decided not to assign referees for any of Zahira or Maliyadeva College rugby matches due to similar incidents which took place in Maradana and Kurunegala last week.
We have requested the Schools Rugby Association to take a firm decision because as the head of the Referees Association I am liable for the safety of referees, Jamaldeen said.
Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association were holding a meeting yesterday with regard to incidents related to unruly behaviour of spectators at school matches.

Women  have more success with love  if they make the first move
A woman has a better chance of love if she makes the first move, according to a new survey by invite-only dating app The League.
The survey found one out of three successful heterosexual couples were initiated by the woman messaging first.
Data was collected from close to 100 couples in successful relationships on the app.
Taking it offline, women are also likely to initiate dates in the real world, explained dating expert Madeleine Mason in a report by The Independent.
Men rarely pursue women if they dont get some signal of interest, whether a smile, nod, flicking of hair, Mason told The Independent. Adding, It seems to be an innate behaviour in our DNA. It occurs across most societies. So it may not be so different in an online context.
The survey also found people in a good relationship tended to have a three-year age difference and almost 80 percent had the same level of education.
Mason stresses this information can help people find their true partner, but also acknowledges people have different ways of dealing with love.
Data helps to reflect on how one is in relation to that and whether there may be things you can change (i.e flakiness), but they are just numbers and do not apply to everyone so need to be taken with a certain pinch of salt,  she explained. The Scientist
