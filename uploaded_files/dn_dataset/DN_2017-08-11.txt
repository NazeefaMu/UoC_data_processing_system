CSSL to host Sri Lankas biggest-ever ICT event
The Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) has assembled an impressive line-up of speakers for the upcoming NITC 2017 (National IT Conference), which is being held in conjunction with the IFIP General Assembly and SEARCC Conference.
With around 100 prominent experts visiting Colombo for the international events, CSSL has taken the opportunity to draw on the significant pool of international talent to offer delegates unprecedented access to thought leaders from around the globe.
CSSL President Yasas Vishuddhi Abeywickrama is predicting record attendances at the combined events, eclipsing the 1,000 ICT professionals, researchers and academics who attended NITC last year.
Given the calibre of international speakers weve been able to attract and the significant opportunities to network and form valuable business connections, we expect this event to be a significant focus for the local ICT community, he said.
International speakers include: President of SEARCC and Adjunct Professor at the University of Queensland, Dr Nick Tate; Vice President of the British Computer Society, Professor Tom Crick of Cardiff Metropolitan University; IFIP IP3 Chair and former Australian Computer Society President, Brenda Aynsley; IFIP Vice President, Dr Yuko Murayama of Japan; Dr Gabriela Marin Raventos of the University of Costa Rica; Professor Kai Rannenberg of Goethe University in Frankfurt, and many more.
The five-day program includes the two-day NITC/SEARCC (South East Asian Regional Computer Confederation) conference on 14-15 September, preceded by three days of invitation-only meetings for the IFIP General Assembly, its various committees and SEARCC Executive Committee.
The confirmed guest list currently includes representatives from almost 50 nations so this is really an opportunity to showcase Sri Lankan ICT to the world, said Abeywickrama.
Weve scheduled several networking and social events such as the International ICT Gala Dinner and presentation of the CSSL Awards, SEARCC International Awards and International Schools Software Competition Awards, along with various lunches and morning, afternoon teas to give delegates numerous chances to connect with our international visitors, he said.
This is definitely going to be the biggest ICT event, in terms of the breadth and diversity of representation that Sri Lanka has even seen.
The Sri Lankan Government has been quick to recognise the significance of this opportunity with both the ICT Agency and Sri Lanka Tourism coming on board as partners.

Echoing laments of the Northern fishing population
Halting destructive fishing and improving livelihoods:
A policy seminar on Halting Destructive Fishing in the North, organised by the Universities of Jaffna, Colombo and Ruhuna and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), was held on July 14 in Jaffna. The seminar revealed the pervasive practices of destructive fishing in Northern waters, threatening the livelihoods of thousands of fishing households in the Northern coastal areas and the sustainability of marine and lagoon ecosystems.
Indian trawlers
The first session of the seminar was devoted to the long standing issue of Indian trawl intrusion into Sri Lankan waters and associated issues related to livelihood threats, ecosystem damage and the diverse strategies so far undertaken to deal with these issues. In Northern Sri Lanka, over 37,000 fishers operate over 11,650 boats, the majority of which are 18 feet FRP boats propelled by outboard engines of 8 to 25hp. Including post-harvest sector employment and dependents, about 200,000 people in the Northern Province are dependent on the sector. They dont stand
a chance against the 2500 odd 30-60 feet trawlers from Tamil Nadu propelled by 70-190 hp outboard engines. It was noted that, although several studies have been undertaken since 2010 to probe into various facets of the problem from different vantage points; fishers, the two governments, and ecosystem specialists, the state authorities of both countries have remained quite silent, while the northern Sri Lankan fishers have been vehemently protesting against poaching by the Indian fishers.
While the North was in turmoil, the Tamil Nadu government was hiding behind the Kachchativu Myth, for which even the local political actors in the North and the South, turned a blind eye. Two important issues in this regard were highlighted; the livelihood threat confronted by Northern Sri Lankan Fisheries and the serious damage to the Palk Bay ecosystem. It was revealed that the annual monetary loss due to resource smuggling and ecosystem degradation amounts to 4-7 billion rupees. However, the livelihood dimension appears to surpass all other dimensions of the issue, because the affected population has suffered 30 years of war and have lost their dear ones, property and other means of livelihood.
The cessation of war in 2009 has not led to any sizeable improvements in their livelihoods, because of intrusion of Indian trawlers into their waters three days a week and expropriate their resources. Furthermore, the state of under-development of the region fails to provide them with alternative income earning opportunities. There is widespread and crippling indebtedness affecting the fishing communities in the North.
Results of field studies carried out during 15 months in 2010 and 2011 with 162 fishers attached to Mathagal and Karainagar Fisheries Cooperative Societies in Jaffna, have revealed gear damage of Rs. 9 million caused by intruding Indian trawlers. Considering the fact that there are nearly 37,000 fishers in the North, one could imagine the colossal amount of losses suffered by these fishers. Moreover, studies on ecosystem health have shown that trawling the sea bottom of the Palk Bay waters has caused gigantic losses of marine life, browning the sea floor and making the trawling areas a dessert. The sea grass beds which provide the breeding places for an innumerable number of resources have disappeared leaving little life in the sea for the future generations. The Tamil Nadu Government, who has a prime responsibility of withdrawing its trawl fleet from intruding into Sri Lanka waters has done very little so far. It was pointed out that, although trawler buy back schemes, converting trawlers into deep sea vessels etc. were in the pipe line, nothing has gained momentum. While fisher-fisher dialogues appeared to have gained some headway during the early years of this decade, they too stopped for lack of support by the governments. Nevertheless, fisher-fisher dialogues were successful to the extent of recognising the livelihood dimension of the issue and the need to stop trawling, particularly conveying the predicament of the Northern fishing community to the Indian officials and public.
The moves by the Sri Lankan Navy in recent years to arrest the Tamil Nadu trawlers and confiscate fishing equipment was considered an important move in exerting pressure on the Tamil Nadu trawlers. It is also a reassuring sign to the Northern Sri Lankan fishers that their government is actually taking their problems seriously. Maintaining and possibly expanding deterrence is therefore an important part of moving forward.
The recently passed law to ban trawling was noted as the most important step taken recently towards resolving this issue. However, it would be nave to believe that Indian trawlers would withdraw overnight. The problem of Indian Trawl fishers is also an economic issue and affects the livelihoods of many. Thus enacting the trawl ban and expecting the Tamil Nadu Government to immediately withdraw the trawl fleet may not pay dividends, unless a trawl withdrawal plan is worked out jointly with the Tamil Nadu authorities.
Since Indo-Sri Lankan relations are currently on a record high, the priorities for both governments are in furthering trade and defence ties between the two countries. In this environment, although the fisheries conflict is probably the single biggest issue of contention, a full confrontation on the fisheries front is unlikely to take place. Deterrence therefore, needs to be combined with a broader strategy that asserts pressure at different levels to corner Tamil Nadu towards conversion or decommissioning of bottom trawlers. Raising the issue both by the Sri Lankan Government towards the Indian Government and the TNA towards Tamil Nadu would be strategic, given the political realities. Furthermore, the national consensus in Sri Lanka on the fisheries issue has to be strongly conveyed to Indian officials.
In this context, the Indian trawling issue being raised by the President and the TNA leadership to the highest levels of the Indian Government over the last two years, culminating in the high-level meeting between the Foreign and Fisheries Ministers of both countries and the formation of the Joint Working Group in November 2016, was an important step towards addressing the conflict. However, the actual outcome of this initiative will depend on the implementation of mechanisms such as joint patrolling by the Navy/Coast Guard of both countries and the speedy conversion and decommissioning of Tamil Nadu trawlers.
Destructive fishing and well-being
On the flip side of the coin, the trawl fleet in Sri Lanka is also seriously affected by the recent ban on trawling. In fact, this trawl fleet remained dormant for a long time since fishing permits were not issued to them. However, expansion of the intruding Indian trawl fleet in Sri Lankan waters saw the local fishers gradually reverting back to trawling, to which the Department of Fisheries turned a blind eye. The local trawl fleet of more than 300 small trawlers are now dispersed over four centres; Pesalai, Velvetithurai, Gurunagar and recently, Pallimunai. The local trawl fishers too would confront a serious livelihood crisis once the trawl ban law is enacted, as stated by the Tamil political actors present at the seminar. This is another issue needing serious attention.
Evidence from the NSF study on destructive fishing also showed that, the trawl intrusion issue and cessation of war has caused escalating conflicts in the north on another front; the pervasive use of environmentally unfriendly gear. Resource smuggling threatening the livelihoods coupled with lack of alternative employment opportunities made the lives of fishing populations very vulnerable, pushing them into poverty. In the absence of livelihood assets to cope with such vulnerabilities, fishers have fallen back on common property resources; the sea and the lagoons, and have used them intensively. While this would meet the needs of the resource users in the short run, the long run impact would be further degradation of resources, pushing people and their families further into the dumps of poverty.
Dynamiting of fish, wing nets with galvenized pipes, trawling, monofilament nets, brush-pile fisheries (use of cut mangrove branches as fish aggregating devices) and purse seining are on the rise and conflicts among different stakeholders are emerging, although they still remain latent. The first three techniques were identified as the most pervasive while dynamiting and the use of monofilament nets were considered as the most destructive. The incidence of the use of stake net has shown a 15-fold increase and trawling, a 60-fold increase from 2007 to 2015. Among the reasons given by fishers as to why they use such gear were, resource smuggling by Indian trawl fishers, rising fishing pressure (increasing entry into fisheries), lack of alternative employment and the persistence of high security zones. High income and relative ease of use were also pointed out as reasons for pervasive use of destructive gear. It is quite evident that destructive fishing would perpetuate destructive fishing binding fishers into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, poverty and ecosystem degradation. It was also highlighted at the seminar, the un-regulatory nature of technological change in fisheries in Sri Lanka, which fuels the use of environmentally unfriendly techniques. It was disclosed that, rather than specifying banned gear, it would be more effective in specifying what permitted gear are, in respect of ecosystem health.
Studies on well-being of the Northern fishing populations have shown that people rank social relationships, childrens education, basic needs and safety and security quite high among factors most affecting their well-being. The lament of the people is that Indian trawl intrusion, destructive fishing, poor educational facilities of children, drug trafficking and lack of security etc. have pushed them into a serious ill-being crisis. More than 40 percent of the people have stated that government assistance is not adequate in effectively addressing the ill-being factors and improving their livelihoods.
Way forward
The first fisher-fisher dialogue organised by ARIF (Alliance for the Release of Innocent Fishermen), took place way back in 2004 in Sri Lanka (called the goodwill mission), where Indian fishers agreed that trawling is bad and to stop four types of trawl techniques. It is now apparent that rather than a missed opportunity, it was the apathy of the governments to address this issue, which has now caused destruction, disorder and havoc in the North, some 13 years after such promising discussions. The governments, political parties and other interest groups have taken various positions, while the crux of the issue is sometimes forgotten, which is the human suffering and resource degradation. The tremendous indebtedness of the fishing community in the North and the weakening of their institutions such as fisheries co-operatives reflect a serious crisis that the fishing community is facing despite the war having ended eight years ago.
The escalation of the migrant fisher conflict in Mullaitivu in recent years, between local small scale fishers and new Mudalalis from the South who are far more capitalized, has not been addressed by the Fisheries Ministry. The escalation of such conflicts, including conflicts between the fishers in the various districts in the North due to the use of destructive methods, undermines the historic co-existence between local and migrant small scale fishers. Addressing such conflicts requires political will and a policy vision for fisheries co-management where local fisher co-operatives can play an important role.
Bringing in laws of various nature, banning trawling and strictly enforcing laws and prosecuting culprits will not be enough to stop people from slaughtering their resources. Rather, the socio-economic well-being of the fishing community needs to be addressed, which requires various kinds of assistance and credible forms of small scale fisheries development to these thousands of families depending on fisheries in the North.
The MPs who attended the seminar representing the Northern populations showed great interest in the issues and actively participated in the discussions. They thanked the organisers, especially the scientific community, for inviting them to the seminar and emphasised the need for such interaction which will pave way for better governance. They suggested the formation of an advisory and monitoring committee consisting of parliamentarians, researchers and the fishing communities, to continue the momentum gained in recent times to address fishing conflicts and fisheries development.
Needless to say, the political leadership have an important role in resolving the conflicts in the North and pull the fisher people out of the dumps of poverty and exclusion, while the scientific community can only provide them with appropriate policy inputs.

Egg scandal: 20 tainted tonnes sold in Denmark, food agency says

Twenty tonnes of insecticide-tainted eggs have been sold in Denmark, the country's food safety authority says.
The boiled and peeled eggs were mainly sold to cafeterias, cafes and catering firms, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said in a statement.
Denmark is the latest European country to discover eggs contaminated with fipronil in its food chain.
The insecticide can damage people's kidneys, liver and thyroid glands if eaten in large quantities.
However, the Danish food administration urged calm, saying the eggs bought by Dang Products posed no risk to human consumption.
"Samples analysed in the Netherlands show traces of fipronil in the eggs, but not as a health hazard,"the agency said[in Danish]. "Because the content is illegal, Dang Products must withdraw the eggs from their customers."
Twenty tonnes is the equivalent weight of two-and-a-half African elephants.
Denmark is believed to be the tenth country affected by the widening scandal, with Romania and Luxembourg among the latest to report finding contaminated products.
The majority of the eggs have originated from the Netherlands, but also from Belgium and Germany.
Romanian authorities said on Thursday that one tonne of liquid egg yolk contaminated with fipronil had been found in a warehouse in the west of the country.
The product was imported from Germany but had not been sold to consumers, food safety officials said.
It also emerged on Thursday that two managers at a Dutch company had been arrested during joint raids by Dutch and Belgian authorities.
The company - named as Chickfriend by local media - allegedly used fipronil at poultry farms, prosecutors in the Netherlands said.
Fipronil is banned from use in the food industry under EU rules.
In a statement, the prosecutors said investigators were also focused on a Belgian supplier, and another Dutch company "that colluded with the Belgian supplier".
They added: "They are suspected of putting public health in danger by supplying and using fipronil in pens containing egg-laying chickens."
Chickfriend, a poultry farm cleaning company, is yet to comment.
Investigators in Belgium have also carried out several raids and identified 26 people or companies as suspects.
Some 6,000 litres of "prohibited products" were seized in Belgium.
Egg sandwiches withdrawn in UK
In the UK, the Food Standards Agency now says about 700,000 eggs have been imported from potentially contaminated Dutch farms, up from an early estimate of 21,000,
But itsaidit was very unlikely that there was a risk to public health.
However, 11 products containing egg - including sandwiches and salads - have been withdrawn from supermarkets.
The Netherlands is Europe's biggest egg producer - and one of the largest exporters of eggs and egg products in the world.
Some 180 farms - which produce millions of eggs a week - have been temporarily shut down while further tests are carried out.
It is thought that fipronil was added to an allowable treatment for red mites.
The problem first surfaced earlier in August, when Aldiwithdrew all its eggs from salein Germany.
It has since emerged Belgian officials knew about the contamination in June, but did not make the information public because of a fraud investigation.
But Belgium has in turn accused the Dutch of knowing about the problem as far back as November 2016, which they deny.

An elephantine passion!
Sri Lanka has a long history of close human elephant association and these pachyderms are an important and integral part of its culture, society and religion. The Sri Lankan subspecies is the largest and also the darkest of the Asian elephants, with patches of depigmentation on its ears, face, trunk and belly.
Once found throughout the country, elephants in Sri Lanka are now being pushed into smaller areas as development activities clear forests and disrupt their ancient migratory routes. The shrinking of their habitat forces elephants into close quarters with humans which often leads to raiding of crops sometimes injuring people or causing death which leaves them vulnerable to retaliatory killings.
At a time, when the elephant population in Sri Lanka is rapidly falling a young activist is taking tremendous efforts to conserve this majestic mammal. Twenty three year old, Tharindu Muthukumarana a past student of Royal Institute, Nugegoda has written the book `The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants to make people understand this intelligent creature.
Elephants are fascinating creatures and are loved by people all over the world. As a wild life enthusiast, from my younger days I had a passion to learn about elephants. It lured me to learn and do research about them. I started collecting information and researching when I was twelve and now I have put them together in a book which I would like to share with other wildlife enthusiasts, Muthukumarana said.
Muthukumarana says both African and Asian elephants face massive threats from poaching, habitat loss and human-elephant conflict. The elephants on my book cover depict both species. The African elephant known as Satao was one of Kenyas largest elephants. He was always a target for poachers. Kenyan Wildlife Service monitored Sataos movements. Despite these efforts he was killed by poachers using a poisoned arrow, he said.
The Asian elephant was known as Parakrama alias Siyambalangamuwa tusker and lived in North Western Province. The locals protested accusing Parakrama had killed villager. During his translocation the truck he was on gave away blocking his respiratory system and he died. It is a tragedy to see the majestic animals face extinction, he added.
He believes that a sound knowledge of elephants, their ways, habits and family life will help people appreciate the elephant more. The future on the elephant considerably depends on man. The three major threats  illegal trafficking of elephants for ivory poaching, habitat loss and abuse are all created by humans. Thus solutions to these issues should be found through people who would understand them better and who are willing to take action to prevent their extinction, Muthukumarana said.
Creating awareness among diverse community is an important strategy. Modern day social network platforms play an important role in this. Through social media youth can be persuaded and prepared for conservation. We have had Ice Age, Stone Age and I believe future would be the age of conservation. If these gentle giants are to survive it is up to the people to care about them. I hope my book will reach a wider audience and create a passion about elephants in the reader, he added.
Elephants and human should co-exist. Both humans and elephants should benefit from each other. Government, non governmental organisations should work together to conserve this mammal and conservation strategies are an urgent need of the country, Muthukumarana added.
Tharindus book will be launched on Sunday, August 13 at 5 pm at Lighthouse at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, Colombo 7 commemorating World Elephant Day 2017. Chief Guest at the event will be Minister of Wildlife and Sustainable Development, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera while the keynote address will be delivered by Former, Director of Wildlife, Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya. Honourary address will be made by Managing Trustee of Biodiversity and Elephant Conservation Trust, Jayantha Jayewardene.

The Emirates FA Cup branded aircraft has made its way to the extensive Emirates A380 network, allowing fans from around the world to connect with the competition in a unique way.
The airline also took the coveted Emirates FA Cup trophy on its first-ever trip to Africa with a stop at the airlines Headquarters in Dubai in October 2016. The four day tour through Ghana and Kenya including visits to schools and training centres allowed thousands of football fans in Africa to get a little closer to the competition and gave them the opportunity to be photographed with the popular trophy. There are plans in place to extend the tour to take the Cup to even more cities on the Emirates network in the coming year.
The 2017/18 Emirates FA Cup tournament began on August 4 and saw 737 teams entering the competition and 185 extra-preliminary games taking place across the country. Last years competition involved more than 11,000 players from over 700 teams, playing in matches attended by over 1.8 million fans.
Sir Tim Clark, President of Emirates Airline said, "We remain incredibly proud to continue our role as the first ever title sponsor of such a prestigious and historic tournament. Emirates remains committed to the sport of football and its continued development. We look forward to the future of our partnership and helping to connect fans across the globe to one of the worlds most celebrated sports."
Mark Bullingham, FA Group Commercial Director added, We are delighted to be continuing our partnership with Emirates through to 2021. We look forward to continuing to work together to ensure the Emirates FA Cup remains the best loved and revered domestic cup competition in the world.

An exercise in futility
Our parliamentarians are about to be brought under a Code of Conduct, to make them behave themselves in the House, we are told. A draft of the Code of Conduct has been made ready which includes the inputs of both local and foreign experts, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told parliament on Wednesday. The Code of Conduct has been introduced to preserve the dignity and decorum of the House, as well as restore public trust in parliamentarians, the Speaker noted. He called on MPs to make their own proposals and suggestions for improvements, before the final draft is presented to parliament, at a future date.
It is not clear when this Code of Conduct will come into being. It is equally uncertain if a Code of Conduct is going to stall MPs from the Joint Opposition going their merry way, as at present. Especially, there is a lot at stake for the JO to keep things on the boil at the present juncture. After all, this is a parliament which saw JO members keep a night vigil in the House, with some even worse for liquor. What form will this COC take Will it be enforceable, or, will it run counter to the rights and privileges of members The Speaker should ensure that the COC is a foolproof one, and, what is more, one that will be binding on the MPs.
A COC, may, or may not, make MPs fall in line, as far as their conduct in the House is concerned, but it is debatable if it can restore the public trust in parliamentarians, as the Speaker is hoping. The unfolding events militate against such a scenario.
One could ask why a Code of Conduct is required to make our MPs adhere to good etiquette and accepted norms of decency. After all, these are all Honourable Members, who, one would expect, to be the last to need a set of guidelines to govern their behaviour in the House. Already, there are Standing Orders that lay down the standards of conduct expected of an MP. Has the Speaker come to the decision that enough is enough, going by what has been played out before his own eyes, so far during his tenure, and decided a firm hand is needed to bring about order in the House.
Perhaps, the recent suggestion by former Secretary General of Parliament Nihal Seneviratne at his Order Please book launch, for more stringent action to discipline members, following the increasingly deteriorating standards in parliament, may have influenced the Speaker in his move.
Usually, any Opposition party is wont to display its muscle in parliament and resort to theatre, as an attention gaining tactic. This could be born of an inferiority complex .The exception was in 70-77 and thereafter till 88 when the Opposition was enfeebled and could not muster sufficient manpower to challenge those governments which enjoyed steamroller majorities. Even then, there have been instances when members of the miniscule Opposition had some of their members evicted from parliament, notably W. Dahanayake (70 -77) and Ananda Dassanayake (77-88). Thereafter, with the advent of the PR system, the Opposition was bestowed with sufficient numbers to challenge the government benches, as was seen during the raucous sessions in the 89- 94 parliament and thereafter, where, for the first time perhaps, the practice of running away with the Mace, which was made into a fine art by Vasudeva Nanaykkara, was witnessed.
It is only natural that things would go from bad to worse, given this scenario and reach the sorry pass parliament has descended into today, where it is not just the nature of the hooliganism, expletives and the vulgarity that has come to impinge on the sensitivities of the decent folk but also emergence of a much more dangerous trend in the form of outright violence in the August Assembly, compelling the Speaker to give a piece of own mind, when confronted with a group MPs wrestling on the floor of the House, during a particular violent session, recently.
Which, once again throws up the perennial question of the quality of the members elected. Professionals and leading members of society, has, time and gain, prevailed on political party leaders to nominate candidates based on their education and good background. However, the leaders are hamstrung, since it is the uncouth, the thug, who rake in the votes for their respective parties, in addition to the criminal types, and, of course, the moneybags who would demand the usual quid pro quo. The progeny and the siblings, of the present lot, too are waiting in the wings in the Provincial Councils to step into the shoes of their papas and mamas. Add to this the latest revelation that as much as 40% of our legislators have not passed their O/Ls, is it any wonder that parliament has plunged into the present morass.
It is therefore doubtful that any Code of Conduct is going to make things different unless there is a complete overhaul.

Power from garbage:
President Maithripala Sirisena inaugurated the first two projects (Nikasala Javaya) for generating 20 Mega Watts of electricity from garbage with an investment of Rs. 27 billion by two private organisations in Kerawelapitiya yesterday.
The government can solve the solid waste disposal issue within two years if there are no more barriers by the people with personal agendas, Mega polis and Western development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. Addressing the gathering at the inauguration ceremony, the minister said there are myths about garbage disposal. The people easily point their fingers at the government when something goes wrong, he said.
There are four major garbage dumps in Colombo. Measures are being taken to turn those lands into urban gardens or parks," he said.
The minister said generating electricity from garbage was not a profitable project, but the government had to initiate the project to control the crisis.
Through this project, we cannot earn the money that we spend on garbage collection. But the government has managed to control the crisis by recycling, making compost and generating electricity using garbage," he said.
He said many projects started earlier were stopped due to various reasons.
The ministry would continue the project if the companies fail to complete it, he said.
The minister requested the support of the authorities as well as public to carry out the Aruwakkalu project.
He said some elements are objecting it and requested them not to obstruct the project.

Although members of the fishery community earn a better income than their counterparts in other vocations, they undergo a more difficult life than others due to bad income management. They should try to curtail unnecessary expenditure on liquor, cigarettes and other wasteful habits to prevent their hard earned income,just wasting away, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The Minister made this observation while addressing the gathering after inaugurating work on a model fisheries village at Keeramundalama in Kalpitiya recently.
Fifty fishery families living in dilapidated houses and temporary huts in Keeramundalama, would receive a decent houses to live in.
This programme consisting Rs 15 million, each family would be granted Rs 300,000 in housing aid in addition to a Rs 500,000 loan on easy repayment terms for house building under the programme.

Fitch Ratings has placed Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lankas (HDFC Bank) National Long-Term Rating of BBB(lka)on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).
The agency also placed HDFC Banks senior secured and senior unsecured debentures, rated at BBB(lka), on RWN. The RWN reflects the risk that the state (B+/Stable), as major shareholder, will not raise the banks capital to meet the minimum LKR5 billion capital requirement by Jan. 1,
2018, in which case Fitch will downgrade the rating to reflect the banks weaker intrinsic strength.
The requirement has been in force since 2016 and Fitch would see a further delay as an indication that creditors may no longer be able to rely on sovereign support in a timely manner, notwithstanding HDFC Banks unchanged linkages with the state.
HDFCs rating reflects Fitchs expectation that the bank would receive extraordinary support from the sovereign, if required.
Fitchs assessment captures the states 51% effective holding, of which the National Housing Development Authority directly owns 49%; the banks quasi-policy role in supporting housing-development initiatives; as well as HDFC Banks low systemic importance.

## Title: Freedom of Association under 1978 Constitution
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, August 11, 2017 - 01:00
Freedom of Association under 1978 Constitution
In Sri Lanka, Article 157A of the Constitution prohibits any political party or other association or organization from having as one of its aims or objects the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka. Where the Supreme Court, upon an application made to it, declares that a party, association or organisation has such an aim or object, such a party, association or organisation is deemed to be proscribed.
Regulation 68 of the emergency regulations empowers the President to proscribe an organisation if he is of the opinion there is a danger of action by, or of the utilization, of, such organisation or its members or adherents for purposes prejudicial to national security, the maintenance of public order or maintenance of essential services or for the purposes of committing offences mentioned in the Regulation.
It was under this Regulation that the Communist Party, the Nava Sama Samaja party and Janatha Vimuthy Peramuna were proscribed in 1983. The Supreme Court in Satyapala v Attorney-General and Mallikarachchi v Shiva Pasupathi held that an order of proscription made under the said Regulation cannot be challenged as a violation of a fundamental right because of the immunity of the President from suit granted by Article 35(1) of the Constitution.
Whether the right to strike is included in the right to form and join a trade union was raised in Yasapala v Wickremasinghe.
The petitioner referred to section 2 of the Trade Unions Ordinance where a trade union is defined as an association of workmen or employees having among its objectives the following objects:
The promotion or organisation of financing of strikes or lockouts in any trade or industry or the provision of pay or other benefits for its members during a strike or lock-out.
Workers demands
It was contented that since the promotion of strikes was one of the legitimate objects of a trade union, it followed that under Article 14(1) (d) there is a fundamental right for a workman to resort to a strike; the freedom to form a trade union extended to confer upon trade unions a right to effectively function as an instrument for agitating and negotiating and for collective bargaining to secure the demands of workers; otherwise the freedom to form a trade union would be illusory.
Sharvanada J. agreeing with the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in All India Bank Employees Association v The National Industrial Tribunal, held that the right to strike did not amount to a fundamental right.
The learned Judge stated that to hold that the right to strike is a fundamental right was to hold also that the right to lock-out is a fundamental right. He stated:
If the fulfillment of every object for which a Union of workers was formed were held to be a guaranteed right, it would logically follow that a similar content ought to be given to the same freedom when applied to a Union of Employers and thus [the] right to lock-out also will have to be upheld as a fundamental right. This construction will result in an absurdity.
In its decision on the constitutionality of the Essential Public Services Bill, a five member Bench of the Supreme Court stated:
The right to strike is essentially a political and economic concept, but has been conceded in some countries as a legal right.
At the most it may be claimed as a mere common law right without being raised to the level of a fundamental right.
A Fundamental Rights case decided by the Supreme Court in 1999 concerning a violation of 14(1) (b) and (c) together with 14(1)(a) was Mihundukulasuriya Vincent Peiris v. Neil Rupasinghe.
The petitioner in this case was the chairman of an NGO known as Janodhaaya Sajeewana Kendraya. The petitioner had been invited by the Central Environmental Authority to attend a workshop on January 5,1999.
When he arrived the premises he was prevented from participating, and was assaulted by the respondents. The petitioner alleged that the respondents had violated his freedom of expression, assembly and association guaranteed by the Constitution.
The Supreme Court acknowledged the petition mentioning that the outcome of the incident was that the petitioner had not been able to participate at the workshop and had been prevented from exercising his fundamental rights of freedom of expression, assembly and association guaranteed under the Constitution.
Interpreting the scope of freedom of association, Justice M.D.H. Fernando on behalf of the Supreme Court in the case of Bandara v. Premachandra stated that;
Article 14(1) ( c) (freedom of association) is of general application to all forms of associations, including trade unions, and not only to the initial act of forming or joining an association but, also to continuing membership and participation in the lawful activities of the association.
Similarily Wijetunga J. referring to freedom of association in the case of Ekanayake v. Gunatillake, Superintendent of Police Maho (1993) stated that a citizens right to join any political party of his choice, which is a necessary concomitant of the freedom of association guaranteed to him by Article 14(1) ( c), would be meaningless unless he has the freedom to participate fully in the lawful activities of such political party and when such lawful activities are unlawfully obstructed or prevented, there is a violation of Article 14(1) ( c).
In these cases, for instances, the courts of Sri Lanka have given a liberal interpretation to the principles governing freedom of association.
Common purpose or joint action
Associations play a vital role in modern society and are a vital expression of the human personality. Freedom of association indicates a condition in which people are free to join others in an organisation for a common purpose or joint action.
It permits individuals to get together for the purpose of influencing policy. Freedom of association becomes an important political issue when associations play a political role. On the other hand, it should be understood that the only importance of associations is not political.
The fundamental right to freedom of association plays a significant role in Sri Lanka.
There should only be minimal State intervention with respect of this right if it is to be fully realized by the Sri Lankan citizens, and such intervention should not exceed the limits on legitimate restriction to this right that are set out in the ICCPR, to which Sri Lanka is a party. The mere recognition of a trade union will not ensure that collective bargaining will ipso facto take place successfully.

Glamorous & and Incredible
The day Grace Kelly met Prince Rainier of Monaco for the first time, started out terribly. The American actress had washed her hair only to realize a labor strike had caused a power cut in Cannes, France, where she was staying at the Carlton Hotel. Without electricity, she couldn't dry her hair or iron her clothes. She would have to use natural lighting to apply her makeup. So she improvised, putting on her one unwrinkled dress and pulling her hair back and adorning it with flowers. She hurried downstairs, without the aide of elevators, where her new acquaintances waited to accompany her to the Prince's palace.
Then, a minor accident with the car behind them made the group late. The prince wasn't there when they arrived; they toured his 225-room palace without him. Prince Rainier, however, made it back in time to take his guests through his private zoo before Kelly had to return to Cannes for a professional engagement. During the tour, he and Kelly walked ahead of the group, chatting privately. On the ride home Kelly remarked that she'd found her prince "charming."
Their chance meeting sparked the fires of love and they started to write to each other after that first introduction. Prince Rainier soon traveled to the U.S. and proposed during Christmas, seven months later.
Their glamorous royal wedding was held on April 18, 1956, sixty-one years ago. Over 600 guests attended the nuptials, including Cary Grant, Aristotle Onassis, Ava Gardner, Gloria Swanson and Conrad Hilton.
By Napoleonic Code and Roman Catholic church rules, the they were required to marry in both a civil ceremony on April 18 and a separate religious ceremony on April 19.
Held in the Palace Throne Room, the civil ceremony lasted only 15 minutes but ended with a 25-minute long recitation of the more than 140 formal titles Grace acquired by marriage. As soon as the ceremony ended, it was repeated for a newsreel camera.
For her civil wedding, Grace wore the first of two gowns created for her by Hollywood wardrobe designer Helen Rose: a two-piece light pink taffeta dress overlaid with champagne colored lace. Both wedding gowns, handmade in MGMs studio ateliers, were a wedding gift to the star from her studio bosses.
Then on the morning of April 19, Grace came to Monacos Saint Nicholas Cathedral as the world watched. Among the immensity of details were: thousands of white lilacs and lilies of the valley; one wedding ring mishap (Rainier was so nervous that Grace helped him place the ring on her finger) and a six-tiered wedding cake that replicated Monacos pink palace and scenes depicting Monacos history in sugar.
Grace wore one of the most famous wedding gowns of all time: Fit for a princess, it was a creation of 300 yards of antique Belgian lace and 150 yards of silk, taffeta and tulle created by 30 studio seamstresses.
After the celebration, she followed Monaco tradition and traveled to St. Dvote, where she offered her wedding bouquet to Monacos patron saint. An afternoon buffet featured caviar, salmon, chicken, jellied eggs, cold lobster, and champagne for 600 before the Princess and her Prince left for a seven-week Mediterranean honeymoon cruise.
They were married for 26 years, until Princess Grace's death in 1982 from injuries sustained in a car accident. The prince, who never remarried and who died in 2005, is buried beside his wife in the Grimaldi family vault, inside the Monaco cathedral where they wed.
It was such an incredible affair, and its left such a mark on people, the couples only son and heir, Prince Albert recalled in an interview with PEOPLE magazine. What it has meant for people has been incredible what its meant for Monaco, for people around the world, and, how their story continues to fascinate, thats something unimaginable.

The people can see the fruitful consequences of the steps taken by the government to increase foreign exchange reserves and to reduce the foreign debt burden.
He said today, we can celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka in a happy status as a result of laying a solid foundation for the relations between the two countries during the past two and a half years.

Govt has undertaken water, power projects worth Rs 300 bn - Minister
Government has undertaken water and electricity related projects to the tune of Rs. 300 billion this year, said City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem.
Speaking at the inauguration of Sri Lankas biggest, four-in-one International Expo on Water, Building, Power and Air Conditioning technology at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre yesterday, the Minister said that some projects like the Moragahakanda multipurpose irrigation project have already been completed. For many protects foreign donor funding was received.
The Minister said that the government also wants the private sector to play a major role in these projects when tenders are called for them. He said that they also want government companies to adopt the positive mindset of the private sector which would create a more active institution.
Minister Hakeem said that weather patterns have changed and these lead to droughts with the end result being power cuts.
There is modern technology available to fight climate change issues and both the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Water Resources Board are working jointly with the United Nations Sustainable Development Fund in this regard.
He said that several sectors in the local construction industry would benefit from product lines and machinery displayed by several countries at the exhibition.
Lanka Water 17, Lanka Build 17, Lanka Energy 17 and SIVAR 17 expo is hosted by Major Constructors of Sri Lanka (MCSL) with the support of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon Electricity Board, Water Resources Board, Institute of Town Planners and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. AMB Tarsus Events Group Director Andrew Siow said, More importantly, 80 percent of the exhibitors are from overseas and as such, most of the exhibits will be shown for the first time in Sri Lanka and as the majority of overseas exhibitors are manufacturers, visitors can source directly and seek solutions from the experts face-to-face.
The organisers hope that the expo will also contribute to the economy by promoting business partnerships and investment opportunities between Sri Lankan businessmen and the many overseas participants.
Many of the overseas exhibitors are here for the first time and will be looking to find business partners in Sri Lanka. We hope this will lead to more investments and trade opportunities.
The three-day expo with 150 exhibiting companies and brands from 14 countries displaying their products will conclude tomorrow.

Hakeem inaugurates Matara Water Supply Project  Stage IV
Although a litre of bottled drinking water is sold at a minimum price of Rs.60 and the people readily buy it and the government provides clean drinking water to residences and premises of consumers at a subsidized price of merely Rs. 12 for every 1,000 litres. the expenditure incurred on it by the Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB) is Rs.49, more than four times the price charged, Minister of City Planning and Water Supply and Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Rauff Hakeem said.
He was addressing the official inauguration of the construction of the Matara Water Supply Project  Stage IV, held last Sunday (August 6) at the Nupe Junction regional office of the WSDB.
While we inaugurate this new water supply project in Matara, an acute drought and water scarcity prevails in another part of the country and the government is also extending relief assistance to the drought-affected people in such areas, the Minister said. The officially stipulated time span for revising water tariffs is only three years, but the government has not enforced any revision of tariffs although four years have lapsed, he said. In spite of it, the governments decision to increase the tariff rate by Rs.6 has come under politically-motivated and unreasonable protests, he further said.
The NWDB obtains investment-oriented loans for implementing new water supply projects and the loans have to be repaid and this fact should be understood by the people without political colouring, he said. Under the Matara project, steps will also be taken to construct a protective wall to prevent the the Nilwala river water being mixed with saline water during the drought season, the Minister said. Protests against such far-reaching development projects due to political reasons are obviously detrimental to the peoples welfare and should be avoided, the Minister said.
The previous government encountered similar problems but very unfortunately they too are now encouraging such protests on political expediency, he said.
Not a single project was initiated during the past decade, disregarding the rapid population growth of the district.
The extension of the Southern highway to Matara and the relative increase on the demand for drinking water and todays necessity is to address the need for drinking water taking all these factors into consideration, the Minister said. Matara, Mirissa, Malimbada, Devinuwara, Kottegoda and Dickwella areas are benefiting under the water supply project, especially under the Matara Joint Water Supply Project and the Wligama Water Supply project. 59,300 cubic meters water is produced per day, with provision of 86,000 water connections and about 350,000 people are benefited.
There are difficulties in supplying water regularly to certain high and low elevation areas due to water-pressure problems, especially in the months of February and March, the Minister said.

Has the Lankan interest  been sufficiently guarded
FCCISL on proposed FTA with China:
The proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and China has once again become a contentious trade policy issue today among the business chambers and industrial sectors today. This is largely due to the latest negotiation position where by Sri Lanka is expected (a) to reduce the negative list from 30% to 10% (b) to phase out import duty of 90% of the total tariff lines to zero duty over a period of 20 years and (c) to phase out the import CESS and PAL which has been imposed to safeguard the Sri Lankan industries to zero within five years after implementation of the proposed FTA.
The reduction of negative list takes place on linear -phased out basis of every 5 years and there is uncertainty over the method of selection of tariff lines as to which stage they fall in to this phased out period. Another concern is on what basis or criteria the remaining 10% negative or sensitive list is decided by negotiators.
Prospects of businesses under FTA with China
China is currently the second largest trading partner of Sri Lanka and the second most important sourcing destination accounting to 20 % of total imports in Sri Lanka in 2015. However, China does not at present contribute much to the Sri Lankan exports as its around 3% of Sri Lanka s total exports. Some surveys done by researchers have identified that Sri Lanka has around 550 products for which Sri Lanka has the comparative advantage vis-a vis the world including China.
According to Sri Lanka Customs statistics, Sri Lanka is already exporting 245 products to China. This means what we call under a best case scenario Sri Lanka has the potential to add around 250 more products to the present export basket to China under the proposed FTA. Now Million-dollar question is can Sri Lanka do it. On what modular assumptions are these optimistic estimations made and have actual business environment/conditions been taken into the equations of such theoretical mathematical models.
Our enquiries from Sri Lankan exporting community reveal that they face a range of trade barriers in Chinese market. The commonly cited issues include trade restrictive sanitary and phytosanitory ( SPS) regime compared to other export markets, non-existence of mutual recognition of standards and certificates, A case in point is g Sri Lankas one of the major export commodities Tea is subjected to a requirement known as rare-earth content testing which is unique to China.
The compliance of this kind of testing requirement is problematic due to the lack of sufficient testing facilities in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan testing facilities can only determine whether the rare earth content is present or not in tea but the level of rare earth content cannot be determined to meet Chinese requirements. Also China does not recognize testing and certificates issued by testing and certification bodies by Sri Lanka. We understand that current FTA negotiations are focusing on so called framework agreements whichincludes mutual recognition of products and services.
It should be emphasized that framework agreements will not establish mutual recognition of standards for products and services, since this is a very specific and technical task involving the bodies responsible for standards in the negotiating countries. Much resources in terms institutional and infrastructure capacities are required to harmonize standards and these cannot be merely relegated to mutual recognition framework agreements. There are concern whether the imports into Sri Lanka under duty free coverage of 90% goods will meet the Sri Lankan SPS standard. This will undoubtedly pause public health issues and other problems relating to the influx of sub-standard goods to the country.
The lack of transparency of test reports and the limits required in China are considered to be complex than other export markets. For examples in other export markets exports of shrimp requires to obtain an antibiotic test report only for one pond in the farm but in case of China antibiotic reports have to be provided for each and every pond in a farm.
On the other hand, obtaining quarantine requirements for fruits and vegetables are also extremely cumbersome and time consuming and subject to a long approval process.
If we look at industrial exports to China such as textiles, apparels exporters complain stringent testing and specific requirements in China. This requires more detailed test reports compared to other export destinations and Sri Lanka lacks sufficient facilities to undertake such testing.
Taking in to consideration the concerns expressed by many countries, World Trade Organization(WTO) in its fourth review of Chinas trade policy called on China to address various NTMs such as anti-dumping duties, technical trade barriers, sanitary and phytosanitary issues, custom process, export restrictions and protection of intellectual property rights.
FCCISL is of the view that entering in to a FTA with China without addressing these trade barriers does not bring the expected benefits to Sri Lanka. On the other hand, Sri Lanka being a developing country which has serious issues on the competitiveness of its products due to high interest rates, low productivity, high production and labor cost will face serious consequences.
While FCCISL stands for free flow of goods without impediments and barriers among countries but admit the right of any country to safe guard its local industry against excessive imports.
WTO too recognizes the need for adopting safeguard measures for protection of domestic industries other than para tariffs imposed to achieve this objective.
Phasing out the para tariffs, such as CESS, without the alternate WTO sanctioned Non-Tariff Measures will be a death knell and this step would lead to the closure of some of the local industries.
Implications on Sri Lankan SME sector
The Sri Lankan industrial sector is dominated by SMEs which accounts for 52% of the total GDP and is also accountable for 45% of total employment and accountable for 75% of enterprises. It is also noteworthy to state that around 25% of these enterprises are owned by women. Moreover, SMEs are significant employers of women and youth. In the global agenda SMEs are receiving prominent attention eg. The sustainable development goals (SDG) under goal 8 recognizes the potential of these businesses to support inclusive and sustainable growth and decent work for all.
These SMEs are dependent on large industries for backward/forward integration for supply sourcing of raw materials, marketing and other services. Removal of tariff protection such as CESS will adversely affect these SMEs, both directly and indirectly which will lead to their non-competitiveness and closing down, creating unemployment and adversely affecting the economy.
The majority of the local industrialists have funded their investments, in their respective industries, with borrowed funds, from banks and financial institutions, using their personal assets as security. Further, their indebtedness on loans and overdrafts run into millions, depending on the size of the company. If they are not safeguarded sufficiently, it will lead to disastrous economic situations.
Lessons from Pakistan-China FTA
Sri Lanka has just concluded six rounds of trade negotiations with China and further negotiations are on the cards. Before concluding this trade deal, it would be prudent for Sri Lanka to examine the lessons learned by one of our neighbors-Pakistan who entered into a FTA with China in 2006 and made it effective 2007. It should be noted that Pakistan is an economically greater entity and possess more production capacity than Sri Lanka, and yet has adopted a more cautious approach in its negotiations with China.
Pakistan and China signed up a FTA in 2006 and made it effective 2007. Under Phase (1) of the agreement China agreed to eliminate/reduce tariffs on 6418 product lines, and Pakistan was to eliminate on 6711 product lines over a period of five years.
As of end of 2013, bilateral trade reached little over USD 9 billion, as compared to USD 3,5 Billion in 2006 prior to the FTA being implemented while the trade imbalance has grown in favour of China during this time. Its noteworthy to mention that during the phase (1) China made substantial use of the FTA and has managed to utilize 57% of the concessions under the FTA, compared to mere 5% in the case of Pakistan.
Has effectively china increased buying from Pakistan. Whats the Pakistans position as an exporter to china comparing to other countries which export goods to China after signing the FTA. This following graph tells the story.
As evident from the above graphical presentation on bilateral trade between the two countries over the last decade, Pakistan has failed to derive the benefits out of the FTA with China. In March 2017 Lahore School of economics and Pakistan Business council have attributed the following factors for poor performance.
(a) China has awarded higher or equal tariff reductions to competing ASEAN countries for products for which Pakistan possess big export potential in Chinese market. As a result, tariff preferences enjoyed by Pakistan under FTS has been eroded which popularly known as preferential erosion.
(b) During the negotiations Pakistans top exports to the world (and China) have been placed in Chinas negative list despite the demand for such goods is high in Pakistan.
(c) FTA concessions offered by Pakistan seems to be more beneficial for China both in terms of the number of product lines utilized and variety of type of product lines utilized.
At the time of signing the FTA between two countries, during the Phase (2) It was agreed to remove 90% of tariff lines achieving substantially all trade.
However, no negotiation was begun even 3 years after the lapse of the phase (1) due to the refusal by the Pakistan to commence the negotiations due to negative impact created by phase (1) on Pakistan economy.
Uniqueness of Chinese system
Its a common knowledge that Chinese systems are not transparent in its rules and regulations and business practices. Also, the competitiveness of Chinese goods internationally is largely due to their vast economies of scale, political and labour structure. Unlike in Sri Lanka in China there is no strict adherence to ILO labour conventions so all these factors give a huge advantage over cost of production in comparison to Sri Lankan products. Question of 90% liberalisation of tariff lines and submission of government of Sri Lanka for such a demand at the negotiating table, we understand that the asymmetrical nature of the FTA negotiations the need for a representative negative list, the review clause have been put to the Chinese negotiators again and again during the past negotiations (Despite the fact that WTO does not define what substantial coverage of goods for negative list should be), Sri Lanka has agreed to 10% negative list as requested by the Chinese. Its pity that Sri Lankan negotiators have accepted the Chinese stance at the at the loss of Sri Lankas economic interest.
(7) Its also important to properly analyze the real impact on the Chinas duty free exemption offer on some product lines amounting to 454 no sooner the import CESS is removed by GOSL. At a glance this offer looks very attractive however the question is what tariff lines China will actually and finally offer duty free is not yet known to Sri Lanka! Sri Lanka had requested 451 tariff lines mostly consisted with apparel and apparel related items., accessories, Fibers, Rubber and rubber related items, Natural and cultured pearls, Precious and semi-precious stones, Edible fruits and nuts, animal and vegetable facts.
Sri Lankas wish List (indicative) for Immediate Zero Duty+Number of Tariff Lines  451
As you see among the wish list of Sri Lanka there are products with and without the national advantage or competitive advantage so making the case weaker for Sri Lanka. On the other hand, Chinas wish list consists of well diversified product range
Another important factor is we should understand as to why china is stressing on 90% of trade liberalization at an early stage with an unequal comparatively small trading partner as Sri Lanka.
What Sri Lanka actually forgot at the negotiating table
Clearly, China has not taken into account the asymmetrical nature of the negotiations. We understand that under Multilateral Trading Rules it is possible for small developing countries like Sri Lanka to negotiate under Enabling Clause that offer more flexibilities. Negotiations of FTA between China and Sri Lanka is conducted under the Article XXIV of GATT whereas Sri Lankas both FTAs with
India and Pakistan were concluded under enabling clause. China too concluded it FTA with ASEAN under Enabling Clause that offer more flexibilities. Arent the Sri Lankan negotiators aware of this basic principal Even under the present rules of negotiations, there is no hard and fast rule that Sri Lanka should go in for a 10% negative list as requested by China. The WTO has not defined substantial coverage under Article 24 of the GATT to mean 10%. It is left for the countries to adopt a comfortable percentage as befits their economic and development level and negotiate long and hard.
In this context FCCISL having consulted its membership across the country wishes to suggest the following to safe guard the interest of the Sri Lankan business community.
(1) Its important that while the negotiations are on for the FTA government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) should address both tariff barriers and NTMs. This process should be a part and parcel of the FTA negotiations.
(2) Adoption of a strategy of scenario planning on implications of FTA in two dimensions - the best case scenario and worst case scenario while taking in to consideration of the political, economic, social and technology factors
(3) To Include a time bound review clause as done in n the China- Pakistan FTA (see following excerpts from page 4 of the China- Pakistan FTA. under chapter 3 - Article 8 - Tariff Elimination)
Review and Modification of Tariff Reduction Modality and the Lists shall be as follows
(a) Tariff Reduction Modality and the lists shall be reviewed and modified every five years by the Committee on Trade in Goods.
(b) The review shall be undertaken on the basis of friendly consultation and accommodation of the concerns of the Parties.
(c) The first review and modification shall be undertaken either at the end of the fourth year or at the beginning of the fifth year of entry into force of this Agreement.
(d) Either party may request for an additional review at any time after coming into force of this Agreement. Such a request shall be favorably considered by the other Party.
(4) It is essential to have a strong development friendly dispute Settlement Mechanism in the FTA.
(5) Its critical that Sri Lanka gets similar or better concessions compared to Chinas other FTA partners eg ASEAN.
(6) Sri Lanka should urgently enact legislations on anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard measures, which are temporary in nature to ease the transition toward freer trade and protect local industries against unfair trading practices/surge in imports. (However, the limits of such trade remedies in preventing the inevitable supremacy of Chinese goods in the domestic market should be noted. In order to establish dumping countervailing and safeguard action the WTO establishes particular rules that require proving the alleged unfair business practices)

Hayleys Group  revenue up 21% YoY to Rs. 29.2 bn
Backed by stronger performance of the transportation and logistics sector the Hayleys Group recorded a 21% Year-on-Year (YoY) improvement in top line up to Rs. 29.2 billion during the three months June 30, 2017 (1QFY18).
Despite the improved revenue, it was a challenging quarter for the Group, during which Profits Before Tax (PBT) contracted 61% YoY down to Rs 407.7 million .
Despite lower profits during the first quarter, we remain confident that group profits will rebound over the coming quarters as multiple strategic investments made over the recent past begin to generate returns and contribute positively towards group profitability.
In particular, we note with satisfaction the consistently positive growth displayed by our transportation and logistics segment, represented by Hayleys Advantis, and the positive turn-around recorded within the plantations sector as a result of favorable market conditions, Hayleys Chairman and Chief Executive Mohan Pandithage said.
The groups transportation and logistics segment generated revenue of Rs7.24 billion during the quarter. Operating Profits during the quarter rose to Rs. 430.9 million.
Turnover in the plantation sector increased to Rs 3.49 billion in 1Q18 while operating profits improved up to Rs. 99.4 million on the back of stronger tea prices at the Colombo Tea Auction during the period under review.
Notably, following the completion of one of Sri Lankas largest solar power plants in Welikande, the groups power and energy sector also recorded notable improvements in top and bottom line performance, generating Rs 404.9 million in revenue, while operating profits within the segment rose to Rs 229.5 million.

Hidden Rituals
Juliet Coombe joined the exciting procession of regal elephants dressed in silk drapes, dancing girls and fire jugglers at the Kataragama Temple, where she learns about some of the mysteries that lie within these ancient temple walls.
As scented flower petals were thrown in the air, and incense smoke billowed in all directions, baskets of food were being loaded up to be taken inside as offerings to be given at the Kataragama Temple. I took off my shoes, out of respect, at the entrance step, which was already so covered in a sea of footwear that it had become totally hidden, and yet the colourful array of left-behind flip-flops and shoes was a clear demarcation that we were about to enter sacred grounds on a very auspicious day. I had come with a team from EKHO Tissa Safari who has created an exciting portfolio of curated experiences ranging from the deeply spiritual to hands-on plot-to-plate foodie safaris.
The biggest elephant tusker
Unlike most Perahera experiences I had in the past, at Kandy I did not have to buy a ticket and sit with thousands of other observers. My duomo guide wanted me to be part of their religious life and not watching the proceedings from afar. So, instead of a bandstand view, we headed off into the growing crowd of pilgrims to the epicentre of where the Perahera would take place, everywhere pilgrims were busy finding spots along the ganga (river) to sleep as this was the start of several weeks of festivities that would end on a full moon day, with a procession of over forty ornately dressed elephants in rich red plush velvet and golden threads.
The night air was pungent with crushed flower petals carried in baskets by those who had come to do their family puja in the temples inner sanctum, where they would throw them liberally over the tusker male elephant and his spiritual guru, who could not be seen by mortal eyes. Hidden inside a giant sack, he was led up and down the elephant mounting steps in front of the temple by holy men.
Luckily, as I was with EKHO Tissa Safari, we had a contact in the inner sanctum and were able to work our way through the crowd, several locked gates and, finally, the main area for offerings, which ranged from baskets of food to cinnamon scented joss sticks being lit around the stone alter, where no photos are allowed and one must keep ones head bowed at all time. The stone steps and sacred ground were doused liberally with sacred water and flower petals, and then blessed with incense, carried by two fire bearers, swinging smoke in all directions as the pilgrims raised their hands to the air in euphoria. Dancing girls passed by with one elephant and then a troop of drummers, monkey men doing summersaults, and more costumed characters, who felt like the warm up act to the arrival of the biggest elephant tusker I have ever seen.
Magical sweet taste
This mammoth beast of the jungle, controlled only by a small stick, weaved his way through the now immense crowds and was not only impressive, owing to his size and hugely grand regal attire, but also the hundreds of flowered garlands that hung from his tusk. Yet he could still wave a few of them around with his playful trunk as he stopped from time to time to be given food. He swayed sideways to the drum beat, as if dancing in time to it, ears flapping as if to remind all who watched that he is carrying the holy of holies - a living god all bagged up in a black sheet, escorted by a priest, who in contrast wore pure white. As the holy men in white snaked their way through the Katagarama temple to where the main evening puja and blessings were taking place, the once noisy huge crowd fell silent for the first time, as the single drum beat announced the importance of these ancient rituals. On their return from the alter, the crowd went crazy, screaming and shouting, as flowers scattered like confetti in all directions, reminiscent in many ways of Spanish Church festivals.
The elephant threw his head back with flower garlands swirling around in a celebratory formation, as the secret person returned to his backside giving blessings, while a huge tray of sweet rice, mixed with cardamom, was handed over by a high priest, for the pilgrims to eat. More smoke and several decisive drumbeats later, the elephant turned round and processed back along a road where all religions were represented. Here, at least for a few hours, the people of the different religions felt in harmony with each other, sharing a huge silver platter of blessed sticky sweet rice mixed with bee honey. One handful and you will be hooked by the special temple food and its magical sweet taste that brings a smile to the children and the elderly that share this sticky treat with all their friends and family members. There is something very different about sharing food with so many different people and in such a deeply sacred place.
As we tucked into fruits and green grams, the twinkly lights above us were only matched by the stars and the count down to the full moon day on the August 8, when the procession will take to the streets of Kataragama and continue well into the small hours. We all picked up fistfuls of blessed flower petals to give absent friends and, in my case, my two sons, then collected our shoes and headed into downtown Kataragama to refresh ourselves with sweet tea at one of the many night hopper stands. Here we try a sugary sambal with coconut roti and a kind of dunking doughnut fresh out of a boiling pot of coconut oil, something they only do during the festive season.
As a crowd gathered, we drank more cups of sweet tea and I listened to stories from my EKHO Tissa Safari team about all the other special things you can do on top of seeing the magnificent wildlife in Yala National Park.

How internet businesses shape Sri Lankas economy
Sri Lanka is increasingly shaped by online startups who are changing the business landscape by disrupting traditional ways of doing everyday tasks and getting people used to smoother, easier and cheaper methods for basic activities.
Internet coverage has risen tremendously over the last years and will certainly not stop at around 30%, where it is at the moment. This provides an increasingly attractive field for tech-savvy entrepreneurs, who dive into conservative markets and change the playing field. As explained by RushabhSheth, Managing Director, everjobs.lk, Gone are the days where you send your CV via post to apply for a job and wait for weeks to get a reply, if you get one at all. Now thousands of jobs are accessible on everjobs.lk and all that a job seeker has to do is apply to as many as he or she wants with just one click
Sri Lankan internet startups receive a lot of external support from organisations like the Information and Communication Technology Authority (ICTA), a governmentally owned agency that aims to foster the economy through ICT.
It runs several initiatives, such as their Spiralation Seed funding programme, which provides seed funding of 5,000 USD per startup along with training by industry experts.
The Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) is another organisation that strongly promotes entrepreneurship in the IT space. With their annual INFOTEL, an exhibition at BMICH, they help companies in the IT space to showcase their services and products, a good way for internet businesses to gain publicity.
The Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies, or SLASSCOM, launched Startup Sri Lanka, an initiative and plan to launch 1000 Sri Lankan startups by the year 2020.
SLASSCOM ran a survey in 2015 among 215 aspiring or existing local entrepreneurs and analysed their demographics, as well as the barriers for growth for startups.
Lack of affordable workspace, missing online payment solutions, poor access to capital - most of the start-ups are internally funded - and unreliable and expensive internet access represent the biggest obstacles. Numerous banks are currently working or introducing payment solutions, which will take away one of the worries.
It is inevitable for Sri Lanka to support the startup industry, given that 8 out of 10 jobs come from the private sector. And while cities like Singapore, Bangkok, Beijing or Ho Chi Minh City are regulars in lists for attractiveness for startups, Colombo is nowhere to be found. However, as SLASSCOMs survey pointed out, this is certainly not due to lack of talent in the country.
More than 50% of the respondents had no issue at all with finding technically proficient talent.
It is therefore evident that Sri Lanka has some structural, financial and legal obstacles ahead that need to be tackled in order to be mentioned with the likes of Singapore and Hong Kong.

India interested in joint venture to run Mattala airport
The Government of India (GOI) has expressed interest in developing the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA).
According to a Cabinet paper submitted by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Indian Government had sent a proposal in May 2017 to form a joint venture company between GOI or its assigned entity and Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) or its assigned entity for the operation of MRIA on the basis of sharing of equity at the ratio of 70:30 for 40 years.
The Indians have also shown interest to operate, manage, maintain and develop MRIA with and not limited to commercial aviation, aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul, flying school.
They are willing to invest US$ 205 million as their equity share and GOSL is to share the balance of US$ 88 million totalling to US$ 293 million as per their valuation of assets of MRIA.
The Minister has asked Cabinet to further study the proposal and evaluate it based on the re-valuation of the assets and lease value of the land in Mattala, to appoint a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC) assisted by a Project Committee to evaluate the proposal and to make recommendations to Cabinet. The Minister has also proposed that they continue to look at other proposals in the meantime.
In December of 2016, the Government of Sri Lanka called for Expressions of Interest (EOI) to develop the MRIA through a public-private partnership. Since then, eight parties had sent in proposals for the project, one of them was the Airport Authority of India.
MRIA was started in 2009 through a loan funded by the EXIM Bank of China. The Chinese granted a loan of US$ 190 million to be repaid over 15 years, starting from 2015 for the project which was estimated to cost US$ 209 million at the time. The balance of USD 19 million was footed by the Airport and Aviation Services (SL) Ltd (AASL). The Airport was declared open in March 2013.
Since being opened, MRIA has not fared well and has run up greater losses. In April 2017, Cabinet had to approve an additional USD 39.6 million in payment to the contractor who had claimed for price escalation, cost variation and interest on delayed payments. This takes the total cost of the project to USD 252 million.
Minister de Silva in his Cabinet paper also explained that the average operating cost including loan interest and excluding exchange loss for per year amounted to USD 20 million. In addition 437 people work at the airport an on average between 2013-2016, the number of aircrafts and passenger movements internationally and domestic respectively were 1500 and 28,000.
On average, the Airport earns a revenue of USD 1.2 million per year but as of 31 December 2016, its accumulated losses amount to USD 112 million.

Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan stated that Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake had set an example in the countrys political history by resigning from his Ministerial Portfolio based on the allegations leveled against him, though he has not been found guilty by any competent court.
He made this observation expressing his views in Parliament after Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake made his statement on his resignation.
The Opposition Leader said that according to the human rights one is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty and Ravi Karunanayake has not yet been been proven guilty before a competent Court in the country.
He commended the bold decision to resign from his position respecting good governance. He added that Karunanayake had set an example for anyone to follow.
He also said that in the past several years there had been allegations against ministers and deputies but none had acted in such a manner.

Berates lack of collective responsibility:
There has been a breakdown in collective responsibility of ministers in Cabinet, Co-cabinet spokesperson and Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Dr Rajitha Senaratne said.He stressed the need for the government to speak in one voice yesterday.
The minister said the matter will be taken up for further discussion at the next Cabinet meeting.
This happens when parties which have opposed each other for so long are bound together and asked to work with each other. Many dont know how to behave within such a structure, Dr Senaratne said.
Over the past few weeks, criticism against the government has been more vociferous within government rather than from outside. SLFP Cabinet ministers have called for the resignation of their former cabinet colleague Ravi Karunanayake and UNP Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has openly criticised the Hambantota Port Agreement; a key achievement of the government.
We may express different opinions within cabinet but when a final decision is made, we abide by that.When Arjuna Mahendran was appointed Central Bank Governor, I opposed it greatly but when the Prime Minister said it was an institution under him and he wanted to make that appointment, we agreed to his decision, we did not oppose it outside, the Cabinet spokesperson said.
He also went on to condemn statement made by the Justice Minister on the Hambantota Port and said, If he cannot differentiate between a sale and lease being a lawyer, how is he going to look into other aspects of the agreement.
As Minister Wijeyadasa wins praise from the Joint Opposition for his statements, the Health Minister asked that his colleague listen to advice given by Mao Tse Tung in his book On Contradiction,
If your enemy praises you, know that you are wrong, when your enemy attacks you, then you are right.I ask Wijeyadasa to learn from Mao, Dr Senaratne said.

LG, PC polls to be held on one day
The government hopes to hold all local government and provincial council elections in one day around January or February 2018, Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
According to the recent bill gazetted on the 20th Amendment and amendments proposed to the Provincial Councils Elections Act No 2 of 1988, the date on which all elections will be held should not be no later than the expiration of the term of the last constitute Provincial Council. The 20th Amendment also proposed to grant powers to dissolve a Provincial Council to Parliament.
At present the central government has no power to dissolve a Provincial Council. If a council is to be dissolved, the central government has to inform the Governor and the Governor in turn has to get the approval all members for it, explained the minister.
We want to have all elections on one day to stop all election fraud and to stop a party from using the victory of one election as campaign material for others, Dr Senaratne addressing the weekly media briefing held at the Parliament complex.
He added that having frequent elections will also disrupt day-to-day activities and add to government expenditure.

In memory of a stalwart
TRIBUTE TO PAUL PERERA:
Paul Perera was a household name in politics two decades ago. Paul became a close associate of J R Jayewardene when he was the Leader of the Opposition and played a key role in ensuring the UNP victory at the 1977 General Elections. He started his career in the public service and then left to become an Advocate of the Supreme Court. It was during this period when he lived opposite J R Jayewardenes residence that they became friendly. He was originally a backroom member of our party  a person who did important work for the Party but was not known. Subsequently, he became a much-talked about political figure.
I got to know Paul Perera in 1972 when I was an apprentice lawyer working for H W Jayewardene. One day, he together with some others, came into H W Jayewardenes Chamber for a discussion after obtaining the Court Order prohibiting the expulsion of J R Jayewardene from the UNP.
I joined the case at that stage. Subsequently, J R Jayewardene and the then Leader Dudley Senanayake reached a settlement. That single act changed the history of our country; for without J R Jayewardene there would not have been an open economy in Sri Lanka. J R Jayewardene could not have won an election without the UNP. After the expulsion issue was settled, I got to know Paul Perera and we all went to work for the UNP candidate at the Kesbewa by-election. When J R Jayewardene became the leader of the UNP in 1973, he appointed Paul and myself to the Party Working Committee. He was always by the side of J R Jayewardene, working on different strategies to ensure that Parliamentary elections were held in 1977, which the UNP won. Paul Perera also oversaw a group of the electorates in the Gampaha area including the constituency where I was the organiser.
Contribution to economy
In 1977 after the unexpected landslide victory of the UNP, Paul Perera was entrusted to help Upali Wijewardene to start work on establishing a Free Trade Zone  the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC). He was appointed as the Deputy Director-General when Upali became the Director-General. This was the first special economic zone set up in the South Asian region. Upali Wijewardene focused on promoting investments while Paul Perera was responsible for the construction of the Katunayake Free Trade Zone and the Biyagama Free Trade Zone.
He, together with Lalith Athulathmudali, was also responsible for Sri Lanka obtaining quotas for the export of garments to the USA. They also obtained similar facilities with the EU. Subsequently, Paul succeeded Upali as the Director-General of GCEC. The work of Upali Wijewardene and Paul Perera ensured the success of GCEC, which today is known as the BOI.
A good example of Pauls commitment to the Investment Zones is the construction of the Biyagama IPZ. The UNIDO specialists said that Biyagama was not suitable for an investment zone as the soil was too hard for construction. Paul Perera overruled them and acted on the advice of the Sri Lankan Engineers who pointed out that this was a misreading of the local soil conditions of the Siyane Korale.
I must recall with gratitude, the help he gave me in transforming Biyagama from a backward region to one of the highly industrialized regions with one FTZ and two Industrial Estates. Paul Perera, together with late Suranimala Rajapakse, was instrumental in the construction of the roads from Kiribathgoda to the Zone, as well as the Kaduwela Biyagama - Belummahara Road.
By now Paul Perera had got the itch for politics. In 1983 President Jayewardene appointed Paul to fill the vacancy in Parliament arising from the death of M D H Jayawardena. During the first night of the 1983 July riots, the President instructed H W Jayewardene, Paul, and myself to visit Dehiwela and Ratmalana and report back to him. Until Pauls death, we would frequently recollect that horrifying experience, which we shared that night.
Subsequent to the communal riots, Paul started his Parliamentary career as acting District Minister for Polonnaruwa. When the country returned to normal, Ekanayake from Medirigiriya became the District Minister while Paul returned to the backbench. He became the Minister of Justice at the end of President J R Jayewardenes term of office. When President Premadasa downsized the Cabinet Ministers, Paul Perera became the Minister for Science and Technology in my Cabinet Ministry of Industries, Science and Technology. He was a great help, taking over the daily chores from me. Paul then became the Cabinet Minister of Lands under President Wijetunga, a post he held till the end of Parliament.
Handsome win
The high point in Paul Pereras Parliamentary career was when he was nominated as the Parliamentary candidate for the Gampaha seat with Attanagalle as his base. Everyone had expected him to lose, but Paul had mastered the system of preferential voting early. He went around stating that he is the opponent of Sirimavo Bandaranaike and requested every UNPer to spare him one preference. Paul won handsomely, but it was a tactic that you could not repeat. An unexpected consequence was that it heralded the entry of Chandrika Kumaratunga to politics.
Paul was a superb lawyer; he was quick on the uptake, seized a point immediately, and studied the brief thoroughly - at least thrice over. He carried these attributes into politics. Paul Perera enjoyed Parliament; for him, it was a continuation of the Court craft  similar to appearing in Court and thinking on his feet. He volunteered to speak on many debates and insisted that his speeches were fully reported. This was not an easy task for the press gallery. Paul was also a fighter who never gave in. The best example was in 1997 when he fell seriously ill during a flight and the plane had to make an emergency landing in to Bangkok. He was given a few weeks to live, yet he fought back, recovered, and carried on for ten more years. It was a unique experience working with Paul Perera, which I did for two decades. Paul will be remembered, not only for his politics but also for his contribution in promoting foreign investments in Sri Lanka; in this, he was a pioneer.

Ministry needed to look after Adivasi interest: Wanniyalaththo
A government ministry should be entrusted with the responsibility of handling affairs relating to the Adivasi Community, Community leader Uruwarige Wanniyalaaththo said at a ceremony to mark World Aborigines Day at Kotabakiniya, Dambana on Wednesday.
The ceremony was held under the State patronage.
Uva Governor M. P. Jayasinghe, Central Cultural Fund Director Prof. Priyashantha Gunawardene, Badulla District Secretary Nimal Abeysiri and Mahiyangana Divisional Secretary Nimal Dissanayake were the Chief Guests.
The ceremony began with the placing of floral tributes at the statue of late leader of the Adivasi Community, Uruwarige Thisahamy.
Wanniyalaaththo said as the leader of his community, he had never clamoured for any personal privilege. His sole endeavour was to protect and safeguard the culture and traditions of his community. Every year, he had been submitting a memorandum to the government highlighting problems and grievances of his community and some of them had been attended to by successive governments. But his request to develop the Dambana Junior School attended by children of his community had fell on deaf ears.
Sri Lanka is a heterogeneous society with several communal and religious groups. A country became a pleasant place to live in when rights of all groups were protected and safeguarded. The National Languages Ministry should undertake the task of protecting the language of the Adivasi community, Wanniyalaaththo said.
He said his community would never engage in violence or protest campaigns to win their demands.
Central Cultural Fund Director Prof. Priyashantha said there were nearly 300 million aborigines throughout the world. A vast majority of them were struggling in poverty. This years theme of the celebrations was Adivasi Rights. The objective of the theme was to create a social dialogue about the rights of adivasis to draw world attention towards attending to their needs and requirements.
He said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam who was billed to attend the ceremony as the chief guest could not make it due to other pressing official engagements. The Minister had however extended his greetings for the success of the ceremony. He said steps have been taken to conserve traditional Adivasi medical system with the blessings of Minister Kariyawasam.
Uva Governor M P Jayasinghe said steps would be taken to develop Dambana as a cultural heritage site on the directives of President Maithripala Sirisena. Mahiyangana SLFP Chief Organiser K P Gunawardene and Mahiyangana UNP Chief Organiser Upali Senaratne and several others also spoke.
Members of the Adivasi community from Nilgala, Rathugala, Pollebedda, Dalukana, Henanigala, Wakare attended the ceremony.
Wanniyalalaththo also opened the new Veda Piyasa (Medical centre) renovated at a cost of Rs 1.2 million by the Central Cultural fund.
Marriages of six Adivasi couples were also registered during the ceremony. Secretary of the Ministry of National co-existence Dialogue and state languages Ranjith Uyangoda presented a computer and a photoset machine to the Adivasi Cultural centre.
A memorandum containing the problems and difficulties of the Adivasi community was handed over to Prof Gunawardena by Wanniyalaaththo. Parcels of dry rations were distributed among members of the Adivasi community by several invitees.

Modi is unstoppable, even his critics agree
INDIA: Even haters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are hard put to deny his virtually unassailable position. No other politician is even near to threatening him. From the looks of it, say many analysts, the next general election is his to lose. His latest political triumph was winning the support of a formidable rival, Nitesh Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar state, last month. For many in the demoralised opposition, Kumar was the only person who could contemplate, at a pinch, taking on Modi in 2019 by leading a coalition comprising the opposition Congress Party and others.
Instead, Kumar jumped ship. Then he dumped his allies in Bihar and formed a new government with the support of Modis Bharatiya Janata Party, BJP. The result - the opposition lost the only politician with enough credibility to have cobbled together an alliance to defeat Modi. Bihar is now in the BJP fold. The feat comes just four months after the BJP won a spectacular victory in the politically important state of Uttar Pradesh.
The Modi juggernaut rolls on. With Kumar joining hands with him, the talk of Modi being on course to win a second term has become louder.
There is no doubt about his re-election as Prime Minister as theres no one to challenge him, Kumar said.
An OECD report in July on the trustworthiness of governments, shows73 per cent of Indians have faith in Modi. This, despite critics singling the government out for lynchings of Muslims over beef, cow vigilantism, unsatisfactory job generation, lack of resolution to the turmoil in Kashmir and cries from liberals that the BJP is crushing dissent.
If Indian politics is entering a new era of BJP dominance, it is partly  maybe largely - because ordinary Indians feel that at least he is trying to do something. As Alok Vinayak, who works as a cook in the Indian capital and who says he has not benefited in any way from three years of Modi government said: Im still hoping his energy will give India a better future. Hes trying to do the best for his country.
Adding to Modis popularity is the fact the Congress Party is terminal decline. Its leader Rahul Gandhi, is openly derided as a rank amateur, a part-time politician who is still wet-behind-the-ears after 11 years in politics. BJP leaders often joke about how they hope Gandhi never loses his job because he is their best asset.
Under Gandhis leadership, the Congress won just seven of the 403 seats in the Uttar Pradesh state assembly. In any other party, rivals would have booted him out. But no one in the Congress Party dares to unseat a member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, no matter how much of a liability.
Writing in the Indian Express, Modi critic Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Centre for Policy Research, called him an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of popular politics.
What should worry the opposition is that Modi has managed to outmanoeuvre them on every fault line of politics the opposition is simply not finding an issue on which to outflank him, he wrote.
The BJP has finally become a truly pan-Indian party, after decades of being confined to a handful of states. It runs the government in 18 out of 29 states. The Congress rules in six; regional parties rule the rest.
But whats even more alarming for the opposition is that the BJP has expanded its social base. Earlier, it used to be able to bank on the Hindu upper castes and the middle class. Analysts say this base has now widened to include poorer Indians.
The election is only two years away. Two years is an aeon in politics.
If the ruling party falters badly, the Indian voter will be unforgiving. Farmers and small traders are grumbling about the impact of last Novembers demonetisation (the government withdrew the 500 and 1000 rupee note from circulation overnight to curb corruption). And they want the Modi government to create jobs to absorb the one million youths who join the jobs market every month.
No election anywhere is a foregone conclusion, least of all in India.
But what Modi can bank on is the state of the opposition: a divided, rudderless, ragtag bunch with no coherent ideology or vision and unable to turn their opponents mistakes to their advantage.
One of the first opposition politicians to voice the thought that a Modi victory in 2019 was inevitable was Omar Abdullah whose National Conference party in Kashmir is an ally of the Congress.
On hearing of the thundering BJP victory in Uttar Pradesh, he tweeted: At this rate we might as well forget 2019 and start planning/hoping for 2024. - SYDNEY MORNING HERALD

Multi-culturalism as basis for peace
It was last Tuesday that former Prime Minister of Turkey Prof. Ahmet Davtoglu gave a lecture on the above topic at the BMICH, Colombo. He was delivering the 20th Commemoration Lecture of Former Speaker Bakeer Marker. In view of the relevance and topicality of the subject of his lecture we were prompted by the desire to make its content known to a wider audience through this column.
He was attracted to Sri Lanka due to its natural and human diversity, he confessed at the beginning. Taking local examples he showed the beauty and strength of diversity. For example he spoke of the beauty of the Peradeniya Botanical gardens which he said consists in the variety of plants and other foliage found there. Though Rose is the most beautiful flower a Garden of roses alone would not be so beautiful if there were no other plants, he said. In other words, he was stressing that unity in diversity is natural. On the cultural front he was impressed by the Kandy Esala Perahera, which was a fine example of multi-religious and multi-cultural diversity.
Unity in diversity is the characteristic of all successful nations, he argued. Nations and empires prospered when they had multi-cultural unity and they deteriorated or were destroyed when that unity was replaced by the hegemony of one ethnic community over the others. He referred to Iraq, Syria, Roman and Ottoman empires et al as examples of states and empires that fell apart due to the lack of multi-cultural unity.
Modern globalization
Hinting that uni-culturalism is abnormal in todays world, he showed that all nations are multi-cultural, particularly almost all cities are multi-cultural, he said. We also see that development of trade, communications and international and internal migration has given a tremendous boost to diversity instead of uniformity and multi-culturalism instead of uni-culturalism due to the advent of modern globalization. Taking the examples of Greece and Turkey Prof. Davtoglu showed how uni-culturalism leads to separation of communities.
Emphasizing the equality of all languages and cultures he showed how the denial of language and cultural rights of communities lead to internal strife and destabilization of countries. Even if we are afraid to look in the mirror at ourselves a glance at Israel or Bosnia or apartheid South Africa would suffice for us to comprehend the death and destruction caused by unilateral suppression of one community by another. Similarly Canada, Norway, India among others point to the vitality of ethnic and religious multi-culturalism.
For multi-culturalism to become a basis for peace it should be developed at four levels, Professor Davtoglu said. They are local or neighbourhood level, national level, regional level and international level.
First of all villages or neighbourhoods should be united with no ethnic or religious feuds. Diversity should be taken as strength. This would prevent any outside interference in disturbing the unity and harmony in the area. Unless neighbourhood unity and diversity exists there cannot be any national unity and harmony.
National level multi-culturalism demands that the national state respects and practice policies of ethnic, religious equality of all communities and refrain from any type of racial or religious discrimination. The language rights of all communities including the numerically minor communities should be respected with no compromise with hegemonic forces. There should be political, economic and cultural equality of all citizens and equitable distribution of wealth.
United Nations
National multi-culturalism will be difficult to maintain if there are regional powers in the neighbouring region influencing divisive internal forces. All countries, big or small, developed or undeveloped, in the region should be equal. Economic or military strength should not be a criterion of superiority. This is the third level of multi-culturalism desired.
At the international level too there should prevail multi-cultural diversity and harmony. This is easier said than done. There can be no country that is more equal than the others. That is why it is impossible to accept the discriminatory nature of the United Nations, the veto powers given to 5 out of nearly 200 nations in the world, said Prof. Davtoglu. He likewise contested the authority of the 5 + 1 countries (China, Russia, Britain, France, the United States and Germany) in taking decisions with regard to the nuclear programme of North Korea. Where is the equality of nations, he queried.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who spoke before the Guest Speaker also expressed himself in the same vein as the latter. He showed how all communities inhabiting our island have lived in unity and harmony through centuries. Whenever entire Sri Lanka was united under one sovereign different sub-kingdoms existed autonomously under the sovereign monarch respecting the unity of the country, he said. The existence of Hindu Gods and their worship by Buddhists as well as the intermingling of communities through marriage etc. are good examples of religious and communal diversity, he said. The Muslim community also assimilated the customs and practices of Sinhala and Tamil communities amidst whom they settled and lived for over a Century, he added. Sri Lanka belongs to all these communities and all of them should have equal rights, he insisted. The Constitution that is being drafted would ensure a climate conducive to all citizens and communities to live with equal rights, privileges, dignity and in harmony, he reiterated.

Navy chief visits Galle maritime security operation centre
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne visited the Galle Maritime Security Operations Centre on an inspection tour recently.
The main purpose of the visit has to observe the preparations at the centre to provide security to commercial vessels of the Netherlands crisscrossing the Indian ocean.

The Netherlands which owns the world's most modern commercial ships has a fleet over 1,200 commercial vessels owned by shipping firms such as Nedloyd, Netherland lines and Epil which service the Indian ocean ports. On the directions of the President, the Navy took over the duty of providing facilities to maritime security teams on November 13, 2015.
The Navy's maritime security operation centres in Galle, Hambantota and Colombo have earned Rs. 3,855,685,681 to state coffers by providing security to 11,105 ship movements in the Indian Ocean.

The New Member..!
The members of the club appeared a disgruntled lot as their President conducted their weekly meeting. A bespectacled man, normally very quiet, but today greatly agitated, rose from his traditional place near the door, his face pale and manner perturbed, Mr President, he said, and his voice quivered with concern, There is not much importance given to our projects by the governor of our association! The other members nodded vigorously, happy that one among their midst had expressed their deep anguish. We have planted two bougainvillea plants, given my old computer to a school, gifted a bedsheet to an orphanage, but the governor has not acknowledged or congratulated us in his communications!
There was a murmur of disapproval, and the President beckoned for quiet, I am well aware of the silence of our beloved governor, said the President, and let me assure you it has disturbed me greatly, I think our problem is the photographs we sent him!
The members clapped at their wise presidents observation. They had seen the pictures taken by one of the members and had quietly agreed they were not of the best quality.
Yes, said the member who had initially raised the point, I agree! Our projects could compete any day with those of other clubs; why our president looked so cute planting those two saplings, much better than all those other club presidents donatingtoilets for railway stations and building classrooms for poor students! Bah anybody can do that! The members clapped lustily.
We need better pics! shouted the immediate past president.
I second that! said the present president.
From now on let us use only iPhones when pics are taken! said another member.
Samsung quality is equally good! said the same bespectacled member, raising his phone to the ceiling.
Order! Order! shouted the President.
I think I have a better suggestion! screamed a lady member above the din.
What is it madam asked the President, who preferred calling all ladies madam so his wife wouldnt get upset. We would love to hear what you have to say madam!
I agree to the importance of good pictures that should be sent out and put up on social media! said the lady member, I have observed that the better the picture, the more appreciation a club receives! I propose we induct a cameraman as a member of our club! A photographer of such precise technic and expertise whos pictures will immediately have us catapulted into the eyes of the higher ups!
The roar of approval that swept the club, could even be heard in the parking lot and the drivers there smiled their bosses were in a good mood, Bravo! Bravo! cried all the club members as the club approved the motion and the members went home, determined to induct the best photographer in town, who would change their fortunes in the district, and maybe raise one of them to be a future governor..!

No-Confidence Motion against former Finance Minister no longer has any effect: Speaker
The No-Confidence Motion against former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake submitted by the Joint Opposition will no longer has any effect, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced in Parliament yesterday.
Speaker Jayasuriya told the House that there is no reason for him to go ahead with the NCM as the minister concerned has tendered resignation. The Speaker made this observation after Karunanayakes special statement in Parliament. The JO handed over the NCM against Karunanayake signed by 33 MPs on August 2. The Speaker had previously stated that he would consult the Attorney General and give a ruling by yesterday.
Watchful of punishment former CB Governor will undergo: Amaraweera
UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said in Parliament yesterday he was watchful of the fate of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
We are watchful of the punishments former CB Governor Manhendran has to undergo.
Removing him from the office of CB Governor is not enough. Corrective measures should be taken with regard to the financial loss the State incurred, the minister said speaking at the adjournment debate.
The minister commended Minister Karunanayakes move to resign from his portfolio and said the courts in the time to come would decide whether Karunanayake was guilty over the allegations.
Nobody can get away after cheating public money is the message his resignation gives out, Amaraweera said.
When we first came up with the proposal to set up the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, some frowned at us saying it was a move to cover up the incident. Today, it has been more effective than filing a court case, he said.
I must remind you that this is not the first financial fraud revealed by the COPE. When Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was chairing it, the Committee found financial irregularities running to approximately Rs. 30,000 million. We are yet to find what happened to those COPE reports. The COPE members could be happy today. This is actually a peoples achievement, he said.
Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement presented in Parliament
The Government yesterday in Parliament presented the Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement signed between the China Merchant Port Holdings (Pvt.) Limited and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake presented the agreement at the commencement of sittings.
The agreement was inked on July 29.
Ravis resignation no victory for Government or Opposition: Handunetti
The resignation of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is not a victory for the Government or the Opposition, JVP MP Sunil Handunetti said.
Joining in the Adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday, COPE Chairman Handunnetti, said the ministers resignation was no cause for the Government and the JO to revel in pleasure.
Those in the Government must understand that they still have a long way to go to restore the broken public confidence in them and their good governance concept. Resigning after frauds were revealed does not reflect any Yahapalanaya. The Finance Minister having to resign within two years is not in any way an achievement for the Government. It could have been better if Minister Karunanayake had tendered his resignation much earlier. He resigned knowing that he could not defeat the No-Confidence Motion, he said. On the other hand, the Joint Opposition should not think that all their previous frauds and corruption charges could be covered up from this incident. People gave mandate to the Government to reveal financial misappropriations of those who previously ruled. The Government has failed in this commitment. The JO could be contended today only if there are no thieves in their group, he said. MP Handunetti said that if follow up actions were taken on the revelations made in the four latest COPE reports, some of the Opposition MPs would even be compelled to resign from their Parliamentary seats.
The challenge before the Government is to reveal that history and dispel the public opinion that the Government protects the corrupt lot. At the same time the Government must rule the country efficiently, he said. The COPE Chairman, expressing his contentment over the progress made on bond scam investigations following the special COPE report, thanked the tireless contribution of all COPE members including the Auditor General in the investigations.
The MP said the investigations should continue to find out what happened to the cheated money. He said measures must be taken to recover the economic loss to the country from the bond scam.
JOs claim public finance precariously placed, unfounded: Media Minister
The Joint Oppositions (JO) claim that the public finance is precariously placed is unfounded, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Joining the Adjournment debate on Central Bank annual report for the year 2016 in Parliament yesterday, the minister told even though some were trying to project that the countrys public finance is in deep crisis that was an unfounded allegation as per the macro-economic situation of the country.
The contents in any Central Bank or Finance Ministry annual report do not support that allegation. The recent report and statements of the international finance agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also negate such allegations. Instead they have commended the Governments efforts to rebuild the economy, the minister said. The minister said the countrys economy was in abysmal condition when the Government took office in early 2015, but it could be saved by following farsighted economic policies.
Minister Samaraweera hailed the contribution of former Finance Minister Karunanayake to create a stable economy and commended his decision to tender his resignation over allegations yet to be proved.
Tense situation in Parliament
A tense situation arose in Parliament yesterday when the Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena remarked over Opposition Leaders statement after Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayakes statement of resignation.
Members of the government and the opposition sides exchanged words when MP Dinseh Gunawardena was heard saying shame on you.
Senior members of the government side were seen bringing the situation back to normal.
MP Wijesiri to hand over No-Confidence Motion against Minister Musthapha
UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri yesterday told Parliament that he intends to hand over a No-Confidence Motion against Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
The MP, observing that Minister Musthapha was repetitively absent in the House to reply to the questions pertaining to Uva Provincial Council Chief Minister Chamara Dasanayake, alleged that Musthapha has failed in his duties as the subject minister. As an MP in the Yahapalana Government, I am ready to present a No-confidence motion against the minister and I request the support of backbenchers for it. The Yahapalana Government has room for such actions against the ministers, he said.
The MP said he filed complaint at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption as the charges he made against the Chief Minister had been proven with the audit inquiries. The Speaker at many a times before told the MPs to pay attention to the allegations, but in vain. For some time now, the minister does not turn up in Parliament to answer to my questions, he said.
MP Wijesiri had been raising question after question in Parliament for the last two years on allegations against the Uva Chief Minister over financial misappropriations and irregularities.
The minister constantly maintained the position that he could not interfere into provincial issues coming under devolved subjects.
No Faith Motion against me not technical: Ravi
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that he resigned from his ministerial portfolio despite the legal advises that technically there was no No Faith Motion handed over to the Speaker against him.
He said since it was moral to resign from the position respecting the good governance that he reached this decision.
My legal advisors advised me that there was no No Confidence Motion against me since two confidence motions could not be moved against a same member during one session of Parliament, Ravi Karunanayake said. So a No Confidence Motion is not there before the Chair.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday after Opposition leader R. Sampanthan made his views on the Ravi Karunanayake's statement on the resignation.
JO members agitate in Parliament over Samurdhi slash
The Joint Opposition (JO) members agitated in Parliament yesterday charging that the Government was slashing the Samurdhi benefits of low income families.
The JO members, who were wearing black arm bands or neck scarves as a token of protest, held up posters and shouted slogans against the Government.
As Parliament heated up, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was forced to suspend the sittings and call for a party leaders meeting.
JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena raising a question under the Standing Order 23 (2) alleged that the Government was revising the list of Samurdhi beneficiaries and as a result a large number of low income families have been deprived of Samurdhi benefit.
I demand to know under what basis the Government is revising the list and how many beneficiaries will be deprived of Samurdhi. Do you admit that political allegiances are the basis for the revisions being made Gunawardena asked.
As MP Gunawardena was making the speech, the JO members were circulating black bands and placards among their group members. The posters carried the slogans, Immediately stop Samurdhi curtailment, Do not touch the Social Security Fund and Ministers, arent you ashamed to slash Samurdhi benefit while importing vehicles. MP Chamal Rajapaksa was neither wearing a black band nor supporting the demonstration.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, while stating that Social Welfare and Empowerment Minister S B Dissanayake would reply to the question raised, assured that the revision of list is being done in an impartial manner and that nobody would face any injustice. The minister reminded the House that the low income families supporting the UNP were deprived of Samurdhi benefit for 20 long years.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake requested the Government to halt the curtailment of Samurdhi till the subject minister make a clarification to the House.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said he is of the opinion that Samurdhi benefit must be facilitated to all low income families irrespective of their political allegiances.
Amidst the tense situation, the Speaker was forced to suspend the sittings around 11.30am as his repeated requests for the JO MPs not to disrupt the proceedings were unheeded.
As the sittings resumed at 11.55am following a Party Leaders Meeting, Minister Karunathilake told the House that Minister S. B. Dissanayake would reply to the question today.

Passionto perform!
Mahamaya Girls College Kandy is a school that shows great promise. When it comes to drama, the girls are eager to get up on stage and perform to the best of their abilities. Dramatic Moves feature the thespians of Mahamaya who are determined to put up a brilliant show.
Teacher in Charge, Nishanthi De Silva felt that one reason the girls blossom is because they have a very good support system.
Up until now under the Literary Music and Drama Society (LMDS), we have been conducting dramas for competitions. However as of this year we have decided to form a separate Drama Club. Our children at Mahamaya love to perform in dramas. We have to be thankful to our Principal I. Withanachchi for her unwavering support and also I want to thank Kumuduni Jayawardena and N. Nanayakkara as well for helping me, said De Silva.
De Silva feels that drama helps you improve your English and the subtleties of the language. Learning Shakespearean languages has its advantages.
They are able to develop their audibility. They develop their confidence. For a teacher, guiding and molding these students give me such satisfaction. These girls learn a lot from drama. Drama at Mahamaya has a certain structure. There are teachers in charge of Junior and Senior dramas. The teachers take the girls under their wings and stay afterschool with the girls and practices commence, stated De Silva.
Getting on stage is the key
Our girls are encouraged to really interact with the role they perform. We discuss the character with them on a one to one basis and they go on the internet to research. They overcome their stage fright by practice. Getting on stage is the key. Drama helps you to face the challenges of the day to day life. When we are going to do a drama we have to face a lot of challenges from the beginning to the end. They learn how to face victory and defeat. I feel that we need to be with the girls and have a friendly relationship. We need to take what is within them and get the best out of them, explained De Silva.
Team spirit
President Shihari Herath feels that drama helps you rejoice at victory and gracefully accept defeat.
Our school is very helpful to us when taking part in dramas, providing us the facilities. Drama has taught us many things such as how to cooperate with each other and work according to a time table. We also learn to balance our school work and extracurricular activities. Drama life at Mahamaya allows the girls to master the language, and in that sense the girls really become cultured, said Herath.
Drama allows you to know the outside world.
The main thing I gained from doing drama is team spirit. Preparing for a Shakespeare drama is quite a challenge and is not easy. We practice a lot which have required a lot of sacrifices. It really is very exacting. All in all it is a great opportunity to perform in a drama competition. It is not about winning. It is also about knowing how to gracefully accept defeat, explained Herath.
Drama is fun because at the end of the day you get to know someone.
Getting into the skin of a Shakespeare character is really difficult. In one Shakespeare drama I played a male character. Being a female and doing a male character is really difficult. So first we need to study the whole story. And on stage we have to flawlessly perform the character. In A Midsummer Nights Dream play, I played the role of Demetrius and that character is one of my favorites, pointed out Herath.
An all-round experience
Vice President, Hymini Wijesekara feels that apart from her branch of knowledge as a science student, drama gives her another view of the world. Another window to look at the world.
Drama really helps us multi-task. We learn to balance our studies and other school related work. It is an all-round experience. It is also a way of reducing our stress levels. On the whole it is really fun. Drama is very helpful to me. As a science student, drama helps me to learn about other cultural aspects. What you get out of drama is so different from what you would get from another discipline. When preparing for our roles, we study the character intensively. We study about the whole drama. Then I get to know the story and then I get into my character and keep on learning. I need to get into the character. Research is of course paramount because even the minute details matter. The expressions count a lot, said Wijesekara.
Learning from each other
Secretary Dinushi Vithanage feels that exposure brings adaptability.
Drama develops our confidence and we learn how to work as a team. Getting up on stage gives us the exposure we need to grow in confidence. It teaches us to take the initiative such as making our own costumes. Drama teaches you how to adapt basically, cooperating with so many people in society. It is a process of learning from each other, said Vithanage.
Not easy
Drama really helps us develop our observational skills through the character. Shakespeare was a great poet, playwright and actor who was able to weave an intricate plot combining all aspects of society. So we gain insights into society and learn about society. So working with the girls really gives us a perspective and understanding of so many aspects of society, said Treasurer Jashanee Fernando.
Winning a Shakespeare competition is really great. But a good performance is its own reward.
We target a lot on Shakespeare dramas and we understand that winning a Shakespeare contest is not easy. After we perform, we understand that the experience of taking part in a Shakespeare drama is itself a reward. We are always happy to work with each other. We treat each other equally and all is fair. We get full support from our school. To win a competition you need team spirit. No matter what challenges come our way we face them together. We have all made a lot of sacrifices. Forming a drama club in school is a challenge but I feel that we can meet this challenge, explained Fernando.
So many sacrifices
We work together, so we learn to get along with so many personalities. We enact different types of characters. So by playing these roles we learn about the world outside. We get to learn so many things because there is so much outside that we dont know. One challenge we face is the scarcity of time when doing a competition, so we have to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. So we have had to make so many sacrifices as well. So in addition to practicing we need to attend to the other logistics like preparing the props.
One drama we did was Midsummer Night Dream and I feel that Shakespeare dramas are very entertaining. The learning is so much. So you have to really keep raising the standards. When enacting a play we leave no stone unturned.
We even look at other dramas performed by other schools to sponge off some tips. Then we get an overall idea and little by little adapt to the character, pointed out Vice Secretary Nimesha Jayawardhana.
The girls all agreed that working together has never been a problem for them because they are there for each other.

Printcare invests Rs 750 mn  in revolutionary technology
Printcare Plc, the nations top packaging exporter and pioneer in Sri Lankas tea packaging sector, recognised for its proven ability to redefine conventional printing and packaging capabilities through constant technological evolution, will break new ground again.
Investing over Rs. 750 million (US$ 5 million) in technology hitherto unavailable in this country, Printcare has once again expanded its capabilities to provide its clients with unrivaled functionalities.
We have a history of innovation and a track record of introducing new technologies. These investments follow our rich history of knowing where the curve is going and staying ahead of it, said, Printcare General Manager Krishna Ravindran. With only limited technology of this nature in Asia, Printcares new Gallus RCS equipment is set to redefine local label printing capabilities enabling maximum flexibility in the selection of printing methods and an exceptionally high level of automation.
In todays world of intense competition, brand owners crave innovation and will grab it when it becomes available. We have known our customers to be extremely progressive and they are anxious to keep pace with the rest of the world. Our goal is to facilitate this move. Ravindran said.
He explained how the tea bag industry showcased higher growth in the 1980s after Printcare made superior packaging available to it.
Prior to the advent of Printcare there were hardly 10 tea bag machines in the country and they were importing all their material.
Today, there are well over 500 and Sri Lanka is the largest tea bag producing country in the world. Also, the companys introduction of high value box making and embellished cartons recently has produced similar results enabling Sri Lanka's tea boxes to be showcased with the best overseas.

Ravi K resigns: Time will decide my place in history
The AG must show same efficiency in other cases:
I resign with pride:
Arjun, Anika and my daughter were school friends :
This is the promise of good governance, delivered:
Foreign Minister Ravi Karuananyake making a 20 minute long statement in Parliament yesterday resigned from his ministerial portfolio.
Commencing his speech at 1.30 p.m, Karunanayake explained the reasons for his resignation the crux of which was his current residence at the Monarch residencies. He said that it was due to the incumbent governments policies, that a Minister of his seniority was questioned and thereafter tendered his resignation.
The Attorney Generals Department has been able to question a minister of this government due to the new political culture that has been brought about by the good governance government, said United National Party Deputy Leader and former Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He said that his resignation from the Ministerial portfolio was historic since a Minister or even someone related to a Minister during the previous regime could not be questioned by the Attorney Generals Department.
Even the Deputy Solicitors General could not open a file of such a person during that period, said Karunanayake. I resign from my ministerial portfolio reflecting this new political culture that has been brought about by the good governance government.
He also said that the Attorney Generals Department reviewed a report of 8803 pages within 48 hours related to his matter which was commendable and a good sign.
I request them to exhibit the same efficiency in the matters related to the loan obtained by the government, at the bills brought in by the Yahapalana government for the benefit of the country and in cases against the ministers of the previous government, MP Karunanayake said.
We hope the department would show the same efficiency with regard to the 87 files submitted to the department by the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) against the members of the former government.
After making his statement he left his front row seat to become a backbencher where he was greeted by handshakes by government members.
He said that the Media and some opposition politicians demand that he be crucified over the issue being probed by a Presidential Commission of inquiry on the treasury bond incident. I decided to resign to set an example for the good governance policy we introduced and I do so without regret, Karunanayake said. I am proud to sacrifice my position. I do so for my party and people whom I always considered above me and my personal gains.
He said that allegations were made against him during the recent past in the media and social media and there had been a debate over this issue and some members raised it in parliament too. He added that a no confidence motion too had been submitted against him.
Therefore,I thought of making an explanation to Parliament, Karunanayake said. I have given evidence with regard to this before the Treasury Bond Commission. I have a house in Battaramulla and it was under repair. I needed to find a new place. I do not have an official residence. My family members too were looking for a suitable place. They told me that there was a house available at Monarch Residencies and it belonged to Nahil Wijesuriyas daughter who is also a school friend of my daughter. We moved to that house. Nahil Wijesuriyas daughter did not want to rent the House to a politician. Therefore my daughter proposed to rent the house to a company belonging to Arjuna Aloysius who is a school friend of both my daughter and Nahil Wijesuriyas daughter. The house was rented in the name of that company and later my daughter settled the amount to that company. As the owner of the house decided to sell it, a company owned by our family decided to purchase it .
He added that they obtained a loan from the Seylan Bank for that purpose. He tabled the documents pertaining to the loan facility No Seylan Bank REF No WTL/CRD/2016-1535, 29 September 2016.
I joined politics after working with former Minister Lalith Athulathmudali who too had been accused wrongly by his opponents. He had been described as a person who swallowed ships. I was a successful businessman before I joined politics. During my career I never earned anything through illegal means. I only lost my money because of politics. I never earned from politics, Karunanayake said. I have no need to acquire a house through illegal means. Many MPs in this House know that I have a house at Battaramulla. Not only those in our side but also those in the opposition too have come to that house. They came there to have political discussions, as friends, to eat and drink and enjoy and sometimes to crossover to this side.
He also said parliamentarians all knew of his assets. They have come to my house. They also know that I have never earned through illegal means. They also know that I never made use of my political power to earn money. Many of those who signed the no confidence motion against me too are aware of this fact, Karunanayake said. Have you ever heard of an occasion when a minister had been summoned before a commission. We know the conduct and behaviour of the ministers of former regime with heads swollen from power. The presidents used to act like kings. They always bypassed the law. They are still trying to do so even after losing power.
He said that the they were not like that. We respect the law and bow our heads before justice. I displayed that sign of a new political culture by giving evidence before the Presidential Commission, Karunanayake said. The commission was appointed to investigate treasury bonds. But now the talk is about a private companies and renting houses.
He also said that the Judges of the commission had to intervene and warn on several occasions against the Additional Solicitor General who questioned me at the treasury bond commission. He added that he believed that the judges of the commission would ascertain the truth at the end of their deliberations.
I would not talk of the conduct or lack of professional manners of the ASG here, Karunanayake said. We soon would know as to how and why the ASG behaved in such an aggeressive manner at the commission. He could have been motivated in a race for obtaining promotions or there could be another reason.
He further said that the Attorney Generals Department and Solicitor Generals have the freedom of questioning a minister of their own government under this government. He also said we had a time when the Department of the Attorney General was afraid of questioning ministers. He added that they were afraid even to open a file connected to the ministers of that government.
The Department of the Attorney General could review a document of 8,803 pages in 48 hours. It is good sign. We hope the Attorney Generals Department would show the same efficiency to investigate the loans obtained by the governments and at the bills brought in by the Yahapalana government for the benefit of the country and in cases against the ministers of the previous government. We hope the department would show the same efficiency with regard to the 87 files submitted to the department by the Financial Crimes Investigations Divisions against the members of the former government, Karunanayake said.
I have worked tirelessly for 32 years for my party. I have been with the party during the times of hardships. I faced numerous challenges on behalf of the party. I received death threats. There were cases against me. There was one case pertaining to foreign exchange and it was heard for 10 years to harass me. Finally the court set me free of all charges. In that case, Raj Rajaratnam too had been accused. Indrajith Coomaraswamy who worked for Rajaratnam is the Governor of the Central Bank today. I dwell on these matters to show how the opposition harassed us and took political revenge. They took political revenge then and are now engaged in character assassination.
He further said that not only was he harassed but his family members too were subjected to much harassment. He added that they once sent a skull to his paralyzed mother. He also added that they had sent parts of bodies to his wife and children. He added that despite all those harassment, he worked for the benefit of his party members. He said that he prevented the split of party. He worked to defeat conspiracies against the party leadership. He always protected his party and party leadership.
I would continue to stick to that policy, Karunanayake said. I will always protect the party, partymen and its leadership. I would set my party above me. We worked for a regime change in 2015. We joined with all progressive forces to effect a regime change. We brought forward a common candidate. It was I who gave the swan symbol for the common candidate at the presidential election. I did all this for the future of this country.
He said that he used the ministerial portfolio to serve the people, to give justice to his party supporters who had been suffering for more than 20 years. He added that all those in this House know that his phone was kept on 24 hours. He did not make use of his position for his personal gain but for the benefit of the party.
The portfolios, positions and posts are temporary, Ravi Karunanayake said. What would last is only the work we did and our honesty. This is the hard fact so many would not realize . They think that power and posts would be there forever. They always dream to remain in power and to regain it even after losing it. They would do anything for that purpose. They would not give damn for this country if they can take power.
He added that they changed all these with the Janurary 8 revolution.
There is no basis for any allegations raised against me. I have no link to any of these allegations. But some groups and media have made me guilty already. The media in this country acted in an unprecedented manner during the last 10-12 days. It is their opinion that I should be paraded to the cross and crucified there. I will not be afraid of this . Jesus Christ was accused wrongly. The Buddha was accused wrongly, Karunanayake said. According to the Ashta Loka Dharma (Eight worldly conditions) any one would have to face challenges and situations similar to this. I have the strength to face these challenges. I have observed that there is a conspiracy to destabilize the Yahapalana regime making use of the allegations against me.
He said further that he felt there was a plot to disrupt the work launched by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for restoring democracy. Those who were rejected by people, engaged in various frauds and corruption, committed crimes are there in this conspiracy against the government. Their wish is to regain power in order to get away from the crimes they committed, Karunanayake said. We would not let these power hungry elements to attack the UNP. We would not let these power hungry elements to dismantle the Yahapalana government. We cannot let them make use of allegations against me to attack my party, my government and our work for democracy. Therefore I decided to resign from my post setting an example.
He said that history would decide his place.
Many previous leaders of my party had been wrongly accused in the same manner. Sir John Kotelawela, Dudley Senanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, R Premadasa and J.R Jayewardene all have been accused wrongly in this manner. But later all those charges were proven false , Karunanayake said. The Holy Quran has said that the truth cannot be suppressed for long and those who try to suppress the truth will be defeated. That is why I say that the history would do justice. Thirukkural Tamil poem instructs us to follow the path of the righteous and to do the right thing always. My wish is to do the right thing always and to serve honestly. Come what may I would continue to serve my people, my party and my country. I will always stand for the truth. I would continue my struggle to eliminate crime and corruption from my country. I would remain dedicate to the causes of January 08 revolution.
He said that he did not regret his decision to resign but was proud to set the example.
I sacrifice my position for the honour of this august assembly. I sacrifice my post for the benefit of our party and all those who love this party. I sacrifice this post for the benefit of all those people in my electorate. I sacrifice this post for the benefit of the new political culture we introduced. I sacrifice this post for the democracy of this country. I sacrifice this post for the continuance of our government, Minister Karunanayake said. Therefore I am proud of my decision.
I have to mention here the mental pressure undergone by my wife and children. Some sections of media try to assassinate the characters of my wife and my daughters. They have become subjects of false accusations. They are undergoing so much pressure. But their support and love to me too have helped me make this decision. I love my wife Mela, my daughters Onella, Shenella and Minnella for that strength. I love you always, Ravi Karunanayake said. There is one stanza in Dhammapada that comes to my mind at this point. It says: If one wrongs a person who should not be wronged, one who is pure and is free from moral defilements, the evil falls back upon that fool, like fine dust thrown against the wind. There is another stanza which says: As a mountain of rock is unshaken by wind, so also, the wise are unperturbed by blame or by praise.
He said further because of those reasons he was a proud person to take that decision on behalf of his party, his country.

Resignation, a reflection of new political culture: PM
The resignation of Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake reflects the new political culture which was brought about with the good governance government, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that he was proud of ushering in that tradition and culture in the country, making history.
The Premier made these observations addressing Parliament soon after the statement made by Minister Karunanayake on his resignation. The PM also said that the Deputy Leader of his party told him that he needed to resign from the ministerial portfolio.
I told him to take that decision after discussing it with the President, the Premier revealed . He met with the President on Wednesday and later he went to meet the President with me and Minister Rajitha Senaratne. He handed over his letter of resignation. Some were demanding his resignation this morning too but he had already submitted his resignation.
The Prime Minister said that Ravi Karunanayakes resignation also signifies that the government would not interfere with the probe by the Presidential Commission on Treasury Bonds. There is no similar example in the political history, Premier Wickramasinghe said. This is an unprecedented instance. The incumbent government has realized its good governance goals.
Where in this country had a minister been summoned before a commission, questioned the Premier. Where had a minister resigned for making a speech or two We are introducing a new political culture. If anyone in the UNP is accused of stealing we would remove him or her. We will not harbour thieves.
At this occasion the Joint Opposition members were heard shouting.
Responding to them the Premier further said that he did not accuse anyone of anything. I just explained the partys position on thieves. Then why only a section there (pointing towards joint opposition) got upset and reacted (pointing towards the JVP and TNA) None here was disturbed by what I said.
He also said that the reaction indicates where the thieves are. If there are no sand thieves, sil-redi thieves, drug dealers, tsunami thieves, carom board thieves, cement thieves among you why do you get upset, questioned Premier. You could not investigate any theft for 10 years. You killed Lasantha Wickramatunge, you abducted and killed Eknaligoda.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that Minister Karunanayke did not go before the Supreme Court to obtain stay orders to avoid the commission. He went before the commission, made his statement, came here and resigned to take a seat back there,he said . We saw what happened to Priyasath Dep under the previous government. When Dep was acting independent and criticized then government, he was transferred to the Supreme Court to prevent him becoming Attorney General. But Dep was lucky and became Chief justice.
He also said that media freedom has been guaranteed. I remember there was a time when the media called us traitors. They even called for my resignation. Today everyone is called a thief. We are called thieves, the Premier said. The person who writes that we are thieves is also a thief. Today media has the freedom to write anything. When I read papers in the morning, I am happy to see media exercising their freedom. I am proud to see the change.

Singer Group revenue crosses Rs 25 bn at half year
Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC results for the six months ending June 30, 2017 showed a good revenue growth of 13.6% to Rs 25.1 billion compared to the same period in the previous year.
There was a strong growth in several product categories such as smart phones that grew by 46%, bottle coolers and deep freezers by 32%, televisions by 22% and furniture by 14%.
This is a commendable growth in view of increased Value Added Tax (VAT), higher interest rates and currency devaluation affecting customer purchasing power.
The continuous drought in the dry zone and floods in the wet zone hugely affected households in Sri Lanka, 30% of which are dependent on agriculture.
When customer income increases, the demand for consumer durables is above that of the general market demand and when customer income decreases the demand for consumer durables is below that of general market demand.
Due to slack market conditions, Singers gross margins were reduced to 29% compared to 31% in the previous year. Increased mix of smart phone sales with lower margins also impacted the overall group gross margin.
The group was successful in lowering selling and administration expenses from 22.3% last year to 21.3% in the current year. As a result, operating profit had a marginal increase.
Net Finance Cost for the half year increased by 45% to Rs. 956 million largely due to increase in interest rates.
As a result, Group Net Profit was Rs. 666.5 million, a reduction of 27% compared to the previous year. In the case of the Company, Net Profit was Rs. 525.5 million, a decrease of 26%.
Commenting on the Half Year results of 2017, Asoka Pieris, Group CEO stated, We are anticipating gradual improvements in the business conditions during the remainder of 2017 and are pursuing strategies to improve margins and lower the costs.

Sri Lankas suicide rate up
About 14 or 15 persons in every 100,000 Sri Lankans commit suicide, Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Thilini Rajapaksha said.
Addressing a seminar at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, she said in 1997, Sri Lanka became the first country relating to suicides. About 47 in every 100,000 persons committed suicide. In 1995, Sri Lanka had the world's second highest suicide rate. But in 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, only five or 10 Sri Lankans committed suicide.
According to Dr. Rajapaksha, the majority of the suicide victims are young males bellow the age of 30. Most of them are between the ages of 15 and 24.
"It is women who try to commit suicide more than men. Many of them end in hospital beds receiving treatment," she said.
Depression and disorders caused by the use of alcohol are two main factors that encourage suicides. Most young people commit suicide due to difficulty of tolerating distress associated with an interpersonal conflict, she said.
Most adults commit suicide due to depression, Rajapaksha said.

Sri Lanka recalls fast bowlers Chameera, Gamage
Rain in Pallekele forces teams to practice indoors:
Fast bowlers Dushmantha Chameera and Lahiru Gamage have been included in the squad of 15 picked by Sri Lanka for the third and final cricket Test against India starting at the Pallekele International Stadium on Saturday.
However there is no place for batsman Danushka Gunathilaka who made his Test debut at Galle in the absence of captain Dinesh Chandimal and was retained in the squad for the SSC Test.
Chameera replaces the injured Nuwan Pradeep who broke down after bowling only 17.4 overs in Indias mammoth total of 622-9 declared in the second Test played at the SSC.
Pradeep is out for three weeks with a grade one left hamstring tear.
Uncapped Gamage takes the place of left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who has been rested because of a stiff back.
Gamage, 29 a right-arm fast bowler from CCC has appeared for his country in 5 ODIs that includes a tour to India with the Sri Lanka team in 2014.
Chameera who has been sidelined by injuries throughout his two-year career has appeared in 6 Tests the last being at Port Elizabeth against South Africa in December 2016.
He recently returned to the Sri Lanka side after a back injury to play in the ODI against Zimbabwe last month.
Lahiru Kumara and Vishwa Fernando, another uncapped fast bowler retain their places in the squad. Although Sri Lanka has strengthened their fast bowling line-up by including four seamers they are short of international experience.
Kumara and Chameera have together played in only 13 Tests and captured 45 wickets while Gamage and Fernando have still to break into the Test circuit.
Sri Lanka has however retained their spin trio of Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara and Lakshan Sandakan.
Sri Lanka may leave it till the morning of the Test to finalise their bowling combination as it has been raining in Pallakele.
We managed to get practice yesterday (Wednesday) but today we are confined to the indoor nets. We have not had a look at the wicket yet because its raining, said cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
The last Test played at Pallakele in July last year saw Herath and Sandakan run through the Australian batting taking 16 wickets between them. Sandakan making his Test debut took a match bag of seven wickets.
Sri Lanka trail India 0-2 in the three-match series and are battling with injuries to key players trying to avoid an embarrassing 3-0 whitewash at the hands of the world no. 1 ranked Test team.
Meanwhile India has called up uncapped left-arm spin bowling all-rounder Axar Patel for the suspended Ravindra Jadeja for the Pallekele Test.

Swim-Wall and Meubel House: a natural fit
Furniture and swimwear may sound like an odd coupling at first, but when showcasing high-end fashion design at the retail level, utilising the right conceptual space can do wonders in terms of presentation, for an item of clothing as intimate as a swimsuit.
These were the thoughts behind the recently established partnership between Swim-Wall the retail platform of the internationally acclaimed Swim Week Colombo and the uniquely innovative furniture boutique Meubel House.
In the wake of the recently held Swim Week Colombo (SWC) that saw some of the biggest names in luxury swimwear including the UK-based Heidi Klein take the ramp by storm, the company brought its online store, the Swim Wall, to an accessible location in Colombo. A pop-up store was set up at the Jetwing Colombo 07, where SWCs top designs from the show were put on display for anyone wishing to get their hands on the latest and greatest in high-quality swimwear in town.
Full-length mirrors, among other items of furniture, of exquisite design were supplied to the Swim Wall by Meubel House ably complementing SWC aesthetic.
SWC Founder Ajay Vir Singh explaining the process said in a press release that the idea behind Swim-Wall was to establish a direct link between designer and consumer.
Swim Week Colombo applies modern design concepts to temporary spaces and creates pop-up retail stores throughout the year. The programme encourages the fashion retailing aspect of the show and creates opportunities for interaction between fashion designers and fashion consumers in curated spaces. We promote creativity in various aspects connected to fashion. Meubel House defines the connectivity between fashion and conceptual design of spaces he said.
Meubel House Head of Business Development, Shamli Mowlana said the relationship between his company and SWC was almost symbiotic, owing largely to their mutual love and respect for design thats simultaneously tasteful and exuberant.
It was a natural fit. Swim Week Colombos unique designs meshed well with our products quite organically. Of course, the spotlight ought to be on the items being sold, so naturally, one would expect the furniture of the space to take a backseat. But somehow, the end result was such that both the SWC swimwear and our own items of furniture combined to make a strong statement on the power of design, he said.

Udayanga wants warrant recalled

Defence counsel who appeared on behalf of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga today requested to recall the arrest warrant issued against him through the Interpol over alleged financial fraud that took place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
President's Counsel Anil Silva appearing on behalf of Udayanga Weeratunga further moved that the Fort Magistrate's order to impound two passports belonging to his client be suspended.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne announced that she would deliver an appropriate order in this regard on August 21.
On June 30, the Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered to impound two passports belonging to former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga in the magisterial inquiry pertaining to the controversial MiG aircraft transaction.
Accordingly, a diplomatic passport bearing number D 3643585 and a general passport bearing number N 5400885 was issued by the Sri Lankan government to Udayanga Weeratunga were ordered to be impounded by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in accordance with Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 51 C of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne earlier issued a warrant through the Interpol for the arrest of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that took place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Anil Silva PC submitted to Court that issuing of warrant against his client and impounding his passports had not been done in accordance with the law.
He further said Udayanga has been in Ukraine for nearly three decades.
The FCID conducting investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft transaction informed Court that they have sought the assistance of Interpol to trace former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga who is currently living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
 The FCID informed Court that they were yet to ascertain Udayangas exact address in UAE and further said he has visited multiple countries including Japan using passports issued by the Sri Lankan government.
 The FCID conducting investigations into the MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga as a suspect in the case through a B report dated October 11, 2016.
The FCID sought a warrant written in English through the Interpol from the Fort Magistrates Court to arrest former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga over alleged financial fraud that took place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
The FCID told Court that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to serve notices on Udayanga Weeratunga who has been residing in Ukraine for several years.
The FCID had informed Court that Udayanga Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack craft. The FCID said the deal amounted to US$14 million.
On June 9, 2016, the Colombo Fort Magistrate issued notices on Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up. The FCID had told Court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which allegedly earned through the Mig-27 transaction.
The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he wrote several articles regarding the financial irregularities that took place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price.
He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts were manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.

Unique and rich in culture!
Divided we fall but united we stand. There are some leaders who are determined to spread discord and enmity. We can only resist them by our bonds of friendship and trust. The Daily News recently attended the Location Opening Ceremony of South Asias First Chinese Cultural Center. The new premises started operating from August 8 and this is a giant stride in the relations between our two countries. Two rich cultures meeting together.
The Chinese Cultural Center was established under the direction of President of Peoples Republic of China, Xi Jinping, during his visit to Sri Lanka in September 2014.
Director of China Cultural Center Liwen Yue, called the event a moment of celebration and a historic milestones of the relations between the two countries. This journey was begun by the visit of President Xi Jinping during the presidency of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now the mission has been completed. The Center has its new premises. Now the best is yet to come.
We have experienced quite a lot of challenges along the way. We have grown and learnt and this is a moment of respect and gratitude. We are thankful to all our friends for their friendship and support along the way. First I wish to convey our sincere gratitude to our Chinese Embassy and Ambassador Yi Xianliang and his capable and efficient staff. They have given us guidance, help and direction, said Yue
The new center will be equipped with a library, classrooms for the purpose of conducting Chinese language programs and Chinese painting/craft lessons, an exhibition space to conduct painting/photography exhibitions. There will also be a kitchen with the facilities to conduct demonstrations and programs on authentic Chinese culinary art/style and a program assistance unit to help the students and academics to engage with the Chinese educational institutes for exchange programs.
This new center would not have been possible without the assistance provided by the Sri Lankan government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, BMICH and BCIS and numerous others who helped a great deal. Yue also acknowledged the Media Coverage without which no one would know about the existence of the center.
China Cultural Center is a non- profit organization established by the Chinese Government. So far there are 30 overseas Chinese Cultural Centers. The one in Sri Lanka is the first overseas cultural center in South Asia. This China Cultural Center is dedicated to cultural relations between our two countries  professional art performance, Chinese language teaching, Chinese Martial Arts and Chinese cooking and many other aspects. It will also organize international seminars.
We want to improve the mutual understanding and friendship of our two peoples. This will be a home and family to all who are interested in Chinese Culture. We hope that you, the Sri Lankans will be our frequent visitors, learning our language and read our books and watch our movies and just enjoy the aesthetic aspects. We will soon launch our website, said Yue.
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Palitha Thewarapperuma, pointed out the relations between Sri Lanka are China are truly old.
Fa-Hien was a celebrated 5th century Chinese Buddhist monk who visited Sri Lanka and spent much time in Sri Lanka. He returned to China and wrote a book on Sri Lanka. Our two countries have so much in common when you take into account our rich history. It is natural for such strong bonds to be forged.
We Sri Lankans have a rich cultural history. Take Sigiriya for example. It is a marvel. Still no one has figured out its water management technology. We have a great history. However the state of affairs in our country at the present is upsetting. The Chinese are certainly an industrious nation who respect their natural environment. We can see by this how developed they are. Fa- Hien journeyed widely through Sri Lanka. From his visit to Sri Lanka we can see that we have always had ties with China dating back to the 5th century, said Thewarapperuma.
Indeed Buddhism has also been part of these ties. After receiving independence from British Rule, the ties between Sri Lanka and China were further strengthened. In 1957, the two sides formally established the diplomatic relationship. Economic, Political and Cultural ties were formed. Such achievements are certainly praiseworthy.
The BMICH was built between 1970 and 1973. The convention center was a gift from the People's Republic of China in memory of S.W.R.D Bandaranaike. The BMICH has been a boon to Sri Lankan society and artistes. The cost it took to build the Nelum Pokuna was partly covered by China. This has been a huge help to our artistes.
Ambassador Yi Xianliang in his speech, spoke about the event as an exciting moment for him. The establishment of the cultural center between the two governments was an important decision. When it comes to ties between two countries culture is a very important part of the relationship.
The decision to set up this cultural center was a landmark decision. The power of culture cannot be underestimated. Fa-Hiens impact on the cultures of both our countries was touched upon by the Deputy Minister. Buddhism has had a significant influence on our relations. This cultural center is a family. Sri Lankans and Chinese alike. It is also open to anyone regardless of religion or race. It is a relationship. We should respect our differences and we should respect each other, said Xianliang.
This year we celebrate 60 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and China. Xianliang pointed out that culture goes beyond boundaries. Culture has the power to promote friendship and cooperation. That is why cultural exchange between China and Sri Lanka is so important.
We Chinese love peace. We want to further strengthen cultural exchange, said Xianliang.

VAT revenue up  by Rs 72.7 bn YoY
The VAT revenue collection has increased by Rs 72.7 billion during January to April 2017, a significant YoY growth of 90.9% compared to same period in 2016.
This has been as a result of the increased VAT rate and removal of some VAT exemptions in late 2016, a report tabulated by the Economic Intelligence Unit of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said.
VAT revenue exceeded the estimated revenue target for first four months by LKR 27.6 bn and accounted for 40.2% of the 2017 annual VAT revenue estimate. This is a significant improvement compared to the level of 28.2% recorded in 2016 VAT revenue performance hints that it is a potential source for bringing more than the forecasted level of one fifth of tax revenue for 2017. VAT amendments the implementation of RAMIS automation, and further measures to improve compliance can further boost revenue from of VAT in 2017.
Excise revenue is likely to remain week with the subdued demand for motor vehicle imports and high duty rates on alcohol and tobacco products, said the report.
Excise revenue grew by 4.9% YoY, an increase of LKR 7.3 bn during first four months of 2017. This accounted for 26.9% of the 2017 annual excise revenue estimate, much lower compared to the level of 32.6% recorded in 2016.
Excise revenue during first four months was largely impacted by the LKR 47.7 bn fall in excise tax collections from liquor, cigarettes and tobacco due to the prevailing high duty structure.
Motor vehicles accounted for 41% of total excise revenue but indicated a weak YoY growth of 7.7% despite the low base effect. Number of Import units of major motor vehicle categories such as motor cars, three wheelers and goods transport vehicles contracted for the second continuous year during first four months of 2017.
Although there has been a surge in motor bike imports and a marginal increase in passenger vehicle imports, it is unlikely to provide the expected level contribution to revenue with excise revenue from motor vehicles and other category falling behind revenue estimate by LKR 6.2 bn during the first four months.
Earnings from non-tax revenue in Q1 2017 accounted for 16.4% of the projected annual revenue for 2017.
This is a marginal improvement from the share of 14.2% recorded in 2016. However, it is important to note that non-tax revenue in 2016 was largely dependent on revenue from CPC and therefore remains vulnerable to external shocks that could arise from increased oil prices.
Hydropower generation in Q1 2017 was the lowest compared to Q1 of the past three years, while CEB Coal and CEB Thermal Oil generation were at their highest levels. This is expected to give a boost to CPC sales in 2017 and increase its contribution to revenue, despite the negative consequences the prevailing drought could have on overall economic activity.
Revenue from income tax increased by LKR 19.6 bn during first four months of 2017 aided by a substantial increase of LKR 16.3 in ESC revenue, following the upward revision of the ESC rate, removal of exemptions and the maximum ESC liability rate in 2016.
The proposed Inland Revenue bill is expected to go through committee stage amendments in Parliament and be passed during August 2017. Income tax related proposal of National budget 201713 are expected to be implemented along with the new Inland Revenue bill.
The provisions of the IR Bill such as introduction of a three-tier income tax structure for companies, removal of exemption on various direct tax sources, and re-introduction of Capital Gains Tax, etc., has the ability to bring a substantial direct tax revenue to the Government.
However the realisation of revenue will be dependent on the date from which the bill is made effective. If, as is indicated now, the Act will come into force from 1 October, the results will be seen by Q4 2017 itself.
More broadly, the Government expects these reforms to provide a significant boost to the revenue generated via direct tax sources, an important step towards achieving Governments policy of a more balanced tax regime of 60% from indirect taxes and 40% from direct taxes.

'A very long grab': Taylor Swift gives evidence in groping case

US singer Taylor Swift has described in court the moment she says she was groped by radio DJ David Mueller during a meet and greet.
"It was a definite grab. A very long grab," said the 27-year-old, who is suing Mueller, 55, over the alleged incident, which he denies.
"It was intentional," she told the court in Denver, Colorado.
"I felt him grab on to my ass cheek under my skirt. He grabbed my ass underneath my skirt."
The singer, who was responding to questions from Mueller's lawyer, added: "He stayed latched on to my bare ass cheek as I lurched away from him. [His hand] didn't let go.
"It was a very shocking thing. I had never dealt with something like this before."
The alleged assault is said to have occurred in 2013, during a Denver stopover on Taylor Swift's Red tour. Mueller, then a host on the top-rated radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show.
Swift complained to KYGO and the station fired Mueller two days later.
Mueller sued the singer, saying that Swift's allegation cost him his job. She countersued one month later, describing the groping incident as "completely intentional".
When Mueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, asked why her bodyguard did not interfere when the alleged incident happened, she said: "No-one could have expected this to happen... It had never happened before. It was horrifying and shocking."
She also rejected the assumption that she misidentified Mueller, saying: "I'm not going to allow you or your client to say I am to blame."
The 55-year-old denies any inappropriate behaviour. Earlier in court, when asked if he had grabbed her, he said: "No, I did not."
Swift took the stand the day afterher mother gave her testimonyand described how she wanted to "vomit and cry" when her daughter told her about the alleged incident.

We were never consulted on the ban - Polythene Industry
The polythene ban which will become effective on September 1, despite all its good intentions, is likely to affect Sri Lankas retail economy, exports and even garbage disposal.
The ban will result in the overnight loss of 345,000 jobs across the country too, according to Sri Lankas HDPE polythene and recycling industry that is now up in arms over the ban.
The new polythene ban is an industry and a humanitarian catastrophe that kills 345,000 livelihoods overnight, said Chairman of All Ceylon Polythene Manufacturers and Recyclers Association (ACPMRA) Anura Wijethunga on August 8, in Colombo. ACPMRA Chairman Wijethunga, accompanied by more than 300 manufacturers of HDPE polythene, was addressing Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen and his top officials at the Ministry.
Eighty percent of Sri Lanka's annual polythene production is in HDPE (high-density polyethylene) considered to be stronger and low cost and the rest 20% in LDPE (low-density polyethylene).
Due to its high strength HDPE is considered to be more harmful to environment than LDPE. Annually Lankan HDPE manufacturers produce around 40 million kilos of HDPE polythene which is banned from September 1. The value of annual Lankan HDPE polythene output is Rs 12.87 Billion (US$ 84 million) and this sector employs 345,000 workers, 45,000 of them directly.
ACPMRA Chairman Wijethunga, addressing Minister Bathiudeen said that the ban will affect the entire economy. Polythene is an essential material in everyday lives anyway. We too support environment preservation. Eight hundred HDPE industry operators are forced to shut down. After the announcement of the ban, we have been facing a serious liquidity crisis and are unable to operate no one lends us now. The entire HDPE industry is at a standstill.
No advance notice nor information about this ban was given to us in advance. We tried to join policy level decision making committee and asked them to include HDPE makers too but the 16 member committee did not include even one industry representative. As per latest government recommendations, after the ban starts on 1 September, if anyone still want to use polythene bags (shopping bags) in future, the one rupee bag at present will cost Rs 12 each and one lunch sheet will cost Rs 10 each."
"We also call for low cost oxo-biodegradable plastic technology to be used in Sri Lanka instead of proposed starch based bio degradable plastic technology, which is four times costlier. We brought down British experts at our own cost to explain to local environmental authorities but they refused to meet the experts. On the bright side, when we met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on this issue recently he showed his understanding of our plight and sympathised with us.
Minister Bathiudeen who bore the brunt of polythene protest that was not of his making, said that being the Industry and Commerce Minister, he is concerned about job loss and impact on exports. I was not involved in the ban but still I am willingness to support the sector for a win-win solution. Use of plastics that harm the environment should be discouraged, but step by step. It appears to me that the ban was somewhat sudden, and has been decided without the consultations of the industry he said.
Thereafter Minister Bathiudeen instructed his top officials to inquire into this and also phoned several Cabinet Ministers promptly, calling for their inputs on the issue. He also immediately arranged a meeting yesterday between the industry representatives who met him on August 8 and national environmental officials.
More importantly, Minister Bathiudeen then scheduled another urgent consultation between industry representatives and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) for today (August 11). The CCEM is headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wcikremesinghe.

Why was Cabraal not summoned before the Bond Commission: UNP backbenchers question

UNP backbenchers today questioned as to why former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal or his sister Shiromi Wickremasinghe were not yet summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the bond issue.
UNP MP Professor Ashu Marasinghe speaking at the Parliamentary debate pointed out the PCoI would need the help of informed advisors as it has so far failed to summon the most relevant witnesses.
Cabraals sister Shiromi Wickremesinghe was a director at Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. The names of former CB Governor Cabraal and his sister have also been implicated in the treasury bonds allegations.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara bolstering Marasinghes position said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was the Finance Minister when the PTL was set up, should also be summoned before the PCoI if former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was summoned.
Those in the AG Department have not been able to verify the signature of the former Defence Minister for two long years. How can we believe in their competency to handle these investigations A large number of files have been sent to the AG Department after completing investigations. The AG Department should expedite investigations into them, Prof Marasinghe charged.
We urge the Attorney Generals Department to do justice in their investigations. If not they will fail to deliver what people expect from them, the MP added.

The share market sentiment was very much more upbeat in the second quarter of 2017 when compared to the same quarter in 2016 as indicated by the average daily turnover of LKR 1.1 billion and LKR 709 million respectively, said Ravi Amarasinghe.
In terms of foreign participation in the bourse, 2Q2017 saw an inflow of LKR 16.5 billion while 2Q2016 saw a net foreign outflow of LKR 4.2 billion. The ASPI moved up 11.30% for the quarter to close at 6,747 points on June 30, 2017 while the more liquid S&P20 Index rose by 14.38% supported by foreign purchases in blue chip companies. Overall investor sentiment was positive due to attractive market Price to Earnings ratio of 11.9 times at the beginning of the
quarter under review and the prospect of receiving the third tranche of the USD 1.5 billion International Monetary Funds (IMF) loan to Sri Lanka, he said.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka held policy rates steady in the second quarter of 2017 after a 25 basis point hike in the first quarter. As such, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) as at June 30, 2017 was 7.25% and 8.75% respectively.

SL can be among worlds top startup ecosystems
Sri Lankas budding startup ecosystem has huge potential to be among the top ecosystems in the world, says Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Chairman Ruwindhu Peiris.
According to Peiris, an event like Disrupt Asia has managed to bring the entire ecosystem to one gathering. Disrupt Asia proved to be a massive success in both its years.
Events like Disrupt Asia are fundamentally important in terms of setting the stage, exposing the country to what the possibilities are and in many ways a celebration of what we are. No one else wouldve done it apart from ICTA and theyve done a great job in bringing together the entire ecosystem in a very meaningful way.
Sharing his views on the the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka, which is the apex ICT institution in the country, Peiris noted that ICTA is positioning Sri Lanka to be a knowledge and innovation hub in the global space.
"ICTA collaborates with the IT industry in the country as a whole and works towards the development of the entire industry, thus promoting Sri Lankas ability in the international marketplace. Its a tough role when you have to deal with multiple stakeholders especially when you have competing stakeholders."
According to him, only an organization with maturity and finesse will be able to do this and ICTA is the most suitable organization for this task. "In my experience, ICTA has done very well, in terms of playing that role."
ICTA has carried out many initiatives in bringing the private sector together. ICTA has been able to infuse a vision of where we should be heading as a nation, enabling infrastructure for the government and the country overall to be really digitally enabled, which is the starting point; if you dont have this, everything else just falls behind.
The agency has provided a foundational platform for the private sector to stand upon and reach the stars in many ways, of which we are all very appreciative and ICTA has done a fantastic job, he said. He also points out the role of ICTA in clearly charting the national agenda that is aligned with the country's vision.
Over the last two years, ICTA has truly set the bar at a high level when it comes to the quality and magnitude of how they look at stuff. It has helped the industry set a bar as a whole," the SLASSCOM Chairman said. "ICTA will continue its support for the IT industry for the foreseeable future and will play its catalytic role in transforming the economy."
Meanwhile, at the recently concluded SLASSCOM annual general meeting, Peiris urged the need to pursue bold initiatives for the future while celebrating the success story of the local IT industry.
"With the rise of disruptive technologies along with countries such as Vietnam and Thailand entering the fray, theres a short window of opportunity to seize the future. And to seize that future, we need to be bold," Peiris said.
Sri Lankan ICT exports are expected to reach Rs 5 billion in 2022 with 200,000 ICT professionals. (IH)

Commenting on the new status, ACL Cables Managing Director Suren Madanayake said, We are pleased to win the above award proving ACL Cables as the No. 1 cable brand in the market.

The economic brandscape is going through an interesting phase with a healthy mix of popular international brands and local home-grown brands emerging in every category. That is why Master Brands outlive time and are indexed only to an evolving market thus forcing a sense of re-evaluation upon them. These brands are the brands that are here to stay, said CMO Asia Executive Director Dr. Aalok Pandit.
A Master Brand is a brand that has made it big. Master Brand in reality is a passion - a brand which has scaled the highest peak in the passion-scale of brands and their respective consumers. It is a passion of passions. Therefore, lets respect the Master Brand for what it is. It is an exclusive club. Not too many members in this league.

A.W.M. Makeen: A great philanthropist
The 3rd anniversary of popular industrialist and the former Chief Trustee of Panadura, Thotawatta Jumma Masjids, Marhoom Alhaj A.W.M. Makeen fell on the 11th day of the month of Dul-Kahda 1438 according to the Arabic calendar. Abdul Wahid Mohamed Makeen left this world in 2014 on the 4th day of August. A leading industrialist, he was well-known for his forthright and forward thinking views relating to educational development, social and religious reform to the needy. Mainly when the holy month of Ramadan appears, his name is still remembered by the people of Thotawatta as he starts to serve the community at its best. He was fond of reading Lake House newspapers everyday. Also, he kept a good communication with the media people in person, especially from his birthplace. He carved himself as a successful industrialist with great struggle and hard work.
He used to help the poor with passion. He was mastered in overcoming challenges and facing the barriers with strength. There are some interesting facts about him more as a human being. Myself a social activist with fellow mate Alhaj Naleem, we used to catch up with A.W.M. Makeen Hajiyar at his Colombo residence every month.
After the Asar prayers at Bambalapitiya Masjid, we used to contact him and always got a keen welcome. His simplicity was just incomparable as he was being an ordinary person in hospitality.We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him. He makes us want to be better men. He speaks to what's best inside us. He was a great person as he was fond of getting information about Thotawatta, his birth place. He likes to talk about the village while enjoying a cup of tea. His educational endeavours such as the grade 5 Scholarship Felicitation, G.C.E O/L and A/L Scholarships to encourage the students and to make a better career path for needy students were worthy. Makeen hajiyars hand in the religious sphere was immeasurable and he served as the Trustee of Thotawatta Masjids. He founded male and female Quran Madrasas at Thotawatta. I, personally feel that it is a huge loss for the community and the village.
We still see young people without prospects for the future. Makeen Hajiyar lit the lives of many and made the people unconditionally smile. He has devoted so much of his precious time in serving the people to complete their needs. He earned the appreciation, and his contribution in the academic sector are countless.
His services and the contributions were not limited within Thotawatta. He was ensuring every time that the deeds were not advertised.
We will never see the likes of Makeen Hajiyar again. But it is great that his sons, Alhaj Milfar Makeen and Alhaj Mizwer Makeen are continuing their fathers pathway in Educational, Religious and Social sectors by making his life's work their own. The Alhaj Makeen & Hajiyani Zahira Makeen Foundation along with Macksons Holdings Lead by them, do continue to uphold and sustain Hajiyars vision.
May Allahs blessings shower them.

THE LOVABLE ROGUE IS NO MORE
It is with sadness that I report the passing of Peter Casie Chetty aka Peter Christie. He had not answered his phone for a couple of days when his sister Rachel had rung him. So she had a friend check up on him and found that Peter had passed away in his sleep.
Peter rang me on Wednesday this week at about 11:30 a.m. Melbourne time which came as a surprise as it was 3.30 a.m. in Manchester, UK and his death comes as quite a shock to me though I am grateful he passed away in his sleep and his soul is resting peacefully. We had a long chat and he told me that recently he had been having a number of falls due to his neuropathy in his feet due to Diabetes. He was also labouring in his speech and rang me to somewhat apologise for the recent spate of emails on the subject of Blazer fabric. Peter was a lovable rogue who expressed his views without fear or fervour in colourful language unbecoming of a gentleman. But, that was Peter. Love him or hate him for his caustic views on the Church, religion and the pretentious people in our society, he always spoke his mind. Some of us were offended by his commentary on various subjects and elected to reject his emails. But, I know that deep within his soul was a kind and generous person but a troubled man whose character had been moulded by his life experiences that he had endured which created such strong views. The voice of the Wesleyite alumni community is finally silent. He will be missed.
His body will be cremated in the UK and his ashes will be interred in Sri Lanka.

K.C.Kamalsabayson:IN LOVING MEMORY OF MY FATHER, MY FRIEND, MY GUIDE 10th Anniversary of the demise of former Attorney General
It has been 10 years since the demise of K.C.Kamalsabayson PC. A decade is definitely not what it feels like - the final memory of him seems not so long ago, when I desperately yearned for his life. And nothing has changed .Looking back ten years ago, I lost my father when I was a law student. I remember when my first year results were released in August 2006, we were in Chennai for his first course of treatment. He was extremely anxious all day until we got the call that I had got through, and at that moment I saw in him a very excited child, jumping around the hospital room and announcing to the medical staff 'my daughter is now a diplomate!'. I remember sitting at the edge of his hospital bed while he was walking around the room informing family and friends of the first of my achievements. It was a very happy and fulfilling sight for me. Not once did it occur to me that this could possibly be the only achievement he was to witness in person. In May 2007 I had my second year final exams and I remember how he used to walk me to the entrance of the exam hall for each paper - I remember turning around before the doors of the hall closed behind me only to see my dad standing there waving to me and giving me a thumbs up. He left a week later for his stem-cell transplant in Chennai and just three months later, he left me with the challenge of wading through society by myself. One of the last things he said to me in hospital was, 'please make sure you study. Being qualified is very important. Never ever give up'. I can only take solace in the fact that I lived up to his wishes.
My father was a simple man with a fabulous sense of humour. He loved pranking people, ranging from me to his private secretary. He used to change his voice over the phone and trick me so frequently, that on one occasion when the then President actually called home to speak to him when he was away at a function, I thought it was him pulling my leg as usual! When he got home and I told him I had spoken to the President thinking it was him, and was slightly panicking that the then President might have thought my tone had been obnoxious, he was doubled over laughing.
Another memory is one of Santa Claus. I was a believer, as are many children. I used to write letters of request to the 'man in red' and my father very graciously undertook the task of posting them. When I was around 9-years-old (embarrassingly, still a believer at the time) I had asked for a scrabble board for Christmas. One fine day my father retuned from work holding a bag looking rather dubious. I noticed him hiding this bag (he was totally oblivious to the fact that I was peeking) and later found out that it was the very scrabble board which I had asked Santa to deliver. I was heartbroken - mainly because I was upset that I had ruined my father's age old secret - that he was the household man in red! So I decided to play along and I did so for another couple of years. We were both pretending so that we could give each other this simple joy. Such was our relationship - innocent and beautiful. He was truly my friend, and I absolutely adored him...I still do and I always will.
He always encouraged me and my mother to pursue our interests. My mother is an artist whose talent she herself had shadowed out for the sake of family commitments. He encouraged her to paint again - I remember how he would return from work everyday and the first thing he would do would be to check on the progress of the on-going piece of art. The visual of him looking at the canvass with his signature grin and his hands on his waist is still vivid in my mind. He was my biggest fan when it came to my venture in Bharatha Natyam  all I needed was to see him in the audience with a proud look of approval on his face. We were extremely lucky to have had a hands-on and encouraging husband and father - we are strong and independent women mainly because of his role in our lives. A gift he left behind for a lifetime.
I had the most wonderful relationship with my father. He may have held high office, but he never compromised on family time. It was never about him making an effort to 'make time' - it was his priority and his 'work-life balance' came most naturally to him. This is a quality which is exceedingly rare in today's context, with the hustle and bustle in the rat race to succeed at the workplace, in the struggle to prove oneself worthy as a successful professional, many of us tend to struggle in attaining the ideal way of life. My father left behind a very prudent lesson - that this is not impossible, neither is it a Himalayan task.
Ten years ago when I lost my father I was very young, distraught and confused, unsure of what was to come, with my mother taking upon herself the arduous task of running the house and educating me. These ten years have taught me many lessons by way of struggles, disappointments, success and hard work. It has taught me the strength of a mother single-handedly moulding her daughter into a person fit to survive in society, while grieving the loss of the man who was her all. Ten years later I have earned myself a small place in the legal world, I am a mother, a wife and I stand by my own mother as her companion and daughter. It would have been perfect, if not for the biggest and most painful vacuum  the absence of my father. Yet I do believe that he continues to guide me and I will forever exist in his shadow.
There was a saying which my father used frequently in his speeches and life in general - 'Rising to eminence by merit, we may live respected and die regretted'.
His life and demise have most certainly been testament to this. We miss you Appa. And we love you more with each passing day.

Jehan Kamer Cassim: My inspiration
In my younger years, Friday was the day I would always look forward to, it was the end of the school week, but more importantly it meant that I could spend three days at my grandparents place in that picturesque lane of Kalshrue Gardens. Three days of old stories from the past, walking down the old lane and the countless games of cricket and chess. My grandparents place was indeed 'THE' place to be.
My grandfather, Jehan Kamer Cassim was a man who knew how to make someone smile, no matter how upset they would be and I was lucky to spend so much time with him not even giving him a bit of relaxation after his retirement.
He was the first to hand me a bat and ball and he spent hours and hours playing with me, either in the little garden, the lane outside or occasionally we would wander off to Campbell Park and return once the sun set. We were greeted by my grandmother presenting us with a few snacks. Our biggest connection was through cricket, we both loved the game and through that we both learned to love each other.
As our bond grew stronger, I learnt a tremendous deal about my grandfather's life and I remember one day praying to Allah to let me live a life just like his.
As I grew older, I was not able to see my grandfather as much as I would have liked. I was caught up in my own personal life that I forgot to visit the man who had one of the greatest impacts in my life.
Thank God I realised this a while back and made it a point to frequently visit him. I will never forget the smile he had on his face on these occasions.
He always inspired me to do what I love and to always follow my dreams. He constantly kept reminding me that nothing is impossible and to always challenge myself.
As I prepare myself to take another nostalgic walk down Kalshrue Gardens, it would indeed be a trip down memory lane.
Memories of the beautiful walks we had together will come rushing back and the lane of Kalshrue Gardens may very well be flooded with my tears!

Willam Henry Samaranayake: Remembering a great educationist founder, principal and philanthropist. on his 48th death anniversary
The passing away of William Henry Samaranayake retired principal of St. Bernadette's College, Polgahawela in 1969, had removed from the public life of this country a great educationist and silent social worker whose activities were directed to the welfare of students, many of whom rose to power and distinction. When Samaranayake took over St. Bernadette's college, it had only a few cadjan huts to house the students. Samaranayake's courage and perseverance helped to produce the land and the magnificent buildings which houses the college today. Samaranayake was not only of an unassuming disposition but also had dignity without pride.
He was calm and collected in manner and was a gentleman par excellence. He belonged to an age which is fast sliding into history, but he successfully accomplished his tasks reaching eminence in diverse fields. His philanthropic genius enabled many unfortunates to bask in the sunshine of his great hearted munificence and acts of generosity. Educationists of Samaranayake's stamp, mettle and genius are indeed today rare as sandalwood trees which adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka.
Samaranayake will long be remembered as the great educationist who disciplined and moulded the characters of students to be respectful towards parents, elders and the state. Those student's who occupy positions of dignity in the land today owe a great deal to Samaranayake. He was also a prolific writer to the press and his articles were directed towards creating public opinion. Three great positions worthy of human ambition are to be the ruler of a great city the principal of a great school or the author of a great book. Samaranayake was not only the principal of that great school St. Bernadette's college, but he was also the author of four great books - "English with a Smile" books, 1,2 and 3 and Practical English which is almost a vade mecum and a sine qua non to students of English in Sri Lanka. W. H. Samaranayake has gone to his eternal rest, but he will live forever in his great books English with a Smile and Practical English which as text books in Sri Lankan School have proved and will prove as invaluable guides to generations of teachers and students for years beyond our ken.
The world has lost a great educationist, who was distinguished for his simplicity, his high sense of duty and integrity.
His 48th death anniversary falls on August 26 and his 111th Birth anniversary falls on November 26th.

Around five amputations daily due to vocational accidents
Daily around five amputations of limbs are being carried out in Sri Lanka but only two of such persons have the ability to obtain artificial limbs. Annually, 1,700 to 2,000 vocational accidents are reported in Sri Lanka, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
According to Minister Seneviratne, eight million people are in the labour force in Sri Lanka and the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry takes care of their welfare. Last year only six artificial legs were provided to six workers who lost their legs while working in factories and similar places. The artificial legs are being provided through the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
Minister Seneviratne pointed out that this year, artificial legs were provided for 20 persons who lost their legs while working in factories etc. The artificial legs are provided by Aruna Samarawickrama, and the legs are of high quality. One artificial leg costs Rs. 140,000.
Labour and Trade Union Relations State Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said that more people should be educated on the programme implemented by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) which offers artificial legs in order to enable them to lead a normal life after amputation.

Baseless allegations on assigning TRCSL frequencies
Digital television frequency bands not released yet:
Reports in some media that the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has assigned frequencies to some institutions in a fraudulent manner are false and baseless, a statement from the Presidents Office said.
The statement said the digital television frequency bands in Sri Lanka has not been released to the market yet and in this backdrop allegations that the government has incurred losses by selling frequencies to the private sector without proper tender procedures were false and baseless.
The 700 MHz(694-806) MHz band proposed for the mobile broadband expansion includes UHF channels 49 to 62. Currently these channels are used for Analog TV. This has been allocated only until the starting date of the digital TV project in Sri Lanka.
In addition the TRN institution uses several frequencies illegally for digital broadcasting and two separate cases have been filed in the Colombo and Jaffna courts in this regard.
The TRCSL has not allocated frequencies for TV stations without prior tenders or by auction at any instance. For the 700 MHz frequency band at no time tenders have been called from other telecommunication service providers.
The annual fees charged by the TRCSL has been noted in the gazette 1104 issued on November 1, 1997 and later in accordance with the budget proposals had taken steps to double that amount as charges for frequency relaying equipment.
The TRCSL in accordance with the government policies is currently working on digital television transition. After this process 700 MHz band will be allocated for mobile broadband and will be given to relevant institutions.
The TRCSL since 2015 up to now has issued licenses following due procedure and also in a very transparent manner. As such the reports in some media about fraudulent deeds with regards to frequency assignment are completely false and baseless, the statement added.

Beauty and the Beast are Spirited Away
So far, we have featured live action movies, so I thought of entering the world of animated movies, more commonly called cartoons this week. There are hundreds of very popular and excellent animated movies to choose from, from Toy Story to Lion King, but I can only feature two in this column.
Even before I began typing, two movies came to mind almost immediately. They are Disneys Beauty and the Beast (I am talking about the animated movie from 1991, not the Emma Watson starrer live action movie from 2017) and Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazakis Spirited Away (from Studio Ghibli), sometimes called the greatest animation feature ever made.
Disney made hundreds of animated movies from the 1930s, but Beauty and the Beast stands out for its flawless hand-drawn animation (Toy Story, on the other hand was completed using 3D computer animation) that can beat the live action movie any day and its gorgeous music. This is a timeless fairy tale, a parable for the ages. Not many movies are made this way now. Perhaps only Frozen, which I hope to feature in a future issue, resonated with the audience in the same way. Spirited Away is an equally loving created masterpiece for children as well as adults. With movies like this, the magic of cinema comes alive before our very eyes.
Beauty and the Beast (USA, 1991)
In a quaint French village during the late 18th century, Belle, a bright and beautiful young woman, finds escape from her ordinary life, and the advances of a boorish suitor, Gaston, by reading books. Meanwhile, off in a castle in the distance, a cruel young prince is cast under the spell of an enchantress who turns him into a tormented beast, while transforming his servants into animated household objects. In order to remove the curse, the Beast must discover a true love who will return his affection before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. When Belles inventor father stumbles upon the Beasts castle and is taken prisoner, Belle comes to the rescue and agrees to take her fathers place. With the help of the castles enchanted staff, she sees beneath the Beasts exterior and discovers the heart and soul of a human prince. What a story and what a movie. This is a must watch whether you are eight or eighty. Yes, the live action movie is good given the current motion capture techniques available to filmmakers, but if you want to probe the very soul of the beast, opt for the animated version.
What are the home video options available  Disney generally releases all of its movies several times over on all the formats available at any given time and Beauty is no different. If you have the original laserdisc, the VHS tape (Did you know that some VHS tapes of Disney movies are extremely rare and can fetch more than US$ 8,000 ) or the Diamond Edition DVD, do keep it. But the best option is to go for the Blu Ray, which features a couple of cuts of the movie (Special Extended and Original Theatrical Edition) along with a sing-along version. The picture quality is superb - unless a 4K version comes along, this is the best home video version of the movie. The sound (DTS MA 7.1) is exceptionally good too. This is easily one of the best Blu Rays in my collection.
Fans can view the theatrical cut alongside the filmmakers original story reel, an incredibly early version of the film that features rough animation, hand-drawn storyboards and other preproduction artwork. In the included.
Audio Commentary Producer Don Hahn and co-directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale discuss the Special Extended Edition of Beauty and the Beast.
The trio dissect the story and characters, the animation techniques utilized throughout the film, its place in Disney history, the dialogue and songs, casting and the voice recording sessions, the challenges they faced during its long and complex production.
Beyond Beauty is a three-hour interactive, feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary teeming with bonus content. In Composing a Classic composer Alan Menken, music agent and Disney historian Richard Kraft, and producer Don Hahn chat at length about the films rousing songs and musical score. All the main features from the earlier DVDs are also carried over in Standard Definition.
Spirited Away (Japan, 2001)
After stumbling upon an abandoned amusement park with her mother and father, ten-year-old Chihiro finds herself trapped in a magical world where a witch named Yubaba runs a bathhouse for an array of supernatural patrons. With her parents transformed into pigs, Chihiro is frightened and alone; her only ally a stranger, a young man named Haku who races to save her life. Haku offers a warning: if she is discovered, Yubaba will turn her into a pig as well. But if she can convince the bathhouses boiler attendant, Kamaji to give her a job, she will be spared. So Chihiro embarks on a journey beneath and ultimately into the bathhouse, struggling to adapt to her new surroundings, survive Yubaba and other spirit world threats, save her parents, and find a way home.
Miyzaki devotes substantial time to the difficulty Chihiro endures adjusting to the spirit world, conceiving and capturing the sort of panic and terror you would expect from a real 10-year old girl thrust into such extraordinary circumstances. Chihiro is not only forced to face these overpowering moments of crippling fear -- sometimes with help, sometimes on her own  she is forced to overcome them, her courage and confidence growing naturally within the story.
In the words of one critic Miyazaki exerts a command of the screen, a control of his art, and a connection with his audience few writers and directors achieve, be it animation or live-action filmmaking. Theres simply nothing like a Miyazaki film, and simply no Miyazaki film like Spirited Away.
If you want to see the movie at home, the best option is the Blu Ray (the original Japanese laserdisc is very rare, though you can still find the VHS on eBay). Disney released most Studio Ghibli releases including Spirited Away with dual Japanese and English soundtracks both in DTS MA 5.1 (there is a French track as well).
The Disney English dub is very good, but my advice with all foreign movies is - watch the movie in the original language with the subtitles. Note that some movies have so-called dubtitles, which means that the subtitles appearing on the screen are actually subtitles of the English track and not the translation of the original Japanese track. Note that from this year, Studio GKids will have the rights to all Ghibli movies including this one.
The best extra on the Blu Ray is the Nippon Television Special (42 minutes): This Japanese television special visits Studio Ghibli and delves into the production of Spirited Away. Included are interviews with Miyazaki and other key members of the Japanese cast and animation team, as well as candid behind the scenes footage that focuses on production meetings, story development sessions, animation and music.
This is essential viewing for movie fans of all ages  in fact, adults will enjoy it even more than the children.

The UK government will make CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses in England under new plans announced today.
The proposals, contained in the Conservative manifesto, will require cameras to in all areas where live animals are present. They will provide vets with unrestricted access to footage.
We have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and the actions I am setting out today will reinforce our status as a global leader, said Environment Secretary Michael Gove as he announced the measure.
As we prepare to leave the EU, these measures provide a further demonstration to consumers around the world that our food is produced to the very highest standards, he added.
The governments CCTV announcement was welcomed by animal health and food quality groups who said it would help with welfare and safety.
Emma Slawinski Compassion in World Farmings Director of Campaigns said: We are absolutely thrilled that the government has recognised the need for CCTV within slaughterhouses.
Millions of animals each year are at risk of suffering behind the closed doors of slaughterhouses. Mandatory CCTV in slaughterhouses will provide the crucial transparency to ensure that legal protections are not being flouted, she added.
Dr Marc Cooper, of the RSPCA, said he was pleased by the move which would lead to a reduction in malpractice and an improvement in animal welfare.
 British Veterinary Association president Gudrun Ravetz said: It will provide an essential tool in fostering a culture of compassion that could help safeguard animal welfare and we are particularly pleased to see a commitment to Official Veterinarians having unrestricted access to footage, said Vets independence and unique qualifications help ensure that the UK will continue to have the highest standards of animal health, welfare and food safety, she added.
Under the new plans for CCTV, footage would be accessible to the Food Standards Agencys Official Veterinarians (OVs), who monitor and enforce animal welfare standards in the slaughterhouse.
Heather Hancock, Chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said she warmly welcomed the CCTV announcement.
We see CCTV as an invaluable management tool for business owners to help with compliance with official controls and to improve animal welfare standards across the industry, she said.
CCTV cameras are not mandatory in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland and there are no plans to introduce them there at the moment.

China combs through quake region for victims
CHINA: China on Thursday ramped up its response to an earthquake that killed 20 people and injured hundreds, sending supplies and personnel into the mountainous zone as rescuers fanned out to search for more victims.
AFP journalists in Jiuzhaigou, a popular tourist destination near the epicentre of Tuesday nights 6.5-magnitude quake, saw dozens of relief and military trucks rolling through the remote corner of Sichuan province.
Locals took refuge in blue relief tents in several makeshift camps or out on streets in towns as menacing aftershocks and landslides kept nerves on edge.
Jiuzhaigou is an area populated largely by ethnic Tibetans and Qiang people. Its scenic beauty is popular with Chinese tourists who flock to its national park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and tens of thousands of visitors were evacuated Wednesday.
But authorities were searching for more, with the Sichuan provincial fire department saying 16 tourists were believed stranded at a lake in the national park. The tremor evoked memories of a devastating 8.0-magnitude earthquake in the region in 2008 that left 87,000 people dead or missing, but the impact of Tuesdays disaster was comparatively light.
Authorities brought the death toll up to 20 on Thursday afternoon, while 431 remained injured, including 34 seriously hurt. A Frenchman and a Canadian woman were among the injured.
The quake tore cracks in mountain highways and AFP journalists saw cars that had been smashed by giant falling boulders. Authorities have said thousands of response personnel were sent into the area.
So far, 200 million yuan ($30 million) in government relief funds has been allocated for quake relief, according to authorities, and the government of Aba prefecture where Jiuzhaigou is located issued an appeal for donations.
The local government said it had repaired 129 telecommunication towers or other installations that were damaged by the quake, restoring communications with much of the affected area.
More than 30,000 tourists were in the Jiuzhaigou park when the quake struck, but authorities said most were evacuated Wednesday. All told, nearly 60,000 people were evacuated from quake-hit towns and villages as more than 1,000 aftershocks hit the region.
