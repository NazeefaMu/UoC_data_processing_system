Cabinet approves consulting AG on life-imprisonment
Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera has received cabinet approval to consult the Attorney General (AG) on imposing lifelong imprisonment for offenders who kill elephants.
The Minister has also recommended that Wildlife officers conduct combined operations and patrolling of wildlife-protected areas and areas managed by the Department of Forest Conservation and Mahaweli Authority, with the Security Forces and Police Special Task Force.
The Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance, which provides legal authority to officers to enforce laws on wildlife protection, would be amended to accommodate such legal action. These changes come in the wake of a series of killings of tuskers within protected areas, thus shedding a spotlight on the inadequate protection given to wildlife within these areas.
The Minister, in his cabinet paper noted that these lapses were a result of management issues faced by the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC). One such major issue was the lack of field staff. Though a total cadre of 1,200 had been approved for the DWC, at present there were less than 750 officers working in the field.
Thus, a Combined Task Force would be more productive and efficient in covering all protected landa massive task given that 14 of the islands land mass has been declared as protected. Furthermore, in 2016 alone, the total income generated by providing visitor facilities and Wildlife Protected areas amounted to Rs. 1,800 million, making conservation economically paramount.

Christmas tale
It's that time of year again. December has come and with all the joys of Christmas. It is both a religious holiday and a worldwide cultural and commercial phenomenon. For two millennia, people all around the world have been observing it with traditions and practices that are both religious and secular in nature. But what is the real meaning of Christmas Is it the gifts under the tree, the lights in the windows, the cards in the mail, dinners with family and friends or the shouts of "Merry Christmas" Is this really Christmas This is a walk down the road of history to have a look how Christmas originated and how it is celebrated today.
The story of Christmas
Jesus' birth, known as the nativity, is described in the New Testament of the Bible. Jesus was born to a woman called Mary who was engaged to Joseph, a carpenter. In Luke's account Mary was visited by an angel who brought the message that she would give birth to God's son.
According to tradition, Joseph and Mary travelled to Bethlehem shortly before Jesus' birth. Joseph had been ordered to take part in a census in his home town of Bethlehem. All Jewish people had to be counted so the Roman Emperor could determine how much money to collect from them in tax. Those who had moved away from their family homes, like Joseph, had to return to have their names entered in the Roman records.Joseph and Mary set off on the long journey from Nazareth along the valley of the River Jordan, past Jerusalem to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem the local inn was already full with people returning for the census. The innkeeper let them stay in a place below his house which was used as a stable for his animals. It was here that Mary gave birth to her son and laid him in a manger. There were in the same country shepherds watching and keeping the night watches over their flock. And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them and shared the good tidings that Jesus was born. Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and singing glory. '
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem. They bowed down and worshiped Jesus and presented him with gifts of gold, incense and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
An ancient holiday
Before Christmas was celebrated, the middle of winter has long been a time of celebration around the world. Centuries before the arrival of Jesus, early Europeans celebrated light and birth in the darkest days of winter. Many people rejoiced during the winter solstice, when the worst of the winter was behind them and they could look forward to longer days and extended hours of sunlight.
In Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated Yule from December 21 and the winter solstice, through January. In recognition of the return of the sun, fathers and sons would bring home large logs, which they would set on fire. The people would feast until the log burned out, which could take as many as 12 days. The Norse believed that each spark from the fire represented a new pig or calf that would be born during the coming year.
The end of December was a perfect time for celebration in most areas of Europe. At that time of year, most cattle were slaughtered so they would not have to be fed during the winter. For many, it was the only time of year when they had a supply of fresh meat. In addition, most wine and beer made during the year was finally fermented and ready for drinking.
In Germany, people honoured the pagan god Oden during the mid-winter holiday. Germans were terrified of Oden, as they believed he made nocturnal flights through the sky to observe his people, and then decide who would prosper or perish. Because of his presence, many people chose to stay inside.
Saturnalia
In Rome, where winters were not as harsh as those in the far north, Saturnalia - a holiday in honour of Saturn, the god of agriculture was celebrated. Beginning in the week leading up to the winter solstice and continuing for a full month, Saturnalia was a riotous time, when food and drink were plentiful and the normal Roman social order was turned upside down. For a month, slaves would become masters. Peasants were in command of the city. Business and schools were closed so that everyone could join in the fun.
Also around the time of the winter solstice, Romans observed Juvenalia, a feast honouring the children of Rome. In addition, members of the upper classes often celebrated the birthday of Mithra, the god of the unconquerable sun, on December 25. It was believed that Mithra, an infant god, was born of a rock. For some Romans, Mithras birthday was the most sacred day of the year. In the early years of Christianity, Easter was the main holiday and the birth of Jesus was not celebrated. In the fourth century, church officials decided to institute the birth of Jesus as a holiday. Pope Julius I chose December 25. It is commonly believed that the church chose this date in an effort to adopt and absorb the traditions of the pagan Saturnalia festival. Christmas was first called the Feast of the Nativity and the custom spread to Egypt by 432 and to England by the end of the sixth century. By the end of the eighth century, the celebration of Christmas had spread all the way to Scandinavia. Today, in the Greek and Russian orthodox churches, Christmas is celebrated 13 days after December 25, which is also referred to as the Epiphany or Three Kings Day. This is the day it is believed that the three wise men finally found Jesus in the manger.
By holding Christmas at the same time as traditional winter solstice festivals, church leaders increased the chances that Christmas would be popularly embraced, but gave up the ability to dictate how it was celebrated. By the Middle Ages, Christianity had, for the most part, replaced pagan religion. On Christmas, believers attended church and then celebrated the feast in a carnival-like atmosphere similar to todays Mardi Gras. Each year, a beggar or student would be crowned the lord of misrule and eager celebrants played the part of his subjects. The poor would go to the houses of the rich and demand their best food and drink. If owners failed to comply, their visitors would most likely terrorize them with mischief. Christmas became the time of year when the upper classes could repay their real or imagined debt to society by entertaining less fortunate citizens.
Christmas today
Christmas today has been taken hostage by dazzling materialism that puts God in the shadows and blinds the society to the needs of the hungry and the weary.
For many people, Christmas is a time of sorrow. They don't have the extra money to buy presents for their children, family, and friends. Many are saddened at Christmas time when they think of their loved ones who will not be able to come home for various reasons. Sumptuous dinners may be only a wish and not a reality for some. Those who lost a loved one recently may not tune in to sing a Christmas carol.
Yet, Christmas can be a season of great joy. It is a time of God showing His great love for us. It can be a time of healing and renewed strength. You see, Christmas is when we celebrate the birth of the Christ child. God sent His Son, Jesus, into the world to be born. His birth brought great joy to the world. Shepherds, wise men, and angels all shared in the excitement of knowing about this great event. They knew this was no ordinary baby. The prophets had told of His coming hundreds of years before.
At present we see placing too much emphasis on traditions such as Santa Claus, Rudolph and Frosty the Snowman. Shopkeepers just keep adding up these symbols on the Shelf. But we should not forget the real reason for the season. All Christmas symbols distract us from Jesus birth. It all amounts to too much tradition, and not enough cause for traditions.
However, each person cherishes Christmas memories in their own unique ways. Thus let us this Christmas be inspired by the delightful spirit of Christmas and spread it all around including the less fortunate.

DID MARY SING A LULLABY
The lights were dimmed as a gentle breeze swept across the cathedral when within the Festival of Nine Lessons, the Cathedral Choir spiritually rose to create the Nativity with a Sinhala lullaby, DOIYA, perhaps Mother Mary would have whispered in her heart as baby Jesus fell asleep, like all mothers do to their new born babes.
The music was set to a Sri Lankan rural background in tender Nocturne. The recreation was so prefect that every word sung by the soloist touched all hearts present and took us back to over two thousand years to a lowly manger in Bethlehem.
The magnificent choir with a single flute, violin, crass quintet, timpani and the Cathedral organ in the background was conducted by Ishan de Laneroll to the rendering of Doiya.
The Ven. Perry Brohier, Vicar of the Cathedral along with Rev Ernest Nadeem and Rev Ratnamala Ratnaraja, the assistant curates led the Festival of Nine Lessons that climaxed with the Nativity. A warm and touching sermon by Ven. Brohier soothed and mellowed our hearts towards the importance of why Jesus came into this world.
As the Cathedral prepared for this event, we were reminded of the sensitive needs of all Christians in the true Anglican tradition of welcoming people of all traditions to join in worship as a worshipping community comprising from believers from different walks of life.
WHY GOD SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON
Let us reflect and recall in our hearts why God sent his only begotten Son. Every Christian or non-Christian have the answer; to save the world from sin. When His son grew up, he was prepared to take our sins upon him and save us. The important thing is not wherher our faith is great or small, weak or strong. What is important is the object of our faith. Why baby Jesus had to sacrifice his beautiful unstained life for all. As much as nativity is joy, it also makes us sad because we all know where he is heading; to the cross.
Today is the birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of thirty three years of his young life he will spend caring, nurturing his scattered sheep and bringing them together with loving tenderness to fulfill his mission on earth; spread the Word of God, his father in heaven who sent him to do so. As the Christian world celebrate the Christmas message, we as his chosen children must look beyond the lavish celebrations we coincide with the great day with extravagant spending gone commercial forgetting the true meaning of the WORD. No doubt it is the most joyful event in a Christians' life but eventually lead us to repent that we all are responsible for nailing him upon the cross by our misdoings, sins and disobeyance to God. It is this beautiful perfect baby Jesus who will make the supreme sacrifice to save us sinners.
Let us meditate, ponder and think on these terms as we welcome the Holy baby to our homes.
HOW IT ALL BEGAN
As promised God sent angel Gabriel to visit Mary; who lived in Nazareth in the town of Galilee. She had already pledged to marry a man named Joseph who was a descendent of kind David. The angle came and said 'Peace be with you. The Lord is with you and He has greatly blessed you.
The message troubled her as she wondered Gabriel's words but the angel assured her ' Dont be afraid Mary. God has been generous to you. You will become pregnant and give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High God.
The Lord God will make him a king, as his ancestor David was and he will be the king of the descendents of Jacob and his Kingdom will never end.
The confused Mary said to the angel. I'm virgin. How then can this be and the angel answered :-
'The Holy Spirit will come on you and God's power will rest on you. For this reason the holy child will be called the Son of God. Remember your relative Elizabeth. It is said that she cannot have children but she herself is five months pregnant, even though she is very old.
For there is nothing that God cannot do'
MARY AND ELIZABETH
After the angel had left her, Mary who was very excited and happy, went off quickly to a town in the hill-country of Judaea where Zachariah and Elizabeth lived. The moment Elizabeth heard Mary's greetings, the baby within her moved. Elizabeth who was filled with the Holy Spirit and said in a trembling voice, 'Mary you are the most blessed of all women and blessed is the child you will bear. Why should this miracle happen to me that my Lord's mother come to visit me. For, sooner the I heard your greeting, the baby within me jumped with gladness. How blessed you are to believe that the Lord' message to you will come true' and Mary replied her,
'My heart praises the Lord. My soul is glad because of God my Saviour has remembered me, his lowly servant'
Later, Elizabeth gave birth to John the Baptist, the cousin of Jesus whose voice in the wilderness, praised the coming of Jesus and baptised him in the River of Jordan.
MARY AND JOSEPH
When Joseph heard of Mary's pregnancy, he was perturbed. How was he to marry her when she was already with child but Joseph was a man who always did the right thing and did not wish Mary to be disgraced publicly and decided to break off the engagement privately. As he was thinking about his dilemma, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said 'Joseph, thou art the descendent of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For it is by the Holy Spirit that she has conceived and she will have a son and you will name him Jesus and he will save the people from sin.
So, when Joseph woke from his dream, he married Mary as the angel of the Lord told him to do so.
Thus, Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judaea when Herod was the king.
In the list of ancestors, Jesus Christ was a descendant of David who was a descendent of Abraham. From Abraham to King David, there was this long list that came from a royal lineage to Joseph who married Mary, the mother of Jesus, the Messiah.
Then there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile in Babylon and then fourteen from them to the birth of Jesus Christ.
Over two thousand years ago and in 3 B. C. there lived in the Judean Hills not far away from Jerusalam a new priest by the name of Zachariah who was very old along with his wife, Elizabeth who too had passed the age of having a child. but Zachariah had faith in God that nothing was impossible for him and served God in his temple. Suddenly Gabriel appered at the right side of the incense altar and spoke to him :-
'Have no fear, Zacharias because your supplication have been favourably heard and your wife, Elizabeth will become a mother to a son and you are to name him John. He will prepare the way to the Messiah.' He was frightened and would not believe what Angel Gabriel announced. People outside the temple were concerned why he delayed to come out and when he did, he was not able to talk.
The Angel punished him for not believing his word and until the baby was born, he would remain dumb. True to God's words, Elizabeth became pregnant and kept away from the temple for about five months.

A doctor attached to the Mahiyangana Base Hospital was injured following a clash which erupted between him and a group of persons engaged in a poster campaign of a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramunas election candidate contesting for the Minipe Pradeshiya Saba.
According to Hasalaka Police sources, the doctor was attacked by the group at the Weragoda, Paalama Handiya area at 11.50 p.m on the 19th. Following the attack, he had been admitted to the Mahiyangana Base Hospital and later transferred to the Badulla General Hospital for further treatment.
Following the incident, doctors on of the OPD section of the Mahiyangana hospital, have been refraining from their services demanding the Police to take the suspects into custody.
However, it was reported that the patients faced immense hardships with the boycott of the doctors. Patients pointed out that the doctors action was not ethical, since the Police should be given a reasonable time to take the suspects into custody. It is not justifiable for doctors to go for trade union action immediately after the clash, without giving reasonable time for the Police to take the suspects into custody.

An elephant injured from a haka patas explosion was found frail and dying after 15 days when residents of Moragoda informed the relevant Wildlife officials. Although the wildlife officials tried to rescue the elephant, they found out that due to the lack of food, the elephant was malnourished and weak. The elephant had sustained serious injuries to its mouth in the explosion.
The residents in the area complained that their crops were continuously destroyed by elephants. They were however advised not to use such explosives and that the officials would provide a solution.
Hakka Patas are improvised explosive devices illegally kept in crops to keep wild animals away and kill smaller ones.

Financial sector minds power change at Asia Securities investment conference
Sri Lankas leading independent equity brokerage firm Asia Securities recently hosted its inaugural financial sector investment conference. Titled Shifting Gears: But Which Way the Asia Securities Financial Sector Investor Conference marked the seventh event under the Wealth Insights series of investor events which is now in its third year.
This inaugural conference generated value-added insights for the capital markets community in Sri Lanka. Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank was the keynote speaker at the event. One of the key themes at the event was low capitalization constraining the growth potential of state banks and the urgent need for state banks to raise external capital in order remain competitive with private banks.
Commenting on the successful conclusion of the event, Chairman of Asia Securities, Dumith Fernando said: We are pleased with the industry response to our inaugural financial sector investor conference. As one of the leading equity brokerage firms in the country, we feel it is our responsibility to be thought leaders for Sri Lankas capital markets community.
He went on to add, This initiative by us provided the right platform for discussion, debate and resolution of the challenges facing the financial community while simultaneously examining the best investment opportunities in the sector.
The presence of the Governor of the Central Bank and a diverse group of prominent speakers added to the richness of the discussions at the conference.
During the event, Asia Securities Banking Sector Analyst and Head of Research, Kanishka Perera concluded that improved macroeconomic conditions have created a conducive environment for the banking sector to deliver strong growth, but also pointed out challenges such as the implementation of IFRS 9 and the proposed transaction levy.
Lakshini Fernando, Asia Securities Non-Bank Financial Institution (NBFI) analyst and economist, touched on the fact that NBFIs need to diversify in order to drive growth in a period which is seeing muted demand for financing consumption needs.
Several panel discussions were held at the conference. The first panel discussion titled Looking ahead to 2018: Challenges and Opportunities for Banks saw Dr. Coomaraswamy, Jonathan Alles, CEO/MD  Hatton National Bank, Krishan Balendra, Chairman  Nations Trust Bank, and Ganaka Herath, Partner  Financial Institutions, McKinsey & Co engaging in a vibrant discussion on the topic.
A key message which came out of the panel discussion was that the macro environment is improving but state banks would need to raise at least Rs 50 billion in order to stay in business with the higher capital requirements and double that in order to deliver meaningful growth.The panel discussion titled Financial Sector Valuations: Cheap or Challenged saw leading industry practitioners Niloo Jayatilake  Head of Investments, Softlogic, Kanishka Perera  Head of Research, Asia Securities; Asanka Rodrigo  Partner, Head of South Asia, Actis Private Equity and Sachin Wagle, Managing Director  Morgan Stanley, India, engaging in a vibrant discussion on the topic.
The panel highlighted that the valuations of banks have fallen making them an attractive investment opportunity. There was consensus that fintech poses an opportunity as well as a threat over the long-term, compelling banks to proactively adapt to it to preserve value.
The session titled "State-Owned Banks in the Post-Basel III World", featured Wagle and Sujeewa Mudalige, Managing Partner/CEO  PwC, Sri Lanka. Sharing learnings from the Indian financial sector, Wagle said that majority of fund inflows have been directed towards the banking sector when compared with others, but that low capitalization has been a constraint on the growth potential for state banks when compared with private banks and has led to market share losses.
He went on to add that raising capital has allowed state-owned banks to grow and has led to substantial levels of job creation especially in rural areas and has led to improved lending to SMEs.
Meanwhile, Mudalige spoke about the impact of Basel III implementation and upcoming IFRS 9 accounting standards on the Sri Lankan banking industry. In his opinion, the banking industry as a whole is largely unprepared for IFRS 9 requirements and will need to do a substantial amount of work heading into 2018. A session on fintech featured Ganaka Herath, who delivered a thought provoking presentation on the fintech space. A panel discussion that followed featured Fariq Cader, Vice President  Digital Services, Dialog Axiata, Dinesh Fernandopulle, CEO, Synapsis, Ganaka Herath and Thilak Piyadigama, Chief Operating Officer, Nations Trust Bank.
There was consensus on the realization that banks will have to deal with fintechs going forward and that technology will play a significant role in shaping the financial sector and all have to be ready for it.

Firing Ranges and Military Training Act to be amended
The Firing Ranges and Military Training Act No. 24 of 1951 is to be amended to allow the training of firearms and explosives to security personnel employed in private security agencies, State banks, government institutions, semi-governmental institutions, and to sea marshals deployed for protection of international merchant vessels.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Defence Minister, noted in the Cabinet paper submitted above that at present, the Firing Ranges and Military Training Act No. 24 of 1951 had no provisions to allow the use of firing ranges or firing training under the supervision of the Tri-Services or Civil Security Department for the aforementioned Sri Lankan security personnel.
Furthermore, under the regulation of private security Agencies Act No. 45 of 1998, setting up of any private training institution for the provision of training with security with the issuance of proficiency certification is not permitted.
However, apart from security personnel employed by licensed private security agencies, you also have employees of State banks, government institutions, and semi-government institutions who do not fall under Private Security Agencies Act No. 45 of 1998, but need to be given training.
The responsibility thus lies with the Defence Ministry, to provide the security personnel of private security agencies with the necessary training in the use of firearms and explosives belonging to the above categories.
Despite this responsibility, the above act imposes various legal impediments in granting approval for use of firing ranges for firing and training. The amendment of the Act therefore, would make it easier for the above security personnel to be legally trained under the supervision of the Defence Ministry.

Fitch upgrades DFCC Banks rating outlook from Negative to Stable
Fitch Ratings have revised DFCCs outlook for both its International and National Long Term Ratings to Stable from Negative while affirming the ratings at B+ and AA- respectively.
The rating agency said that this outlook revision reflects their view that adverse effects on the banks credit profile from increasing risks in the domestic operating environment previously expected have reduced.
DFCCs Viability Rating and the National Long-Term Rating capture its developing commercial banking franchise and still-high capitalisation levels relative to the peers.
DFCCs Sri Lanka rupee-denominated senior debt is rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations. The banks subordinated debt rating will move in tandem with the banks National Long-Term Rating.
Commenting on the latest rating review, Lakshman Silva  CEO, DFCC Bank, said. This upgrade in DFCCs rating outlook by Fitch closely follows a similar upgrade by S&P Global Ratings which clearly indicates that the rating agencies have recognized DFCCs effort to keep the fundamentals strong. The positivity reflected by the upgrade of our outlook by both rating agencies gives us confidence to drive the bank to create more value for its stakeholders and press on with our plans for long term growth and stability.

## Title: Governed by poverty

Governed by poverty
More than 30 percent of Lankas population lives in absolute poverty and private-public partnerships could help reduce this number to a great extent, one official said recently. Apparently, Sri Lanka has initiated several poverty eradication projects since independence. Though those projects have done a lot to reduce poverty levels, it is necessary to do a lot more to reduce the poverty level overall; because more than 30 percent of the total population lives in absolute poverty.
This government, with the help of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Sri Lanka, announced the initiation of a strategic Public Private Partnership (PPP), around the country's key priorities related to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
Even in Sri Lanka in the past, some commentators have claimed that due to economic liberalisation, poverty in the world is rising rather than declining, and that was confirmed in the country. They also argue that extending property rights, giving land to the poor peasant and boats to fishermen with protection to the poor, is one of the most important poverty reduction strategies a nation can implement. Securing property rights to land, the largest asset for most societies, is vital to their economic freedom.
The World Bank too concludes that increasing land rights is the key to reducing poverty citing that land rights greatly increase poor peoples wealth, in some cases doubling it. It is estimated that state recognition of the property of the poor would give them assets worth 40 times all the foreign aid since 1945. Although approaches varied, the World Bank said the key issues were the security of tenure and ensuring land transactions were low cost. In China and India, noted reductions in poverty in recent decades have occurred, mostly as a result of the abandonment of undemocratic forced collective farming in China and the cutting of government red tape in India. In addition, new enterprises and foreign investment can be driven away by the results of inefficient institutions, corruption, the weak rule of law and excessive bureaucratic burdens.
However, ending government sponsorship of social programmes is sometimes advocated as a free market principle, with tragic consequences. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for the fertilizer that many farmers cannot afford at market prices. In Lanka in the past period, civil wars in the south as well as in the north created poverty and misery. Masses wasted time and wealth seeking a solution; thus increasing poverty.
Tamil national problem
They sat in the baking sun. Sometimes through the cold of night facing dangers, amid the dust and pollution of the roadside. For approximately 20 years, family members of those who disappeared during and after Lankas civil war in the south have been protesting continuously at various locations across the country. Now, less and fewer people come. Maybe parents have died or they are satisfied with compensations.
At the same time, the civil war in the north and the same suffering or more, spread into the Tamil homeland too. In the first case, Sinhala youth under the guidance of Sinhala chauvinist political parties attacked everybody who wanted to resolve the Tamil national problem. Of course, they did not attack Tamil politicians but went against pro devolution Sinhala activists including popular politicians such as Vijaya Kumaranatunge and Deva Bandara Senaratne. Mass repression followed and over- forty thousand  disappeared and families of the disappeared organised protests as described above. There were petitions in support of them, taken to HR Commissions in Geneva.
In the meantime, Tamil freedom fighters were able to capture power in many parts of the Tamil homeland.
Even the Indian army failed to arrest their progress. They assassinated many Sinhala and Tamil politicians; some who supported Tamil freedom. They had the power to assassinate Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Then with the support of world powers including of course India, Lankan armed forces were able to repress the Tamil insurrection. That was a disaster with many disappearances. Families of the disappeared in the Tamil areas too were organised by the human rights organisations and they claim around - hundred and fifty thousand- are missing.
The protestors on both sides are seeking answers as to the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones, many of whom were disappeared during the repressive wars, including after being taken into the custody of the Lankan state authorities in its final stages and immediate aftermaths (from 1988 to1989 and from 2008 to 2009).
In order to obtain those answers, they are calling for the release of information that could provide vital clues. In particular, they want the Lankan Government to release a list, known to have been kept by the authorities, of all those who surrendered or were detained by the security forces during and after the wars.
This demand, along with four others, was issued by Tamil protestors at a meeting with President Sirisena in June this year. Apparently, it was met by a pledge from the President that he would take immediate action to secure the release of the records. He has made similar promises to Sinhala protesters too. Meanwhile, the protesters  mostly Tamil mothers  still continue their fight. Organisers have produced a series of infographics detailing the locations of the protests and the number of days occupied at each. They claim that already the longest running of these would have surpassed the half-year mark. These figures speak to the extraordinary resilience and determination of the families.
Sinhala and Tamil insurrections
The time has come to say enough is enough. Promises and pledges from the government of Sri Lanka must now give way to concrete action. The release of the list of detainees, un-doctored and in full would be a crucial first step in the right direction.
It is correct to emphasise that getting distracted by arguments about the numbers that were killed or went missing, during or in the immediate aftermath of the end of nearly three-decade wars, between the state security forces and both Sinhala and Tamil insurrections could easily distort the truth.
In any conflict, while a single death is a tragedy, a large number of deaths are a statistic. If people allow themselves to lose sight of the tragedy of what happened, reconciliation and the guarantee of future peace will become more elusive.
It is necessary to be careful not to allow one to get distracted by arguments about numbers because figures can too easily get in the way of the truth.
Time has come to understand reality as it is, without prejudice and hate. We have to learn to look at the other with meththa, karuna, upekka and muditha. Private and public cooperation, unless based on such firm ethical foundation, results in the increase of exploitation and poverty.

The government has allocated Rs. 1.7 million for next year, to provide free eye lenses to all patients who undergo eye surgeries at State hospitals in the country, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, according to the latest calculations, a total of 150,000 eye lenses are required for next year. In this year, a total of 100,000 eye lenses were imported to be offered free-of-charge. All eye surgeries will be performed without any issues next year.
In Sri Lanka, a total of 1.7 percent of the population above the age of 40 years suffer from various types of eye diseases. By 2026, a total of 26 percent of the elderly population will be blind in the country. The Health Ministry will take all possible steps to prevent this, he said.
Performing all eye surgeries will be accelerated during next year in order to cut down long-waiting lists existing in the State sector. Eye surgeries will be performed in private hospitals (in addition to the State hospitals), and the required bills will be paid by the government on behalf of patients, he added.

Puttalam District UNP Parliamentarian and Chilaw Electorate UNP Chief Organiser Shantha Sisira Kumara Abeysekara said he would never leave the UNP fold any day.
He debunked as false the rumours that he had resigned from the UNP to join the SLFP spread by certain opponents. He was addressing a press conference at his residence.
Addressing a press conference held at his residence, Abeysekara said former Chilaw UC Chairman Hillary Prasanna Fernando, who crossed over from the SLFP to the UNP during the run up to the last General Elections, was defeated when he contested in the Puttalam district from the UNP ticket. This time, he planned to contest in the UC election on the UNP ticket and asked for a written undertaking to name him as the Mayoral candidate. When he conveyed this request to the party leader, he said no one contesting elections will be nominated as Mayor or Chairman as a matter of policy before the election.
When this was conveyed to Hillary Prasanna Fernando, he left the UNP and returned to the SLFP fold, failing to realise that this is an election conducted on a ward basis. There was no need for anyone to panic or get exited with Hillary Fernando's decision because it amounted to a homecoming for a former SLFP member, he added.

Intl community speaks highly of Chinas efforts  to promote high-quality economic growth
Economists and scholars are praising Chinas commitment to encourage high-quality development, as the Central Economic Work Conference that concluded here Wednesday outlined the countrys economic work for 2018.
The three-day meeting unveiled Xi Jinping Thought on Socialist Economy with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and stressed the importance of high-quality economic growth. As China has become indispensable to the world economy, the conference attracted immediate attention from both home and abroad.
ENOUGH TO BE PROUD OF
Growth is projected at 6.8 percent in 2017, exceeding initial expectations, the World Banks China Economic Update reported Monday.
Economic growth in China has remained strong in 2017, supported by rising household incomes and improving external demand, the report said.
China has maintained its growth resilience and gained reform momentum. The authorities have undertaken a host of policy and regulatory measures aimed at reducing macroeconomic imbalances and limiting financial risks without notable impact on growth, said John Litwack, World Bank Lead Economist for China.
2017 has been a successful year for China, he added.
China is no longer the developing economy that relies on low costs but today it competes on the mid- to high-end markets and if it is to be successful it has to step up the reliance and quality of its products and production, said Niklas Swanstrom, director of the Institute for Security and Development Policy.
It is beyond doubt that China has invested the most of all states in green technology and the impact is very impressive, he added.
Chinas adoption of high-end development has a global dimension as China is pushing manufacturing as well as finance towards digitization, said Hans Hendrischke, chair of the business and economics cluster of the China Studies Center based in the University of Sydney.
It is important to maintain the priority of stable and socially and environmentally sustainable economic growth, said Hendrischke, also a professor of Chinese business and management. For outside observers it is difficult to see how fast progress has been in these areas.
GREAT EXPECTATIONS
The 13th Five-Year Plan is the single most compelling five-year plan that China has ever made, said Joe Kaeser, president and CEO of Siemens AG.
According to Xi, the year 2018 is the first year in implementing the development blueprint outlined at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, and also a crucial year in carrying out the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020).
The Belt and Road Initiative is a huge opportunity for China and the world and much has already been accomplished, said Kaeser.
Proposed by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is aimed at building trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa based on ancient land and maritime trade routes. It comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
Siemens supply chain is related to structural reforms that are taking place in China, which generate new opportunities in high-end manufacturing such as automotive, aerospace and artificial intelligence, Kaeser said.
We predict that Chinas economy will grow more than 6 percent in 2018 and 2019. For an economy that is as large as Chinas, a 6-percent growth is still a very strong contribution to the world economy, said Stefan Kooths, director of Kiel Institute for the World Economy Forecasting Center.

Jerusalem: UN resolution rejects Trump's declaration

The UN General Assembly has decisively backed a resolution effectively calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The text says that any decisions regarding the status of the city are "null and void" and must be cancelled.
The non-binding resolution was approved by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine others voting against. It came after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution.
How did UN members vote 
The nine who voted against the resolution were the US, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo
Among the 35 abstaining were Canada and Mexico
Those voting in favour included the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia and the UK) as well as key US allies in the Muslim world There were 21 countries who did not turn up for the vote.
What is so contentious about Jerusalem's status 
The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.
Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy.
What does the UN resolution say 
The 193-member UN General Assembly held the rare emergency special session at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month.
The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution that was similar to the text approved on Thursday. The text put forward by Turkey and Yemen does not mention the US, but expresses "deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem".
It also says "any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council".
What do Israel and the Palestinians say
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to reject the results of the vote, calling the UN a "house of lies".
Afterwards he said in a statement: "Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks those countries that voted alongside Israel, alongside the truth."
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote "a victory for Palestine".
How does the US see it 
In a speech before the vote, US permanent representative Nikki Haley stressed that the US decision did not prejudge any final status issues, and did not preclude a two-state solution if the parties agreed to that.
"The United States will remember this day, on which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation," she said.
"America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that."
On Wednesday, Trump warned he might cut financial aid to states who voted in favour of the resolution.
"They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us," he said.
"Well, we're watching those votes," he added. "Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care."

Joseph real star in a star spangled world
Joseph was called to play sheet anchor in someone elses star role  how would you react to that Both Baby Jesus and Mary received more attention from Heaven and others, than Joseph did. Christmas is when God sets you up for His best  dont try to compete with your agenda.
Saviour was insulted as Carpenters Son  why - Bethlehem had the most delicate and skilled carpenters to make and maintain their linen weaving timber machines (handloom). Bethlehem was famous for well bred sheep, quality wheat, flax and linen industry. When Bethlehem fell on rough times, these carpenters scattered all over the country and some from Josephs ancestry ended in Nazareth of Galilee  quite the antithesis of Bethlehem, the City of King David and the city beautified by Solomon, the wisest. Joseph pined for Bethlehem where carpenters were honoured. In Nazareth they were among the poorest and also had to learn masonry with limestone. There was no artistry in doing the timber work for rough shod fishermen like Simon Peter and their hands were calloused with hard labour while their back broke for their meagre pittance.
Agreeing to be Gods best
Mary heard heaven and Joseph had to agree. How do you respond to people who say, I have a vision from God; will you partner with me Having understood Marys re-telling of Gabriels vision, Joseph came on board on the Project Immanuel.
Having come on board on Marys word, Joseph seems to have had misgivings when Marys heavenly vision had visible girth consequences that were embarrassing. Obviously people began to drop their voice when Joseph came around. He may have heard, poor fellow. Have you felt like pulling out having begun in good faith If Joseph pulled out he would have missed God and his own destiny. Joseph is the one who has understood that his destiny is to serve another who has a great call from God. Not that Josephs call was less but different and supplementary. All cannot be in the lead role.
Joseph became the team member who got the most difficult parts of Project Immanuel. His call was, Do whatever needed to be done for the King to be born. Shift the straw. Clean up the dung. Wash the food trough. Find the bandages. There went Josephs best robe. Be midwife for one night with no training. One moment great elation that three kings came to worship the babe and in the next, great danger that Herod will kill  fleeing in the night.
Most menial work to make others shine
Joseph understands that his toil is anothers gift. In the fellow-ship of HMS Apeksha, Joseph is on lower deck pulling the oars (work of Galley slaves). Singers are high on the sails for all to see. Others reach down and save the sinking taking them into life boats. Someothers man the guns to keep the enemy at bay. Some read maps and keep the ship on course. In fact the whole profession is called sailors though Joy-serfs are indispensable. Joseph is the Joy-serf who toils for others to shine.
Their joy is anothers trophy. Trainers, coaches, teachers all have the ministry of Joseph. Joseph demonstrates the ministry of the shepherd. Shepherd has to lead and follow and be on a side when there is danger that sheep may fall of the ledge. Shepherd leads until he gets them to new pasture. He follows them when sheep have to move thru known territory. It is a difficult balance. If you do not lead, sheep stagnate or go astray. If you do not allow sheep to take initiative, they do not grow.
Others first  Josephs motto
When all goes well Joseph gives the credit to the protg. When all does not go well he takes the rap. Josephs task is not to do it himself but to get others to do what he knows to do so well, to see those whom he trained do it better than he does. Joseph works to get himself out of the job. Do you not know I have business in my Fathers house - twelve year old Jesus asked Joseph. Jesus was even then surpassing Josephs mentoring capacity.
1.Joseph lends his light for others to shine even if it outshines him.
2.Joseph cannot feel let down when trainees do not perform. Joseph cannot steel the credit when trainees perform well.
3.Joseph cannot get disappointed that trainees do not perform to his expectation. He would get disappointed only if he assesses his worth according to the trainees performance. Joseph sticks through bad seasons, even when his team comes last in the tournament, knowing that he did his best as their coach.
4.Joseph must not become Saul when he recognizes that one protg is going to do better than him.
5.Joseph was wise to tackle jealousy and made Jesus brilliant.
6.Joseph evaluates and appreciates anothers son in the same way he does for his son.
7.Joseph cannot allow bad ways or brilliance of one to dominate the others. Joseph like David has to lead the slower sheep also to full potential. Joseph makes the playing field even. The brilliant one gets the hardest task. The handicapped gets the easy tasks. All play the game. All are rewarded.
8.Joseph learnt the ministry of a shepherd  not to accuse or blame but bear the sin. Be the solution. Joseph has understood his foibles and failures and is graced by God to help others in their failures. Those who look for perfect workmates assume they too are perfect. Joseph through trouble was comforted that he might comfort others. 2 Cor 1:3.

Matale farmers face fertiliser delays
Although nearly 50,000 acres have been brought under paddy cultivation under large and small-scale irrigation schemes in the Matale District during the current Maha Season, farmers have faced great inconvenience due to their inability to obtain fertiliser for their paddy lands in time.
The situation had aggravated as they have not received adequate supplies from the Agrarian Service Centre in the area. Farmers said they are yet to receive the fertiliser subsidy from the government. Private sector traders have cashed in from the situation by hiding available fertiliser stocks and selling it at black market prices.
Farmers said private traders charged Rs. 5,500 per bag containing 50 kg of urea. State officials maintained stoic silence when questioned about the fertiliser subsidy and as such, they had fallen into dire straits, unable to bring the grown paddy under proper care. Farmers said they had to skip the past two Maha Seasons without planting their lands due to lack of rain.
Although they had cultivated their lands this Maha Season after receiving rains in time, they had faced unexpected difficulties, being unable to obtain their fertiliser requirements. They request authorities to intervene in this matter and rush fresh paddy stocks to their areas.

My first Christmas in heaven
I am having my first Christmas in heaven
A glorious, wonderful day!
I am standing with saints and
departed souls of all ages,
Who found baby Christ- the truth and the way
I am singing with the heavenly choir
As I loved singing praises to our King Jesus!
And, oh what a cherished music
We sing and praise our Saviour and King in heaven
I am singing the glad song of redemption,
How Jesus was born in Bethlehem,
And why they called His name Jesus,
That all may be saved through His Name!
Oh, loved one, I wish you could be here!
No Christmas on earth can ever compare,
With all of the rapture in glory,
I witnessed my first Christmas in heaven so fair
You know how I always loved Christmas,
It seemed such a wonderful day,
With all of my loved ones departed around me,
We were so happy meeting them every day.
Yes, now I can see why I loved it,
And, oh what a joy it will be,
When all of my loved ones are with me,
To share all the glories of true Christmas I see!
So, dear ones on earth, I send my greetings,
Look up! Until dawn appears
And, oh what a Christmas awaits for us,
Beyond all our sorrows and tears!

Nation of builders
Minister of Higher Education and Highways
Sometimes we forget how far we have progressed as a nation. The Sri Lankan economy is navigating through a period of transformation, amidst global turbulence. Our country has enormous potential. Strengthening macroeconomic stability, complemented by supporting policies, has become crucial to realising our true potential.
We have strong recognition by international financial experts that the reforms we have taken are the right ones and we are assured that under our Government Sri Lankas international reputation is restored and strong.
Sri Lanka has truly come a long way from the dark days of Mahinda Rajapaksa  who governed only for himself, his family and cronies. The economy was in a mess and Sri Lankans lived in fear for their safety.
For too long traffic congestion has been a daily part of the travel experience for Colombo commuters. Those travelling during rush hours endure lengthy delays and on rainy days, the situation is worse. The entrance to Rajagiriya from Kotte was one area where traffic congestion was at its worse.
The Rajagiriya flyover project, which will soon be completed, was launched with the objective of reducing traffic congestion on Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha and the Rajagiriya Junction. When completed it will be the longest in the country.
Substantial investment such as this - over Rs 4.5 Billion - is only possible because of the effective measures we have taken to transform and strengthen the economy.
Better future for all Sri Lankans
Our government is working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans. So far we have created more than 400,000 jobs and helped over 200,000 families secure a home. This investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
Our governments initiatives have reduced fuel prices by 22 per cent and provided RS 20,000 to pregnant women. Strong action has meant that we have cut crime by a third and I am pleased that we have increased public sector salaries by RS 10,000. We are the builders. We are building a strong economy and now we are building homes for our people from the proceeds of endeavour. Housing is a human right and we are delivering homes for our hard working citizens. More homes, a stronger economy and we are building a better Sri Lanka.
Strong leadership
We have a proven record, a clear vision and the determination and strong leadership to build a better Sri Lanka for the future. In order to do so the economy is central to everything we do. Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools or hospitals or jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
We know there is still more to do so that everyone can walk the streets safely, our children can get a good education, and basic food is affordable. We will not rest on our laurels and will continue our mission to transform Sri Lanka and deliver better lives for all our people. That is why the 2018 Budget has been so important. The economy is central to everything we do. Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools or hospitals or jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future.

Not a Season, but a Feeling
Look out of the window and see how the sky has wrapped himself in a gloomy blanket of clouds, inviting you to do the same. The gloomy weather outside is balm to lazy souls; snuggled under a blanket, sipping cups of hot plain tea, watching over and over again, Maria falling in love with Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music. The hills are alive with the sound of music! (Or rather, the radio channels with the sound of George Michael singing Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.... It is so very sad to think he is no more)
It is that time of the year again. (Sigh. Sigh). Time for my yearly assignment on Christmas trees. Complaints of writer's block fall on deaf ears. My best excuse I have nothing new to say is brushed aside with a gentle suggestion That's a good opening line. You know you can do it. You think so I KNOW so! More sighs. Oh, the things one would do in this season of love.
Help comes from an unexpected source. The Christmas tree itself. Standing there, in the corner of the sitting room. Alive. Breathing. Watching. And finally talking.
You want to write about my story. No I tell him. Everyone already knows your story. It began in Germany almost 1,000 years ago when St Boniface, who converted the German people to Christianity, was said to have come across a group of pagans worshipping an oak tree. In anger, St Boniface cut down the oak tree and to his amazement a young fir tree sprung up from the roots of the oak tree. St Boniface took this as a sign of the Christian faith. But it was not until the 16th century that fir trees were brought indoors at Christmas time.
But there is more to the story of Christmas trees. Insists my tree. Read Penne Restad's book on Christmas trees called "Christmas in America" to find out more about how Christmas is celebrated today. I follow his advice and surf the net in search of the book. Yes, Penne Restad, a University of Texas historian, has much to say about the role of the Christmas tree in the modern world. As she sees it, the Christmas tree is the focal point of a celebration that honors families and the home, separate from the religious holiday on the same date.
"The Christmas tree has become a physical center of the holiday," says Prof. Restad. "You walk into a house, see a Christmas tree and know that is where everything will happen, where everyone will be. It's the heart of the familial celebration of Christmas that may have no connection to the religious celebration."
I read the words out loud to my Christmas tree realizing the truth behind her observation, for here I am, a non-Christian (and I know there are many others like me) with Christmas trees in our sitting rooms right this minute. This is why, the tree, decorated in millions of different homes every year all over the world can be seen as a unifying thread explains Prof.Restad. We're all doing the same thing but we're doing it in our own, personal way.
The one in my sitting room, who has suddenly turned into my guru on Christmas trees appears to be a stickler for perfection. He offers more advice. Why don't you read the article written by Prof.David McGrath about Christmas trees for the Los Angeles Times, last Christmas Tired of being so obedient, I decide to postpone my search and check my email inbox instead. But the transformation in my tree is too hard to ignore. The leaves begin to droop reminding me of Grumpy in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Ok. I mutter under my breath and search for Prof. McGrath's article. It turns out he is a father who wants to offer his daughter Janet, many arguments against the wasteful practice of buying a real Christmas tree. He confesses he had had the same argument with his wife for thirty years. Real ones had always been important to her  the annual pilgrimage to the tree lot on a chilly night, the scent of pine, keepsake ornaments. For me, it is a mess of trouble for something you discard after two weeks, not to mention $50 that would be better put toward gifts or charity.
At least, that is been my losing argument going on 30 years. He wonders why Janet and her husband Kevin should launch their own 30 years of wasteful practice and hopes Kevin might be allergic to the pungent smell of pine leaves and not buy a real tree. But when his daughter telephones to ask him, from 1,500 miles away what kind of tree they should buy he gives in, forgets all his arguments and suggests she buy a "Uh, probably balsam fir. They last the longest."
I decide to write to Prof. McGrath, though I am sure he would not want to answer the questions of a strange, foreign journalist sent in an email, even in this season of giving. To my surprise I receive a response.
Since my Times piece, there has been more research and debate about the tradition of real tree vs. artificial, much of which shows that buying real trees is better for the environment than buying "artificials," because of the global/chemical benefits of tree farms. Prof. McGrath tells me.
What I found with both my wife and daughter, is that the proverbial family heart trumps such practical concerns. Prof. McGrath thinks that what is vital is that, It does not have to be a tree, per se: any talisman or symbol that serves to perpetuate the idea and feeling (love) of family, even when far from home, or when members are absent, is what's vital. It could be a tree or a music box or a dish or a photo or a song. For my wife and children, it's the tree, and any pragmatic objections that I have are dwarfed by the primacy of family. Perhaps imagining the fellow Christmas trees standing in the houses of Prof. McGrath and his daughter Janet right this minute, my tree too cheers up.
And I realize how attractive he is, even though till now I had only noticed the gaps between the branches on his left side, and that he was stooping too much to the right. Looking at him now, from this particular angle, in the glow from the monitor of my computer I realize he is as handsome as...well...Captain von Trapp! Now that my tree has come alive writing about Christmas trees no longer seems a drudge. I will do it again next year too. Till then, wish you a merry Christmas. May you keep your Christmas-heart open throughout the New Year.

In addition to SSB Unit additional 400+ ATMs, CDMs & Kiosk.
Our command center too operates from world trade center office providing 24x7 call center, monitoring and reconciliation services. Since banks are unwilling to invest on acquiring infrastructure Novus business model of charging customers on monthly basis for only for the services obtained from them is gaining in popularity. Under our project Banks dont have to invest in ATM machines and other expensive hardware.
He said that bank surveys have indicated that most of the customers come to the banks to pay utility bails and banks prefer to see these bill paid online and through ATMs. Due to this this number of acceptance points for ATMs/POS not up to the demand.
Our targets for 2018 are an additional 1,000+ self-service machines connected to Novus Transact Switch. We also want to create a country wide acquiring infrastructure encouraging more cards to be issued and more transactions to be processed in urban and rural parts.

OL exam impersonator caught on ninth attempt
Examination Department sources said a person was arrested while sitting the Ordinary Level examination with a forged identity card at an examination centre in Piliyandala.
The person was answering the Geography examination papers after impersonating a student when arrested.
Police sources revealed that the suspect had pasted his picture on the National Identity Card (NIC) belonging to the student he was impersonating. At a first glance the bogus identity card cannot be identified as it has been much similar to a normal identity card. However, he has managed to answer eight examination papers using this bogus identity card until he was arrested yesterday.
Invigilators on duty took the 25-year-old suspect into their custody and later handed him over to the Piliyandala Police. The Examinations Department will conduct an inquiry in this regard.

The Prime Minister added that the government commenced various projects having taken into consideration all these issues.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the project was expected to be completed by the end of December 2018. Instead of building two lanes separately on either side, we decided to build all four lanes at once.

Santa... who are you
With Christmas around the corner it is no surprise that sights of a jolly old man, dressed in red and white, are growing in frequency and with it mounts the excitement and anticipation of children all around the world. All are familiar with the man clad in red and white, whose laughter resonates far and wide. A symbol of Christmas and the reason as to why children are impeccably well behaved during the month of December, he is a welcome sight to all yet few are really aware of the origins of Santa Claus.
St. Nicholas
The most well-known ancestor of the modern day Santa Claus is St. Nicholas, born around the year 280AD in Turkey who is commemorated on December 6, the day considered the anniversary of his death. Differing from the jolly round Santa that we know today, St. Nicholas was a fiery defender of the Christian doctrine and a bishop in the town of Myra. He inherited the fortunes of the family as his parents passed away when he was quite young. Known to be a kind hearted and pious man, there are many tales of how the young bishop used his wealth to assist the poor and those in need.
The tradition of hanging up stockings for Santa to fill and his use of the chimney originated with the most famous tale associated with St. Nicholas. It tells of a poor man who had three daughters for whom he could not afford dowries and therefore couldnt get them married. St. Nicholas having heard of his plight dropped a bag of gold into the poor mans house via the chimney. It landed in a stocking that was drying by the fireplace. The poor man was able to marry off his first daughter. The same process was repeated for his second daughter and for the next few nights the poor man lay awake by the chimney to find out who had been helping him. He caught St. Nicholas dropping another bag of money down the chimney for his third daughter. In spite of St. Nicholas requesting his silence, word spread about the kind St. Nicholas.This was the basis of the tales of Santas descent down chimneys to fill stockings for inhabitants of each household.
St. Nicholas popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children. A tale that led to this tells of how St. Nicholas had entered an inn in Athens and sensed the crime of the innkeeper who had just murdered three boys, dismembered their bodies and pickled them in basement barrels. The bishop not only sensed the crime but through his fervent faith and divine senses, resurrected the boys thus earning him the title of patron saint of children.
The Protestant Reformation resulted in many saints including St. Nicholas falling out of favour in most of Northern Europe.
Sinter Klaas
Even after the Protestant Reformation when the veneration of saints was discouraged, St. Nicholas was able to maintain a positive reputation in the Netherlands. Dutch settlers took the legends of Saint Nicholas, known to them as Sinter Klaas, to America towards the end of the 18th century. Sinter Klaas was believed to have ridden a white horse and left gifts in wooden shoes the day before St. Nicholas Day. Festivities take place on December 5 and 6 in the Netherlands and in Belgium. Gradually instead of giving gifts on December 6, he became a part of the Christmas holiday and tradition by giving gifts on Christmas Eve.
Christkind
As mentioned before, the Protestant Reformation resulted in the disappearance of saints such as St. Nicholas however someone still had to deliver gifts to children on Christmas Eve to reward them for being good. Thus came about the Christkind who originated in Protestant faith as the idea of a Catholic saint bringing Protestant children their gifts was rejected as was the veneration of saints. The Christkind or Kris Kringle was chiefly popular in countries such as Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia and Switzerland.
The Christkind is depicted as an angelic figure with blond hair and wings and, as implied by the translation of its name, is symbolic of the Christ Child. The Christkind brings gifts on Christmas Eve and leaves them under the tree and his arrival or departure is usually signified by the ringing of a bell.
Over the years Christkind transformed from the Baby Jesus representation into a blonde, female angel. Each year in the city of Nrnberg in Germany since 1969, a teenage girl is chosen to depict the Christkind and is known as the Nrnberger Christkind. Similar to present day Santa Claus, she also is flocked by children who sit on her lap and tell her what they want for Christmas.
Many countries though not visited by good old St. Nick make ready their homes to receive other Christmas personas. Scandinavia receives Jultomten, an elf in a sleigh drawn by goats. Pere Noel is known to visit France and fill the shoes of children with treats and candy. Italy is home to the good witch, La Befana who rides her broomstick down the chimney and fills the stockings left by little children. On January 5, it is believed that an elderly woman by the name of Babouschka leaves gifts at the bedsides of little Russian children to make amends for giving the wise men incorrect directions to Bethlehem. It is believed that in doing so she may earn the forgiveness of Baby Jesus.
The Image of Santa Claus
Santa Claus was revived by a series of authors and poets in the 19th century and it was during this time that the image of Santa that we are familiar with came to life. Knickerbockers History of New York written by Washington Irving in 1809 first depicted a pipe-smoking Nicholas soaring over the rooftops in a flying wagon, delivering presents to the well behaved children.
In 1821 a booklet entitled The Childrens Friend was supposedly written by Arthur J. Stansbury and it contained the first known visual representation of Santa and his sleigh drawn by a single reindeer. The poem describes Santa as a steady friend of virtuous youth who brings gifts and candies to little boys and girls.
In 1822, A visit from St. Nicholas more popularly known as The Night before Christmas written by Clement Clarke Moore tells of the plump, jolly Santa and his eight reindeer  Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen. Rudolph was created over a century later in 1939 by Robert L. May, whose story poem had a similar rhyme scheme to that of Moores The Night before Christmas.
The image of Santa wasnt the full-size adult, dressed in red with white fur trim, who resided in the North Pole with a reindeer-driven sleigh until the late 19th century.
The jolly, chubby, grandfatherly face of this Santa was largely created by Thomas Nast who also based his design on the works of Clement Moore. His work as well as the works of N. C. Wyeth, J. C. Leyendecker, Norman Rockwell and other popular illustrators contributed to the Santa Claus we know and love today.
Where is Santa Claus now
Santa Claus has since been commodified with his representation in Coca Cola advertisements. He appeared on billboards, counters, advertisements of all shapes and sizes to convince the public that Coke was the solution to the thirst for all seasons.
Nowadays Santa appears to frequent the streets of Colombo, sometimes even in more than one place at the same time to deliver the magic of Christmas to children everywhere. From little roadside shops, to boutiques to large scale stores, Santa is everywhere and occasionally has a few sweets for the little boys and girls that venture inside the stores with patient parents in tow.
A symbol of Christmas, it is hard to imagine that the magical Father Christmas was originally just old St. Nick from the little town of Myra. Encompassing the essence of Christmas as a time for giving rather than getting, a time for helping ones neighbours and cultivating the spirit of generosity and kindness, the origins of Santa Claus should not be forgotten.

Scrumptious treats for yuletide
Come Christmas time and many a housewife used to find herself cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Not only do they prepare traditional delicacies but they also have to yield to the familys many requests for all their favourite yuletide treats. Preparations for the elaborate feast began many weeks in advance in the years gone by. Today, however it is a different story. The modern family simply does not have the time or motivation to sit down for a traditional Christmas says culinary expert Mallika Joseph.
Christmas time was when the whole family got together those days. This was a much looked forward to time of the year because there is an ambiance of fun and togetherness everywhere. Today the most common excuse that people give is that they have no time to unite with their family on this special period. The family members are scattered across the nation and even in foreign countries, she explained.
She says that Christmas songs were sung often during this era. Today you can hardly find any real Christmas songs or decorations.
The festive season begins from December 1. Even those who are not Christians too said that they wish to become part of the festive celebrations, she said.
Bon Bons were one of the signs which signified the arrival of Christmas. Bruedher with cheese is normally part of the Christmas breakfast. Wine and cake follow. You get Fried Rice for lunch. Roast chicken or turkey is part of the Christmas Day dinner. The Christmas spirit continues up to January 6  the date that the three kings came to meet baby Jesus. Thus Christians normally take down the Christmas tree only after January 6. Age old traditions add fun to the Christmas season. A ring, a thimble, a button and a coin is put in the Christmas Pudding. The person who gets the ring will be the first to marry. The receiver of the thimble will be a spinster while the person who gets the button will be a bachelor. The one who receives the coin will be the richest one of the lot.
Such traditions have become alien to the modern generation. We use to make Bon Bons with valuable gifts inside them. It is essential to serve Rich Cake with wine during the season. Most people serve other sweetmeats like marshmallows and milk toffees too but include something savoury like sandwiches, cutlets or pastries, Joseph advised.
She says that the Christmas colours are red and green. Gold and silver are usually associated with weddings.
Some people say that they want Love Cake wrapped in toffee wrapping form instead of Rich Cake. The recipe is similar except that Love Cake includes more cashew nuts and less fruits. The real tradition is linked with Rich Cake, not Love Cake, Joseph stressed.
She says that it is not right to refuse to eat certain food at this time of year.
That is not the etiquette. Eat a bit but follow a strict diet from the following day onwards. This balances your diet as well as refrains from offending your hosts, she added.
Apart from wine, champagne too is associated with the season. You can serve Chilled Fruit Punch for non alcoholics. This can be served before a meal like an appetizer.
It is nice to have the tradition but today, this is lacking in the modern society. Non Christians too celebrate Christmas because it is a lovely atmosphere to create, especially for the children.
The rage is also to go shopping for the season. Christmas has become so commercialized today. We should never lose sight of what really counts on this special day, she concluded.

Self-promotion at others expense
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Leader of the Podu Jana Peramuna or the Pohottuwa clan has alleged that various goods are being distributed throughout Hambantota area by Government party candidates contesting the local government polls. Whether this particular allegation is true or not, the fact remains that such distributions are taking place not only in Hambantota but elsewhere too.
The former President should be well aware that this practice was widespread during his period of rule and was even considered a state policy despite its prohibition by election law. One could also recall how he pretended ignorance of the distribution of calendars bearing his photograph during the Presidential elections campaign. As a person prone to contradicting himself, he also justified the distribution of sil redi (attire of those observing eight precepts on Poya days) by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga in violation of election law.
It was reported in the media that the Elections Commission has prohibited the distribution of school textbooks in Matale by a Deputy Minister recently. Obviously the Deputy Minister should have known that it violates election law. Yet not only did he organise the distribution but also defended it after it was prohibited by the Elections Commission. He pleaded that it was an annual event. That means he still considers it legitimate. Hence, one could safely conclude that it is not ignorance but willful disobedience that motivates such politicians. In any case, ignorance of the law is not an excuse, Mr. Minister!
Law enforcement officials
Of course, he is not to blame. It is the established custom for several decades to circumvent election law by devious means. One was to organise so-called official functions at which politicians would attend and carry on their election propaganda or distribute favours. Official functions are either deliberately advanced or postponed to fall within election periods. One could also observe that many foundation stones for projects are being laid during such periods. In fact some of them lie in the same state exposed to the elements and covered by shrubs, even after several years.
Elections Commissioner has warned that he will be strictly enforcing the law. We wish him success. We expect him to implement the law without fear or favour. He deserves unconditional support from the public, political parties and politicians as well as from other law enforcement officials.
It was also reported that the Prime Minister has postponed until after the local government polls the handing over of letters of appointment to some new recruits since it violates election law. While the PM should be congratulated for doing so, we wish to remind him with all due respect that such letters of appointment could be best served by officials without the participation of politicians. In the colonial days and even up to 1970s in independent Sri Lanka letters of appointment were sent by post or handled by officials. An employment is a right of a citizen and is not a favour granted by politicians or bureaucrats. Such handing over ceremonies are mean attempts to politically influence the new recruits and give them a false idea that the employment was a favour granted by politicians. It is part of the politicians marketing themselves as candidates. State employees are paid by the government, meaning that it is the public and not the politician who pays their salaries etc. Thus the politicians are actually promoting their ego and bribing the people at public expense. Good governance would not tolerate such actions.
The same is true of the practice of naming various projects including the construction of townships, hamlets etc. after living politicians. It is the public who spend for such projects through the budget and no politician, who is only a temporary custodian, should act to brand them in his or his kinsmens name in the same manner as animals being branded under the names of their owners. The proliferation of numerous foundations and trusts under the names of politicians or their families is also another malpractice that leads to siphoning of public funds to them. A classic example was the transfer of foreign tsunami assistance money to a family foundation instead of to the common treasury fund, by a high-level politico.
Principles, practices and policies
We often hear stories in which former MPs or Provincial Councillors claim to be the owners of projects implemented. They even arrogantly sabotage commissioning of such projects if they are personally defeated at polls before the inauguration. No, there are no such projects for all are carried out utilizing public funds and not their personal capital. To give due recognition for their services is far different from giving them ownership and paying obeisance to them as vassals. It is high time that politicians understand and respect the reality without attempting to build their ego at public expense.
Politicians should understand that the people were more interested in extending democracy, initiating good governance and establishing rule of law more than just replacing the Head of State. It is not a question of personalities but principles, practices and policies. It is good that the former ruler was removed for he was autocratic and tribal in outlook. However, having done so one should not relapse into past practices. One has to go forward. The countrys orientation should not be towards the past but futuristic. It is democracy, far more and participatory democracy that is required. And democracy has no meaning if the people are economically and politically weaker.
January 8th was a welcome change, but only a change. It was no revolution, though some claim it to be so. A revolution is a clean rupture with the past. Yet wherever one looks we see today practices and ghosts of the past.

SLT launches 2018 calendar themed Connected Lifestyle of Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), the countrys leading Telecommunication provider proudly announces the much awaited launch of its calendar for the upcoming year. Continuing its reputation as one of the most coveted corporate collectables in Sri Lanka, the SLT launched its 2018 calendar under the theme Connected Lifestyle of Sri Lanka.
Since 2003, the SLTis at the forefront of producing calendars and complimentary items that provide a gamut of rich content on culture, biological diversity and heritage of Sri Lanka.
The SLT calendar has also become an important and most valued item amongst collectors due to its unique artistic value and creativity. Each year, SLT produces these calendars under the main theme Preserving Heritage for Tomorrow, with sub-themes.
These themes are selected after much research and study into the subject areas and calendars are produced with the help of key resource persons in the related fields that ensure credibility of the information provided by these calendars.
The main aim of this years calendar and complimentary items is to raise awareness among the general public on the contribution and role of telecommunication services in developing the nation, its economy and connecting lifestyles over the last 160 years.
The calendar showcases the evolution of the telecommunication service in Sri Lanka with the phone units used over the last 160 years (18572017) and various applications of the telephone service in day to day life and in the industry.
In 1858, the first electrical telegraph circuit was established in then Ceylon between Galle and Colombo which eventually enabled people to connect with each other.
The very first telephone lines were installed by the Oriental Telephone Company in 1881 and with growing interest, in 1896, the government of Ceylon purchased the Company along with its fifty-six subscribers and it was assigned under the Department of Post and Telegraph.
The early history of thriving coffee and vast tea plantations would not have been a reality without telecommunication services that not only served the interests of colonial administrators, traders and merchants but also proved of significant value to the establishment of railways and the systematic connecting of state offices; helping to improve the efficiency of public services.
SLT calendar 2018 was prepared with the valuable contribution of veterans in the field including Prof. Saman Chandra Ranasinghe, Department of Languages and Cultural Studies, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Dr. Praneeth Abeysundara, Senior lecturer, Department of Anthropology, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Raveendra Withanachchi, Demonstrator, Faculty of Graduate studies, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Eng.

For a spiritually fulfilling Christmas
Another Christmas is here with us, the excitement, joy and seasonal feeling that is experienced at Yuletide every year, very much in evidence. Christmas of course has taken on a different hue today in keeping with the times, the true message of Christmas buried in the avalanche of celebrations. Of course the traditional Christmas cannot be separated from the age old merriment and it is doubtful if things will change much in this our life time. Hence, some would say that there is no other alternative but to swim with the tide.
The run up to Christmas, as always, is a hive of activity with brisk shopping and hectic preparations. The streets are choked with milling crowds. Yuletide perennials blare forth from record bars and sundry shops sending that special feeling coursing through your veins. There is also that nip in the air this time of the year mingling with the scented cypresses lined up for sale on city pavements and in shops. It is also the time for big business.
Rubicund cheeked Santas beam out from shop windows advertising the latest brands. Special Christmas hampers are laid out at supermarkets and luxury stores. It is holiday time with school vacations on and office workers taking their annual leave in bulk. Peoples faces mirror a general air of gaiety and joy filled with a sense of anticipation.
Present day Christmas celebrations have changed over the years in tempo and form. Christmas shopping in the past was a leisurely affair unlike todays mad scramble. Though salaries were small compared to the present day there was always plenty in reserve for Christmas. The lavish bonuses dished out by many mercantile firms helped fuel the Christmas cheer.
Shoppers also had their favourite stores unlike today when everything could be bought under one roof. Alas, most of these landmarks are no more although old timers still speak of them with a sense of nostalgia.
Christmas was also a much looked forward to event in the now almost extinct Burgher community which dominated many pockets in the Colombo city areas such as Hulftsdorp, Princess Gate Grandpass and Kotahena. For them Christmas was all about merriment and revelry with no expenses spared. For them Christmas was a day for Bachchanial roister that began days before the event and progressing well into the New Year.
Preparation
The preceding weeks were devoted to stocking up where the stores were conveyed in the then ubiquitous rickshaws. Central to the run up to Christmas was the preparation of the Christmas cake for which the assorted ingredients were preserved in jars months ahead. Carols were another feature sung with gusto to perfect harmonising by members of the family and extended family.
In the weeks preceding Christmas it is also common to see carol singers parading the streets in groups donned in fancy attire visiting every home collecting in the process a substantial purse invariably spent on binges. All this culminate in the midnight mass where the church overflows with the pious and the once a year church goers.
It goes without saying that Christmas is a universal festival celebrated across different faiths, cultures and ethnic boundaries. No matter what gloom has descended the Christmas spirit cannot be dampened. This is why even amidst the worst economic depression to hit the Western world several years ago Christmas was celebrated without let or hindrance among these societies.
But is Christmas that marks the birth of Christ, the saviour of mankind observed in the way it should Is this great event heralding peace, joy and salvation to the world being abused and distorted Sadly amid the babel and humdrum surrounding the Christmas festivities the underlining message denoting the true meaning of the event is lost. Christmas today has been associated with unbridled commercialism and the cacophony of the market place.
Nay, Christmas has today become a commodity in the hands of multinational behemoths to rake in the shekels. Greed has overtaken the true message and meaning of Christmas which is sacrificed on the altar of mammon.
Humble birth
It is all too evident that Christmas today has been hijacked by business interests. It has become an occasion to bolster trade and business connection. Expensive hampers and other goodies are exchanged for favours in return - all in the backdrop of Christmas.
The contrast with the humble birth of the Christ Child in a manger surrounded by poor shepherds cannot be more glaring. Even the grandeur in which the Christmas mass is celebrated is at variance with the circumstances of the birth of Christ. Symbols such as the Christmas tree, the crib are only tokens for unbridled jollity. Sadly even the Church today has failed to get across the true message of Christmas to its flock. Nay, some its actions tend to betray shades of commercialism.
As a result, the spirit of giving, sharing and caring for the poor which is the essence of Christmas is subsumed in glitter of the festivities and merriment.
The level of commercialization of Christmas can be seen by the giant structures of the Nativity scenes adorning the frontages of supermarkets and shopping malls, the epitomes of luxury, ostentation and profiteering. Santa Claus is but a clownish figure doing his thing opposite shops and store fronts. Christmas should be rescued from the grip of mammon and made to revisit its true origins and hallowed message.
True meaning
Buried in all the joy and gaiety is the true meaning of Christmas with Christians tending to overlook the message of the birth of the redeemer two millennia ago in a cold stable surrounded by cattle and sheep. Instead the accent is on the outer trappings. Christmas is called the season of giving and sharing, but mostly this giving and sharing is among the rich who have the capacity to return the favour. This is a distortion of the theme of Christmas which is today being used as a convenient tool to trade favours.
Hence it is vital for all Christians to hearken to the spirit of the message delivered by the birth of the redeemer and make Christmas a meaningful and spiritually fulfilling one. True, celebrations are in order for the great gift of God in sending his Son to this world to cleanse and purge all souls of the stain of sin. But the underlying message of Christmas should not be forgotten. Those who splurge on Christmas goodies should spare a thought for the orphans, the deprived and those in the numerous homes for the elders, the prisoners, the terminally ill and those on the verge of death, refugees fleeing oppression. Christ moved among the poor and the deprived and expects His followers to traverse in His footsteps.
It should be rescued from the status of a commodity and salvaged from exploitation by the unscrupulous for profit and gain. A huge responsibility lies with the church and its guardians to redeem this most hallowed festival from its current decadence.
The underlying message of Christmas should be dinned into the faithful with more emphasis and vigor so that they will be enriched and inspired by the universal message of that far away first Christmas.

The Sri Lanka Police will take maximum efforts to ensure a free and fair election, under instructions from the Chairman of the Elections Commission, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
Especially, we will take stern action against those stirring up communal and racial sentiments through false propaganda, seeking political mileage during the election period.
The Minister made these remarks while speaking to the media after handing over nominations for several Local Government bodies in the Matara district.
This election will be a historic one. Therefore, we as a party, have decided to set an example to other political groups. We have already instructed our candidates to refrain from resorting to violence. With the intention of carrying out an environmental-friendly election campaign, we have also advised them not to use polythene for election propaganda. We also refrained from organising vehicle parades and other forms of processions during the nomination period, the Minister said.
We have utmost respect to election laws. At the same time, we want to urge activists and supporters of all political parties to protect their unity at the village level. We do not have to be divided because of an election. We will turn this election into an opportunity to strengthen unity among all political parties, at grassroots level, the Minister added, stating that the unity government had ushered in a new political culture.

Taking the Putin route
There has long been speculation that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa will throw his hat into ring at the next Presidential race. Most felt that the Viyathmaga and Eliya movements formed under his leadership were just stepping stones for his larger ambition to be President. But it does not seem so. At least, if one were to take the comments made by Basil Rajapaksa, seriously.
Speaking to a newspaper, the younger Rajapaksa sibling says that they would install Mahinda Rajapaksa in the presidency once again the same way Vladimir Putin was made the leader of Russia. Putin's presidency was interrupted after he served two terms as Russian leader and the hiatus was filled by the Prime Minister, at the time Dimitri Medvedev. Putin was back in business again after a single term of the PM ended, by winning the election that followed. Putin was debarred from running for three consecutive terms as President in terms of the Russian political system but was not precluded from taking over the reins after the break in the sequence.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, on the other hand, is constitutionally debarred from running for President, and, unlike Putin, cannot aspire to that office even after a break. The Constitution has seen to that. If he is ever to again become President of this country, the constitution has to be amended by a two thirds majority, which is an unrealistic prospect, given the political reality.
To begin with, Rajapaksa is today the leader of a third force which has as much chance in garnering a two thirds majority as a snowball in hell. No third force has gone any distance in its political journey, but floundered midway. Lalith and Gamini broke away from the UNP and while Laith perished in harness, Gamini returned to the fold to contest the Presidency. Vijaya quit the SLFP to form the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya which today is almost extinct. Ditto for Rukman Senanayake whose ELJP, in the end, amalgamated with the UNP.
True, Rajapaksa can become Prime Minister, but only if he rejoins the SLFP. But here again, it is very doubtful, indeed, if he will be made PM in the event of a SLFP victory, after already been rejected for the post, by President Sirisena, who is the SLFP leader.
Besides, Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated on January 8, and, also, the UPFA, which he led at the General Election that followed, was trounced. In essence he has been tried and tested and has been found wanting. One cannot comprehend how the tide will turn three years hence (when the Presidential Election is due), if Rajapaksa, who will be a ripe old 75 years, were to stand for election, what with corruption allegations sticking out liker sore thumb. To become President, it necessarily follows that one has to stand for election. There is no way one can be parachuted to that high office. How Rajapaksa can be a candidate when the constitution has shackled him from such a prospect only Basil Rajapaksa will be able to explain. Or, perhaps, he has been advised in this regard by Prof. G.L. Peiris who is fond of quoting the Doctrine of Necessity, as he did when justifying the passage of the aborted draft constitution in 2000 without a parliament vote. Rajapaksa, too, allowed himself to be a willing tool in that piece skullduggery, while today shouting hoarse against the enactment of a new constitution.
Be that as it may, why this obsession with a candidate who was soundly defeated at two elections Is Mahinda Rajapaksa the be all and end all for the pohottuwites Or is Basil Rajapaksa yearning to keep the Presidency in the family Or is this a ruse to buttress the fortunes of the pohottuwa in the wake of the LG elections
Basil Rajapaksa also says that MR should be once again elected President for ending the war, ignoring the fact that the last Presidential election too was held post war. The war victory as a slogan has become threadbare now. Were it not so, Rajapaksa would have romped home last time around. In fact, the war victory slogan, hammered hard, at the last presidential election, only served to alienate the minorities, that cost MR dearly.
Be that as it may, political dynasties have a long life in this part of the world. Rahul Gandhi has assumed the leadership of the Congress party, taking the baton from mother Sonia, continuing in the long line of the Gandhi family in political leadership. Bilawal Bhutto, son of Benazir, too have come into the political limelight, and, could one day become Prime Minister, like his mother, father, and, grandfather. Mahinda Rajapaksa may not be President again. But hopes of continuing with the Rajapaksa dynasty has certainly not died, at least with Basil Rajapaksa. Of course, there are quite a few in the Rajapaksa clan waiting to take over the mantle, and, Basil Rajapaksa may have only dropped a hint, knowing full well that a Mahinda Rajapaksa comeback is a dashed long shot.

Tennis saved me during  illness' - returning Bartoli
Paris: Former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli said on Wednesday that she first considered making a professional comeback while suffering from a mystery illness last year.
The Frenchwoman was forced to pull out of an exhibition event at Wimbledon last year because of the virus, which medical experts said was so rare they had no name for it.
But on Tuesday Bartoli announced that she would return to the WTA Tour in 2018, aiming to be ready for the Miami Open in March, after recovering from the illness despite losing 20kg of weight in a matter of months.
"If what happened to me in 2016 hadn't happened, I don't think I would have had that strong feeling of wanting to come back to the court," the 33-year-old said.
"The start of this all came on the most difficult day of my life, when Wimbledon decided not to allow me to play the legends' matches because they thought I could have a heart attack and die on the court.
"From then on, I swore that if one day I was healthy again, I wanted to try to relive what I had been lucky enough to live three years before when I won the tournament.
"What saved me at that time was tennis, by hanging onto the great moments that I lived on court -- that's what kept me alive."
Bartoli's finest moment came when she beat German Sabine Lisicki to win the 2013 Wimbledon title, but she hasn't played since after retiring due to a shoulder injury.
The former world number seven, who was also beaten by Venus Williams in the 2007 Wimbledon final, is confident that setting a return date for March isn't too optimistic.
"Mid-March seems realistic with the amount of training to be done," she said.
"The day I play my first match will be a huge victory after what I've been through, and what I do on the court is just a bonus.
"In terms of tennis, I'm at about 80-90 percent of my level from Wimbledon 2013 and physically I'm missing about 40 percent of that level, which at the same time is and isn't a lot of work."

'UN assignment in Mali endorses SL Armys international capabilities'
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake addressing the landmark Mali-bound Combat Convoy Company (CCC) of the Sri Lanka Army at the Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI) Regimental Headquarters in Panagoda on Wednesday morning (20), remarked that the opportunity the Sri Lanka Army had got in Mali would testify to the world that ours is a globally-recognized organisation, dedicated for world peace. He was the chief guest for the occasion.
The Sri Lanka Army has a history of its overseas troop deployment since the 1960's, even before I was born. To our credit, more than 1,7000 Army peacekeepers, about 300 military observers, and staff officers have to-date served foreign UN assignments world-wide with the purpose of restoring global peace. In the future, we would definitely be able to multiply our numbers in overseas assignments including Mali. I expect that all of you proceeding to Mali in a couple of days would serve as a fully-pledged professional Army, maintaining the strict discipline and dignity of the organisation, the Commander added.
The Commander also opined that he would like to get the numbers in Mali increased to be equal to a brigade in the future and show the world that the Sri Lanka Army, like any other Army in the world, has the full potential for undertaking any responsibility at an international level. The assignment in Mali is not for any personal gains, but for the best interest of the country.
This international involvement is also an endorsement that recognises our professionalism at an international level, the Commander underlined.
Note that we are a different breed of soldiers who can be identified as a special community called the Rata Rakina Jathiya (RRJ), a new concept defined by me, irrespective of ethnic differences, he added.Defence Services Command and Staff College Commandant Major General Ruwan Kulantunga, on behalf of Regiment Colonel SLLI Major General Amal Karunasekara, welcomed the Army Commander on arrival at the SLLI Headquarters in Panagoda.
Towards the end of the days programme, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake left a few thoughts about this historic mission in the Visitors Book before CCC Commander Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupure awarded a memento to the chief guest.

UN Human Rights Chief will not seek second term
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein, a staunch critic of United States President Donald Trump, had stated that he will not seek a second term.
After reflection, I have decided not to seek a second four-year term, the New York Times quoted Al-Hussein as saying in a statement emailed to his staff and shared with the paper. He penned down, To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication; muting a statement of advocacy; lessening the independence and integrity of my voice - which is your voice.
His four-year term expires next September. A spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Stephane Dujarric confirmed Husseins plans to leave after his term expires.
According to the report, The High Commissioner informed the Secretary General last week of his intentions not to seek another term, Dujarric said in an email.

The amount of vehicles on expressways has risen since December 15 due to the Christmas season. Around 47,000  60,000 vehicles travel daily on the Southern expressway and it has risen to 70,000 during weekends. Meanwhile, 24,000  30,000 vehicles travel on the Colombo  Katunayaka expressway daily.
There are several solutions to be taken to reduce heavy road traffic between December 16 to the first week of January. Additional entrances will be opened in the Southern Expressway at the Kadawatha, Kottawa, Gelanigama, Pinnaduwa, and Godagama interchanges.
A sufficient amount of officials in operational units would be attached to these interchanges and their holidays will be limited. Expressway Police Division officials, Road Development Authority (RDA) Traffic-Controlling Unit, and the Special Task Force (STF) will be engaged within 24 hours.
There are instructions to drivers who enter the expressway during that period. Vehicles must be in good condition. Accidents have increased to 8 percent during the past few years because of exploding tyres. When there is a mechanical issue in a vehicle, drivers are advised to park the vehicle out of the asphalt lane as soon as possible and call the Motor Traffic Department on the line 1969, keeping their distance from the guard fence. Theyre advised not to park vehicles beside the expressway, unless there is a mechanical issue.
If driver is exhausted, it is better to exit from the closest interchange. Bringing a ticket and the exact change is helpful to deduct delays at exits. Vehicles are being observed through CCTV cameras, and the Motor Traffic Department is open 24 hours. Any information can be obtained by calling 1969.

Venus Williams cleared  in fatal Florida crash, reports
Los Angeles: American tennis star Venus Williams will not be charged in a fatal two car smash in June that killed a passenger in the other car, according to the US media quoting the Florida police.
Police concluded neither driver was at fault and no charges would be filed in the collision which took place in a busy intersection in Palm Beach Gardens, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper reported on Wednesday.
"Based upon this investigation and relevant Florida state statutes, no charges will be filed in this case," according to an 18-page traffic homicide investigation released by Palm Beach Gardens police.
The police said an unidentified third car cut Williams off as she tried to cross a six-lane highway. That sparked a series of events that ended with a Hyundai sedan, driven by Linda Barson, running into the passenger side of Williams' SUV which was stopped in the intersection.
Barson drove into the intersection when the light turned green, striking Williams' vehicle. Both Williams and Barson, were not injured but Barson's husband, Jerome, died 13 days after the smash. "The unknown dark-colored vehicle  started a sequence of events resulting in (Barson) crashing into (Williams)," the police report said.
Barson's family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Williams.

Wrong composition contributes to record defeat
Why was  Sadeera and Danushka  ignored
Is there a paucity of batsmen in this country or is it that the present national team has not grasped the fact what T20 cricket is all about
That was the impression given by the composition of the Sri Lanka side for the first T20 International against India at Cuttack on Wednesday and the pathetic batting display they put up.
The cold stats was that India invited to bat first scored 180-3 in their 20 overs and Sri Lanka in reply were shot out for a dismal 87 in 16 overs to hand to the hosts their biggest T20 win by 93 runs.
What was dreadful than the loss was the balance of the side - whereas India went with six batsmen, an all-rounder and four specialist bowlers, Sri Lanka with their suspect batting line up went with only four frontline batters, three all-rounders and four specialist bowlers.
When the run chase began it soon became evident that Sri Lanka was clearly a batsman or two short. They had overloaded the side with too many bowlers and lengthened the tail to such an extent that anyone watching the match was left wondering whether Sri Lanka were aware that T20 cricket is strictly a batsmans game and not one for the bowlers.
What role was all-rounder Dasun Shanaka playing batting at number six He in fact did not even get a bowl. That position could have easily gone to a specialist batsman. The same could be said of Asela Gunaratne who batted at number five and was not utilised for his bowling being an all-rounder.
There were two hard hitting young batsmen Sadeera Samarawickrama and Danushka Gunathilaka in that Sri Lanka T20 squad who were not selected for the match.
Of the four specialist bowlers picked only two completed their quota of four overs, Vishwa Fernando who was given his maiden T20I cap bowled only two and Dushmantha Chameera three. If you are not going to maximise and use your specialist bowlers why pick them
With Angelo Mathews available to bowl and also Asela Gunaratne, Sri Lanka could have easily played six batsmen at the expense of a fast bowler and yet they would still had Nuwan Pradeep, Akila Dananjaya and either Chameera or Fernando which would make up 12 overs and, Mathews, Thisara Perera and Gunaratne to bowl the remaining eight.
It is a well known fact in ODIs and T20Is it has been our batting that has contributed largely to our defeats and here we see that area being further weakened instead of being strengthened.
Sri Lanka cricket may be going through a lean phase of team rebuilding but there is no excuse for such sloppy compositions for which the team management is clearly answerable.

## Title: Why we need professional voters

Why we need professional voters
The green signal has been given to the Local Government Elections by the Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya by announcing the date. All the political parties are busy with nominating the right candidates to contest in their respective parties. Once the selection is over, the politicians will begin their election propaganda by generously throwing broken promises in a way to convince the prospective voters. It is an acceptable custom in our country that the politicians do make seasonal visits to the homes of innocent voters and mesmerise them to vote.
That will fulfil their needs but not of the people. Once again the good samaritans will forget the peoples grievances. In practical terms, people go in search of politicians to remind and request them to fulfil their promises made during the election. Having unfulfilled the pledges and promises of the previous elections, the politicians once again give numerous unrealistic promises. Finally they will be the winners and the innocent voters, the losers.
This is a usual and recurrent event in Sri Lankan politics. The voters are also somewhat responsible for their own grievances. Once the politicians cheated them, they should wake up and should teach them a good lesson in the next election. On contrary, they re-elect the person who cheated them in the previous election.
When the politicians are in power, the ball is in their hands. But now, during the election, the ball is absolutely in the voter's custody. They must use the ball to bolt the person who kept the promises unfulfilled. The voters are the powerful crowd blessed with the power to use their valuable franchise to change the fate of the politicians as well as the democratic socialist republic.
Thus, every single voter in the country shall know the value of their votes and shall cast votes to elect the right representative who will do a yeoman service following the election. The voter's power is the supreme power in a democratic country and the real sovereignty rests in the peoples hands.
Real democracy
Refer to the US President Abraham Lincoln's definition for democracy: Democracy is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. His definition clearly tells us that we must elect the right person among the mass so as to rule our people. This fact is of course forgotten by most of the voters in our country. They cast the votes for the sake of casting votes.
This attitude should be changed and we should realise the blunder we have had committed and the punishments given for our ignorance. Every citizen of this country should use their franchise to change the history of country. We must be the contributor and the partner to create genuine democracy in the country and thereby enjoy the benefits of real democracy.
A large portion of people do not use their valuable votes on various grounds. They loathe politics, politicians, or the prevailing political trend of the country. This could be due to corruptions and violence during the elections.
Whatever the reason, we must remember that voting is our inalienable right which we should exercise in order to protect and preserve democracy in the country. To insist on the same matter, Additional Elections Commissioner M M Mohammed has proposed to impose a penalty on the person who does not cast his vote.
A similar system is in operation in countries like Australia. Of course no need to impose a fine on them, if the voters really understand the value of their votes. Rather than imposing fines, we should educate them through conducting awareness programmes across the country. I had a privilege to attend such an awareness workshop conducted by Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya educating the people on the value of their votes and why we should use our vote in election. He provided a clear picture about democracy, sovereignty of the people and the country. Once the mass understand the value and the power of their franchise, they will never misuse or abuse their voting rights.
Local Government elections
The general public should be vigilant about the candidates who are going to contest and represent our society after the election. The political leaders select candidates without any educational and moral background for their personal gains. But this is our responsibility to accept such a person or reject them in the upcoming Local Government elections.
This is our time and we must make use of our rare and golden opportunity. If we miss this valuable opportunity we will have to wait for another four years to change the situation. As the proverb advises, make hay while the sun shines for opportunity neglected seldom returns.
There is an unfamiliar and ugly culture prevailing in our country that politicians distribute money and utility goods among innocent, poor laymen targeting their valuable votes. This is not at all a healthy or acceptable culture for the country or people.
The general public earnestly request the politicians to try to form a decent political culture in the country where our future generation will ride their horses without showing them the bad examples and the improper or nasty culture. Therefore it is our duty to form a good political culture where everyones right is respected and protected and try to bring back the real democracy in the country so as to reap benefits ourselves first and the country at large.

In a statement following a board meeting, CSA president Chris Nenzani said lessons had been learned from the failed venture, which led to the resignation of former chief executive Haroon Lorgat.
Nenzani said an internal investigation had highlighted pervasive governance lapses around the T20GL.
In a departure from previous statements, Thursdays announcement wavered on a commitment to stage the league in 2018. The Board has tasked management to look at the various T20 league financial models around the world and to present a viable financial model before a final decision on the future of the T20GL can be taken.
Nenzani said a complete financial reconciliation had revealed no irregularities or financial mismanagement and that CSA accepted responsibility for losses incurred.
No figures were revealed but media reports have estimated that CSA spent around R100 million (about $7.8 million) on setting up the league, as well as having to spend about $5 million to compensate contracted players. Nenzani said that CSA remained financially sound, despite the losses, due to tight financial controls and reserves built up over the years. In its annual report issued in September, CSA said it had R740 million (about $60 million) in cash resources.

Rise in countrys CKDu patients presently halted
There are 21,000 Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) patients in Sri Lanka, and the country is successfully maintaining the number without letting it to increase further, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, by the time this government came into power on January 8, 2015, there were only 299 dialysis machines in the country and now, this number has been exceeded 500. He was addressing the gathering after the launching of the newspaper Kidney in Colombo, recently.
Minister Senaratne stated that by the end of next year (2018), the number of dialysis machines in the country will be increased up to 1,000. A total of 900 more dialysis machines will be installed island-wide with the support of an Indian investment.
From next year, a mobile dialysis unit will be made available for the service of the patients. The construction work of the National Kidney Hospital to be set up in Polonnaruwa, has already been commenced, he added.
Scholarships were awarded for 120 schoolchildren belonging to kidney patients. School instruments were provided for another 150 such children during the launching ceremony.

Sri Lanka has progressed in human development, poverty alleviation
"I am pleased to report to you the success of Sri Lankas strategy to reduce poverty of the masses in a systematic manner. Since its Independence, Sri Lanka has adopted a twofold policy of human capital development and poverty alleviation. The country followed a concerted policy of providing rationed food at subsidised prices to the poor and free and equitable access to education and health care for all. Through adopting those policies over the years, Sri Lanka has made a considerable progress, both in human development and poverty alleviation," Social empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake said at the third BMISTEC Ministerial meeting on poverty alleviation on December 20 at the BMICH.
The hardcore headcount of poverty has declined to 4.1 percent in 2016, and the unemployment as a percentage of labour force has declined to 4.5 percent. Life expectancy has increased to 75 years, while the annual population increase has been reported at 0.94 percent, infant mortality is 8.2 per 1,000 live births and literacy; 93.2 percent. As a result, the Human Development Index has increased to 0.77 and Sri Lanka has placed 73 among 188 countries in the world. Sri Lanka has reached to a level of a middle-income country with a per-capita income of US $ 3,835 and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of US$ 11,417, in 2016, he added.
He further said however, poverty alleviation is at the heart of the Sri Lankan public policy and significant investment has been made in social welfare and poverty reduction in the country. In pursuit of poverty reduction, successive governments since independence have introduced a number of public sector programmes aiming to mitigate poverty, with limited success.

2nd T20 International today
INDORE, Thursday - India are looking like overwhelming favourites in the 2nd T20 International against Sri Lanka, to be played at the Holkar Stadium at Indore on Friday.
Following up on the massive 93-run win at Cuttack on Wednesday, India, led by Rohit Sharma in the absence of Virat Kohli, would be looking to seal off yet another series win against a Sri Lankan side that has by and large been out of sorts through the entire tour, barring a spell in the first Test in Kolkata and the first ODI at Dharamsala. However, they possibly would have the best opportunity in the T20 format, where things can change in a rush.
There seems no end to the woes of the visitors. While the Indian youngsters have put their hands up to deliver the goods, the Lankans are going through a terrible phase of transition during which they are badly in need of reliable performers.
This series has hardly proved to be a good preparation for the challenging South Africa tour that awaits India next month, considering the home teams domination in the absence of a good opposition in favourable conditions.
The absence of regular skipper Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan and a transformed Bhuvneshwar Kumar has not given any respite to the Sri Lankans, who overtly rely on seniors such as Angelo Mathews. However, even the senior Lankan players have struggled to counter the Indian bowlers and batsmen.
A robust domestic structure coupled with Indian Premier League (IPL) has prepared good bench strength for the hosts.
Players such as Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav have managed to carve a niche for themselves immediately after making their international debuts.
Sri Lanka need captain Thisara Perera, Upul Tharanga and Mathews to lead by example. They have been a part of the side for long and only strong performances by them can infuse life and hope into this dejected side.
Players such as Dusmantha Chameera and Dhananjaya de Silva have shown promise and need guidance to be consistent.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose finishing prowess has been under the scanner for some time now, got some runs under his belt after being promoted to number four in Cuttack and is likely to continue in the same position so that he gets enough overs in a match situation before the ODI and T20 challenge in South Africa.
Squads:
India: Rohit Sharma (capt), KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, MS Dhoni, Hardik Pandya, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj, Basil Thampi, Jaydev Unadkat.
Sri Lanka: Thisara Perera(capt), Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews, Kusal Janith Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratne, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Dasun Shanaka, Chaturanga de Silva, Sachith Pathirana, Dananjaya De Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Vishwa Fernando, Dusmantha Chameera.

6 shocks from the Mamma Mia 2 trailer [VIDEO]

Here We Go Again.
The first trailer for the highly-anticipated sequel to 2008's Mamma Mia dropped on Thursday.
Earlier versions of it may have leaked on the internet in the last few days but we don't talk about those so hush now.
When it was released, the first Mamma Mia moviebriefly held the title as the highest-grossing film release in UK film history.
(Of course, that was before the release of Skyfall, Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Basically, Mamma Mia is now in ninth place.)
We've been through all two minutes and 24 seconds of the Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again trailer - several times, to be honest - and we have the following questions.

Where in the name of Chiquitita is Meryl Streep
So there we were, clicking on the trailer on a perfectly pleasant Thursday morning, expecting unfiltered, light, fluffy, Abba-drenched escapism.
But no: the Mamma Mia 2 producers have decided to obliterate any false sense of security we'd all been foolishly lulled into in the promo's opening seconds.
As flashback images of Meryl Streep run across the screen, Julie Walters tells Amanda Seyfried: "Your mother was the bravest person we ever met."
Hold the phone. (Ring Ring etc.) Did Mamma Mia just kill off Meryl Streep SHE WASN'T EVEN THAT OLD.
Perhaps the actress has been too busy over the last couple of years winning awards to make room in her schedule for a mimed rendition of Voulez-Vous.
But still, if Donna Sheridan is dead in Mamma Mia 2, we are already done with 2018.

Haven't we seen Jeremy Irvine do something like this before
In 2013's The Railway Man, Jeremy Irvine played a young Colin Firth.
He looked like a young Colin Firth, he sounded like a young Colin Firth, he WAS a young Colin Firth - as Louis Walsh might have said.
So now that he's climbed aboard Mamma Mia 2, and Colin Firth is also in Mamma Mia 2, surely he'll be reprising his role as a younger version of the Oscar-winning actor
Not quite. He's playing a young Pierce Brosnan instead, which - if we didn't already know from having just looked it up on IMDB - we certainly know now from his hairstyle in the trailer.

Oh my god. It's Cher.
With blonde hair and sunglasses.
And apparently she's playing Meryl Streep's mum, as Amanda refers to her as "Grandma".
In real life Cher is only three years older than Meryl Streep so that pregnancy must have been quite the medical breakthrough.
"Grandma, you weren't invited," smiles Amanda in the trailer - the kind of smilethat also says "oh my god look it's Cher I can't belieeeeeve it."
"That's the best kind of party little girl," Cher replies. Well put.

And look there's Will from W1A.
He's back in all his swooshy-haired glory, and this time he isn't just carrying Hugh Bonneville's fold-up bicycle.
Yeah, no yeah, no cool, yeah no worries.

The songs. THE SONGS.
For so long, we've all been kept awake, night after night, wondering which Abba classics will make it into the movie sequel.
We are now three songs closer to having the answer - as the trailer features I Have A Dream, Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia.
Earlier this year, Benny Andersson from Actual Abbatold BBC Radio 2that the film would also feature Angel Eyes, I Wonder and When I Kissed The Teacher.
But given how many of the big songs were mopped up by the first film, they don't have many other tunes left to play with.
The major omissions from the first included Fernando and Knowing Me, Knowing You. Beyond that, there may have to be some more repeats.
Which is fine by us, as long as one of them is Waterloo - because that one was cruelly relegated to the credits in the first film.

There's a new girlband in town
Amanda Seyfried now appears to be performing with her mum's pals, played by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, in the new film.
It works both as a touching tribute to Streep, and also as a vision of what the Sugababes might have looked like after another few decades of line-up changes.
Anyway, whatever other surprises are in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, we are so ready for this film.
For now, we say Thank You For The Trailer, which you can watch below.

Birmingham named as 2022 Cwealth Games host city
London: The English city of Birmingham was on Thursday confirmed as the host of the 2022 Commonwealth Games after a troubled bidding process.
"We warmly congratulate Birmingham and England on today's announcement - it is a defining moment for this truly Commonwealth city," Commonwealth Games Federation president Louise Martin told a press conference at Birmingham's Arena Academy.
The Games were originally awarded to Durban in 2015, but the South African city had the event taken away earlier this year for financial reasons. The quadrennial multisport event, involving members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, last took place in the United Kingdom in Glasgow in 2014.
After Durban was taken out of the running, Birmingham defeated a rival British bid from Liverpool to secure the support of the government in September.
But the Midlands city has had to wait almost three months to have its victory confirmed.
The CGF extended the deadline for bids until the end of November, saying Birmingham's candidacy was "not fully compliant", and then announced a further delay as it sought guarantees from the city and government.

Bristol City dump holders Man Utd out of League Cup
London: English Championship side Bristol City dumped Manchester United out of the League Cup on Wednesday, scoring with seconds remaining to beat the holders 2-1 as Chelsea also progressed to the semi-finals after late drama of their own.
United, second in the Premier League, made 10 changes from their weekend victory against West Brom but still boasted a star-studded line-up including a fearsome front three of Marcus Rashford, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Anthony Martial against the second-division high-flyers.
But as the match appeared to be drifting towards extra time with the score at 1-1, unfancied Bristol dug deep to fashion one last chance and Korey Smith's strike sparked scenes of wild celebration at Ashton Gate.
Bristol, third in the Championship, have now beaten four Premier League sides on their march to the last four of the League Cup and their reward is an even-more daunting-looking two-legged tie against runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City.
The other semi-final next month sees an all-London clash between Chelsea and Arsenal.
"It's an overwhelming feeling of pride, to beat Manchester United is incredible," said manager Lee Johnson. "They are a special group. It has been a long time since we had a result like that at Ashton Gate.
"The lads didn't want to go into extra time and the scenes that winner set off were unbelievable. My dad always says he's the most successful Bristol City manager so I have maybe pushed him close tonight."
The home side took the lead after an even first half, Joe Bryan firing the home side ahead in the 51st minute with a left-foot shot that arrowed into the net past the despairing dive of Sergio Romero.
United were only behind for a few minutes before Ibrahimovic blasted the ball through the wall after a softish-looking free-kick awarded for a foul on Paul Pogba in a central position.
Manager Jose Mourinho threw on even more attackers as he pushed for victory, with Romelu Lukaku replacing Daley Blind while Henrikh Mkhitaryan came on for Ibrahimovic. But despite pressure from the away side, Bristol held their nerve, taking advantage of some sloppy defensive play from United to score deep into injury time through Smith, who burst into the area, chested the ball down and finished coolly with his left foot.
United surged forward for one last push but it was too late and at the final whistle joyous fans streamed onto the pitch.
