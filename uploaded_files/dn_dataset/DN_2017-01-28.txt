Import duty on rice further reduced
The government has decided to further reduce the existing tax on imported rice with immediate effect. Accordingly, the Special Commodity Levy on imported rice would be reduced to Rs.5 from Rs.15 with effect from midnight today (January 27).
On the advice of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has taken this decision in order to provide urgent relief to the people. The Special Commodity Levy has been reduced for imported varieties of brown raw rice, Nadu and Samba. However, the tax relief is not applied to Basmati varieties. The government took this decision in response to the exploitation of consumers by certain unscrupulous traders who hoarded stocks and made fast money in the recent past.

John Hurt: Elephant Man, Alien and Harry Potter actor, dies at 77

John Hurt, the widely-admired English actor who rose to fame playing flamboyant gay icon Quentin Crisp, has died aged 77.
On Saturday, his agent, Charles McDonald, confirmed his death on Friday in London.
Hurts role in the made-for-TV film The Naked Civil Servant, first broadcast on ITV in 1975  as well as its 2009 follow-up, An Englishman in New York  identified him with Crisp, whose transgressive public behaviour had made him a pioneer in altering public attitudes to homosexuality in the late 1960s and early 70s.
Hurt told the Guardian he had been warned not to do it  they said youll never work again, but in the event it proved a rousing success; Hurt won several awards, and it transformed him from a mercurial supporting player  in films such as 10 Rillington Place, where he played Timothy Evans, the hapless neighbour of Richard Attenboroughs thoroughly creepy serial killer John Christie  to a genuine international star.
[As theflamboyant Quentin Crisp]
Born in 1940 to an Anglican clergyman father and an engineering draughtswoman mother, Hurt grew up in Woodville in Derbyshire before being sent to school in Kent, where he later revealed he had been sexually abused by the headmaster. He later moved to a school in Grimsby, before a spell at art college and then Rada (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art). Having worked his way up through TV bit parts and theatre, his first significant role was in the 1966 film of A Man For All Seasons, as Richard Rich.
After The Naked Civil Servant, Hurt went on to appear in Jerzy Skolimowskis The Shout (as a composer who is terrorised by a mysterious stranger, played by Alan Bates), voicing the role of Hazel in an animated adaptation of Watership Down, and playing Caligula in the BBCs celebrated TV adaptation of I Claudius, Hurt took another step upwards with memorable supporting roles in major Hollywood productions  both by British directors.
Alan Parker cast him as an English junkie in a Turkish jail in 1978s Midnight Express (for which Hurt won a Bafta and a Golden Globe for best supporting actor, and was nominated for an Oscar). The following year saw him take the role with which he arguably made the most permanent impact on popular culture: Kane, the crew member of the Nostromo in the Ridley-Scott-directed Alien, out of whose chest an xenomorph gruesomely bursts.
As Crisp later wrote, Hurt seemed to specialise in victims; he next went on to play one of the most heart-rending of all in The Elephant Man, directed by David Lynch. Notoriously, the extensive make-up and prosthetics required to recreate John Merricks physical deformities meant Hurt had to endure seven hours of preparation each day; however, the difficulties paid off when Hurt was nominated again for an Oscar, this time for best actor. (He lost out to Robert de Niro for Raging Bull.)
[As 'elephant man' John Merrick]
Having been elevated to these heady heights, Hurt then embarked on a blizzard of wildly differing roles, moving rapidly between genres and continents as he went. He was cast in Hollywood films such as Heavens Gate and The Osterman Weekend; comedies such as History of the World Part 1 (for his Elephant Man producer Mel Brooks); and British independents such as the Stephen Frears directed The Hit, Champions, in which he played a Grand National winning jockey, and Nineteen Eighty Four, as Winston Smith opposite Richard Burton. His rich, rasping tones were perfect for animation and voiceover: he worked on The Plague Dogs and The Black Cauldron as well as the celebrated Dont Die of Ignorance public health warning about Aids.
This prolific, eclectic career continued through the 90s and 2000s: he worked with fashionable arthouse directors like Gus Van Sant (Even Cowgirls Get the Blues), Jim Jarmusch (Dead Man, The Limits of Control) and Lars von Trier (Dogville, Manderlay) while making regular outings in Hollywood, including Rob Roy, Contact, Hellboy, V for Vendetta and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Reportedly, though, his personal favourites were Love and Death on Long Island in which he played an ageing author obsessed with a young man, and The Field, Jim Sheridans fable of strife in a remote Irish village.
The advent of the British commercial-cinema revival in the same period saw Hurt called upon for Captain Corellis Mandolin and the Harry Potter films (where Hurt appeared as the wand-maker Mr Ollivander in the first film, Philosophers Stone, and the final two, Deathly Hallows. He continued to alternate between gamey Hollywood fare  such as Immortals and Hercules  with more considered work: he played Control in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy; a centuries-old vampire called Christopher Marlowe in Only Lovers Left Alive, again for Jarmusch; and the guru-like Gilliam in Snowpiercer.
Though he always prioritised film acting, Hurt also made regular appearances on stage, including the first West End production of David Halliwells cult play Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs in 1967 (before going on to appear in the 1974 film version, funded by George Harrison). However, he was most identified with a series of performances of Samuel Becketts Krapps Last Tape, which he first played in 1999. Hurt also played numerous roles on TV, including Alan Clark in the 2004 adaptation of The Alan Clark Diaries and the Doctor in the 50th anniversary special episode of Doctor Who in 2013.
Hurt had a turbulent personal life: he was married four times, and between his first and second marriages he had a 15-year-relationship with a partner, Marie-Lise Volpeliere-Pierrot, who died in 1983 after a horse-riding accident. (He had two children, Alexander and Nicholas, with his third wife, Jo Dalton.) In 2008 he admitted to having recovered from a long-term problem with alcohol, that had seen him tentatively grouped with the likes of Richard Harris and Peter OToole as a hellraiser. However his distinguished work over six decades was recognised with a special Bafta for outstanding British contribution to cinema in 2012, and a knighthood in 2015.

Kiriella objects to Bimal raising COPE report issue, Speaker overrules
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday in Parliament strongly objected to JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake when he was raising a matter related to the COPE report on the Treasury Bonds investigation.
Minister Kiriella said MP Rathnayake should not be allowed to speak as it is a matter before court now. However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya allowed the MP to raise the matter stating that he was speaking on behalf of all members of COPE.
He was talking about summons being received by the COPE members. I have to look at the legal aspect of the matter. I have to listen to it, the Speaker said.
MP Rathnayake pointed out that he was raising a matter related to Parliament and the Speaker also agreed with the MP. However, Minister Kiriella went on objecting and MP Rathnayake asked in return whether he has taken over the role of the Speaker.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera supporting Kiriellas argument said MP Rathnayake could not speak on behalf of all COPE members, but could only raise it as a personal privilege question.
If a statement is made on behalf of the Committee, Committee Chairman Sunil Handunnetti should first inquire the opinions of other COPE members he said.
Kiriella intervening again said those in the COPE should know that the country is being ruled by the Government and not by the COPE.
The Speaker however said that he would look into the matter raised MP Rathnayake. Let me handle it, he replied.

Permanent solution to waste disposal needed: Archbishop tells President
Archibishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday, stressed the importance of having introduced eco-friendly alternative solutions rather than re-locating garbage dumping sites in Ekala.
Speaking at a press conference at the Archibishops House yesterday, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said that the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) declared that the lands identified in Ekala for this project were not viable.
The Colombo Municipal Council in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Army had engaged in carrying out a feasibility study even after the CEA confirmed that it is not viable, he added.
The Archbishop of Colombo said, Ja-Ela is a densely populated area. Dumping garbage collections over 800 MT in this area per day, could lead to very serious matters. It would adversely affect the residents, creating many health hazards, while creating a favourable environment for mosquito breeding . The vulnerability to negative impacts from natural disasters such as floods too would increase, while the fish population in the Negombo lagoon would also be threatened.
He requested President Maithripala Sirisena to look into the matter and present a permanent solution to this continuous issue of waste disposal. The Government presents alternative solutions such as dumping garbage at the cement manufacturing plant sites in Puttalam or permitting to the requests made by foreign companies to engage in the recycling process of the waste, Cardinal Ranjith added.
He pointed out that the objective of acting against the re-location of waste disposal lands was not to create a controversy with the Government, but solely to become a voice for the residents in Ja-Ela and to act for their benefit.
The Cardinal also said, Megapolis projects need to be implemented in order to develop a country. But priority has to be given to the establishment and continuous maintenance of the infrastructure facilities, such as proper waste disposal which are the base for the development of the country. Also, State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply Sudarshani Fernandopulle and Gampaha District Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena signed the petition against this project of locating garbage dumps in Ekala.
Secretary to the Ekala Preservation Movement Chaminda Preethiviraj, Ven. Balagalle Dhammaseeha Thero and Ven. Kimbulapitiya Wimalananda Thero also participated.

SC notices on COPE members: Speakers ruling after studying legal background
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said in Parliament that he would study the legal background and make an announcement over the Supreme Court notices sent to the COPE members.
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake brought to the attention of the House that the COPE members who participated in the Treasury bonds investigations have received notices summoning them to court.
I raise this issue on behalf of all COPE members. We in the COPE execute the duties of Parliament. If the court intervenes into our role in the COPE, then it is a breach of our Parliamentary privileges. The Speaker has to look into it. However, we are not afraid to go before any courts of law for our contributions in the investigations on the bond scam, MP Rathnayake said.
Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara also urged the Speaker to give a clear ruling in this regard. When an MP has been summoned to court as a respondent because of his role as a Parliamentarian should he comply with that If not can we maintain the previous stance that the court cannot middle into the affairs coming under Parliament powers and privileges even in this instance That is the problem before us, he said.
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said studying the previous ruling made by former Speaker Anura Bandaranaike at a similar instance in the past would be helpful for the Speaker to arrive at a decision in this regard.
The Speaker said that he would obtain legal advice and make an announcement in the House later.

UN torture report a wake up call to SL Govt.: Sooka
A UN report which was published yesterday describing a culture of torture in Sri Lanka is a wake up call to President Maithripala Sirisenas Government to comply with its obligations under international law and to the international community to put torture prevention at the core of its engagement with the new Government, the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) yesterday said. The UN report by Special Rapporteur Juan Mendez was published yesterday, following his mission to Sri Lanka last year as UN Special Rapporteur on torture.
The Special Rapporteur said he received credible reports to show white van abductions have taken place under President Sirisena's government in 2015 and 2016.
ITJPs Executive Director Yasmin Sooka said this devastating report rightly calls for an office which is independent of the Attorney Generals office to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture in Sri Lanka. We have already offered to assist both the Foreign Minister and the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission in identifying international experts to help set up such an investigative team. If they are serious about justice, this should have been done two years ago, she said.
Sooka said there had been a deep seated reluctance to accept the evidence on the on-going violations, but without security sector reform these sorts of violations will inevitably continue.
Denying the evidence of ongoing abductions because they are politically inconvenient is an unforgivable affront to the scores of victims whose cases have been painstakingly documented by ITJP, our medical colleagues and other human rights groups, she said. The report says Sri Lankas progress in implementing UN Resolution 30/1 has been slow and transitional justice paralyzed.
