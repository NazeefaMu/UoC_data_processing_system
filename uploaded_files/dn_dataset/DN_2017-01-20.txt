The petitioner cited Sri Lankan Airlines Limited, Group Medical Officer of Sri Lankan Airlines Dr. Anoma Jayasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation Nihal Somaweera, Director of National STD/AIDS Control Program Dr. Sisira Liyanage and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The person wishes to keep his HIV status undisclosed to the public and is entitled to maintain confidentiality of his HIV status, as is the policy of the Government of Sri Lanka.
The petitioner stated that in or around 2010 X (victim) made an application to Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. The petitioner stated that X joined the in-flight cabin staff as steward and continued to serve in the said airline, receiving appreciations etc. for his services and as at August 2016, the aforesaid X was a confirmed employee of Mihin Lanka.
The petitioner stated that during his employment with Mihin Lanka X was diagnosed as being HIV positive at a voluntary testing done in or around 2013.
The petitioner stated that since the Mihin Lanka did not require disclosure of HIV status and since X was under no obligation to disclose his HIV status to Mihin Lanka, the HIV status of X was not disclosed.
The petitioner stated that in or around June 2016, it was announced by the government that since Mihin Lanka was excessively debt-ridden, it would cease operations and would be amalgamated with the Sri Lankan Airlines.
The petitioner stated that the staff of Mihin Lanka were advised that operations of Mihin Lanka would be wound up by December 30, 2016, and were advised to seek alternative employment including at Sri Lankan Airlines. The petitioner stated that to the best of his X, the entire staff of Mihin Lanka were given the opportunity to apply for employment with Sri Lankan Airlines.

The petitioner stated that X was well aware that the National Policy on HIV and AIDS in the World of Work in Sri Lanka contained policies which inter alia declared that HIV screening is not required for purposes of employment and confidentiality of his HIV status made it non obligatory to disclose his HIV status in the said health form.
The petitioner sated that in the attendant circumstances, confused and conflicted as to how the said question in relation to whether X was the carrier of a STD ought to be answered and being aware that he was not obliged to answer as to his HIV status and fearing and being mortified that if the said question was left unanswered and answered in the affirmative the two nurses would publicly question him causing grave prejudice to the confidentiality concerning his HIV status and thereby stigmatizing him, X decided to answer the said question in the negative.
The petitioner stated that on about October 7, 2016, X was notified by a person attached to the Human Resource Department of the Sri Lankan Airlines as a cabin crewmember.
Thereafter X was further requested to collect his uniforms and suitcases from the Sri Lankan Airlines and also to give measurements for his jackets. The petitioner stated that on October 19, 2016, X was required to present himself at Nawaloka Hospital PLC for certain tests, including HIV screening.

The petitioner stated that the second respondent had therafter requested X to hand over the appointment letter and the staff ID issued by Sri Lankan Airlines for safe keeping until the matter was resolved.
The petitioner said the decision of the Sri Lankan Airlines to subject X for an HIV screening, the subsequent constructive withdrawal of the appointment letter, and termination thereof on account of Xs HIV status and such other grounds upon his HIV status being made aware to the second respondent is wrongful.
The petitioner said X was informed that his services had been terminated as he failed his medical test.
The petitioner said Sri Lankan Airlines being a state instrument is bound by the National Policy on HIV and National Policy on HIV and AIDS in the World of Work in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner stated that the respondents were wrongful and unlawful and discriminatory because it disqualifies from employment as cabin crew any person who is HIV positive, without objective medical assessments to show that such persons are unsuitable for employment as cabin crew.
The petitioner seeks Supreme Courts permission to conduct these proceedings in camera to maintain the confidentiality of the name and identity of X, the person concerned herein.
The petitioner is seeking a declaration that the Fundamental Rights of X guaranteed by Article 11, 12 (1), (2) and 14 (1)(g) of the constitution.
Counsel Senany Dayaratne, Thishya Weragoda, Eshanthi Mendis, Nishadi Wickramasinghe instructed by Nilika Dissanayake appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appeared for the Attorney General.

Shashi Welgama further remanded until February 2
Two persons, including former Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman Shashi Welgama, a nephew of former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded until February 2 by Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky for allegedly cheating and misappropriating Rs. 125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
At a previous occasion, the Court refused to grant bail to the suspects citing there are no exceptional circumstances to release them on bail.
Meanwhile, SLTB former Chief Financial Manager Sanjeewa Waidyatilleke was yesterday named as a suspect in the case by CID.
On December 20, 2016, Shashi Welgama and Nandana Priyantha Perera, the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Ltd, were arrested by the CID regarding an investigation into a financial fraud said to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs. 40 million and Rs. 166 million to Perera to provide leaf springs to the SLTB. The CID alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to SLTB with a deficiency, which amounted Rs. 24 million and Rs. 101 million.
The CID said the former SLTB Chairman had authorised the financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then chairman of SLTB. The CID informed Court that original documents pertaining to the fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding this incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena.
The suspects are charged under the offences under the Public Property Act.
However, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for the former SLTB Chairman, denied the allegations levelled against his client citing that there was no evidence to prove that his client was involved in financial transactions.
He had told Court that his client had been subjected to a bypass surgery in 2014 and that fact be considered as an exceptional circumstance to release him on bail. At a previous occasion, the Court issued an order directing the Emigration and Immigration Controller to prevent four individuals, including former SLTB Chairman Nandana Priyantha, Sanjeewa Waidyatilleke and Sumith Hettiarachchi from leaving the country.

SLC gives full backing to team despite SA debacle: Mathews will be captain till 2019 WC says SLC president
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala said that Angelo Mathews captaincy will remain until the 2019 ODI World Cup despite criticisms after Sri Lankas recent 3-0 Test series defeat in South Africa.
Addressing a media conference at SLC headquarters yesterday Sumathipala affirmed that this was the opinion shared by the national selection committee headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya.
SLC and the national selection committee called a post series review through internet with captain Mathews, coach Graham Ford and manager Ranjith Fernando soon after the Test series and discussed a lot about preparation for the T20 and ODI series.
Sumathipala defused rumors that they had discussed about Mathews captaincy during the discussion.
Sumathipala was of the view that Mathews who is a very senior and experienced player in international cricket is the most suitable campaigner to lead Sri Lanka at the 2019 World Cup.
Mathews too must understand this responsibility and should work towards to rebuild the team. We hope that the South African pitches for T20 and ODI series will be more familiar to our players, the SLC president said.
Sumathipala praised the Lankan pace attack, especially Lahiru Kumara who bowled 145kmph despite the series loss. There were many mental setbacks in our players during the last three-four months. But with new High Performance Manager Simon Willis we were able to minimise those problems and hope the team will get back on the right track very soon, he said.
We have selected the best 11 out of 20. If we are afraid of losing, we will not learn to win. It is quite pathetic to accept that we could not go beyond the 150 mark in three innings. We not only failed in batting, but missed some crucial catches where we could have put pressure on the South African batting.
The truth is we were not capable of facing the South African pace and bounce. But we have to find a solution to this.
We are quite satisfied with coach Graham Fords service.
Instead of pointing fingers to people we have to re-unite to get the team on a winning path, Sumathipala concluded.

Not a single clause of the new Constitution has been formulated, Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister said some are talking about the contents of a Constitution which has not yet been prepared.
The minister made these observations at a media briefing at the Highways and Higher Education Ministry yesterday. It is useless to talk about a hypothetical constitution, which is at the committee stage, the minister said.
Minister Kiriella said the process of formulating the new Constitution is at the committee stage.
The seven sub-committees appointed to look into seven sub-sections of the Constitution, have completed their reports, he said. The committee reports consist of the proposals and ideas and views of the people. The committee reports will be presented in Parliament for discussion. The committee reports are not the final draft of the new Constitution. The final draft will be prepared by Parliament based on the proposals of the seven commit reports. The debate for preparing the new Constitution will be held after converting Parliament as a constitutional assembly, minister Kiriella said.
The minister said certain persons are misleading the public about the new Constitution.

Sri Lankas first multi-purpose harbour in the offing
Sri Lankas first multi-purpose harbour is to be built combining Fisheries, Tourism, and Commercial sectors with the aid from the Korean Government, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
Multi-purpose harbour will be built merging the Udappu, Kelani, Madigala, Delft, and Thangalla ports. It will create employment opportunities and a favourable economic atmosphere, he said. The State Minister was speaking at a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Gampaha District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma said the government had cancelled the agreement of outright ownership of the Port City lands and a lease agreement had been drafted instead to withhold the ownership.
Criticising previous regimes decisions, Mannapperuma said: The Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port reported a loss of Rs. 37.2 billion to date.
The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and Mihin Lanka Airlines reported losses of Rs. 13.6 and Rs. 17.2 billion by June 2015.
Ninety percent of the governments revenue comes from taxes. However, low income earners bear more than 80 percent of the tax expenses. As a government, we will take measures to reduce tax burden of low income earners and distribute taxes among high and low income earners equally.
Referring to the tax payments of the high income earners, Mannapperuma said the number of income tax files had been increased from 694,000 to 1,450,000 from January, 2015 to 2016.
Tax revenue for 2015 was 15 percent from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and tax revenue for 2016 was 16 percent from the GDP. The government wishes to increase the revenue and reduce tax burdens on the poor, he said.
He said the Gampaha District saved Rs. 80,000,000 by following the contract service procurement process recommended by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The State Minister said 2016 recorded the highest exports of fisheries and aquatic resources. The gap between imports and exports will be reduced by introducing effective measures, he said.

Tiny moth named for president-elect Donald Trump
A miniscule moth with a wingspan of just 0.4 inches is the first species to be named for the soon-to-be president of the United States, Donald Trump.
Yellow and white scales topping the moths head resemble Trumps signature hairstyle, inspiring the name Neopalpa donaldtrumpi, wrote evolutionary biologist Vazrick Nazari, a researcher from Ottowa, Canada, in a new study.
The moths habitat extends from Southern California in the U.S. through Baja California in Mexico. The wall that the president-elect has proposed building along the border between the two countries could divide that stretch.
Nazari discovered the new species while examining moth specimens from the Bohart Museum of Entomology in California during an investigation of the North American moth family Gelechiidae, also known as twirler moths.
Its distinctive wing pattern and its unique DNA bar code immediately flagged it as a new and undescribed species, Nazari told Live Science in an email.
The shapes of certain folds and pouch-like structures on N. donaldtrumpis genitalia were also unique to the species, Nazari wrote in the study.
Twirler moths earned their common name from a habit of twirling in circles when disturbed. This is the second twirler moth species to be described in the Neopalpa genus, though the family includes more than 4,830 described species, and there may be as many as 10,000 species in that family worldwide, according to the Encyclopedia of Entomology (Springer Netherlands, 2008).

Toyota Lanka inaugurates HINO national skill contest
Toyota Lanka being the national dealer distributor for Toyota and HINO brands in Sri Lanka and a member of Toyota Group Japan inaugurated the first-ever HINO National Skill Contest 2016 (National Skill Grand Prix) recently.
The primary objective of the HINO National Skill Contest is to diagnose, develop and sharpen the skills of technicians at all levels to increase the output productivity and improve the customer quality delivery for HINO at all customer service touch points.
Being a one-full day exercise, the HINO National Contest assessed the task orientation, timing of performing technical tasks, service management skills, maintaining repair standards and service delivery time. These were measured by an expert panel of judges under the supervision of Hino Motors Limited Japan who were invited specially to grace and witness this remarkable event.
General Manager (Service) MatheeshaSamaranayake commented that With the rapid expansions in the country it is critical that the infrastructure development too expands which in turn will help to transport people and goods from place to place. These expansions boost a huge demand for industrial and heavy vehicles, and also for skilled technicians for service repairs. The Toyota-backed Hino presence in Sri Lanka is therefore very important at this stage.
Hino Service Assistant Manager and Service in Charge concerned, Nuwan De Silva stressed, The HINO truck brand launched in 2009, and gained a sharp increase in a short period of timecreating a new level of customer transport mobility solution. In this sense, Toyota Lanka is fully geared to provide total transport solutions with total after sales support. In order to cater to the high anticipations in service maintenance Toyota Lanka has also a dedicated Hino infrastructure with the new upcoming 3S facility (Sales, Services, and Spare-parts).
The winner of the National Skill Contest was Dinidu Buddhika Peiris and Amila Nuwan Karunanayake was placed second. The winners were not only provided a stage to demonstrate skills and competencies, but offeredwith a globally recognized certification from HML. Winners will be sent to Japan for the Global HINO Award Ceremony held in the grandest stage.

Unhealthy foreign policy deprived former govt. of GSP+: Minister
The previous government could not obtain international support due to its unhealthy foreign policy, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He said that it was deprived of the GSP plus facility in 2010 due to the same reason and this government could obtain it as the government has been able to convince the international community that the country has a political willingness for reconciliation.
The minister was speaking at a press conference at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party auditorium yesterday. Minister Samarasinghe also said that the reluctance of the previous leader to listen to them placed the country in jeopardy. He added that he went to Geneva during the previous regime as the Human Rights Minister. He added that he kept the former president informed of the developments in Geneva but he was not ready to listen to them. So during the last sessions I had nothing to answer to them, said Minister Samarasinghe. Some nations were on the verge of imposing economic sanctions on Sri Lanka as well.
He added that it was due to this reason the former President held the Presidential election before two years of the expiry of his term, the minister said.
Minister Samarasinghe further said that there was no condition agreed to y the government to get the GSP plus facility.
He said that a particular media had carried the news that the government had agreed to a number of conditions in its effort to get the GSP plus facility which is totally misleading.
He also said that the European Union said at a conference that the countries that were granted the GSP plus facility have to ratify only 27 treaties. We have already entered into those treaties  said Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. We also have to implement them as we have ratified those treaties.
He also said that it was not enough only to ratify those treaties but needed to be implemented and we would be monitored continuously of the developments. He added that even the GSP plus is not a facility granted forever.
He added that the country was deprived of the GSP plus facility in 2010 and this government was able to get it back this year. He added that this zero duty facility would be applied for around 700 types of exports to countries in the European Union. He also added that according to the experts views the garment exports will get an extra income of US$ 2 billion within two years.
The Minister added that at the cabinet meeting the Ministers also asked the Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva, as the Foreign Minister was not present ,to explain matters in the news item on the alleged conditions and he assured that there was no such conditions and he would submit them to cabinet if there were any. Minister Samarasinghe also said that the the proposed 2017-2021 human rights action plan was decided to be presented along with the request for the GSP plus even before it was presented to the European Union. He added that however it was not a new one. He added same was presented during the previous regime.
This proposal was presented before the Cabinet for their views. However the media had misleadingly carried the word homosexuality which were not included in the amendments. He added that it was the view of some members that the term non discrimination on gender and sexual orientation could be interpreted in many ways and the same was removed on the
instruction of the President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Minister also said that this action plan has proposals to protect the peoples civil and political right but also the economic and social rights too. Lakshman Seneviratne and Arundika Fernando also participated at the press conference.

Ven. Athureliye exposed
The avowed claim of the Jathika Hela Urumaya for entering politics, was to cleanse the prevailing corrupt political setup and redeeming it from the pits it had descended into. Leading lights of the JHU said their very presence in parliament was bound to bring about discipline among its members and raise the level of debate. This was based on the reverence and regard in which persons of the saffron robe was held. The JHU may have believed that the calm and serene demeanour of the members of Sangha inside parliament would have a sobering effect on the unruly MPs, making them restrain their natural instincts. The JHU was on course to create a Dharmarajya, the slogan on which some 15 members of saffron brigade entered parliament at the 2004 general elections.
But things turned out different, when, on their very first day in parliament itself, members of the JHU were rouged up and manhandled (pun intended) by members of the very party for whose formation the Sangha played a most pivotal role.
However, the party soldiered on holding fast to its chief principal of cleansing the body politic although there were splits in the entity, with some of its leading lights throwing in their lot with Mahinda Rajapaksa. Eventually though, the JHU disintegrated and drifted into a state of being just another political party, inheriting the same afflictions common to all political parties, including the casting off of principles.
This change is today epitomised by the antics of the Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera who had cast himself with the lot of all garden politicians this country has been foisted with. Here is why.
The Ven Athureliye, if he is true to the original JHU precepts, should have first tendered his resignation from his parliament seat before embarking on a mission, which, for all intents and purposes is anti-government. The JHU stalwart, who was nominated by the UNP on the National List, though distancing himself from Mahinda Rajapaksa, nevertheless, is going along with the same Rajapaksa led Joint Opposition slogans.
Ven Rathana states that he would campaign against those seeking to undermine Sri Lanka's unitary status and are pursuing an agenda inimical to the country, sentiments that are heard ad nausem from the Rajapaksa camp. The Ven Thera has also made similar statements against the enactment of the proposed new constitution as that being belted out by the Joint Opposition. This, at a time, when even the Mahanayakas have allayed fears of all and sundry in this regard on the basis that the proposed new constitution is still in the making and yet to see the light of day.
The Ven. Athurelye Thera has apparently taken a cue from the JO in looking for hidden devils in the new constitution. Hence his parroting the same words uttered by the rabid elements of the JO day in and day out. Sentiments and observation of the Ven Athureliye as regards ECTA and the Hambantota port projects are also akin to those from the Rajapaksa hymn sheet.
No less than the elder statesman of the JHU, the Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera has requested his onetime protege to resign from his parliament seat if he intends to chart a new course. The Ven Omalpe is naturally scandalized by the stand of the Ven Athureliye to stay put while criticizing the government. It is this kind of duplicity and doubly speak among politicians that the Ven Omalpe and the JHU sought to remedy through its initial foray into parliamentary politics. By refusing to budge, the Ven Athureliye will only cast yet another pall over the JHU which received body blows by the conduct of some of its stalwarts, notably the Ven Uduwe Dhammaloka and Udaya Gammanpila, thus cutting off the foundation from under the feet of the party.
The UNP is indeed in a dilemma. It cannot be seen to be evicting a person of the saffron robe without inviting a backlash. The JO will ensure this. But the party has to make up its mind if it is going create a precedent that would embolden others of similar bent. As a party, it has suffered the most by way of defections and ought to close this chapter once and for all if it is to remain a strong party.
The Ven Rathana, on his part, should come out clean and declare his true intentions without attempting to swim with the tide of protest campaigns that are being organised by the Joint Opposition. He should unequivocally state in whose camp he is, without trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hound.
Aluthgamage jokes
Maverick politician Mahindananda Aluthgamage is holding press conferences these days to claim with confidence that several government ministers are planning to mount the stage on the 27th at Nugegoda where the pohottuwa party will hold its maiden rally. It is the self same Aluthgamage who at the height of the Presidential Election campaign asked the crowds at the Anuradhapura rally not to leave and that the comely Chandrani Bandara from the Greens would be joining them in a few moments. The crowd waited. Like waiting for Godot.

This has been done with the hope of penetrating all 25 districts within Sri Lanka and ensuring that every nook and corner of the country receives the opportunity of experiencing the brands being marketed under Vision Care.
Vision Care General Manager Harsha Maduranga commented, Vision Care has come upon the realization that every citizen has the right to enjoy a fundamental necessity when it comes to eye care solutions and that approach has led us to establish the mobile facilities. Under Vision Cares own systemized training centre, we have embarked on providing todays youth with the opportunity to experience and understand an all-important segment of prospects in the field of eye and hearing care.
Vision Care has also embarked on the exercise of initiating two mobile services where a selected range of products and services would be arranged and made aware of through the mobile service and taken into remote areas of the country, taking Vision Care and its services to prospective customers.

Wadduwa Central girls excel in cricket
Wadduwa Central College, in the Kalutara Education Zone, has made remarkable progress in the cricketing and athletic spheres.
The school has been popular due to a number of sporting records at Zonal, district, provincial and national level tournament matches and big matches.
Dhanushka Ranmuthu, the senior cricket coach of the school, with the co-operation of D. Kenneth, has dedicated much of his time and strength in producing a girls cricket team. Within a very short period of less than 6 months, Dhansuhka was able to produce a very talented and hard working girls cricket team for the first time in the history of Wadduwa Central.
They won their first ever tournament cricket match played against the Bolossagama MV team played at the Wadduwa Central College Playground. Dhanushka says, its very difficult to establish a hard ball team and there are only three schools having girls leather ball cricket teams in the Kalutara Zone up to now.
Bolossagama MV, Mahanama MV, Panadura and Wadduwa Central College are the only three schools where girls hard ball cricket is played, according to cricketing reports.
Dhanuska Ranmuthu, who was also a former head prefect of his Alma Mater Wadduwa Central College has a genuine love for this cricket team. He usually gets his boys and girls to practice after school hours at least three days a week, the Master in-charge of sports and cricket at Wadduwa Central, D. Kenneth told Daily News recently.
Dhanushka Ranmuthu highly appreciates the co-operation extended by the principal of Wadduwa Central S.D.N. Gunarathne.

Watson, a new Disney Princess
One of the most wondrous things about Disneys great array of onscreen princesses is just how they affect different people.
Everyone has a favourite. Everyone has one who seems to best reflect their personality, ambitions, and dreams; for Emma Watson, that seems to be Beauty and the Beasts Belle, who shes taken on in Disneys live-action adaptation of the classic 1991 animation.
Indeed, Watson revealed to Total Film that she was originally offered the role of Cinderella in Kenneth Branaghs live-action remake, but turned it down, with the role eventually going to Lily James instead.
I didnt know they were going to make Beauty and the Beast at the time I turned down Cinderella. But when they offered me Belle, I just felt the character resonated with me so much more than Cinderella did, she explained.
Theres this kind of outsider quality that Belle had, and the fact she had this really empowering defiance of what was expected of her. In a strange way, she challenges the status quo of the place she lives in, and I found that really inspiring. And also, she manages to keep her integrity and have a completely independent point of view.
Indeed, Watson only accepted Beauty and the Beast on the condition that she could work with director Bill Condon on updating Belles character; for example, suggesting that she take over her fathers job as inventor.
Beauty and the Beast sees director Condon, best known for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, take on a script by Stephen Chbosky, who directed Watson in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Watson stars alongside the likes of Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Josh Gad, Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.
The animated original grossed more than $375 million at the global box office and earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture; this version sees Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken re-recording songs from the original alongside fresh material from himself and Tim Rice.

We are the last defence against Trump
In the second half of the 20th century, the main threat to democracy came from the men in uniform. Fledgling democracies such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Thailand, and Turkey were set back by dozens of military coups. For emerging democracies hoping to ward off such military interventions into domestic politics, Western European and American institutions, which vested all political authority in the hands of elected civilian governments, were offered as the model to follow. They were the best way to ensure that democracy, as Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan famously put it, became the only game in town.
Far from most thinkers minds was whether Western institutions might be inviting a different threat to democracy  personal rule, in which civilian state institutions such as the bureaucracy and courts come under the direct control of the executive, and the lines between the states interests and those of the ruler begin to blur. Most believed personal rule was something that applied only to the worst of the tin-pot dictatorships, such as that of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, Daniel arap Moi in Kenya, or Sani Abacha in Nigeria. The checks and balances built in the fabric of Western institutions, the thinking went, would withstand any such usurpation.
Democratically elected leaders
Yet today we are coming to discover that contemporary democracy has its own soft underbelly  not so much a weakness against a cabal of colonels conspiring a violent takeover of government, but the gutting of state institutions and the incipient establishment of a variant of personal rule. Examples of personal rule include Venezuela under Hugo Chavez, Russia under Vladimir Putin, and Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
These differ from the Mobutus, arap Mois and the Abachas of the world, because they are engineered by democratically elected leaders and maintain a much higher degree of legitimacy among some segments of the population. But they still showcase how this process can irreparably damage institutions and hollow out democracy. Now, these examples are poised to include America under Donald Trump.
Trump appears to share several political goals and strategies with Chavez, Putin, and Erdogan. Like them, he seems to have little respect for the rule of law or the independence of state institutions, which he has tended to treat as impediments to his ability to exercise power. Like them, he has a blurred vision of national and personal interests. Like them, he has little patience with criticism and a long-established strategy of rewarding loyalty, which can be seen in his high-level appointments to date. This is all topped by an unwavering belief in his abilities.
What makes America vulnerable to being blindsided by such a threat is our unwavering  and outdated  belief in the famed strength of our institutions.
Of course, the United States has much better institutional foundations and a unique brand of checks and balances, which were entirely absent in Venezuela, Russia, and Turkey. But many of these still wont be much help against the present threat. Not only are Americas institutions particularly ill-equipped, in this moment, to stand up against Trump; in some cases they may actually enable him.
Threat to U.S. institutions
The first bulwark against any sort of personalizing threat to U.S. institutions is the countrys vaunted separation of powers. The legislature, elected separately from the executive, is supposed to stop in its tracks any president attempting to exceed his authority; it has indeed acted in this fashion during frequent periods of divided government, and when lawmakers on the Hill could follow their own constituencies wishes and their own principles.
Their capacity to do this, however, is much less true today, thanks to a historic rise in polarization between Republicans and Democrats and a pronounced shift toward party discipline.
Consequently, as political scientists Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole, and Howard Rosenthal document in their book Polarized America, House members and senators are now very unlikely to deviate from their party line. Such a rise in partisanship comes at the worst possible time, just as these protections are needed most. But given how quickly the Republican Party has regrouped around Trump on most issues, it would be optimistic to imagine a principled resistance to his appointments and most policy initiatives from a Republican-dominated Congress.
And so it follows, in turn, that the check on presidential power from an independent judiciary, the second leg of the separation of powers stool, is also unlikely to hold up. In truth, judicial independence in the United States has always been somewhat precarious, dependent on norms much more than rules.
The president not only appoints justices to the Supreme Court and top federal judges (a prerogative Trump appears set to fully utilize), but also controls the Department of Justice through his attorney general. Any institutional resistance to inappropriate nominees would only be offered up by Congress, which, as discussed, seems poised to take Trumps machinations lying down. And so the judicial institutions, too, are headed toward pliancy.

We picked the best squad for the Test series - Jayasuriya
Chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya said that it was not a surprise that the Sri Lankan team lost to South Africa playing on their fast pitches.
We had included a bunch of young cricketers to South Africa, thinking about the future of the national team. They need time to mould. So we have to accept the loss. We have just begun, said Jayasuriya during a press briefing at the SLC yesterday.
As the Sri Lanka team is full of young blood, it is not a surprise that they faced a setback in South Africa. Even though we have given them the best squad, things did not turn out as we thought. We wanted one of the top four batsmen to play a long innings and score a hundred. At least two or three batsmen should have played a long innings. But it did not work, Jayasuriya explained.
Jayasuriya said the blame should not go to the captain.
This is not a time to blame and destroy Mathews captaincy. This is a time we have to strengthen Mathews. As a former captain I know how these allegations will badly affect Mathews moral especially during a series. We have to support Mathews, correct our faults and face the T20 and ODI series with confidence, he said.
When questioned why Mathews who bowls at 120kmph did not allow Lahiru Kumara who recorded 140kmph to open the bowling, Jayasuriya did not come up with a straight answer.
Some bowlers like to bowl later when the ball gets old, I do not know whether Lahiru preferred to bowl later, said Jayasuriya. We had also decided to send Kusal Perera at number three allowing him to play his usual game, but when he failed we brought Dhananjaya de Silva up the order as he has told there is no support for him at the other end when he comes to bat at number seven. So likewise we had to change our batting order, Jayasuriya stated.

Into the wilderness
At times life experiences are so complex that one finds it hard to gather words to express them. This is why globally renowned photographer Destin sparks says that photography is a story one fails to put into words. Viewers get this feeling when they encounter Mahinda Vithanchchis work.
The seasoned photographer will be holding his seventh photography exhibition Montage on Life II at the J D A Perera Gallery, Horton Place. The opening ceremony of the exhibition is on January 20. Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka will be the Chief Guest at the event. The Guest of Honour will be University Grants Commission Chairman, Prof Mohan de Silva. Montage on Life II will run till January 22.
Wild life and nature is mainly in focus at the exhibition. There will be more than a 100 photographs on display.
I will be retiring next year from ANCL. I worked for 34 years in the media and out of that span, 17 years has been rendered for ANCL. It is a tiring occupation. I feel that now it is the time to put a full stop to my occupation in the media. However I am not one to laze around doing nothing. I wish to do something for myself now using the invaluable experiences I gained through my occupation, Mahinda said.
Mahinda has not limited himself to taking photos alone during his stint in the media. He has ventured into other sectors as well and had made contacts socializing in the field.
I have good friends in the media and they have stood by my side on various occasions. They are very cooperative towards me if I invite them for events, he added.
Mahinda notes that it is mostly because of the lack of time that his capacity to capture more scenic locations is limited. He says he could have presented a more enthralling collection of pictures displaying the beauty of Sri Lanka if he had more free time at hand.
I was limited because I had to perform my duty towards my occupation. I do not have any sophisticated equipment either. I captured these photos with the limited equipments that I could get my hands on. Most of these images were captured by borrowing camera equipments from colleagues, he expressed.
Mahinda says that capturing these photographs was no walk in the park since he had to go through various hardships in the wilderness. he has ventured and taken pictures in many of the wildlife national parks and forest areas in the island including Kumana, Wilpattu, Yala, Galge, Bundala, Minneriya, Gal Oya etc.
I even have a few video clips of myself trekking through various obstacles in the jungle. You can see me crawling on the ground, climbing steeps and scaling to the top of trees in those clips. I am hoping to edit them and present them as a documentary, he said adding that the former Wildlife Department Kumana Park Coordinator Suranga Ratnayake has been very supportive toward his ventures.
He notes that all wild animals are ferocious in some manner.
The law in the jungle is that each and every creature fears the other. We were able to get close to the animals due to the help of the wildlife guards who accompanied us during our trips. They knew how to handle matters on unexpected occasions. Since we did not have some of the latest equipment we had to get as close to our target as possible to capture the images. We have been through many dangerous experiences having being chased by elephants and nearly trampled down by a herd of oxen. Therefore all the images we have captured are images of the moment and difficult to capture, he explained.
Talking about the feedback he received for his former exhibition Montage on Life in 2014, he notes that many of those who viewed it expressed their appreciation for his effort.
I believe that Montage on Life II is presented in a manner which is more developed than the previous exhibition. Some people who witnessed Montage on Life in 2014 said that they felt like they had been transported from the busy city to the wilderness when they entered the venue. Some even said that they felt the nostalgia of going back to their village days about three decades back, he expressed.
J D C Printing Technologies Pvt Limited is the sponsor of Montage on Life II. The photographs were printed in India. Mahinda has included some of the photographs in the exhibition into a coffee table book as well. This will be available at the exhibition.

Worlds oldest Bornean orangutan goes ape on her 62nd birthday
The worlds oldest Bornean orangutan, Gypsy Chan, goes ape on her 62nd birthday by shoving her two-year-old grandson, Apis face into her towering fruit cake.
The sweet photo at Tokyos Tama Zoo, Japan, by British snapper David Williams, 41, will cause tiers of joy. Gypsy wowed the science world when she was spotted acting as a peacemaker by breaking up fights between apes
Scientists, writing in the journal Primates, say this is the first time an orangutan had behaved in this way.
Dr Tomoyuki Tajima of Kyoto University in Japan, who recorded the behaviour along with colleague Mr Hidetoshi Kurotori, a keeper at the Tama Zoological Park in Tokyo, said: Orangutans spend most of their time alone in the wild. However, they sometimes come and travel together, so researchers regard them as semi-solitary.
Molly, the worlds oldest captive orangutan, sadly died at the zoo in 2011. She was aged 59. Molly arrived at Ueno Zoological Gardens, another zoo in Tokyo, in 1955 from Indonesia and was the first orangutan in post-war Japan. She found fame when she became an artist by drawing with crayons in 2002.
Gypsy is now the worlds oldest and clearly still going strong as these pictures show.

Yuvraj, Dhoni blitz hands India ODI series
Cuttack: Veterans Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni turned back the clock with blistering centuries to set up Indias series clinching 15-run win against England in the second one-day international in Cuttack on Thursday.
England skipper Eoin Morgan struck a valiant 102 as the visitors, who were chasing 382 for victory, gave the hosts a scare after they ended the reply on 366-8.
With England requiring 46 off the final three overs the visitors stood an outside chance but Morgans unfortunate run out in the penultimate over ended their hopes.
The left-handed batsman hit 6 fours and 5 sixes during his 81-ball blitz.
But it was the 256-run fourth-wicket partnership between Yuvraj (150) and Dhoni (134) that handed India an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
The day belonged to the 35-year-old Yuvraj, who made his highest ever ODI score, and former captain Dhoni as they delighted a sell-out crowd at Cuttacks Barabati Stadium.
The left-handed Yuvraj, who is making a comeback in the ODI side after a gap of three years, counter attacked after India were in early trouble at 25 for three.
Yuvraj, who last scored a hundred against West Indies in the 2011 World Cup, recorded his 14th ODI century as he smacked 21 fours and 3 sixes in a 127-ball knock.
In the process, he overtook the great Sachin Tendulkars record run tally in ODIs against England, and he has now accumulated 1,478 runs in 36 matches.
Dhoni had a relatively sedate start, seeing out two maidens before boosting his confidence with a couple of boundaries.
The wicketkeeper-batsman, who survived a dropped catch on 43, made the most of the reprieve to post his 10th ODI hundred as he hit 10 fours and 6 sixes.
Yuvraj was caught behind off Woakes while Dhoni fell to Liam Plunkett but their departure was scant consolation to the England bowlers who were all carted around the park.
In Englands innings, Jason Roy (82) and Joe Root (54) put on 100 runs for the second wicket to try and set up the chase but the Indian spinners struck back to dent the oppositions hopes.
It was then that Morgan rose to the occasion with an exemplary showing as he put on 93 runs for the sixth wicket with Moeen Ali (55) to keep the chase alive. But the pressure of keeping pace with the ever-increasing run rate finally got to the visiting side as Plunkett remained unbeaten on 27. AFP

Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the views of most of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party members were that the Executive Presidency should remain unchanged.
He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party auditorium.
He also said that most of the Central Committee members of the SLFP were of that opinion and future discussions would be taken in this regard at the Central Committee.
"President Maithripala Sirisena was of a different opinion and he went further to move a motion in Parliament to abolish the powers of the Executive Presidency," Minister Samarasinghe said.
"However, the Court decided that the President is elected by the people so that curtailing of powers should be approved by the people at a referendum."
He also said that where the manifesto is concerned, the President had clearly said that he would do the changes within the powers of Parliament and would not go for a referendum.
He further said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party did not accept the Federal situation to the country.
He added that if the Executive Presidency is in existence, the country is not Federal.
Questioned by the media if the same view was shared by the UNP on the Executive Presidency, Minister Samarasinghe said they speak on the views of the SLFP and they stand for it.

He said that they face many challenges when taking loans.If we could free ourselves from the installment to be paid, we can obtain a loan for a lower interest rate. Then we will be able to develop the Eastern terminal under a different method. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority owns a larger portion and we are not going to assign the port to others.
Minister Ranathunga expressed these views while speaking in a ceremony which was held in the Mahapola training institute. We have taken every possible step to sign the agreement in a way it gives more advantages to the institutions related to the subject of Ports and Shipping.
We are not working to destroy the port, which was developed due to the contribution by the workers, Minister Arjuna Ranathunga emphasized.
Debts installments relevant Hambantota Port is being paid through the profit we earn from the Colombo Port. Hambantota Port is located in a very important place in accordance with the maritime industry. If we will be able to reduce debts on the Hambantota Port, we could consider our ability to bring an investor for the development of the Eastern terminal.

Agri exports: Whats holding Sri Lanka back
A study by Verit Research (VR) together with the Lanka Fruit and Vegetables Producers, Processors and Exporters Association (LFVPPEA) found that domestic barriers faced by Sri Lankan exporters at the border of their own country to be a significant problem.
These barriers exist especially for agricultural exports, which can enrich the rural and farm economy. Agricultural exports, especially perishables, suffer the greatest difficulty within the country, not outside.
The study identifies three types of domestic barriers that the export sector face when dealing with border agencies in Sri Lanka; 1) Regulatory barriers, 2) Administrative barriers and 3) Information barriers.
Fixing domestic barriers: The Need for Introspection
These domestic barriers, also called Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs), refer to barriers traders face at the border of a country. These include cumbersome border procedures that cause unnecessary delays and add to cost of trading. These barriers significantly undermine the trade competitiveness of Sri Lankan products in the international market. Therefore, removing these barriers is critical to revive exports.
The external barriers faced by Sri Lankan exporters abroad have received much attention. The government has taken initiatives to remove these barriers by entering into free trade agreements with a number of countries (e.g. India, China). However, very little effort has been made to remove domestic barriers. This is despite the fact that addressing domestic barriers is far easier than trying to persuade foreign governments to reduce the barriers they impose on Sri Lankan products through trade agreements. Given below are some examples of the barriers faced by agricultural exports in Sri Lanka:
1. Regulatory Barriers: The Act was passed 17 years ago, but plant protection regulations are yet to be published
Outdated regulations undermine both export potential and the safety and quality of agricultural products traded. Sri Lanka enacted the Plant Protection Act of 1999, which aims to protect plants in Sri Lanka from foreign pests and diseases. However, to give effect to the Act, the Minister of Agriculture must publish regulations aimed at protecting Sri Lankan plants from foreign pests and disease. It has been 18 years since the Act was put in place, and regulations are yet to be published. Instead, the import of plants and plant material today is governed by regulations published 36 years ago, in Extraordinary Gazette No. 165/2 of 1981.
2. Administrative barriers: After 8 years of peace, security checkpoints continue to undermine export competitiveness
Every hour of delay caused by various administrative procedures adversely affects the quality and competitiveness of perishable agricultural exports. At present, exporters are checked for regulatory compliance by three border agencies  National Plant Quarantine Service, Sri Lanka Customs and Sri Lankan Cargo. Yet in addition to this, exporters have go through an additional security check by the Sri Lankan Airforce at the entrance to the airport.
This increases the time in transit, adds to the cost of exporting and compromises the quality of the products. The inspections are carried out in an open area without any temperature controls. Perishable products which are pre-cooled for several hours prior to packing are frequently exposed to heat and contamination during inspection. Further, the aisle that is left empty in the lorry for an Airforce officer to inspect products reduces the loading capacity of a lorry to 80%, and increases the transport cost.
3. Information barriers: Time and cost of finding information is high in Sri Lanka
Making information available online can help significantly reduce time and cost of looking for information. Research revealed that government agencies in Sri Lanka lag far behind in terms of disseminating relevant information online. Applications for export and import permits are not made available online, and when they are available, the forms are outdated. This compels traders to physically visit the relevant agencies to obtain the application forms. Despite almost all relevant government agencies having websites, even basic information such as points of contact on the relevant government websites are often incorrect. Further, communication of changes to regulations are often delayed or obtained through third parties, adding to the transaction costs experienced by traders.
Efficiency of border procedures: Sri Lanka lags behind regional peers
The time and cost taken to comply with numerous government border regulations are a significant factor affecting the international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products. Sri Lankas global ranking for the efficiency and transparency of border administration went down from 87th place (2014) to 97th (2016) out of 136 countries, according to the Global Trade Enabling Index. Sri Lanka lags behind regional peers such as Thailand (44th), India (75th) and Vietnam (86th). According to Doing Business Index 2017 of the World Bank, it takes 76 hours on average to comply with export documentary requirements in Sri Lanka compared to 11 hours in Thailand, 38 hours in India and 50 hours in Vietnam. Thus, addressing domestic barriers will undoubtedly help enhance competitiveness of Sri Lankan products vis a vis other countries.
These examples are only a few of the numerous barriers agricultural exporters face at the Sri Lankan border. The negative impact of these domestic barriers on the international competitiveness of Sri Lankan products is significant. Yet, while much attention has been given to removing barriers abroad through trade agreements, there has been little attention given to removing barriers exporters face in their own country. If Sri Lanka is to achieve its export targets and accelerate export growth, identifying and reducing domestic barriers to trade should remain a priority.

A(H1N1) stalks: Do not panic, be vigilant
A(H1N1) virus circulates throughout the year in all tropical countries. The routine pattern of the illness shows peaks of infection in November, December, January, May, and in June. The death of three patients at the Kandy General Hospital is an unfortunate incident. They were victims of unexpected complications. Therefore, generally the public has no reason to panic about an Influenza A(H1N1) spread.
According to Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit Consultant Virologist Dr. Samitha Ginige, elderly people over 65 years or children below two years, pregnant women, mothers in postpartum period, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases should seek medical advice from a qualified practitioner to prevent complications.
Without panicking, the public needs to be vigilant. Some people develop complications very rarely. However, those who suffer from flu and feel short of breath or weakened health condition, should seek prompt treatments.
Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said the public need not panic about A(H1N1). The virus can be at any public place in this cold weather conditions. Many may have already been infected and passed the infection unnoticed or with general medical treatment. The best advice the public must heed is to seek medical treatment from a qualified doctor when they get infected with flu without opting for any domestic remedies.
According to Dr. Bandara, individuals in high risk categories should avoid crowded places these days and should not visit infected patients. It can put them in danger as well as the already affected A(H1N1) patients in further more danger by exposing them to more infectious viruses and bacteria.
Consultant virologists encourage the public to followgeneral hygienic measures to prevent the spread of respiratory infections and to seek medical attention for flu. All possible measures to equip health institutions and health staffs to handle Influenza A(H1N1) patients have been taken by the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and the Epidemiology Unit.
Symptoms
Individuals infected with A(H1N1) get sudden onset of high fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and runny nose. Cough can be severe and can last two or more weeks. Influenza can severely affect people in high risk categories with can lead to death . The time from infection to the onset of illness, known as the incubation period, is about two days.
Prevention
When an infected person coughs, droplets spread into the air and another person can breathe them and get infected. The virus can also spread by contaminated hands. People should cover their mouth and nose with handkerchiefs or tissues when coughing and sneezing, and use a germ killer soap/liquid and water to wash their hands. Used tissues should be disposed while handkerchiefs should be washed thoroughly with a germ killer soap before reusing them.
Other preventive methods
Health professionals recommend further preventive methods as well. By following good personal hygienic habits like of not touching eyes, nose or mouth, washing or cleaning hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rubs, avoiding spitting in public places can help prevent infections. Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as having more severe symptoms. Since influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces, sanitizing surfaces may help prevent some infections.
Treatment
Influenza patients need to seek treatment from a state/private hospital or from a qualified doctor. The hospital authorities/the doctor/s decide the diagnosis method and treatments. Home remedies should not be applied.
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is prescribed for Influenza A(H1N1) patients. The drug should be given twice a day (150 mg per one dose). Patients in critical condition may require it more than twice a day. Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) should be avoided.
A private company in Sri Lanka recently announced that SD BIOLINE Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1) PandemicOptimal test for all types of Influenza Virus are now available in Sri Lanka from all leading private hospitals and laboratories. It is a chromatographic immunoassay for the differential and qualitative detection of Influenza virus types A, B and A(H1N1) Pandemic antigens directly from nasal/throat/nasopharyngeal swab or nasal/nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens. This assay is intended for professional use and for vitro diagnostic use only. The test can detect Influenza virus type A, type B and A(H1N1) pandemic antigen (4 lines) with the highest specificity. The samples tested positive, are determined as influenza H1N1 positive without additional tests.

The all-new Jaguar F-PACE was  revealed to the world
The all-new Jaguar F-PACE was revealed to the world with a spectacular gravity-defying performance on the eve of the Frankfurt Motor Show. The F-PACE showcased its dynamic performance credentials by completing the worlds largest 360 degree loop and - in celebration of Jaguar's 80th anniversary- lit up the citys skyline with its dramatic C-X17 inspired silhouette.
The Jaguar F-PACE is a performance crossover designed and engineered to offer the agility, responsiveness and refinement that all Jaguars are renowned for, together with unrivalled dynamics and everyday usability.
Developed using Jaguars Lightweight Aluminium Architecture, the all-new F-PACE delivers on the promise of the breakthrough C-X17 concept vehicle and combines purity of line, surface and proportion with F-TYPE-inspired features such as the powerful rear haunches, fender vents and distinctive tail light graphics.
Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar, said, By remaining absolutely true to our design principles the all-new F-PACE is immediately recognisable as a Jaguar. It offers all of the interior space you would expect  and more  but because of our disciplined approach to surfaces, proportions, and purity of line, we have designed what I consider to be the most balanced, most attractive vehicle in its class. The Jaguar F-PACE is the ultimate practical sports car
Kevin Stride, Vehicle Line Director, Jaguar F-PACE, said, The all-new F-PACE is a Jaguar that customers around the world demanded that we make. The targets we set are among the most challenging weve ever had to deliver but Im proud to say that the all-new F-PACE meets or exceeds every one of them. This is a performance crossover with outstanding dynamics yet also delivers a smooth, quiet ride.
The F-TYPE-inspired design combines dramatic looks with a spacious interior and an exceptionally large luggage compartment.
Together with our all-new infotainment system, our most advanced all-wheel drive system and an outstanding range of active safety technologies, the all-new F-PACE makes every journey a better, more rewarding experience.
The all-new F-PACE also brings the world debut of Jaguars Activity Key. A waterproof, shockproof wristband with an integrated transponder, this segment-first, wearable technology supports active lifestyles because it allows the keyfob to be securely locked inside the vehicle  invaluable if youre going surfing, for example, or kayaking.

Anthony Don Michael-Tony: Legendary cardiologist
At many international Cardiology Seminars over the last half century, Tony Don Michaels contributions to the study and advances in clinical and surgical cardiology had been discussed, analyzed and admired. Elite medical circles in the USA and England are aware that his patented medical and surgical inventions have been superlative and curative aids for cardio vascular diseases.
In over 100 informative published papers on cardiology, Tony had demonstrated his superior knowledge on empirical diagnosis and the art of curing the diseased heart successfully. While all these tomes have been read and digested by men of medicine, we lay apostles of the maestro, can only summarize it all in one word legendary.
In spite of all his erudition, Tony would, in true humility consult me for advice on the intricate micro-engineering necessary for transforming his revered medical patents into reality and the almost nuclear clean conditions required during factory production of the hardware.
Our lives mingled over the last 75 years, ever since we first met as mischievous students at our alma mater  St. Peters College  the Bambalapitiya clique which also included Dion Walles, Nihal Abeysundera, HIK (Herbi) Fernando, Kumar Paul (SNR), Geoff Garnier, Michael Mack, Brian Lawrence and many others - always seriously qualified for the cliched title Boys will be boys. However, Tony, more than all of us, was the exception that proved the rule, always studious but athletic and cricket mad.
My inherent aversion for the sickly odour of formalin and laboratory dissections of rats, frogs and cockroaches were Tonys delight. So his doting father, quick to discover his sons love for empirical discovery, built an expensive home laboratory for biology experimentation, while yours truly gave the lab a deliberate miss every time he passed it with a handkerchief over his nose.
Tony fast grew up to be the indomitable Renaissance Man, a gentlemen to his fingertips, an aesthete admiring all things delectable, a true connoisseur of good wine and cordon-bleu menus, an athletic slim 6 footer, the perfect tailors dummy, with a fastidious taste in good dress, a tenor who held his audiences spellbound with his magical voice and lyrical operatic Italian fluency and a dancer whose lithe movements on a ballroom floor, leading his glamorous wife Sharmini, was always a cynosure for all eyes. Tonys last 18 years were blessed with happiness and the love of his doting Sharmini, who so silently and patiently nursed him with such loving care right through his terminal illness.
This appreciation of an exceptional healer among us will not be complete without reference to his impeccable bed side manner and the deep gratitude of his innumerable patients, for the hours he spent in individual invaluable and accurate diagnostic excellence, however tired he might often have been, after many grueling consultation hours.
Thank you Tony for your gracious caring of the thousands who came to you for solace and health and whose hopes you always unstintingly satiated with curative green fingers. The Almighty has already lovingly welcomed this legendary doctor into eternal glory and all of us must give thanks for the good fortune of knowing this extraordinary gentlemen.

Asias first Helopathic Hospital to be set up here
Rs 200 mn hospital to treat spinal disorders
Asias first Helopathic Hospital will be set up in Sri Lanka by Prof. Sagara Karunathilaka in association with part funding from the United Kingdom.
Helopathic treatment is a new form of medical science founded by Prof.Steve Russel, (grandchild of scientist Bertrand Russel) to treat spinal disorders without surgery.
Prof Karunathilaka who already operates Natural Back Ache Treatment Centre to treat spinal disorders in Malambe said that they will invest around Rs.200 million for this hospital. It will have 40 beds and initially six doctors from the United Kingdom will be stationed on a
fulltime basis.
These doctors will also train local doctors in this new area of medical science before they phase out back to London.
Prof Karunathilaka who was based in London for over 15 years studying and treating patients at the Natural Health Practice and Teaching Clinic in England, (their sister company) said that they will also set up a doctor cum nurse training school at the same proposed premises. Our target is to train around 200 doctors (as Dr of Helopathy) and nurses each year. The Britannia University in London is ready to offer the examination and international certification for all passing out doctors where they could practice anywhere in the world.
He said that his aim is to attract foreign medical students and youth to study in this institution and bring in foreign exchange. I am also planning to set up a 20 room hotel and six mini dormitories to provide accommodation for foreign students as well as families of parties who would use the hospital.
Prof Karunathilaka said that a unique feature of Helopathic treatment is that a patient is healed without surgery, injections or even drugs. We study the X-ray and MRI reports of patients with spinal disorders and other ailments and treat them with form of massage and innovative methods with no side effects.
However he lamented that he presented this project proposal to top brass of the government seeking a suitable 25 acre land on a long term lease in Western Province one year ago but still there is no positive response. If I dont get the land by mid this year, I will take this operation to either Singapore or Dubai.
He said that soon after the war he came back to Sri Lanka and set up Osteo Clinic in Malambe investing around Rs. 100 million. Soon the number of patients increased and he also expanded.
I then rebranded my hospital as Natural Back Ache Treatment Centre in 2015 and increase the bed capacity as well and recruited more staff. Using non-surgical techniques applied over a short period of time, we cure patients who have suffered for years from back problems and related ailments.
I offer to improve patients general mobility and health by treating changes to the vertebrae, backache, muscular pains, aching hips and sciatica, along with other aches and pains. These health treatments apply to the whole body and to the functioning of the internal organs by affecting the spine and its natural outflow.
My expertise in the treatment of back problems comes from many years experience, with thousands of patients from all over the world successfully treated in Colombo South Government Hospital (Acupuncture foundation), and both my Natural (Nila) Therapy Hospital in Panadura and Natural Therapy Centre in Galle in Sri Lanka. Patients have been very willing to give testimonials of successful recoveries.
The hospital was successfully able to treat lot of patients suffering from spine related prolong disorders and to cure them with short time during the recent past with use of Osteopathy and Healingpathy treatments which has no side effects at all and thereby able to relief the patients and their siblings from prolong suffering in their lives.
Prof Karunathilaka is a practitioner and the founder of Osteo-Healingpathy, the world class natural medical treatment.
He has been awarded the prestigious award, The Knight Commander of the Commonwealth, nominated by the Weston Reserve University, for founding Osteo-Healingpathy Healing Science, for his unique treatment methods serving mankind.
Healingpathy has also been nominated for a Queens Award for voluntary service 2006.
He has been awarded a Citation in Natural Health and Spiritual Science by the Weston Reserve University  2007.
The specialty in this unique healing method is no side effects; no oral medicine is given and need no operational approaches, but only an external correction.

Beat insomnia!
If you struggle to sleep, it might be time to ditch the late-night tipple and sleeping pills - and try cherry juice instead.
The fruit drink is known for its high sugar content, but new research has revealed it could work to beat insomnia and increase sleep time.
The unlikely health concoction was used by professional athletes ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics to reduce recovery time between events. And now, two studies have shown that cherry juice also has the ability to help with sleep-related issues.
Nigel Mitchell, performance nutritionist for Healthspan Elite, said he includes the drink as an important part of the recovery protocol with all professional sports teams that he works with.
He said: Many athletes find that cherry juice also supports sleep when taken an hour before bedtime.
After two weeks of drinking cherry juice, people suffering from insomnia gained, on average, an extra of 83 minutes sleep a night, a study by Louisiana State University found.
Cherries are laced with tryptophan which turns into melatonin in the body, the hormone responsible for feelings of drowsiness.
Drinking two glasses of cherry juice a day could also increase your sleep efficiency - a global measure of sleep quality, separate research by Northumbria University showed.
The study of healthy volunteers revealed that that people consuming tart Montmorency cherry juice twice a day for a week enjoyed 25 minutes of additional sleep, as well as an increase of up to six per cent in sleep efficiency.
While cherries wont knock you out like a strong drink, they work by stabilising sleep patterns by regulating the chemicals in the body that make a person feel either drowsy or alert.

It is very important to advise customers as regards settlement of bills on time to avoid disconnection. It is better to give modified information on the reverse of the statement.
a) All cheques should be written in favour of People's Bank  0/A Ceylon Electricity Board duly crossed Account Payee only.
b) Electricity Board will not take responsibility in case of postal remittance lost or delayed. It is better to send by registered post or direct hand delivery duly entered in a book for acknowledgement.
It has been stated that in the event of cheque being defaulted and returned supply could be disconnected without any notice. However if the customer has paid on time, though the cheque is returned due to some technical error (need not be due to lack of funds always) he still has time to settle his dues by cash, if advised early. Therefore notice of disconnection or any other information should be sent to the consumer as he has time to settle. Electricity Board should develop this culture.
Bankers also should have the courtesy to inform the customer in case the cheque tendered in settlement of statutory dues (Income Tax, Rates and Taxes etc.) is returned.
It is high time for everybody to adopt courteous approach towards settlement of statutory dues.

Colombo guilty of 40% water waste
Close to 30 percent of water supplied to households in the country is wasted with Colombo guilty of wasting almost 40 percent of the water supplied, City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary Nimal Hettiarachchi said yesterday.
Old plumbing, together with inefficient and wasteful use of water by the people were blamed for the staggering numbers. The world average for water waste stood at 18-20 percent. Hettiarachchi who is one of the three Secretaries appointed to the Presidential Task Force to tackle issues regarding the drought appealed to the public to use water more efficiently given the stresses placed on the supply during the drought. We will do our best to ensure there is no water shortage.
At present, the situation is not dire but we are trying our best to prepare for the worst.
If the drought continues, we will have to pay more attention to protecting our water sources.
We ask the people therefore not to pollute the water, as this tends to happen more during the drought, said Hettiarachchi as he addressed a media briefing together with the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary and the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary.
The Water Board which presently operates 75 bowsers is expected to purchase an additional 25 to supply water to all areas.
In addition, they plan to build 480 temporary water tanks in drought stricken areas to offer relief to the people. Only 47 percent of the people in the country have access to pipe borne water. The rest rely on private sources such as wells but during drought,wells dry up, so we will have to supply more people with water, Hettiarachchi said.
Ensuring a continuous supply of drinking water, according to the Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Udaya Seneviratne has become the greatest challenge of the Presidential Task Force, The water levels in the Mahaweli reservoirs are at less than 50 percent.
Only 45 percent of our total agricultural lands have been planted (35 percent of paddy and 10 percent others).
The main priority thus is to direct water for drinking, then to protect the crops that have been planted and then the remainder will be given for power supply, Seneviratne said.
Seneviratne also pointed out that the current drought made it a necessity for climate mitigation actions to be put in place,
Sri Lanka has signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 and thus we prepared a plan of action in 15 identified areas, along with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all areas, explained the Mahaweli Secretary and added,
This drought can be used as a good opportunity to introduce new water management systems, agricultural methods and technology that would use our resources wisely.

Corporate donations bankrolling Trumps inauguration break records
US: When Donald J.Trump strides onto the inaugural ballroom floor this week amid the sprawling celebration of his swearing-in, he will have corporate America and many of its titans to thank for the rapturous greeting.
Chevron, the oil giant, has given $500,000 for the dayslong festivities. Boeing, which has been a target of Trump, pledged $1 million. And Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, giants of the gambling industry, are said to have donated more than that by themselves.
They are far from alone.
All told, the group planning the inaugural festivities says it has raised more than $100 million, which would be nearly double the record for an inauguration, with much of it coming in six- and seven-figure checks from Americas corporate suites.
In exchange, Trumps most prolific donors will gain access to what amounts to a parallel inauguration week, carefully planned and largely out of public sight, during which they can mingle with members of the incoming administration over intimate meals and witness Trumps ascension from the front rows.
No matter which party controls the White House, corporations and wealthy individuals open their checkbooks every four years, and administrations reward their donors with private events and other incentives.
But ethics experts say Trumps donors are being given greater access and facing fewer limits on donations than those in other recent inaugurations, despite his vow to drain the swamp of special interests in Washington.
This is nothing short of selling access to the president, the vice president and the cabinet, said Craig Holman, a registered lobbyist for Public Citizen, a nonpartisan ethics group in Washington. This is very unfettered, brazen selling of access. It certainly runs counter to any presidential candidate who was talking about draining the swamp.
For those who have bankrolled the events, inauguration week will look quite a bit different from what it will to average Americans viewing it from home or the National Mall. The festivities will begin Tuesday evening with a black-tie Chairmans Global Dinner for Mr. Trumps cabinet picks, congressional leaders, foreign diplomats and a few top donors.
On Wednesday, events include a lunchtime reception hosted by Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, and a dinner honoring Vice President-elect Mike Pence, according to a copy of the weeks schedule obtained by The New York Times.
Thursday will feature another leadership luncheon, a public concert at the Lincoln Memorial featuring artists like Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down, and a candlelight dinner with Trump and his family for about 1,500 in the great hall of Union Station.
Packages range from $25,000 to $1 million or more for both individuals and corporations, and as the figures rise, so do the number of invitations available and the level of proximity to the president-elect and his inner circle.
Throughout the week, private transportation will ferry donors between a handful of high-end hotels, where donors were given priority booking, and the events. During unscheduled time, donors will be able to take advantage of private tours of Smithsonian museums arranged for them by the inaugural committee.
Depending on the size of their gift, donors are also entitled to several V.I.P. tickets to an inaugural ball (there will be two, hosted on two floors of the convention center here), the inaugural parade and the swearing-in. For the most important guests, including many of Trumps Cabinet picks, his new hotel blocks from the White House will serve as a defacto home base and after-hours social venue, according to a member of the committee.
Unlike campaigns, inaugural committees face few regulations limiting what they can raise and how they can do it. That has traditionally left it up to each administration to set its own restrictions.
George W. Bush did not place restrictions on who could donate, but he did cap gifts at $100,000 in 2001 and at $250,000 in 2005.
Barack Obama went further in 2009, banning all gifts from lobbyists and corporations, and capping individual gifts at $50,000, even as his fund-raising team amassed $53 million, then a record.
He relaxed those restrictions in 2013, generally accepting corporate gifts up to $1 million and individual gifts up to $250,000.
Trumps team said it would not accept gifts from registered federal lobbyists or solicit corporate donations over $1 million.
The committee did not cap contributions from individuals.- THE NEW YORK TIMES

Defending champ Djokovic stunned by Istomin
Defending champion Novak Djokovic was sensationally knocked out in the second round of the Australian Open by unheralded Uzbek Denis Istomin in a major shock on Thursday.
The 117th-ranked Istomin ousted the six-time winner 7-6 (10/8), 5-7, 2-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 in 4hr 48min on Rod Laver Arena.
It was the world number twos earliest Grand Slam exit since Wimbledon 2008, when he was beaten by Marat Safin in the second round.
It was also only Djokovics second loss to a player outside the top 100 in seven years, after his defeat to 145th-ranked Juan Martin del Potro at last years Rio Olympics.
Istomin, who got into the main draw as the winner of the Asia wildcard play-off in December, said it was the high point of his playing career.
It is the biggest win for me, and it means so much, Istomin said, struggling with the emotions of his achievement.
So now I can feel that I can play with these guys and to be with them on the same level. He added: I feel sorry for Novak. I was playing so good today.
I mean, I also surprised myself today. Serbias Djokovic was bidding to win a record seventh Australian Open title and overtake Australian Roy Emerson, who won six in the 1960s.
It was a miserable start to the Grand Slam season for Djokovic, who surrendered his top world ranking to Andy Murray last year and fell to second in the world for the first time since June 2014.
Istomin played at an extraordinary level from the opening game, which took 16 minutes -- signalling the impending struggle for Djokovic.
Last year Djokovic survived an epic four-and-a-half hour five-setter against Frenchman Gilles Simon in the Australian Open fourth round, but this time there was no escape.
Istomin broke the defending champions serve in the seventh game before Djokovic broke back in the following game as the marathon first set went to a tiebreaker.
Djokovic had two set points but it was Istomin who grabbed the set 10-8, ending an 85-minute struggle.
The 12-time Grand Slam champion had more early problems when he clutched his left hamstring after stretching for a volley in the third game of the second set, and called for the trainer at the next changeover.
Istomin held two set points at 5-4 for a two-love lead but Djokovic fought them off and broke the Uzbek in the next game before levelling the match after almost two-and-a-half hours. Istomin looked to be tiring and he dropped three straight service games as Djokovic surged back to take the third set and hit the front for the first time.
But Istomin wouldnt go away. He broke Djokovics serve early in the fourth set and had a set point at 5-4, but the Serb saved it.
Istomin had control of the tiebreaker and got to 5-1 before he took the match into a fifth set with a second-serve ace on his fourth set point.
He was too strong in the final set, breaking Djokovics serve in the fifth game and admirably handling the pressure to serve it out.
He only needed the first of his two match points to claim victory when Djokovics return of service went over the baseline.
Istomin will now meet Spanish 30th seed Pablo Carreno Busta in the third round. AFP

Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States today.
The ceremony is scheduled to start at 11:30 a.m.(Washington time) with a musical prelude beforehand. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will then participate in the traditional inaugural parade, which is scheduled. Besides Trump, his family and the Obamas, several living ex-Presidents will be in attendance. Jimmy Carter was the first to say he will attend, and so will George W. Bush. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also said he will be there. Both former President Bill Clinton and 2016 Presidential election nominee Hillary Clinton are also slated to attend. A George H. W. Bush spokesman said he will not be there, citing health concerns.
Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to set an all time record for attendance, but planners are expecting about 800,000 people, well below President Obamas first inaugural.
Tom Barrack, the chair of the inaugural committee also told reporters that there will be a soft sensuality for the inauguration with a much more poetic cadence. The ceremony opens with the call to order from Sen. Roy Blunt, followed by readings and invocations and music from the Missouri State University chorale. Mike Pence will then take the Vice Presidential oath of office, administered by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir performs, and then Donald Trump takes the Presidential oath of office, administered by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
Trump will give his inaugural address, followed by more readings and a benediction and close with the national anthem.

Dundee man turns Lankan street dog into yoga star
A Dundee yoga instructor has told the amazing story of how the dog he rescued while on holiday has become his student.
Finlay Wilson enjoyed a trip to Sri Lanka last January with his partner, where he regularly practised yoga.
Each morning as he practised, Finlay would be joined by an inquisitive young stray dog.
Dismayed at the way local people treated the animal, Finlay grew close to the curious dog, who he later named Amaloh.
Upon leaving Sri Lanka, Finlay decided to adopt Amaloh.
After his new pet spent nine months in quarantine, Finlay and Amaloh were finally reunited and now enjoy sharing their yoga poses with fans.
Finlay revealed: One of the videos weve done has had 775,000 views. Everyone loves a dog video and random yoga videos.
Maybe its because its January as well and everyone is into their fitness.
I would roll out the mat (while in Sri Lanka) and Amaloh would trot up, he was maybe a year or a year and a half old.
I was shocked at the way the people where I stayed treated him. They would kick him.
When I woke up in the morning Amaloh used to be sitting outside my room.
Ive always had dogs and when I saw the way he was treated and how sweet he was I decided to take him home.
By sharing examples of their work together, the pair have gathered quite a fan base.
Finlay explained: Amaloh is actually pretty good.
If I put my elbows down, he puts his down. If I put my hands on the floor, he does the same.
Its not just that Im exercising, yoga makes me a bit more mindful. Its the entire well being yoga gives.
It helps keep me human. If Im not doing yoga you wouldnt want to be around me.
Finlay, who has been studying yoga for 10 years after injury prevented him from pursuing an interest in lacrosse continued: Loads of charities have been in touch since the video went up and now its creeping up to one million views.
When I first met Amaloh he was malnourished, covered in bugs and you could see every rib.
He arrived here in late September and in the last two months hes become a lot more comfortable.
When I get on the mat he cuts some shapes and sees it as play time.- Dundee Courier, Scotland

The Hill Of The Quiet Mind
Juliet Coombe follows in the footsteps of the pilgrims sacred circuit and is spellbound by Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya, Yalas wild and deeply spiritual rock temple
Driving through protected wilderness in the heart of Yala National Park one hears how once a year the 50 park guides have to protect the pilgrims from being attacked as they walk barefoot through Yala game reserve to a mystical rock and cave temple complex known as Sithulpawwa, which is thought to have been built in the third century.
A place that is both spiritual and historically fascinating owing to its temple cave drawings done in red and yellow, on a thin layer of plaster, in the 3rd century, which give a wonderful snap shot of earlier times in this remote area of the island.
Temple water holes once washing  points for the monks
Known throughout the island as one of the great pilgrim sites of Sri Lanka it is all the more exciting and dangerous for the un-initiated as it lies inside Yala wildlife reserve, which requires crossing a bridge from Block One to Block Two on foot. Risking ones life among the bull elephants and frisky leopards is truly a test of faith as they will if hungry happily take a whole cow or monkey, in one jaw dropping moment, as they pounce on their prey. However, my guide laughed saying usually the elephants want to steal the pilgrims lunches or cameras and the greatest danger is them being crushed by one of them in the process. Talking to the parks guides one has to admire those that will risk all for their religion; some might even say it is a religious test to navigate your way through the wildest of places and survive to make a holy pujas.
Sithulpawwa 
If westerners want to go to Sithulpawwa temple through the park please organise special permission in advance so that you can do this on foot, or you can go on the road to Katagamuwa, running alongside Block Two, where if you are lucky you will see, as we did, a leopard crossing the road outside the park boun dary along Tissamaharama-Yodhakandiya road, where even in a car you will have plenty of wildlife encounters.
Revered and exalted, Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya, built around the 3rd Century BC, is only one hour from The Safari Hotel, Tissa and is an excellent place to stay as they provide excellent guides and an extremely knowledgeable naturalist in the area, who can explain the history of the ancient Buddhist monastery, which is 18 km east of the pilgrimage town of Kataragama.
There are many ancient buildings of interest below the rock temple, which you have to climb up to, to get to the inner sanctuary, where you can enjoy spectacular views. The rock temple has small water features cut out of the rock surface, probably formally for the monks to bathe in and now home to a couple of pairs of white ducks.Sithulpawwa is derived from the word Chiththala Pabbatha, meaning the hill of the quiet mind, which was famous at one time for its hermit religious community.
You park up in the lower car park and walk up one side, taking your shoes with you or facing a long walk back to pick them up later in the day. At the top of this naturally beautiful spot one crosses a path from the main Stupa to get to the other side, through jungle and a rock climb to the top that takes one and a half hours. From here you have amazing views of Yala National park on the other side, which is home to 44 different mammals, of which the leopard and elephant are the most famous.
From the temple you can see views of Yala and lots of colourful bird life
On the walk the naturalist guide will point out some of Yalas 250 birds, some of which can be seen around the large temple area. Yala boasts half of the 495 different types of birds to be found in Sri Lanka, and if you are lucky, on a cool day, you may also encounter a handful of the 47 species of reptiles that can be found in the park and occasionally, if you do not walk too loudly, you might even see one of the countrys three venomous snakes. Monks say there have been snakes from time to time on the jungle path, including the Indian Krait, the Indian Cobra and Russels Viper.
For history buffs this ancient monastery is full of different ruins in diverse places that go back over 2,200 years, to a time when it was a place of worship for devotees as well as a centre of Buddhist education for Buddhist monks teaching learned pilgrims. Things to look out for are the paintings of the first Kingdom, during the Anuradhapura era, and the fascinating Image Houses and Circular Relic Houses, which are spread throughout the monastery premises. It is a good idea to have an expert with you on this adventurous walk.
Pilgrims walk up the rock face to Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya              
The serene quietness of the place, even when busy with pilgrims, is why people say it is so uplifting as one is not only close to nature and what many refer to as the original Garden of Eden, but also touched by the words of the Buddhist monks that live inside the temple grounds. Seeing Yala game reserve through its religious buildings reminds one how until recently this was open land and the only way to see the area was on foot or by ox cart, as cars and jeeps in the bigger scheme of things are very new.
Watching the sun set over this sacred spot is breath-taking and also means, on the journey back to the hotel, that you are more likely to see nocturnal wildlife as they are at their busiest at dusk.
It is a great time also to see rogue elephants returning from a wash and drink in the waterhole and if you are really lucky a leopard or two. Just remember as you drive back to The Safari Hotel to do so slowly, as elephants if frightened can charge vehicles at night.
The stunningly recently refurbished Safari Hotel Tissamaharama is a gateway property to a number of special places like Yala National parks Sithulpawwa temple and is in its own right a major cultural and natural attraction. The hotel overlooks a floating lake of birds nesting on an island opposite and blooming lotus flowers, which are picked daily at dawn in a rubber ring to give as spiritual offerings to the surrounding temples and in particular to sell to pilgrims making their yearly pilgrimage to Kataragama.
It is a serene spot where time does not matter as much as your spiritual well being, a true oasis located 270kms South of Colombo and a lifetime away from busy city life with experiences that will stay with you for a life time.

Human Rights Commission Chairman for decriminalising homosexuality
The arguments to cast aside the proposal to decriminalise homosexuality on the grounds of culture simply do not hold water, Human Rights Commission (HRC) Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama said.
Speaking in favour of decriminalising homosexuality, she said the HRC has been receiving many complaints lately over various threats, prejudices and attempts to arrest due to their sexual orientation .
The Chairperson reacting to the recent comments over the issue, said it was a matter that cloud not be cast aside trotting out culture as a reason, adding that deeper analysis and wide social dialogue are needed about it.
She said the non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation should be included into the Constitution, adding that the HRC has already communicated it to the Constitutional Assembly.
However the Chairperson said the draft of National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017-2021 has not been referred to the HRC so far. Several parts of it were sent to us and we sent our observations on them. However, we are still unaware of the draft action plan that was presented to the Cabinet this week. It could have been better if it was referred to the Commission prior to presenting it to the Cabinet. The Commission will ask for a copy of it from the Foreign Ministry. The Commission has a role in examining the legislation from a human rights angle and advising the Government on them, but many draft policies and Bills do not reach the Commission and we have to search out for them ourselves she complained.
Dr. Udagama said the HRC looks at the issue of decriminalising homosexuality from a scientific and human angle, adding that the country has a history of stalling progressive legislation citing cultural implications as excuses. In 2005, when the Prevention of Domestic Violence Bill was presented in Parliament, the same argument on culture came up during its debate. In the same way, even now some say homosexuality is against our culture. However, if all segments of the society are not incorporated or allowed to have their natural behaviour, there is a serious problem in that society, she noted.
She pointed out that the countrys policies should be framed not based on religious beliefs, but on common grounds. We need to tolerate the differences among various groups of our society. We cannot move forward if we become judgmental, reject other groups or label them. All citizens must have the space to live respectfully, she commented.

Jathika Hela Urumaya MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, yesterday said the governments ongoing constitutional reform process is the least of his worries.
I am not worried about it because it will not objectify, the Thera said.
He said so on being questioned by the Daily News if he meant to signal his opposition to the government that he is against its ongoing constitutional reform process as with his position taken recently to function as an independent MP.
The Thera replied: I hold fast with the government. But I will function as an independent MP outside Parliament.
I am with the government, but no one in the government is responsible for what I do or say, he said. Questioned as to why he took such a stance to go independent outside of Parliament, Ven. Rathana thera said, I felt the need to form a broader national movement to influence the government as to how it should deliver economic growth.
We need intellectuals and experts to play their role in tracking the countrys economic development process, so that they would create their impact on the policies of the government for faster progress, he pointed out.

She lies down at one point but as the beat picks up she soon gets to her feet and bobs enthusiastically.

Viewers have loved the footage, which is believed to have been filmed in America, and uploaded to Facebook by Shelter Cats and Kittens - a community which shares photos and videos of shelter cats and kittens in order to promote fostering and adoption.

India, Sri Lanka in talks on port
Sri Lanka is in talks to offer the Port of Trincomalee to India. Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said the decision on offering the port to India will be taken soon.
Talks are at present going on between India and Sri Lanka and we hope to offer the Trincomalee port, which is one of the best deep sea ports in the world, to India, Fonseka told The Hindu on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue.
Trincomalee has been on the table for sometime as Sri Lanka wants to maintain a neutral stand and provide equal access to its ports to both China and India. Sri Lankas experience with the Chinese, who carried out major infrastructural work at the Hambantota port has put a heavy burden on the country, Fonseka said.
Our experience [with the Chinese] on Hambantota has not been very beneficial as we are facing a heavy debt burden due to the work done in that port.
The problems and corruption in the project prompted us to review our policy on infrastructural development. We have currently given the port to a private entity so that some of the more immediate issues are resolved.
This arrangement will also address Indias security concerns, said Fonseka, indicating that Sri Lanka is willing to address Indias concerns on the visit of Chinese nuclear submarines to Sri Lanka.
The port of Hambantota was conceived as a major Sri Lanka-China project during the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, but the controversy around the debt burden has slowed down the project.
Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, Fonseka said Colombo is aware of its responsibilities in the Indian Ocean region and is committed to freedom of navigation.
Field Marshal Fonseka said that Sri Lanka will remain committed to the fight against terrorism and extremist violence in the region and beyond.
Recollecting the fight against the Tigers, he said that insurgency often receives extra-territorial support, and pointed at the support for the Tigers from India. - The Hindu

The majestic rock with its series of moats, ramparts and water gardens rises 200m above sea level and a pair of giant stone lions paws still remain at the entrance of the stairway, which leads to the rocks summit.
The history of the rock is intertwined with a chilling story; the King at the time was walled-up alive by his son, Kashyapa who then fled in fear that his exiled brother would return and unleash his vengeance on him. Kashyapa built Sigiriya into a magnificent fortress to protect himself and it stands a reminder of the impressive urban planning skills and sophisticated knowledge of engineering, construction and irrigation that were prevalent in ancient Sri Lanka.
The rock is also famous for the frescoes of the Sigiriya maidens that adorn one of the old palaces walls. The frescoes can be seen on the climb to the summit, which offers breath-taking views of the surrounding plains as well as manyintricate bathing pools and reservoirs.

Nature at its best in Habarana
Located 20 minutes away from the hotel near the town of Habarana, Minneriya National Park offers travellers the chance to experience one of Sri Lankas most iconic wildlife events  The Gathering.

Melbourne chaos: Three dead, 25 injured as car ploughs into pedestrians

A young child is among three people who were killed when a car was deliberately driven into pedestrians in Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall, police say.
Police said they shot the 26-year-old driver, who was linked to an earlier stabbing in the city's south, before he was arrested with non-life threatening injuries.
A man and a woman, both in their 30s, were killed in different locations along Bourke St, Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said.
At least 20 people were injured with three understood to be in a critical condition at the Alfred Hospital. Two others are in a serious condition.
width=&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;700&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; height=&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;400&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
Six people were taken to St Vincent's Hospital, another six to Royal Melbourne and five have been taken to the Royal Children's Hospital.
A three-month-old is being operated on after being rushed to the hospital in a police car and a two-year-old is in intensive care.
Commissioner Ashton said at 1:45pm the vehicle entered the city driving erratically and did "burnouts" on the corner of Swanston and Flinders streets.
"The vehicle proceeded up Swanston Street, then turned left into Bourke Street and entered the mall," he said.
"We suspect that [the driver was] intentionally hitting pedestrians. Travelling at speed right through the mall.
"It has then continued along Bourke Street, continuing over the intersection of Elizabeth Street and it has made its way up to approximately 501, or thereabouts outside the RACV Club in Bourke Street.
"At that time, police intercepted the vehicle, as I understand it, they rammed the vehicle."
Police said they believed the man was involved in a stabbing at 2:15am in Windsor, where he allegedly attacked his brother.
Commissioner Ashton said the suspect was known to police and was also charged over an incident last weekend.
"There is an extensive family violence history involved. He has come to our attention on many occasions in the past. We have mental health and drug-related issues in the background of this particular person," he said.
"He has been coming to our attention more recently over recent days in relation to assaults, family violence-related assaults."
He said they attempted to intercept the vehicle this morning but he was driving so erratic they called off the pursuit and called in the air wing.
Commissioner Ashton said there was a woman in the car with the man as he travelled over the Bolte Bridge towards the city from Yarraville. She got out of the car on the bridge.
He said investigators were trying to determine why she was in the car, or if she was being held hostage.
Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said he saw the car try and turn down Collins Street from Swanston Street, but the driver was deterred by the bollards in place.
"To our absolute horror we watched him turn back onto the footpath on Swanston St at lunchtime on Friday and accelerated down Swanston," he said.
"It was just horrific, you think about how busy Swanston St is at any time of day, but lunchtime on a Friday.
"It's quite unreal. There's an air of unreality, but horror."
Mohammed Minhaz said he saw three people hit by the car when he was waiting at the corner of Bourke and Queen streets.
"I saw a red car coming from the sidewalk hitting people. He just was driving, he didn't stop for anyone. The people were flying," he said.
Minhaz said he saw the car drive up on the footpath then on pedestrian crossing.
"He hit one person on the footpath," he said.
People urged to avoid the city
Acting Commander Stuart Bateson asked people to avoid the city this afternoon and overnight.
"It is going to take us a really long time to process this scene. Our priority at the moment is with the injured, and it must be that we give them our attention," he said.
"We ask members of the public that perhaps witnessed the incident, if they've left the city, please log your details with Crime Stoppers."
Armed police wearing bullet-proof vests and helmets were seen moving through the area, along with uniformed and plain-clothed officers.
There were also a number of ambulances and paramedics dotted throughout the streets.
Witnesses report car driving 'recklessly'
One witness, Laura, said she saw a car being driven recklessly near Flinders Street Station.
"People were trying to stop this man who was driving around and around and he was half hanging outside the car," she said.
Another witness said they saw a car doing a burnout before it drove onto the footpath.
One witness told Epstein dozens of police were onto the driver quickly.
"I was just down on the corner and I just heard two gunshots and I just thought it was one of those cars that makes a similar sound.
"Then I heard yelling and screaming and saw the special unit squad car and all of a sudden saw all the armed officers running towards the car, and by the time I got to the vehicle they were all on top of him already."
Former Victoria Police commissioner Christine Nixon saw the incident unfold and said one of the injured was a young child, who appeared to get thrown out of a pram.
"[The mother] she just kept asking me, 'Where's the baby' and [I said] I don't know," Nixon said.
Nixon said the car missed her by a metre while she was standing on the corner of Bourke and William streets.
"I kind of just stepped back, and he went by and then continued on down Bourke Street on the footpath, being chased by police officers, who were probably about two or three seconds down the road chasing him," she said.
"I kind of stood there in some shock and surprise to then hear shots, which I clearly now understand to have been Victoria Police, who had fired shots to stop the individual, as I understand it.
"There was a lot of people on the ground, many bystanders ran to help those people."
Police were said to be on the scene almost instantly, one witness said.
One man in the area at the time said he saw a person lying in the middle of the road.
"I was just walking up Queens Street ready to go to Bourke Street Mall and then I saw people running in the opposite direction away from Bourke Street," he said.
"I asked what happened and someone said shots were fired."
Nearby department store Myer was locked down during the incident, keeping customers inside for a short period, before ushering them out the back onto Little Bourke Street.

Mercedes-Benz takes  chequered flag in 2016
Mercedes-Benz was more successful than ever in the year 2016: The Stuttgart-based premium brand with the three-pointed star increased its unit sales by 11.3% and delivered 2,083,888 vehicles to customers all over the world. This means not only that Mercedes-Benz grew worldwide faster than its German competitors, but also that it delivered the most cars in the premium segment overtaking BMW after a decade.
Dr Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars: 2016 was the most successful year for Mercedes-Benz in the history of the company, and the sixth record year in succession. With new cars with pioneering design that inspire our customers and with particularly strong growth, above all in China and Europe, we have climbed to the top of the premium segment. And we are accelerating further - with new technologies, products and services.
The model portfolio of Mercedes-Benz with the sub-brands Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach is bigger and more diverse than ever before. And the plug-in-hybrid initiative is in full swing: with eight models, Mercedes-Benz offers the widest range in the premium segment.
Daimler's Mercedes-Benz leaped to first place in the global luxury-auto sales race last year. It was the first time since 2005 that Mercedes outsold the BMW brand globally, the fruit of heavy recent investment, a revamped lineup and shakeup of its China business. Volkswagen's Audi unit remained third on the podium. Still, buoyant demand in China helped all three of the German manufacturers to new sales records.
Mercedes sold 2,083,888 units, which is 11,3% above previous year. Every single month in 2016 was a record month for Mercedes-Benz sales - December was the 46th record month in a row. All regions contributed to the growth, spearheaded by China (+28%) and Western Europe (+18%) with very dynamic market development. Mercedes-Benz is leading the premium segment on a world level by far with 80,000 units ahead of BMW and more than 210,000 units ahead of Audi.
Many markets conquered or defended the leading position: USA, Germany, Canada, Taiwan, Italy, Denmark, Czech Republic, Greece, Japan, Australia, Hungary, South Korea, the Southeast Asian Hubs and many other markets including Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the achievement of Mercedes-Benz, Mr Ranjith Pandithage (Chairman / Managing Director of Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC) mentioned As the only authorized distributor for Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka and probably as the oldest authorized distributor for Mercedes-Benz in the region, we are very proud of this achievement.
Mercedes-Benz from its introduction to Sri Lanka more than 7 decades ago, has been successful in maintaining its leadership in the luxury car market. Mercedes-Benz yet again proved their dominance in 2016 as the only luxury brand having the technology to compete in Formula 1, and keep winning the Constructor's title and the Driver's title again and again for consecutive years.

Middle class in crisis, IMFs Christine  Lagarde tells Davos 2017
The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has called for urgent action to tackle a middle-class crisis hitting working people as she warned that inequality, distrust and a lack of hope were fuelling growing populism.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Lagarde said she had first highlighted the dangers of rising inequality four years ago but had been ignored. I hope people will listen now, she said.
Lagarde said the gulf between rich and poor was evident from an Oxfam report showing that eight billionaires own the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the worlds population  3.6 billion people.
With lower growth, more inequality and much more transparency, you have the good ingredients for a crisis of the middle classes [a US term to describe working people] in the advanced economies, she said. Lagarde added that the answer was not for countries to turn their back on globalisation but a mix of policies designed to stimulate activity and ensure the fruits of growth were more evenly spread.
Policymakers need to get the signal now, and really think about how to address the public discontent. It [the policy response] needs to be granular, it needs to be regional, it needs to be focused on what will people get out of it. It probably includes more redistribution than we have in place at the moment.
Lagardes view that the middle class was in crisis was shared by the outgoing US vice-president.
Joe Biden said globalisation and new technology were in effect hollowing out the middle class, the traditional engine of economic growth and social stability in western nations.
He added: We cannot undo the changes that technology has wrought in our world, nor should we try. But we can and we must take action to mitigate the economic trends that are stoking unrest in so many advanced economies and undermining peoples basic sense of dignity.
Addressing his audience directly, Biden said the top 1% was not pulling its weight and urged that income tax be made more progressive.
Larry Summers, the Harvard professor and former US Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, questioned whether concern over income inequality really explained the crisis in the middle classes. The US has just elected the worlds biggest example of conspicuous consumption. That is a bizarre manifestation of a concern over inequality.

A million LED bulbs for households
The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry is planning on supplying close to a million LED bulbs to households that continue to use incandescent light bulbs in a bid to save power.
The Secretary to the Ministry, Suren Batagoda, addressing a media briefing yesterday on the Presidential Task Force to solve issues during the drought said they could save close to 40MW of power if the plan was implemented.
We still have around 20 percent of energy users using these bulbs. It is only 5 percent efficient, explained Batagoda as he outlined the plans set out to save power during the drought. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) supplies 3900MW of power to households with 1300MW coming from hydro power but if water levels continue to drop, Batagoda estimated that in the worst case scenario they would have a deficiency of 600-700MW of power.
The Ministry however is adamant that they would not have power cuts during the drought and has included options such as purchasing power from private sources, re-starting power plants and cutting down on the numbers of hours street lights are lit as measures to avoid this fate.
The reduction of street lighting by an hour would save the CEB 20MW of power. The power plants in Embilipitiya, Matara and Puttlam are to be restarted which would supply 225MW.
They have also signed a six month agreement with regional power plants to supply an extra 60MW in extremely dry areas such as Hambantota.
In addition, a recent circular asking that government agencies reduce their A/C usage is expected to help, We hope to reduce 60-100MW of power usage by controlling A/Cs. Almost 60 percent of demand is used to run the A/Cs, Batagoda said.

Mom, dad, son all share a birthday
Luke and Hillary Gardner never have a problem remembering each others birthday. After all, the husband and wife were born the same day. And so was their son, 27 years later this past December.
The odds of that happening are about one in 133,000, statisticians say. And thats a lot less likely than getting hit by lightning sometime in your lifetime, which some put at roughly one in 12,000.
They werent aiming at a joint birthday when their son Cade Lee Gardner was conceived, said Luke Gardner, an assistant pastor at a Baptist church in northeast Mississippi and a student at a nearby campus of New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.
I really didnt even put it together until we got pregnant, he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. Then we realized, Oh, wow!
Using a smartphone app, he said, his wife calculated a due date of Dec. 15, three days before their joint birthday. Her obstetrician called it for Dec. 19.
So the couple from Baldwyn, Mississippi, got in some exercise to try to hurry the baby up a bit. The night of Dec. 17, Gardner said, we went walking around the parking lot at First Baptist Church of Baldwyn, where Gardner is outreach pastor.
Whether or not the exercise sped things up, Cade was born at 10:01 a.m. on Dec. 18  exactly 27 years after his parents birthdate.
Hillary is exactly six hours older than me, Luke Gardner said. She was born at 8:10 a.m. and her husband at 2:10 p.m. on Dec. 18, 1989.
They learned about their shared birthday before they started dating, while just part of a group of friends who hung out together.
I saw it on a Facebook page first and asked about it, Gardner said. I couldnt really believe it when I saw it. I had to confirm it with her.
The chance of meeting someone born the same day as you is one in 365, explained Tumulesh Solanky, chair of the math department at the University of New Orleans. He said the chance of two people being born on the same day and having a baby on their birthday is about 1/365 times 1/365. That comes out to .0000000751  seven zeros and then 751, or about 7.5 in a million, he said, which comes to about one in 133,000. Statisticians note that this ignores such factors as leap years and the fact that births are not evenly spaced throughout the year.
Gardner joked that if he and Hillary Gardner have more children, they may have to try for December.
If we have any more kids, if we dont get pregnant in March, well have to wait till the next year, he said. AP

Myths in the guise of reality
Anyone having even a prima facie glance at the present political situation would not fail to observe a plethora of myths and fallacies traded as fact and truth by interested parties. They prevent the observer from going beyond a superficial understanding and penetrating to the essence of phenomena. Our endeavour here is to examine some of them.
One such fallacy propagated for some time and taken up in earnest now is that the country needs a strong leader to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Coupled with it is the myth of kingship and its benevolence. The world has moved far away from the age of kings and dictators.
Democracy has advanced so much that it is peoples sovereignty is best expressed by republican and collective leadership. While it is true that leaders should be strong and resolute, they need not be dictatorial and ruthless. The examples of such leaders paraded for emulation are such that they have been in most cases deposed by the people subsequently. Nelson Mandela, for example was a strong leader but he was not a dictator. Nor did he cling on to office. In fact, he honourably retired after a single term despite Constitutional provision to contest for a second term.
Ferdinando Marcos was also a strong leader but he failed to solve the problems of his people. Often it is said that the separatist war against the State was won because we had a strong leader in Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The victory of the war was a result of several factors and the fact that Mahinda Rajapaksa was the President at the time is a fortuitous circumstance. We had a stronger leader in President J R Jayewardene at a time when the war was just beginning but he failed to win the war.
Stability of government
Another myth, a modern one that is propagated is that the State should be unitary to defend the country. It is forgotten or concealed that Sri Lanka became a unitary state only after British Occupation in 1815.
It was earlier a union of provincial kingdoms. Even when the entire island was ruled by a single monarch there was provincial autonomy. If one looks at the world today one could see that federal states are nor less secure than unitary ones and some of them are very powerful indeed.
Another fallacy coupled with the above is that devolution of power to regions would trigger centrifugal forces leading to separation of devolved units. It is not the case since devolution of power is coupled with power sharing at the centre so that the leaders of the devolved units also have a stake in preserving the unity of the country. In neighbouring India, for example, stability of government is derived mainly from the cooperation of the provincial states with the central government.
Devolution of power
Also used as a reason for opposing devolution of power is the myth of an imminent resurgence of the LTTE or armed uprising among the Sri Lankan Tamils. Those that say so are the very same people who boasted in 2009 that the LTTE and separatism was dealt a death blow from which they would never recover. In fact, they went as far they could to ensure it. There is no situation on the ground that warrants such an assertion of a resurgence of separatism.
An interesting development of the post-January 8th development is the so-called super-abundance of democracy. Not only have politicians defeated at the polls appointed as Members of Parliament, political exigencies to prevent a stalemate in the alignment of political forces following the elections Members of Parliament were coaxed into cross over to the opposite side.
It has resulted in a situation where the SLFP is simultaneously in the Government and the Opposition and its members are free to move to and fro at will. In consequence the concept of democracy has been so stretched that it now borders on the absurd. Thus anarchy reigns supreme in certain quarters of the political establishment.
Constitutional proceedings
The same anarchy is also demonstrated in the proliferation of protests which sometimes are made on the flimsiest grounds.
These include individual theatrical performances by maverick politicians as well as protests against the constitutional proceedings of the judiciary and law enforcement officials. For example, arrest and detention of politicians suspected of fraud and corruption by the latter have resulted in street demonstrations of protest by supporters of those alleged to have committed such offences. To call such protests democratic is a mockery of democracy. We could also recall the wild-cat strike of private omnibus operators and three-wheeler owners against the imposition of traffic offences demanding the abrogation of the law.
Abundant use is also made of historical myths to pursue present day vested interested as evidenced by the proliferation of such organisations as the Ravana Balaya, Sinha Le etc. Imposition of age-old myths on the present day reality which is much more different and advanced than the days of yore when such myths may have had some relevance is anachronistic and regressive.
Young generation
While pontificating about knowledge economy, digital revolution, global village etc. politicians in the same breadth make liberal use of obscurantism and superstitions as well as outdated customs to perpetuate the ignorance of backward sections of the masses and the status quo in society. Thus, for example, much faith is placed on the effect of planetary motions of the political development of the country.
Not to be outdone the media have also has joined the cacophony of voices disseminating archaic and obscurantic ideology.
Even new media channels and publications have appeared that pursue this objective. It was some time ago that an event was organised to celebrate the birth day of a deity. Such a practice was unknown even during pre-capitalist or ancient times.
Mention must be made of mass campaigns to invoke blessings of the deities on student candidates on the eve of public examinations as an insurance cover for success.
However, such campaigns would not be able to conceal the deficiencies and weaknesses in the present education system. Inculcation of blind faith instead of an inquiring mind set would be harmful to the growth of an innovative and resourceful young generation.

National Eye Hospital patients in jeopardy
The patients who visit Colombo National Eye Hospital for cataract surgeries and lens transplant surgeries, face difficulties due to non-availability of free lenses and machines used to do cataract surgeries. Doctors do not give prescriptions to buy spectacles from the private sector, patients said.
According to patients, the hospital authorities send them back when they turned up for surgeries.
Only six eye lenses were available for hundreds of patients last Friday. Lens transplant surgeries are conducted at the hospital only for the patients who receive free lenses through the Health Ministry's Vision 2020 Programme.
According to hospital sources, doctors halted surgeries after the statement by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne in connection with issuing lenses free of charge and taking legal action against doctors and the Hospital Director if surgeries are performed with lenses from the private sector.

There is no scientific evidence that Japanese Encephalitis has become an epidemic and that there is a rapid spread of the disease, Acting Health Services Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr.Bandara, there is a slight increase in the number of Japanese Encephalitis patients reported in Sri Lanka from November to January every year. This situation is nothing new. Dr.Bandara pointed out that the four Japanese Encephalitis patients reported from Ratnapura were from four different MOH divisions and therefore it is just a normal situation. The patients were in the 24,30,42 and 80 age groups and have been already cured.
During the past three weeks, around 10 patients with Japanese Encephalitis symptoms were detected at the Ratnapura General Hospital,Dr.Badara added.

NSB re-launches 'Sthree Savings Account  with enhanced benefits
When comparing with the domestic savings of several countries such as Japan , Malaysia and India in the Asian region, Sri Lankas domestic savings rate is in the position of 23 percent and therefore this is the high time to increase our savings rate to a considerable position considering it as a national responsibility.
National Savings Bank (NSB) Chairman Ashwin de Silva made these remarks at a ceremony held in Colombo to coincide with the re-launching of 'Sthree Savings Account.
Speaking further, Chairman de Silva highly valued the re- launching of the 'Sthree Savings Account and said NSB is one of the oldest, safest and well recognized retail banks in the country.

Sthree depositors will be able to receive many benefits including for their educational activities, weddings, wedding anniversaries, for new born babies and for many other occasions,
The Chairman also highlighted that this product was re-launched after several years in order to give a new strength to customers and it is also the responsibility of the bank to introduce more and more tailor made benefits and novel features for the benefit of depositors considering that it is the only way to propagate the habit of savings among people.
He further said 'Sthree Savings Account has been recognised as the flagship account of the National Savings Bank as it lends a helping hand to millions of Sri Lankan women to shoulder their responsibilities and to fulfill their everlasting dreams for a better future,.
De Silva also mentioned that the global finance has rated NSB as the safest bank as the responsibility it carries well with strengths.
As we are aware Sri Lankan women whether they are employed here or abroad have the habit of savings 52 percent to 57 percent and it is our sole responsibility is to introduce important benefits to this re-launched 'Sthree product,.
He also said the message of re-launching the 'Sthree with novel benefits and features will take across the countrys 250 branch network and encourage that every adult female have the responsibility to access to this savings accounts which in turn the depositors could also reap valuable benefits offered by the NSB. NSB General Manager and CEO Dammika Perera said that the service rendered by women is in our society is invaluable and they are in the forefront in the todays society. The re-launched Sthree Savings Account will immensely help them to brighten not only their future but also their families as well,.

Why does AIA reward you for being active Its no secret that unhealthy lifestyle choices and insufficient exercise is the leading cause for non-communicable diseases (NCD) in Sri Lanka, triggering over 70% of deaths in the country (Sri Lanka Health Ministry). More disturbingly, an astounding 95% of Sri Lankans acknowledge that there are definitely things they can do to improve their health but only 8% have taken major steps towards healthy living! (AIA Healthy Living Index 2016) So we can agree that whilst Sri Lankans have a high awareness of the importance of healthy living, we are not really doing much about it!
AIA is committed to help people live, longer, healthier and better lives. And what better way to start than by encouraging people to get active, exercise and be conscious of their health. Easier said than done! Many of us are only too familiar with that overwhelming temptation to take the easy way out. That which keeps us on the couch, or has us getting into a tri-shaw to travel a short distance. That is why the AIA Vitality programme uses rewards as an incentive for you to be active.
The globally renowned wellness programme uses extensive science backed research in behavioural economics and health incentives. Their research shows that incentives can work to nudge people towards adopting and sustaining healthier behaviours. So while your own good health should be the biggest incentive, AIAs exciting rewards including mobile top-ups, movie tickets, discount vouchers from e-tailers and taxi vouchers, do help!
AIA Sri Lanka Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani said This is revolutionary to Sri Lanka as it is a programme that will bring about positive change in an engaging, fun and rewarding way. The message is simple. Most people may not be able to exercise all the time, but every day will present you an opportunity to walk, and you should grab that opportunity, because staying active is imperative for good health.
He added, Unlike other wellness programmes, AIA Vitality uses a combination of incentives and principles of behavioural economics to achieve sustainable change. It is designed to make people accountable for their own health.
CEO Pankaj Banerjee commented, We are excited to launch AIA Vitality in Sri Lanka, which is proven to work, evidenced by the tremendous success that it has enjoyed in the other AIA markets. As the Real Life Company, we care about your well-being. AIA is constantly looking for ways to help you live longer, healthier, better- so all of us can make the most of our lives and be there for those that matter the most to us. So get on-board the AIA Vitality programme- it may be the best New Years resolution you make!

Peace Air makes  US$ 2.2 bn bid to run Mattala Airport
Peace Air has made a US$ 2 .2 billion bid to operate Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) on a lease basis. The bid includes, total operations including ground handling and catering.
Peace Air Chairman, Gamini Wethasinghe told media that they had also made a US$ 5.5 billion bid to take over and run SriLankan Airlines. We are yet to get a response.
He said that they have the money, already deposited to run both these operations along with assistance from Lufthansa Technic of Germany. He said that if they do not get SriLankan they will concentrate on MRIA. We will invest further and then set up Peace Air with 25 aircraft that would be purchased on upfront cash basis.
He said that Peace Air would not only be a region airline but an comprehensive carrier and would be the biggest competitor for SriLankan. He said that while operation a full service airline, they will also reserve around 6 flights to operate a budget airline. Both will operate out of MRIA.
Wethasinghe said that they are also in talks with Malaysian Airlines to acquire four A380 aircraft to operate under Peace Air branding in the second stage of their operations.
He said that the national carrier SriLankan can be easily turned around if its given to them and what is firstly needed is to abolish the lease agreements that are eating the profits of the airline. I dont agree that the lease agreement clauses cannot be amended. If I am given the airline to be run, I will terminate these agreements.
I still feel that knowledgeable people are not being appointed to run the airline. I will take over and I will ask the present CEO, Suren Ratwatte to be in charge of a proposed A380 operations as he is a pilot who flew them in Dubai.
My plan is (if given to run the national carrier), firstly exit from the lease agreements and then to buy 25 more aircraft on an upfront cash basis and increase the fleet to 50 within six months.
He also said that he will also restart the Mihin Lanka budget airline again and reinstate the 400 employees who were sacked when the airline was liquidated.

Plusses of GSP Plus
President Maithripala Sirisena announced the Era of Sustainability together with a programme for poverty alleviation at the commencement of the third year of his government.
To attain success in these objectives, the country needs to increase production, increase exports and solve the issue of unemployment. Furthermore, all these will have to be done while facing the issues such as the uncertainty in weather patterns, meeting external debt interests and service charges.
At one time 33% of the foreign trade accounted for exports. Now it has dropped to 14.5%. While the exports continue to drop, the government is making efforts to attract foreign investments to boost production and exports.
President Sirisena announced on January 9 that Sri Lanka would receive the Generalised System of Preference Plus (GSP +) trade concession from the European Union shortly. He has every reason to be overjoyed about the decision by the European Commission (EC) to restore the concessions to Sri Lanka under the GSP System, as he campaigned at every meeting with the leaders of the EC, either at bilateral meetings or collective meetings at international forums to get the GSP Plus concession.
European Commission
However, the opposition came up with allegations that the government has acceded to 58 conditions laid down by EC to get the GSP Plus. Fortunately, within hours of the oppositions charge, the record was set straight by the Head of the Political, Trade and Communication Section of the Delegation of the European Union in Sri Lanka, Paul Godfrey. He clarified that the European Commission in Brussels recommended granting GSP+ preferences for Sri Lanka to support the progress of the countrys commitment to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.
There EU criterion for GSP Plus concession is very much similar to the policies outlined in the Common Candidate Sirisenas election manifesto. He promised the nation that he would strengthen democracy and human rights, improve labour conditions, protect the environment and usher in good governance.
GSP Plus concessions will be of immense use to boost exports and it would also be an incentive to foreign investors as they could easily export the goods manufactured in Sri Lanka making use of the tax relief offered by the EU. State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena says the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus or GSP+ tax concession will provide relief to 7,200 types of goods. As he explained the garment industry which incurred losses of US$ 782 million will largely benefit from the tax concession.
Currently, Sri Lanka exports up to 2.6 million Euros worth of goods to Europe and this could be multiplied by several times over the years, making use of the GSP Plus duty reduction.
International human rights conventions
It is true that the EU decision pertaining to granting GSP+ to Sri Lanka was made on January 11 noting Sri Lanka has more work to do. What the EU proposed was an action plan and it is wrong to interpret them as conditions. Minister Lakshman Yapa said that the decision was made to entirely remove about half a dozen points in the plan. He reiterated among the points in the action plan only what was agreed to would be activated. The Minister said such matters which negatively affect the countrys culture, society and emergency law such as the powers the President wields in a situation will be avoided.
As EU Delegate, Paul Godfrey said there is no truth in the allegation that the government had agreed to comply with some 58 conditions laid down by the European Commission, which are said to be disadvantageous to Sri Lanka as regards its proposal to restore the GSP + tariff facility to Sri Lanka.
The media quoted the European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrm as stating, GSP+ preferences can make a significant contribution to Sri Lankas economic development by increasing exports to the EU market. But, this also reflects the way in which we want to support Sri Lanka in implementing human rights, rule of law and good governance reforms.
I am confident of seeing timely and substantial further progress in these areas and the GSP+ dialogue and monitoring features will support this reform process. This should include making Sri Lankan counter-terrorism legislation fully compatible with international human rights conventions, Malmstrm said.
An EU report said: Sri Lanka had already benefited from GSP+ in the past. In 2010 the EU decided however to stop the preferential treatment for Sri Lankan imports due to the failure to address reported human rights violations in the country.
In 2015, the government set out a path of major reforms aiming for national reconciliation, respect of human rights, the rule of law and good governance principles, as well as sustainable economic development.
The Sri Lankan government applied for GSP+ in July 2016 and the Commissions assessment has concluded that it met the GSP+ entry criteria set out in the EU regulation.
Developing countries
The GSP system was introduced in 1968 by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on its initiative to encourage industrialized countries or developed countries to grant Autonomous Trade Preferences to all developing countries in accordance with the recommendation of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), of which, the eminent Sri Lankan economist Dr Gamini Corea held the top post of Secretary General for two consecutive terms.
GSP Plus currently covers 13 beneficiaries. They are Armenia, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Mongolia, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and the Philippines. Trade concessions under the GSP Plus for Sri Lanka, was revoked by the European Union in 2010. The reason given by the EU was that no satisfactory progress was shown by Sri Lanka in the implementation of the three UN human rights conventions such as Civil and Political Rights, Convention against Torture and Rights of the Children which were related to the grant of benefits.
Sri Lanka formally submitted the application for restoration of the GSP Plus concessions in December 2015 and after examining the issue during the year 2016, the EU came to its decision as Sri Lanka met all the criteria required by the EU for the GSP Plus.

## Title: Puppies love baby talk, Oh yes they do!

Puppies love baby talk, Oh yes they do!
If anyone has ever mocked you for speaking to puppies in the way people typically talk to human babies, tell them to shove it, because those puppies are loving it.
Ok, loving it might be an overstatement, but a new study does suggest that puppies are more responsive to baby talk than to the kind of human speech youd use with adult humans.
Research published Wednesday in the biology journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B contains some interesting findings about how people tend to talk to dogs, and how dogs of different age groups respond to different modes of human speech. Heres what the scientists did.
First, they gave people photos of puppies, adult dogs, and visibly old dogs, and recorded them looking at each picture and reciting the words, Hi! Hello cutie! Whos a good boy Come here! Good boy! Yes! Come here sweetie pie! What a good boy! Researchers also had the test subjects recite the phrases while looking at photos of adult humans, as a control measure.
They found that when talking to dogs of any age, people used a higher tone of voice, and varied their pitch more than they did when addressing the photo of a human adult.
The humans used this mode of speech with images of dogs of all ages, though it was slightly more pronounced with puppies. The humans pitch went up by an average of 21 percent with puppies, 13 percent with old dogs, and 11 percent with adult dogs.
Next, the researchers used a loudspeaker to play the different voice recordings for dogs at an animal shelter in New York City, as well as for dogs that live in France and Italy as family pets. (In those cases, they recorded the phrases in French and Italian.)
They found that puppies were more responsive - meaning they were reacting more quickly, looking more often at the loudspeaker and approaching it closer and for longer periods - when they heard people speaking in puppy-voices or adult-dog voices, as compared with the neutral adult human voice. The researchers noted that the puppies were not significantly more responsive to the puppy-voice than they were to the dog-voice.
Adult dogs, on the other hand, reacted pretty much the same way to voices meant for dogs and voices meant for humans. Its unclear whether the researchers played the puppy-specific voices for the adult dogs.
The researchers noted that their findings have interesting implications not just for puppies, but also regarding human speech.
By showing that human speakers employ dog-directed speech to communicate with dogs of all ages, this study suggests that this particular register of speech is used to engage interaction with a non-speaking, rather than just a juvenile listener, they wrote.
However, it seems a little dubious to suggest that humans would use baby talk to address all nonspeaking creatures, especially ones that are decidedly not cute. Its difficult to imagine, for instance, people using a high-pitched cutesy voice to address, say, an anglerfish. Regardless, well be baby-talking to every puppy we see from now on.
