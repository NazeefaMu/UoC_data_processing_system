Bollywood's 'Deadly Dutt' released from jail

INDIA: Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt was released from prison early on Thursday after serving about four years of a five-year sentence for possessing weapons supplied by gangsters behind deadly bomb blasts in Mumbai in 1993.
The disgraced star kissed the ground and saluted at the prison as he walked free in the western city of Pune, after authorities decided to release him ahead of schedule for good behaviour.
Facing a crush of police and media outside Yerwada Central Jail, the smiling 56-year-old was bundled into a white SUV and driven away.
"I am out here because of their (fans') support. There is no easy walk to freedom, my friends," the 56-year-old later told media at Pune airport before reportedly taking a chartered flight to Mumbai.
Dutt was originally sentenced to a six-year term after being convicted in 2006 of possessing guns supplied by mafia bosses who orchestrated the series of bombings in Mumbai that killed 257 people. He spent 18 months in prison before being released on bail in 2007, pending an appeal.
In March 2013, the Supreme Court upheld his conviction but cut his prison term from six years to five, and the star was sent back to prison to serve the remaining three-and-a half years of his sentence.
Social activists fiercely opposed Dutt's release eight months ahead of schedule, claiming he was being given special treatment because of his celebrity status.
Dutt was granted several months of freedom at different times during his jail spell to work on unfinished Bollywood movies whose multi-million dollar productions were at risk.
Activists filed legal action in the Bombay High Court challenging his release, arguing that other prisoners waited years for a decision on their remission requests.

Cambodia to use helicopter gunships to crack down on illegal logging

CAMBODIA: Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Thursday said he had authorised the use of helicopter gunships to crack down on rampant illegal logging in an effort to curb deforestation.
Hun Sen recently appointed armed forces deputy commander-in-chief General Sao Sokha and the head of the military police to curb illegal logging and timber smuggling.
The trade, lubricated by violence and bribery of forestry officials and border guards, has eviscerated one quarter of the country's forests in a generation. Hun Sen has been in power in throughout that time, but conservationists say he has made little headway in reducing illegal logging despite trumpeting several crackdowns.
"We recognise that deforestation must be punished. I gave two helicopters to Sao Sokha," Hun Sen said Thursday.
"I have authorised them to fire rockets."
Hun Sen said his government had also confiscated nearly one million hectares (2.5 million acres) of land from private firms in an effort to stop illegal forest clearance.
He said the trade was being conducted under the noses of officials, asking: "The logs are so big, where are the eyes of police, military police, forestry administration and the ministry of environment Or are you guys just the same as them"
In the last few decades a surge in illegal logging has contributed to a sharp drop in Cambodia's forest cover, which fell from 73 percent in 1990 to 57 percent in 2010, according to the United Nations.

Jeb Bush spent $US130 million running for President

US: When Jeb Bush formally entered the presidential campaign in June, there was already more money behind him than every other Republican candidate combined.
When he suspended his campaign in South Carolina at the weekend, Mr Bush had burnt through the vast majority of that cash without winning a single state.
His spending on valets, pizza and clubbing - in addition to the usual consultants and advertising - might go down as one of the least successful campaign binges in history. Here is Mr Bush's story, as told by his ledger:
Donors' cars don't park themselves. With an aggressive fundraising schedule and several major donor gatherings, Mr Bush and the super PAC, Right to Rise, incurred a proportional parking tab.
Instead of spending last winter on the hustings of Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr Bush held off, instead using the first half of 2015 to raise money in places such as New York, Chicago, Texas and Florida. His goal: to raise enough money for a super PAC to scare other candidates - especially those with a similar political profile - out of the race. Over the entire campaign, his team racked up tens of thousands of dollars in dinner and event tabs at the Yale Club, the Union League Club of Chicago, Nantucket's Westmore Club, and more than two dozen other haunts of the well-heeled and racquetball-inclined.
When Bush finally did get in the race, he needed to reintroduce himself to the Republican electorate. After all, it had been eight years since the end of his final term as Florida's governor, and he had spent the intervening period as a philanthropist, consultant and investment banker. His campaign and a super PAC supporting him spent heavily on sunny advertising spots in the hopes of announcing Mr Bush to the post-Tea Party Republican Party as a credentialed conservative.
As the Bush campaign matured, he and the group supporting him built one of the largest organisations of any candidate in either party, banking that his superior fundraising would sustain his high overhead costs, which in turn would yield him wins or near-wins in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where organising is critical. But Mr Bush's message - experience, civility and technocratic competence - did little to win over voters mesmerised by billionaire provocateur Donald Trump, who outshone his rivals with a bare-bones organisation and millions in free media exposure.
Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting the Bush campaign, and then his campaign directly, retained 30 Point Strategies, a public relations company in Bethesda, Maryland, specialising in "thought leadership" and "brand journalism", according to the firm's website. But in the end, the most lasting label for Mr Bush was supplied by Mr Trump: "low energy".
Bush and his staff racked up sizeable travel bills, including $US3.3 million in airfares and hundreds of thousands of dollars at hotels, ranging from a Best Western in Phoenix to the Biltmore in Coral Gables, Florida. But what stands out is the Bush team's taste for the Vegas Strip, where aides and allies patronised the Bellagio, the Wynn and the Venetian, owned by Sheldon Adelson, the Republican mega-donor.
A well-funded candidate tends to attract hordes of consultants, and Mr Bush had plenty. All told, his team paid consulting fees to about 140 companies or individuals, including senior campaign staff members, opposition research firms, and get-out-the-vote operatives in Iowa and South Carolina.
As his fortunes declined, Mr Bush sharply pared back employees' salaries and consulting fees, even laying off some campaign staff members to bring down costs. But let it never be said he allowed his team to go hungry. His campaign and super PAC were particularly fond of the pizza, whether from Domino's or from Pizza Ranch, the Iowa chain.

Krishan and Sheshala win Central Province table tennis titles

Over 400 paddlers participated in this championship which covered Matale, Kandy. Gampola, Nawalapitiya and Nuwara Eliya and was a major success due to the efforts of the committee of the KDTTA which had to meet heavy overheads as this venue is located nearly 20 kilometres from Kandy. The organising committee headed by by former National coach Mahinda Ellepola did their best to encourage the participation of leading paddlers from the Province providing good competition. Notable absentees from the tournament were national champion Udaya Ranasinghe, Prasad de Silva and Nirmala Jayasinghe who ere away on national duty playing for the country at the 12th South Asian Games 2016 held in Guwathi, India during the same period. But this gave the other paddlers a chance to display their talents.
Seventeen year old Krishan of Vidyartha College often in the shadows of Udaya Ranasinghe did well to win a double. He first won the boys under 18 singles by defeating schoolmate Dinesh Kavishka 3/1 in the finals. The loser started off well by winning the first set 7/11 but Krishan Wickremaratne mopped up in the next three sets without allowing the game go into the fifth set.
Sheshala Bandara of Mahamaya Girls College kept out of table tennis due to her G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examinations last year came back to form by winning the ladies open event defeating the Junior National Champion 14 year old Samadhi Hettirachchi of Mahamaya Girls College 3/0 in the finals. Sheshala Bandara won the first set by the close margin of 13/11 but the loser displayed leaser fight in the next two sets as she was seen often gasping for breath. This was too much for the little girl who played in her third final for the day.
But Samadhi Hettharachchi did not go home without a major trophy as she won the girls under 18 title defeating none other than the open event winner Sheshala Bandara 3/1 in the finals Samadhi Hettiarachchi won the first two sets but lost the third 4/11 and her 11/6 win the fourth set finished of the match. Losing in the quarter finals were top paddlers like Ridmi Kandnarchchi, Janani Pushpakumara and in the semi finals Thanushi Ridrigo and Sandavini Kularatne.
Fourteen year old Thanushi Rodirigo of Mahamaya Girls College won the Girls under 15 title by overcoming Schoolmate Samadhi Hettiarachchi 3/0 in the finals. The loser was often slow as the had some breathing problems but battled on to finish runner up.

Legendary steam train 'Flying Scotsman' returns in UK

UK: The Flying Scotsman, a steam locomotive seen as a jewel of British industrial heritage, left King's Cross Station in London Thursday on its first official journey after a 10-year restoration project.
Pulling away in plume of white steam, the 97-tonne green engine pulled out at 0740 GMT with some 300 passengers on board to applause from a crowd of enthusiasts who had come to witness its rebirth.
The Flying Scotsman is set to arrive at 1230 GMT in York, a historic city some 280 kilometres (175 miles) north of London, before heading to the city's National Railway Museum where it will stay until the beginning of March.
The train will then spend the coming months on tourist trips and featuring in exhibitions.
Restoring the famous engine cost around 4.2 million (5.3 million euros, $5.8 million). Thursday sees the locomotive's first official outing since it returned to the rails last January in Bury, northwest England, for a series of tests. "It's a historic day," said Paul Kirkman, director of the National Railway Museum.

Mark Zuckerberg Receives Axel Springer Award and Launched Facebook AI Research Initiative in Berlin
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is known for wearing a grey T-shirt most of the time, but yesterday evening at the Axel Springer Awards 2016 in Berlin, Zuckerberg put on suit to receive the first ever Axel Springer Award for entrepreneurial spirit.
Publishing house Axel Springer likely created that award just for Zuckerberg.
Mark Zuckerberg had a high profile day in Germany yesterday meeting withChancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff Peter Altmeier. Facebook also announced theFacebook AI Research Partnership Program in Germany.
This new program is aimed to support artificial intelligence research at universities using state of the art computing hardware, software and expertise provided by Facebook.
"AI is one of the technologies that Im most excited about. Building machines that can learn the way humans do will let us create new tools to dramatically enhance humanitys potential. AI will save lives by diagnosing diseases, making cars safer, and unlocking new insights about our planet and universe, " said Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.
The first FAIR Partnership Program is with Professor Klaus-Robert Mller at TU Berlin. His laboratory is using AI to analyze medical scans to extend our understanding of breast cancer. Facebook is going to provide 32 GPUs in four state of the art servers to TU Berlin that will allow this research to go faster. In total the social media company plans to provide 200 GPUs to research institutions across the EU.(News Agencies)

New-look Navy should have it easy against CH

The rejuvenated and new-look players of Navy SC rugby team is expected to run circles around the hapless CH and FC side, when they clash in their Dialog 'A' Division Inter- Club League Rugby second round encounter scheduled to take place at Navy Sports Complex in Welisara at 4.30 pm today.
The CH outfit who are lying at the bottom of the table in eighth position received a painstaking 38-3 hammering at the hands of Army SC last week and should expect a tough time again from the Navy.
CH has come into the tournament this year to stamp their class and save heritage of this one-time champion club but have withered and faltered away over the last few years due to the lack of a home ground which is being used for cricket. Also it's noteworthy to mention that CH reached great heights in the 1980s and 1990s and last won the championship 15 years ago under burly winger Ajith Upawansa.
Going on the strength of other teams participating in the league tourney this season the hapless CH and FC side has ended up as the wooden spoonist with all teams targeting them not only for a win but also registering the added bonus point of scoring four or more tries.
In this game against Navy, CH and FC will be led by their sturdy number eight and former Zahira College player Rifkhan Siddiq.
As for the Navy, this entire season they have fielded mostly talented young school rugby players to don the sailors' jersey. Other than a couple of games their think-tank and former national captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa could not turn out for them in the entire second round, hence Navy have found it difficult when confronted with much stronger team to come to terms with them. Perhaps a few experienced players in their ranks could have made them one of the strong contenders for this year's league tournament but sadly it was not to be.
The kicking boots and the tremendous running rugby displayed by their full back former Kingswoodian Thilina Weerasinghe seems spectacular and he should put the sailors up on the score board each time he turns out for them. However it will have to be the combined efforts of the rest of the team members as well; if they are to create any impact at least to grab the upcoming Clifford Cup Knockout Championship this season.
Navy SC (Probable XV): Roshan Ranasinghe, Nisal Desatha, Sathya Ranatunga, Matheesha Sarathchandra,, Chathura Dilshan, Sajith Saranga, Supun Peiris, Nivanka Prasad, Richie Dharmapala and Chanaka Chandimal, Saliya Handapangoda, Lee Keegal, Kosala Thisera , Heshan Maduranga, Thilina Weerasinghe.
CH and FC (Probable XV): Steve Nelson, M.Nizmin, U.Perera, T. Hasaranga, Rahiru Prabod, M. Farhan, S. Migara, Rifkhan Sideek, M. Rizwan and Sajith Bandara, Prasad Perera, Udara Madhusanka, Migara Madugalla, Ganidu Hewage, Janith Chandimal. - WAI

Royally Indulgent and Ceylonese

Spa Ceylon products are world renowned. What started as one outlet rapidly grew to several places in Colombo itself and then extended an arm to Kandy, Galle and few more to various parts of the South East Asian countries. Recently, they grew even larger when they opened the Royal Indulgence Spa (truly a royal feel once you enter) on Galle Road, spotlighting itself in the heart of Colombo where even in the night, when you drive by, you won't miss it.
So I met up with two young lads Shiwantha Dias and Shalin Balasuriya, who are not just business partners but brothers, to share their success story in bringing Spa Ceylon to where it is today.
Q: How did you both come into this trade
A: Well, our mum (Janet Balasuriya) was the inspiration behind this and she always taught us to dream big, go out take risks and do things, giving us confidence. Plus growing up in a business family so this kind of business was in our blood. We never planned to open a spa in the first place as we were in the production business.
We had our Janet brand which was a mass market brand. We saw an opportunity while running the business, product development, factory production facilities in place and saw an opportunity create something different and create something that can sustain itself internationally.
When the war ended, everything was falling into place and it gave us much more in Sri Lanka than we expected. The first store was opened in Crescat.
Q: For Royal Indulgence, why did you choose this location
A: We were always looking out for new locations as the brand has been expanding plus it has been popular with tourists and targeted high end consumers. Galle Road is tourist hub of Colombo - so it made sense location wise and also given the space you want.
We wanted to create a store that has more experience, luxurious, and more pampering - so all this fits into this store.
There's approximately 6000sqft of space with half of it been the store and other half the spa.
What we did was basically take a building that was here from 1970, ripped it to the shell and custom built it to the store. With people working 24/7, this building came up in 3 months.
Q: Can you tell a bit about the interior dcor and the reasons behind it
A: As part of our strategy to increase the profile of the brand and to strengthen the connection with Ceylon. We had a designer from France who we got down to Sri Lanka and took him around the country to give us new inspiration as part of our strategy to take it to the European and American markets. Looking at what was left of old Ceylon, old palaces, temples, art and culture of the country, he gave us this idea of developing a range based on pld palace art and traditional Ceylonese art. We reached out to an artiste who does art in temples and gave a brief of the colour palates we wanted and gave him the freedom to develop this 'flower designs'. And also this sort of art is passed down in generations and it's a technique that looks easy but not so easy.
Apart from the complete brand experience, even the exterior look is to give it the iconic luxurious store for a Sri Lankan brand. The highest quality LED screens are what are used outside for the display of the store. We wanted to create a space that looked international. Another thing is that our doors are closed where entry is from the inside. The interesting part is also that the most of our customers are walk-ins. Even though the locals don't walk much the tourists love to walk. So we are targeting large tourist groups.
Q: How many ranges of products do you have
A: the whole product range we can break it down to two larger segments. First of which is the Dosha range that has body lotions, shower gels and much more. Then we move to our more indulgent range which is also the Royal Indulgence Range which has about There are about 8 royal indulgence ranges. Apart from that we have the Majestic Ceylon Elephant range where 10 percent of its revenue sales internationally to the Elephant conservation of Sri Lanka. Then there is the Fragrance range which is from Home aroma, Essential oils. What we have done is that every section has an experience area where people can try it. And if they like the fragrance we can get it in a diffuser, candle and whatever mode they like. We have about over 400 ranges experience in the brand at the moment. The nature of the industry is that there some new products coming in and its continuously expanding.
Q: How many therapy rooms do you have here
A: We have got 5 therapy rooms, one royal suite which is rather large. The royal suite is the largest and most indulgent pampering space Spa Ceylon has at the moment. It has a separate bath area, two oversized spa beds. Then there is one room which is traditional ayurveda room which gives Shirodhara and traditional ayurveda treatments. There are two couple rooms, a facial room and foot spa which have 8 seats plus a room for manicure/pedicure. In terms of capacity this is one of our largest spas we have.
Q: What about the rest of the team of Spa Ceylon
A: We have a good team in place. Shalin looks after the customers, meeting corporate customers. I look after the product design and the formal relation side of it. There's a sister who handles all the financial aspects of the company, and another sister who handles the spa training and services. Each of specialize in different area. WE have a lot of extended family as well who help out here. Plus we have a good team of people who have been with is for a very long time. We have a superb back office team.
Anyone who has used Spa Ceylon will be able to detect it from miles away and the fragrances just last for days. So if your nose detects a really indulgent aroma on Galle Road - then you know you are heading the right way for an exotic, royally indulgent treatment.
This Royal Indulgence store is truly a "must do" on your list when in Colombo. There is seriously nothing like this. And to feel really royal, you get to sit on the replica of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe's Royal Throne and take selfies to your heart's content and have your very own reigning moment!

Sisi says Russian plane downed by 'terrorism'

EGYPT: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday that "terrorism" caused a Russian plane crash in the Sinai Peninsula in October that killed 224 people.
"Has terrorism ended No... Whoever downed that plane, what did he want Just to hit tourism No. To hit relations. To hit relations with Russia," Sisi said in a speech.
Sisi had previously dismissed as "propaganda" a claim by the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group that it downed the airliner on October 31.
The group said it smuggled a bomb on board the plane in the airport of Sharm el-Sheikh, a Sinai resort popular with Russian holidaymakers.
Russia had quickly concluded that a bomb brought down the airliner, and suspended flights to Egypt. Britain also stopped flights to Sharm el-Sheikh.
The attack dealt a major setback to Sisi, who had been at pains to revive the country's tourism industry and impose control over the restive Sinai Peninsula.
Jihadists there have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since Sisi, then army chief, overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013.
Egypt has set up a committee to investigate the attack, and previously insisted it be allowed to finish its probe before any conclusions were made.
Egyptian media outlets have dismissed suggestions that a bomb was the cause as part of a Western "conspiracy" aimed at harming the country's tourism sector.
The A321 airliner, operated by Russia's Metrojet and bound for Saint Petersburg, broke up mid-air over the Sinai, minutes after take-off.
The wreckage fell several kilometres (miles) across North Sinai -- the bastion of the Egyptian branch of IS.
The group said it bombed the plane in revenge for Russian air strikes in Syria.
On November 17, Russia's President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian investigators had found evidence of a bomb on board, and vowed to punish the attackers.
"We will search for them anywhere they might hide. We will find them in any part of the world and punish them," he said.
Russian security chief Alexander Bortnikov said the passenger jet was brought down by a bomb with a force equivalent to one kilogram (two pounds) of TNT.
Egypt has since hired a British firm to review security at airports, including procedures to check passengers and baggage, and security equipment in the airport.
Millions of tourists, mostly Britons and Russians, flock to Sharm el-Sheikh and other Egyptian resorts attracted by its beaches, warm weather and diving sites.
In November and December, the tourism sector lost 2.2 billion Egyptian pounds ($280 million) a month primarily due to the Russian and British flight bans.
Overall tourist arrivals fell sharply in 2015 to about 9.3 million, from 15 million in 2010.

The Splendour of the North

The A9 road runs smooth for miles down the middle of Sri Lanka, bursting forth from the jungles of the Wanni to cross the Elephant Pass causeway over a shining lagoon before it comes to a stop in the historic Jaffna town. Constantly abuzz with energy, it still maintains a sense of calm that is unlike most cities on the island. Jaffna's recent past is known the world over but its ancient history is rooted deeply in the lives of its people. The heartland of Tamil culture, Jaffna is a wealth of insight to the arts, religion cuisine and warm hospitality of its people.
The Nallur Kandaswamy kovil stands majestic in the centre of the town, the most prominent place of worship on the peninsula that is dotted with monuments of the Hindu faith. Overlooking the lagoon, its walls holding strong after centuries, is the Jaffna Fort, the second largest in the island that offers a view over the fishing boats moored and nets cast over the gleaming water. The peninsula is also a place of myth and mystery - the Nilavarai Well, whispered to be one of King Ravana's secret pathways, and the healing waters of the Keerimalai tank lend magic to Jaffna's story.
A drive over the causeways leading off the peninsula takes one to quiet islands that are miles of undiscovered beauty along bumpy roads, a peaceful contrast to the pulsing atmosphere of the Jaffna town. Walk along the white sand Chatty Beach on the island of Kayts or dip the feet into the waters at the famed Casuarina Beach on the Karainagar Island. The island of Nainativu or Nagadeepa offers a harmonious spiritual experience for those of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. The iconic temple and vihara are a short boat ride from the mainland, across the blue waters of the Palk Bay. A few kilometres from the town, through fields of crops and endless palmyrah growth is the northern shore of Sri Lanka at Kankesanthurai. The calm Indian Ocean stretches for miles at Point Pedro, the northernmost point on the island.
The nerve centre of the Jaffna town is its market, a colourful maze of produce and products that dizzies the senses. Expect to find a range of palmyrah products as the tree grows there in abundance. Alongside these, dry fish are a northern staple and the grape wine made by Rosarian nuns must be sampled when visiting the region. Indulge in some of the finest thosai on the island while savouring the depth of the classic Jaffna crab curry, laden with a heady blend of spices. Stop by Rio ice cream, now a landmark in Jaffna that is loved by locals and travellers alike, for sweet treats to beat the dry heat outside. And now, located on the historic Mahathma Gandhi Road is Jetwing Jaffna.
The first luxury hotel project in the area, Jetwing Jaffna stands proud - a testament to the splendour of the North. Featuring 55 rooms, the hotel is designed by internationally renowned firm Design Group 5 to be influenced by the rich heritage of the area, complete with the legendary Jetwing brand of hospitality.
Jaffna's journey as a destination for travel has only just begun. The opening of Jetwing Jaffna in partnership with MMBL Group, Regency Teas and other partners, is a symbol of Jetwing's vision for a city that has come so far and has the potential to go even further.
In the last ten years, Jetwing has conducted 13 Jetwing Youth Development Programs (JYDP) in 8 locations throughout the country. These programs provide rural youth with free English language and professional training to equip them with the skills needed to seek employment in the tourism sector.

Taking Sri Lanka's Brand to the World
While Sri Lanka is well on its way to achieving its goal of becoming a one hundred million dollar economy, research has revealed that the best approach to fostering peace and understanding of cultures among nations is to celebrate the beauty of their people. This is the core motivation behind the staging of international beauty pageants.
Given that Sri Lanka is poised in 2016 to cross the 2 million tourist mark- the'magic number' in tourism, the island nation will be staging the Ms. Tourism Sri Lanka-International Pageant as an annual celebration of Sri Lanka, each year inviting more countries across the globe to participate, and to truly take Sri Lanka to the world.
By inviting ambassadors of beauty from all around the world, it celebrates and rewards not mere physical beauty, but grace, intelligence and acceptance of different cultures, promoting acceptance and understanding among nations.
The organizers' mission is to encourage friendship between countries and the exchange of ideas in a dynamic inclusive environment. They hope through their mission of bringing nations together, to strengthen relationships between nations and to showcase their beautiful island to the world in a new light as the pearl of the Indian Ocean.
"We are very grateful to the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau, the travel & hospitality industry, beauty industry and state-owned organizations for the enthusiasm, encouragement and support extended to this endeavor", Ms. Tourism Sri Lanka - International founder Rosita Wickremesinghe.
"We will work with determination and purpose to take this brand forward and ensure the success of this event, and we intend to expand over the years, putting Sri Lanka on the map on a global scale" she added.
