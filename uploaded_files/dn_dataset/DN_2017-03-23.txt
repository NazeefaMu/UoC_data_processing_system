Mother of all Shows, cradle of world class cricketers, officials
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega event has not only produced champion cricketers but has also given birth to the top most officials in the game - ICC elite panel umpires, ICC match referees, including the chief match referee and even international level coaches.
Knowing how valuable this title is and its potential to produce legendary cricketers, the dream of every schoolboy cricketer is to win this prestigious award, if not any other major title at the mega show.
With the 2016/17 inter-school first X1 season gradually reaching towards its last few weeks, the race for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year titles has become extremely competitive. There has been heavy voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests, conducted under three divisions.
Old boys, present boys and their supporters have joined hands in voting for the outstanding schoolboy cricketers from their alma mater. That has made these contests extremely competitive and its hard to make any prediction at this stage.
Interestingly, two former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winners  Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis made Sri Lanka proud with two blistering centuries in the back to back Tests in the recent home series against Bangladesh.
Mendis, the winner of the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2013 as a star batsman from Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, anchored Sri Lanka batting when the hosts won the first Test against Bangladesh by 256 runs in Galle. Mendis had a marathon innings of 194. In the second Test of the same series, another former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award winner made his presence felt at Saravanamuttu Stadium. Vice aptain Dinesh Chandimal, who had won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year crown in 2009, regained his form with an exemplary century.
He walked into the middle when Sri Lanka was reeling at 24 for 2 after electing to bat first. Coming to bat at difficult time, Chandimal kept his cool and faced 300 balls in a courageous effort to give Sri Lanka a respectable total. Sri Lanka was reduced to 136 for 5 at one stage.
Although the wickets tumbled at the other end, Chandimal was a tower of strength, selecting only the bad deliveries to go for his strokes. He had one six and ten fours in a responsible innings that helped Sri Lanka to recover partially. It was one of his slowest innings in Tests with a strike rate of only 46.00.
Speaking after the match, Chandimal rated it as the best out of his eight Test centuries. He was the ninth batsman to depart in the home teams first innings but by then, Sri Lanka had managed to go pass 300-run mark.
Chandimals return to form came at a crucial juncture - both to his team as well as for the stylist cricketer personally. Chandimals willow started talking again when his team desperately needed big contribution from him. He had a majestic knock of 138 runs scored through four sessions.
Chandimal is one of the several Sri Lanka star cricketers produced by Ananda College, Colombo which has been a breeding shade for outstanding young cricketers. The galaxy of the Sri Lanka national players produced by Ananda is headed by Sri Lankas world cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga.
Incidentally, Ranatunga is also a proud recipient of the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award, having won the title twice in 1980 and 1982. Beside Ranatunga and Chandimal, among the other notable Anandians who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title are former Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu (1990), Sanjeewa Ranatunga (1988), former Sri Lanka cricketers Thilan Samaraweera (1994 and 1995) and Muthumudalige Pushpakumara (1999).
Interestingly, two former Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main title winners are playing key roles as officials in the respective sides during the current Sri Lanka-Bangladesh series. The winner of the coveted award in 1985, Asanga Gurusinha joined the Lankan team as cricket manager from early this month while another Lankan serving as the batting coach of the visiting Bangladesh team Thilan Samaraweera.
Samaraweera, who had the rare honour of winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice, has sharpen the skills of the Bangladesh batsmen who gave a torrid time to the Lankan bowlers last Friday.
After making only 312 and 197 all out in the respective innings of the first Test, the Bangladesh batsmen came out with a vastly improved performance in the second Test to make 467 all out that enabled to win by four wickets  their first Test win ever against Sri Lanka. Full credit should go to former Observer Schoolboy Cricketer turned coach Samaraweera who has done a wonderful job.
The Mother of all Shows has not only produced great cricketers who had conquered Mount Everest in world cricket but also engraved their names as great officials.
The first recipient of the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award Ranjan Madugalle continues to play his key role as the Chief ICC Match Referee while another award winner Kumar Dharmasena went on to join the ICCs elite panel of umpires.
Sri Lankas 1996 world cup star Roshan Mahanama, who had joined the select band of cricketers who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice (1983 and 1984) too had served as an ICC Match Referee.
Incidentally, current chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya too had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year (Outstation) title in 1988 during his school career at St. Servetus College, Matara.

3rd Asia Deaf Cricket Tournament : Sri Lanka finish runner-up to India
Sri Lanka deaf cricket team emerged runner-up in the 3rd Asia Deaf Cricket Tournament worked off from March 13 to 19 at the Lal Bahadur Stadium in Hydrabad, India. Sri Lanka performed well to qualify for the final to meet strong India, but had to be satisfied with second place, losing the final by 156 runs.
Lankan captain T. S. Jayasinghe won the toss and invited India to bat first. India piled up a mammoth 391/7 with openers Vipul Patel (139 including 15 fours, 3 sixes) and Vinay Sanap (60 with nine fours and two sixes) laying a solid foundation. Udaya Lakmal bowled best for Sri Lanka and captured 4/77. Chasing a seemingly impossible 392 target the Lankans were skittled out for 238 runs in 48.3 overs. Captain Jayasinghe top scored with 56 (4 fours) while D. Sachin (34 n.o. including 4 fours) was the only batsman to impress.
Sijit and Vinay did the main damage to Lankan batting bagging three-wicket hauls.
Teams from India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh participated in the tournament which was worked off on a league basis.
Jayalath Aponso, the head coach of the Sri Lanka deaf cricket team stated, Our deaf boys did well however I would have loved a better fight. We failed in our fielding dropping four catches. I think this was the turning point of the game. I have been working with the deaf since 1995 and my dream is to see our deaf cricket team bring glory to Sri Lanka soon. SLC has backed us with support and we are very grateful to them."
The Sri Lanka Deaf Cricket Association (SLDCA) was founded in 1995, to uplift the game of leather ball cricket in Sri Lanka by active parents of deaf children. The associations primary objective is to encourage deaf cricketers to play leather ball cricket and be able to play and compete in domestic and international tournaments.
The SLDCAs efforts have borne fruit since year 2000 as its players commenced playing Division III tournaments conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket. This exposure has enhanced the morale, commitment and enthusiasm of deaf cricketers from all parts of Sri Lanka.
The SLDCA is affiliated to the Deaf International Cricket Council (DICC) headquartered in Pakistan and the National Federation of Sports for the Disabled in Sri Lanka.
The runner-up Sri Lankan deaf cricket team comprised Tharaka Sampath Jayasinghe (Captain), Lakshan Fernando (V. Captain), Sumudu Lanka, Tharindra Deepika Wimalaweera, Goyum Shanaka Walgama (Wicketkeeper), Nalin Sameera, Asanka Manjula, Udaya Lakmal, Priyankara Madushanka, Kumarasamy Thirukumaran, Alenross Kalep, N P G Ushan Lakshitha, G A Nuwan Hasaranga, A P Dinuka Sachin, Anton Jayasegaram, Antony Norman.

## Title: The birth of Hong Kong Rugby Sevens

The birth of Hong Kong Rugby Sevens
The 2017 Cathay Pacific/HSBC Hong Kong Sevens, organized by the Hong Kong Rugby Union (HKRU) marks the 42nd year of Sevens in Hong Kong. The tournament spans for over three days beginning on a Friday April 7 and concluding on Sunday 9.
The organizers are expecting 120,000 visitors to attend the event. This world-famous sevens is the largest confirming the tournament.
Hong Kong Sevens was originally the idea of the Marketing and Promotions Manager of Rothman's Export for a Pan Asia 15s Rugby tournament. Rodney Bentham-Wood wanted Rothmans to sponsor a Pan Asia Rugby Tournament. Leah May was considering the Carlsberg as the main sponsor. However, after a discussion between him and the chairman of the HKRFU, South African entrepreneur, A.D.C. "Tokkie" Smith, it was decided that a Sevens tournament would be cheaper and simpler to set up. The idea was then implemented by Duncan McTavish (HKRFC then captain), Trevor J. Bedford OBE (Chairman of Hong Kong Land, Jardine Matheson Limited, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and Director of HSBC) and Ian Gow, the Rothmans' Tobacco company executive for Hong Kong. After an initial proposal was refused by the Rugby Football Union in England, the HKRFU changed its focus and sent out invitations to Asian and Pacific sides.
On 28 March 1976, clubs from Indonesia, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Japan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Fiji participated in the first Hong Kong Sevens tournament at the Hong Kong Football Club in Happy Valley sponsored by Rothmans Tobacco and Cathay Pacific. This was an important step as this was one of the first rugby tournaments that attracted commercial sponsorship.
Of the countries represented in the inaugural sevens tournament, only Australia and New Zealand did not send national sides, instead being represented by the Wallatars and the Cantabrians respectively. These two clubs met in the final where the Cantabrians won 24-8.
The series thereafter grew into a huge competition with national representative sevens sides competing, and with this the growth of the tournament moved to the Hong Kong Stadium in 1982. The Hong Kong Sevens were ahead of their time, and an influential force in the modernization of rugby union, for example, the Hong Kong Sevens was one of the first rugby union tournaments to attract major sponsorship, when the Airlines Cathay Pacific sponsored the 1976 tournament. They also provided a level of cosmopolitan international competition, which tended not to exist in rugby before the first Rugby World Cup in 1987, especially since Hong Kong was not seen as one of the "Big Eight", and other than some involvement with France, the Commonwealth teams tended to be notoriously clannish. By 1986, the Hong Kong Sevens were held up as a positive example to others. The defending cup champions are Fiji, Plate England, Bowl Argentina and Shield Russia.
The participating teams for this year
Pool A - England, Australia, Samoa, South Korea, Pool B - South Africa, Canada, Kenya, France. Pool C - Fiji, New Zealand, Wales, Japan. Pool D - USA, Argentina, Scotland, Russia. Pool E - Germany, Tonga, Uganda, Jamaica. Pool F - Hong Kong, Chile, Sri Lanka, Namibia. Pool G - Spain, Papua New Guinea, Uruguay, Guyana
Women's - Pool A - Japan, China, Netherlands, Jamaica, Pool B - Argentina, Kenya, Hong Kong, Belgium, Pool C - South Africa, Colombia, Papua New Guinea, and Italy.

A. C. M Lafir a cricketing legend
Last Week's St. Anthony's - Trinity Centenary Cricket celebration had one distinguishing feature. It was about a record set by Antonian A.C.M Lair in making 1086 runs in the 1954 inter-school season and breaking Jack Anderson's record that has stood the test of time. His batting feat in making big runs stands like a monument towering over the picturesque hills of Kandy. Unconqured.
ABDUL CADER MOHAMED LAFIR commanded great respect as he strode the cricket fields. With willow in his hands runs flowed in avalanche style in school, club and at national level and not international level because his heroics were in the pre Test playing era.
LAFIR was born before the pre Test era, where many other champions were born like Mahadevan Sathasivam, C.I. Gunesekera, Sargo Jayawickrema, Mahes Rodrigo, Bertie Wijesinha, Vernon Prins, Stanley Jayasinghe, Michael Tissera and Dr. H.I.K. Fernando to mention names that come to mind. It is said that the country should been made a full member of the then Imperial Cricket Council in 1948 when the country had magicians with the willow and the ball. What we lacked was the infrastructure and the political and will to make a bid for inclusion.
Born in 1935 Lafir grew up as a talented cricketer destined to rewrite the school crickets record books and later that of the country. Opening his career as a 14 year old for St. Anthonys College, Kandy which he had the fortune of captaining the school in its centenary year. He had extraordinary talent, spotted by that great mentor and coach who had no equal in that era --JOHN HALLANGODA who is still spoken in awe by Lafir.
Hallangoda's immaculate coaching
Lafir says Hallangodas immaculate coaching is still vivid in his memory and still reveres him. It was Halangoda, a Trinitian himself, who made Anthonian Lafir one if not the best of opening batsmen of the country in that era  the 1950s and 1960s. He is also grateful to former Peterite Maurice Perera who coached him in latter years.
Born with a simple demeanor, which he still carries, he was a fierce competitor. Like a gladiator with bat in hand as he led by example the 11 men he took to the field against all opponents. He played for SACK as a 14 year old from 1950 to 1955 for 5 years and captained in 1954 and 1955. He was a captain who would not ask or give any quarter.
He was a strict disciplinarian and led by example. His team mates would rally round him and the bottom line that mattered to him was winning, not at any cost but by playing in the spirit of the gentleman's game and according to the rules. It was unlike today where winning is not the thing but the only thing.
Lafir was tall and nicely built. He was the envy of all schoolboy batsmen of his time. It is said that school coaches and the bowlers would over work their brains finding strategies to get Lafir out early, because to let him ride was to do a lot of leather chasing. Lafir in 1954 scored 1000 runs that season.
Broke Jack Anderson's record
It was a record considering that unlike today when school batsmen score 1000 runs playing about 20 games, during Lafirs time the maximum number of matches played were 7 or 8. In making 1086 runs in 1954 at an average of 108.6 he broke the record of that illustrious Antonian batsman, the great Jack Anderson.
In the match against Ananda he made a 100 in just 60 minutes. In that record breaking season he scored 4 centuries with the 176 in the big match against Trinity being the highest. His opening stand of 276 with Ronnie Stevens in the 1954 big match against Trinity still stands the test of time.
As a right hander Lafir was an elegant batsman. He was quick of eye and packed a wide repertoire of strokes with the off drive being eye catching and exquisite. His footwork was a lesson and strokes blessed with rare timing. His defence was impregnable.
After a dream inter-school cricket career, Lafir donned pads in big time cricket, the Sara trophy and in his first year playing for Kandy United against Saracens he made a double hundred (206 not out) and would have broken the highest score in Sara; cricket that was to the credit of former Josephian and Moors cricketer Makin Salih which stood at 237 if not for captain Hugh Fernando declaring the innings.
Moon among the stars
That was the memorable knock that launched his career to stardom to shine like the moon among the stars. But Lafir was determined to break that record and had the opportunity of doing so against the University in a final round Sara trophy clash making 276 not out for Nomads which University team team was led by that wonderful all round cricketer H.S. Mevan Pieris who was then known as the king of swing.
I remember Lafir's feat when in that game when he made 9 runs off a single delivery. He was attempting the 5th run. The over throw took the ball to the boundary line and the fielder he alleges kicked the ball purposely to the fence. Umpire Allan Felsinger awarded an additional four runs as a penalty.
Lafir says his best inning in the big league was the 186 he scored against SSC which team had cricketers of the calibre of F.C.de Saram, Bertie Wijesinha, C.I. and Channa Gunesekera, Stanley de Alwis, Lasantha Rodrigo, Neil Chanmugam, and Ben Navaratna.
Lafir had the distinction of representing the country against Englands Len Huttons team as a schoolboy and made a gutty 26 facing the bowling of Frank 'Typhoon Tyson, Brian Statham and spinner Tony Lock. Playing for Ceylon against Polly Umrigas Indians he made 55 facing the wiles of two of Indias best tweakers Gulam Ahmed and Subash Gupte. In the Gopalan Trophy series he has two centuries to his credit.
Holds no grudges
He says he could have played for the country for 10 more years had it not been for some selectors of that era who penalized him for no faults of his. But being an Amighty Allah fearing man that he is Lafir holds no grudges against them. One incident that should be mentioned was when he was bating against England with a very senior player.
The senior player would hit the ball and scamper two runs, but when Lafir hit the ball to an open space he would respond by running only a single. Lafir decided to respond and when there were two runs he ran only one. When the senior batsman questioned him, Lafir unafraid said he was returning the compliment. Ken Barrington the England stone waller who heard the conversation, sided with Lafir.
Lafirs other batting records will require reams to mention. He probably holds the record for the most centuries, half centuries scored in local cricket. I had the opportunity of capturing Lafirs prized wicket when I playing for BRC and he for Saracens. I forced him to lunge forward to a viciously turning leg break that took the edge of his bat before he settled in and went to slip where former Carey College and C.W.Mackie left arm spinner Noel Lutersz, now domiciled in Australia , gulped the catch. I still treasure that wicket and Lafir still reminds me of how I dismissed him whenever we meet.
Lafir was always equal to the task before him. In his own words he would face great bowlers fearlessly and they in turn accorded him much respect. He recalls FAST BOWLERS like Sonny Yatawara, T.B. Kehelgamuwa, Mevan Pieris, Dooland Buultjens. SPINNERS -Gamini Goonasena, Abu Fuad, Neil Chanmugam, Daya Sahabandu, Anura Polonowita, D.S. de Silva, B.W.R. Thomas and Elmo Rodrigopulle. FOREIGN BOWLERS  Frank Tyson, Brian Statham, Allan Davidson. SPINNERS  Subash Gupte, Ghulam Ahmed, V.V. Kumar, Tony Lock, David Allan and Richie Benaud whom he terms as the greatest spinners in world cricket in that era.
ACM Lafir, in his happy and content retirement will always be remembered as one of the excellent crickets of all time in Sri Lanka. No surprise that the "L" in his name stands for LEGEND.

Cabinet nod for Concession agreement on Htota port with China
Cabinet approval has been granted for Sri Lanka to enter into a Concession agreement on the Port of Hambantota with China. Its implementation is to be supervised by a Cabinet Sub-Committee chaired by Minister of Special Assignments Dr Sarath Amunugama.
The ministers; Malik Samarawickrama, Arjuna Ranatunga, Susil Premajayantha, Champika Ranawaka, Mahinda Amaraweera and Sagala Ratnayake are included in the sub-committee. The final draft of the agreement which was submitted to Cabinet this week received the go-ahead but Deputy Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Sujeewa Senasinghe said they had not agreed on a date to ink the agreement,
We will go ahead with an understanding and China will start construction on the third phase. The Chinese understand our political situation, he said addressing the weekly cabinet briefing at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
The agreement which received the stamp of approval from the Attorney General, aims at preparing future plans, financial provision, operational promotion and development of infrastructure including completed phase I and II and proposed phase III.
The Port which will be handled through a joint venture between the Government of Sri Lanka run Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the China Merchant Port Holdings Company Limited, will have 20 percent stake being given to the SLPA while 80 percent at the cost of USD 1.12 billion go to the Chinese.
The agreement will also allow Sri Lanka to buy back a further 20 percent stake after 10 years of operation, taking Sri Lankas total stake in the venture to 40, explained Senasinghe.
He added that the full cost of the third phase would be borne by the Chinese.
Sri Lanka at present is also in debt to China for Rs 230 billion at a seven percent interest rate for the first and second phases of the project. The tenure of the joint venture, according to the deputy minister is for 99 years and along with the Port, the Chinese would also be getting 1235 acres adjoining the port as part of the deal.
The President has decided that this should happen and that this was the best way to go about it to come to a speedy conclusion. The cabinet subcommittee will look at the most advantageous agreement to Sri Lanka, said Senasinghe.
The Hambantota Port agreement has been highly controversial with the employees of the port as well as other organizations protesting against divesting a large proportion of it to China. The government in the meantime has pointed out that given the mountain of debt it has to deal with, it has no choice but to sell a majority stake to China to recover from the Chinese loans.

No regulatory bodies for Ayurvedic doctors and other healers
The GMOA, student movements, politicians, trade unions, interested individuals and groups are currently hitting the headlines with their hysterics and the mass media are also obsessed with reporting SAITMs inability to meet the requirements (still not gazetted) of the regulatory body for Allopathic medicine sector, namely Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Their demonstrations on the public roads have created mayhem paralysing the countrys economic activity and demoralizing the poor, helpless patients. Their actions have wasted large amounts of valuable foreign-exchange spent on tear-gas cans, water cannons and the precious time of the police and the public.
The public are well aware that the quality of the service rendered by the healing sector (or the industry!) which looks after the lives and well being of the people cannot be compromised. The moot question is, where are the regulatory bodies for healing sectors such as Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Acupuncture and the plethora of quacks comprising Gamey Wedahs, Kattadiyas, miracle healers- religious and otherwise, who even advertise their healing powers using the mass media What action have these egoistic groups taken to safeguard the lives of the public from the aforesaid healers
In this context, it is evident that the SAITM issue has been blown out of proportion by the aforesaid groups to achieve their ulterior motives.
Any sane person should understand that this whole issue involves a Sri Lankan investor and a group of local, enterprising young students who have braved several obstacles to serve the nation by succeeding in medical profession. Therefore, they should be encouraged to sort out the drawbacks or shortcomings rather than engaging in disruptive, militant activities to prevent a feasible solution benefitting the country and its people.

After several appeals made to the government by the hoteliers in the area the coast conservation authority launched a mammoth project to recall the beach and today its in its original position for which the hotel sector is thankful.
However with the monsoon season coming next month there is a threat that the beach would be once again washed away since there is no breakwater. If the breakwater is not built immediately the beach would be washed again and millions of rupees would go down the drain, said General Manager, Gamini Keerthisinghe.
He said that with the re introduction of the beach the hotel has once again re launched their beach activities.
We now offer beach weddings for foreigners and also dining under the stars and moon in the beach. We offer daily buffet and due to this the hotel is now becoming a much sought after destination for local for corporate outing and also a place as a transit point when travelling to Wilpattu. The hotel is also planning to build second swimming pool mainly to cater to daily outing and the large local groups that patronize the hotel.

Customer decision  making criteria and  the importance of  Price-Stax perspectives
Understanding customer decision making is crucial to profitable growth, and particularly so in driving product development or sales and marketing investment decisions.
Overview and Objectives
Many organizations spend significant resources to identify customer needs precisely and early to stay ahead of competition.
Traditionally, the customer decision making process has revolved around price, product quality and customer service. With advancements in technology, attributes of products and services have changed and have led to changes in the decision-making process as well.
Over the last 20 years at Stax, we've conducted hundreds of customer studies, gathering tens of thousands of data points. This gives us a tremendous amount of experience and data with which to understand customer decisions, not only for a given engagement, but across many engagements.
We use this data to develop insights to inform our current work and to better understand decision making. In addition, it provides us with a significant and constantly growing foundation of data with which to benchmark findings in our current work.
To that end, Stax sought to review the relative importance of price, using data gathered through multiple engagements over the past couple of years. We incorporated responses around price, quality and other attributes from over 40,000 survey respondents. We explored how the influence of price changes based on two categories of decision makers across select industries: consumer and corporate end user. Finally, we looked at what new product attributes influenced consumer decisions.
As Expected Price is the Primary Influencer of Purchasing Decisions
Overall, price/cost of ownership remains the most influential decision driver, with nearly half of the respondents considering it as one of the top three factors for selecting a product or service. Of those, 18% selected price most important factor.
End Consumer Decisions are Driven by Price and Quality of Products
When examining decision maker motivation, purchasing decisions of consumers revolved around optimizing price, quality and durability. Price remains the main decision driver with 50% of consumers acknowledging it as one of their top three considerations. Factors such as comfort, fit, convenience and customer service act as secondary drivers.
Closer examination of categories reveals that with Financial Services, Food and Beverages (F&B), Information Technology (IT) and Consumer Products (like gifts, toys, mattress, etc), purchaser decision making is price sensitive, whereas in the Healthcare and Apparel verticals it seems to be less sensitive.
For F&B, quality of food was an important decider, along with price. For Financial Services consumers also placed a great deal of emphasis on financial performance, brand reputation and customer services of the service provider. With IT purchases additional drivers were quality, ease of use, brand reputation and product performance.
The same goes for Consumer Products such as sanitary ware, cosmetics and furniture, with co-determiners of quality and durability, while convenience of purchase is a secondary factor. In this segment, more than 50% of consumers included price in their top three considerations, with 22% of them choosing it as their main selection criteria.
Price is less influential in decision making with regards to Apparels, as consumers tend to focus primarily on fit, comfort and quality. With Healthcare, decision making is mostly based on the insurance coverage and in-network status, which generates substantial reductions in costs. In addition, customers are also value convenience and physician credentials. Thus, the actual pricing will have a lower influence in decision making.
Corporate End User Decisions are Equally Driven by Price and Impact on Business Continuity
Even though price remains the top decision driver amongst corporate end users, they tend to place lower emphasis on price compared to consumers, as less than 40% consider it to be part of their top three considerations. Corporate end users prioritize factors that would ensure limited or no disruption of operations during the implementation to minimize opportunity costs.
Therefore, factors such as ease of use, reliability and ease of implementation are ranked higher while product quality has a comparatively lower importance.
Corporate end users in IT prioritize the ease of use along with price.
Development and competitiveness in the IT solutions sector has resulted in new companies using attractive pricing models that allow them to reduce large upfront costs. In addition, cost of down time due to implementation has bigger financial implications on most organizations compared to actual price of the solution. Thus, corporate decision makers tend to emphasize solutions that allow for easier implementation, training and use.
Like consumers, business users of Healthcare services focus on insurance coverage and the quality of service more compared to pricing. The decisions in healthcare IT sector depend on ease of use and integration capabilities, in order to ensure business continuity.
Concluding Remarks
Clearly, price remains the most important decision driver across segments and industry verticals. However, customer selection criteria are more nuanced and there are more secondary factors that can be developed for success in the market.
Methodology
Stax analysis is based on data from 40,000 respondents, which includes 30,000 consumers and 10,000 corporate end users from U. S. Industries covered include IT, Consumer Products, Healthcare, Apparel, and Financial Services. We extracted data from questions that requires respondents to rank top three factors considered when selecting a product or service. A typical question would be Which of these factors are the most important in your selection of a product.

Roshan Madawela, CEO and Director from RIU opened the event giving an overview of the Sri Lankan economy which was backed-up by extensive research and evidence provided in a Power Point presentation.
Ajit Wijesinghe, Director of Indola Group, the Developers for the DusitThani project addressed the audience of 80 plus people, mentioning how he was inspired to start this project and the benefits it gives for investors.
Declan McNaughton, CEO of Indola Group drilled down into the project details further, presenting why this new concept of investment apartments in Sri Lanka is such a good opportunity.
Many Sri Lankan expatriates liked the idea of investing in their Mother Country and especially in a luxury brand, 5-star project that gives them a Freehold Title.
The opportunity to own a beachfront apartment, whilst earning a guaranteed 6% nett per annum that is paid in US$ seemed an opportunity not to be missed. Added to that, the fact that the apartment Owners can enjoy 21 days free stay per annum, appealed to all as they could use it during the time to visit family back home.
With the unique investment opportunity DusitThani Sri Lanka provides, we have come across a large amount of interest from foreign buyers giving them the best investment option. The Beachfront takes Sri Lanka's luxury five-star living," said Ajit Wijesinghe.
DusitThani Sri Lanka is the one and only, luxury, high-rise beachfront apartments located on the West Coast of Sri Lanka that foreigners can legally buy.
It is a perfect combination of opportunity, location, luxury and return on investment.
The Beachfront is located on 500 meters of absolute pristine beachfront and every apartment will feature a large private balcony, five-star designer interiors and stunning, uninterrupted ocean views. Apartments are priced from US$244,000.
There are three Stages of construction and Stage one has just started and will be completed by the first quarter of 2019.
Tower B of Stage 1 has already sold and sales for Tower A are flourishing. Stage two will consist of 15 international restaurants, cafes, bars, luxury spa, sauna and gymnasium and Stage three will be another two Towers of investment apartments. The Directors and staff of Indola have been very active promoting their project to interested investors in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Russia.

117th Battle of the Blues, St. Servatius vs St. Thomas' Matara:
An exciting finish is expected if spectators and the weather dont hamper the 117th big match between St Servatius College and St Thomas College which will be played at the Uyanwatta stadium from the 24th to the 26th of March.
It is most likely that a decision would be reached as in most probability the wicket would favour the batsmen at the early stages of the three day encounter, but it is certain that the spinners would have their say at the final stages of the game.
St. Servatius who play in the elite division one of the schools cricket tournament did not perform up to expectation this season to end in sixth place in their group with 85.64 points with a solitary win over Mari Stella College, Negombo while St. Thomas who play in division II of the schools tournament topped their group with 107.360 points with four outright wins over St Johns College - Jaffna, Debarawewa National School, Vidyartha College - Kandy and Carey College to boast about. The Thomians are just one win away from qualifying to join St Servatius in the elite division one schools cricket tournament next season.
Of the 16 games the Servatians played they have won three games while the Thomians have won nine of the 17 outings this season.
The Servatians are led by second year coloursman Isuru Udayanga who has Sandaru Nethmina as his deputy. The team is strengthened by Sri Lanka under 19 cap Thilan Prashan while the final XI will be selected from Shasika Dulshan, Pushpitha Dilshan, Dineth Nethsara, Dilshan Maduranga, Ruvinda Rochana, Keshara Nuwantha, Supun Kavinda, Muditha hashan, Pasindu Manupriya, Chalana Anuradha,  Kaavindu Dulakshitha, Imanka Madushan, Hirun Anjana, Dilakshana Kavinda, Shanaka Didulantha, Nethum Sahasra, Navin Sahith, Dinura Dilmin and Ashen Dinuththara.
The Servatians are coached by Priyantha Abeysekera who is assisted by Rasika Lakshantha. While Nayanananda de Silva is the master in charge of the team.
Wicket keeper and opening batsman Nipun Achalanka leads the Thomian XI to the 117th Battle of the Blues. He has Hashin Dilman as his deputy. The final XI will be selected from Praveen Madushan, Akila Thiwanka, Hasitha Suneth, Ishan Jayawardena, Hirantha Lakshan, Mihisal Amoda, Lahiru Gimhan, Lahiru Dilshan, Raminda Pravinath, Maleesha de Seram, Sandun Chaminda, Kavindu Ridmal, Gisanthika Jayaweera, Avindu Nimantha, Nimanthaka Bhashana, Shanjaya Maduranga, Sanchitha Gimhan, J P Harindu, Hirusha Jeewadith, Voshitha Amarasinghe, Sineth Dissanayaka, Sac hira Rashmika and Nipun Ruchira.
The Thomian team is coached by Charith Palliyage with the assistance of Dumindu Hewapathirana and Dinusha Jayashanaka. W M A D Lakmal is in charge of the Thomians this season.
Thilan Prashans pace and accuracy would be the Servatians trump card while the Thomians can boast of left hand batsman Raminda Pravinath who has two double centuries against his name this season and passed the 1000 run mark. Right arm off spinner Hashin Dilman and left arm spinner Pravin Madushan who have captured over 80 wickets each are capable in turning the game in favour of the Thomians.
The big match in Matara is the third oldest in the island and is said to have been played continuously since 1900. It is also been known as the Battle of Ruhuna and Battle of Nilwala. St Thomas have a five match lead in the series with 32 wins with Tharaka Dushantha leading them to victory in 2007 while the Servatians have won 27 games and have been winless for the past 46 years since Nimal Munaweera led them to victory in 1971.

Exclusion, inequality lead to uneven development across Asia and Pacific
Disparate progress in South and East Asia and the Pacific due to discrimination towards women, ethnic minorities and populations in remote areas, says UNDP Report.
Exclusion of women, ethnic minorities, and people living in remote areas create chronic barriers that have stymied human development progress and led to significant disparities within the Asia and the Pacific region, leaving many behind.
A stronger focus on those excluded groups, and on actions to dismantle these barriers is urgently needed to ensure sustainable human development for all.
These are among the key findings of the Human Development Report 2016 entitled Human Development for Everyone, released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The report finds that although on average human development improved significantly across all regions from 1990 to 2015, worldwide almost 1.5 billion people live in multidimensional poverty - reflecting acute deprivations in health, education and standards of living.
The world has come a long way in rolling back extreme poverty, in improving access to education, health and sanitation, and in expanding possibilities for women and girls, said UNDP Administrator Helen Clark, speaking at the launch of the Report in Stockholm today alongside Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lfven and the report's lead author and Director of the Human Development Report Office, Selim Jahan.
But those gains are a prelude to the next, possibly tougher challenge, to ensure the benefits of global progress reach everyone, Helen Clark said.
The report makes clear that progress in the Asia and Pacific region has not benefited everyone. Despite a steep drop in poverty between 1990 and 2013 - in East Asia, the proportion of people living on less than $1.90 a day fell from 60 percent to under 4 percent, and in South Asia from 45 percent to 15 percent - some 54 percent of the world's multidimensional poor live in South Asia, as measured by the Multidimensional Poverty Index.
South Asia also has the highest levels of malnutrition in the world at 38 percent (measured by the prevalence of severe or moderate stunting in children under five years), and the lowest public health expenditure globally as a share of GDP, at 1.6 percent (2014). This report uncovers a deeper story behind the statistics, said Haoliang Xu, Director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific. Even in a region that has made such remarkable progress, pockets of exclusion continue to prevent millions of people from fulfilling their true potential.
The report shows that the disparities disproportionally impact certain groups. Women, ethnic minorities and people living in remote areas can suffer deprivations both overt and hidden.
We place too much attention on national averages, which often mask enormous variations in people's lives. stated Selim Jahan. In order to advance we need to examine more closely not just what has been achieved, but who has been excluded and why
Asia-Pacific has the largest gender gap of all developing regions.
The report shows that gender-based inequalities linked to patriarchal social norms afflict women over their entire lives. Such disparities manifest in myriad ways: higher malnourishment, morbidity and mortality for women; starkly imbalanced sex ratios due to sex discrimination; lower labour force participation rates for women, but higher workloads and less rest; less access to financial decision making; and the pervasive risk of violence against women.
Between their first and fifth birthdays girls in India and Pakistan have a 30 to 50 percent greater chance of dying than boys. Women consistently have, on average, a lower HDI value than do men across the world, but the largest difference is in South Asia, where the female HDI value is 20 percent lower than the male value. Indeed, according to the report, the Asia-Pacific region is the second most gender unequal of all developing regions, after the Arab States region. In South Asia, gender gaps in women's entrepreneurship and labour force participation account for an estimated income loss of 19 percent. Minority groups, whether by ethnicity, language or religion, continue to face barriers to social, economic and political participation. For example, the report shows that in Vietnam some 85 percent of children ages 12-23 months from the Kinh-Hoa majority were fully immunized in 2014, compared with only 69 percent of ethnic minority children.
Evidence from Nepal in 2011 shows similar patterns of disadvantages among ethnic minorities, with wide variations in HDI values across population groups, albeit with trends towards less inequality. The Newar people have the highest HDI value (0.565), followed by the Brahman-Chhetris (0.538), Janajatis (0.482), Dalits (0.434) and Muslims (0.422). The variations in HDI values are significant within these groups, depending on location. The highest inequalities are in education, which impact capabilities over the lifespan.
Geographic remoteness and location also pose barriers for those who live there. The report cites the Pacific islands, where youth unemployment is estimated at 23 percent - but reaches 63 percent in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, 54 percent in Kiribati and 46 percent in the Solomon Islands. It is time to face up to deep-rooted barriers to development. By eliminating deep, persistent, discriminatory social norms and laws, and addressing the unequal access to political participation which have hindered progress for so many, poverty can be eradicated and a peaceful, just, and sustainable development can be achieved for all, Helen Clark said.
Marginalized groups often have limited opportunities to influence the institutions and policies that determine their lives. Changing this is central to breaking the vicious circle of exclusion and deprivation.
To this end, the report calls for far greater attention to empowering the most marginalized in society and recognizes the importance of giving them a greater voice in decision-making processes.
It also calls for a more refined analysis to inform actions including making a shift toward assessing progress in such areas as participation and autonomy. Key data, disaggregated for characteristics such as place, gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity is vital to identifying who is being left behind. The report stresses the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to build on past development gains noting that the agenda and human development approach are mutually reinforcing.

Forty five percent of countrys expenditure for road development
Forty-five percent from the capital expenditure of the country consists of expenditure incurred to develop the road system, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Speaking at a media briefing on the review of the pilot project to dedicate priority lanes for buses at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, he said: according to the pilot project, 22 percent of bus passengers, 43 percent of private vehicles and 37 percent of three-wheelers are in favour with extending the bus lane.
Priority lanes were dedicated to buses under the one-week pilot project from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction aimed at finding a solution to the traffic congestion in Colombo and to uplift the standards of public transportation.
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry implemented the project jointly with the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Police, Moratuwa University, Western Province Road Passenger Transport Authority and Colombo Municipal Council.
The pilot project review disclosed that the average speed of all vehicles at peak time (7.30 a.m.  8.30 a.m.) had marked above 20 kmph. It is internationally accepted as a favourable condition to a country with traffic congestion issues, he added.
The minister said: the priority bus lane system will be implemented during the next three months in identified areas. An efficient passenger bus transportation system will also be implemented within a period of one year. Also, a suggestion will be made to the Cabinet to allocate funds to uplift the public transportation system.
He said priority bus lanes would be implemented to reduce the negative impacts caused to pedestrians and three-wheelers.
Minister Ranawaka said the implementation of an efficient urban development plan and uplifting standards of the public transportation system should be given priority over the construction of highways.
The main focus is reducing issues related to traffic congestion by means of increasing road discipline, he added.
Transportation hubs in Battaramulla and Colombo and sub-transportation centres in Panadura, Moratuwa, Piliyandala, Kottawa, and Kadawatha will be implemented. Makumbura Kottawa transportation centre will be opened within this year. The private sector will be encouraged to invest in these projects, the minister said.
He said a light weight railway system would be implemented from Battaramulla to Fort with financial aid from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Megapolis and Western Development State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Road Development Authority Transportation Specialist Prof. Samantha Widanapathirana also participated.

Deputy Minister of Power and Energy, Ajith P Perera yesterday said a good lawyer rather than a hunger strike would expedite MP Wimal Weerawansas release from prison.
We believe that our courts are independent and only through the legal system, can they receive bail, said Perera addressing the weekly cabinet briefing held at Parliament yesterday. MP Wimal Weerawansa, it is learnt had commenced a hunger strike yesterday in protest not being granted bail by courts on Tuesday.
Weerawansas current lawyer is none other than MP Namal Rajapakse. The MP was arrested on January 10 , for the alleged misuse of government vehicles.
Weerawansa was not arrested for fighting on behalf of his country, this was misuse of public property. As a lawyer, I see no point in this fast. No one has been granted bail because of it, they have to seek redress through legal means,Perera further explained.

Greek Bond purchase decided at an unofficial meeting: No prior notice to Monitory Board
The decision on the controversial Greek Bond purchase in 2011 came from an unofficial meeting held between some officials of the Central Bank, the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday observed. Subsequently, the decision to purchase the Greek Bonds was approved by then Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraal, it was also noted.
The 30 million dollar Euro Greek bonds were then purchased with no prior notice to the Monetary Board, the Commission observed as well.
According to the Auditor General, the transaction has resulted in 15.6 million dollars loss, the Commission was informed. The questioned Greek Bond purchase caught the attention of the Commission when the legal representative Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando was leading evidence. He questioned the present Secretary to the Monetary Board H.A.Karunaratne whether he was involved in the Greek bonds transaction in April, 2011. On a request by the Commission to describe the said informal meeting, Karunaratne said it was a particular gathering that took the decision. The Governor had the power to amend or adjust the decisions that were taken at the meeting. To much amusement of those present at the Commission , Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane told Karunaratne, the ;last time I heard of a gathering ,it was the elephants in Minneriya. So what is this gathering you are talking about
Karunaratne replied it was a casual meeting and that he would like to withdraw the word gathering. He also said the group included Deputy Governor Weerasinghe, Siriwardane, Ananda Silva and himself were among this so called gathering or group. Asked if this said meeting or discussion was official, Karunaratne said as a matter of fact it was not.
Justice Jayawardane then questioned Karunaratne whether he is suggesting to the Commission that a gathering took a decision to purchase Greek Bonds with the approval of Governor Cabraal, and it was only after the purchase of them in April,2011 the Monetary Board was notified . Justice P. Jayawardane also said even though Greek Bond issue is not within the mandate of the Commission, the questions were asked for everybodys general interest as citizens.

Heavy fine, prison sentence for abandoning dogs at public places
Amendments to the Registration of Dogs Ordinance No 25 of 1901 will soon prohibit people from abandoning their dogs at public places. Those who do so will be fined a sum not exceeding Rs 25,000, imprisoned for a period not extending two years or both.
Cabinet this week approved the above proposal put forward by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha in order to control the stray dog population and spread of rabies in several areas around the country.
He had pointed out that Local Government Authorities would be more effective in controlling the stray dog population if they had the legal authority to take action against those who abandon dogs on the street. The above amendment would grant them such powers.
Cabinet had earlier granted approval to repeal both Registration of Dogs Ordinance and Rabies Ordinance and draft new legislation to replace them, but the consultation process which has been going on for some time has not been finalised yet.
In 2006, the government passed a No kill policy and thus stray dogs are only allowed to be sterilised.

Around 900 students have been subjected to this financial scam. According to information provided by parents, the company is sending funds to Russia in an informal method.
Dr. Zoysa said the fraud at SAITM is only second to the recent `Bond Scam' of the Central Bank. Relevant documents will be presented during a Police investigation. The company was investigated some time back in connection with harbouring the bones of sportsman Wasim Thajudeen, he said.
Police commenced an investigation on the `shooting drama' staged by the SAITM CEO. Culprits are still to be brought before the law, Dr. Zoysa said.

Lankas poor fielding: is it due to surplus of wicket-keepers
Is Sri Lankas key fielding problem due to the surplus of wicket-keepers in the team
This was a moot point that was raised the Daily News reliably learns at a meeting of the Sri Lanka hierarchy with the national team cricketers and key support staff that took place on Tuesday night at the end of the two-Test series against Bangladesh.
The series was drawn one-all with Bangladesh securing their maiden Test win over Sri Lanka in 18 Tests at the P Sara Oval, venue of the second Test. Sri Lanka had taken an early lead in the short series by winning the first Test played at Galle.
Tuesdays meeting was nothing new, but the normal practice after each series where the top brass met with the national team and reviewed the series, said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva. We usually have these meetings at the end of every series.
One startling revelation that came to light was that Sri Lanka had so many wicket-keeper batsmen in their team and this could be one of the reasons for the poor fielding standards that we are experiencing today.
In the past two years the Sri Lanka team has comprised of cricketers who are also wicket-keepers namely  vice captain Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Perera, Kaushal Silva, Sandun Weerakkody and Chamara Kapugedera in all three formats of the game.
Naturally the selectors pick these players purely for their batting but there is a minus factor to it because they are not natural fielders. Having begun their careers at school as wicket-keepers and some of them having to keep on switching from wicket-keeper to a normal fielding position like for example in the case of Chandimal, surely the fielding standards have got to drop. Sri Lanka could easily be the national team in contemporary cricket with the largest number of wicket-keeper batsmen in their playing eleven.
When Sri Lanka won the cricket World Cup in 1996 they had three wicket-keeper/batsmen in their 14 namely Romesh Kaluwitharana, Hashan Tillakaratne and Asanka Gurusinha, but the standard of fielding was so high that they compensated for whatever shortcomings there was in the bowling.
Wicket-keeping is a totally different specialists position and does not require so much of movements around the ground because the wicket-keepers job is to stand behind the wicket at each end whereas a fielder is expected to be able to play in any position he is asked to and also chase balls to the boundary line and back. He is expected to run and take high catches in the outfield as well as stand at close-in and snap up sharp catches that require sharp reflexes.
If one was to analyse and see why Sri Lanka was at the receiving end of Bangladesh in the second Test you can easily point it out to poor catching. Two of the offenders were Dinesh Chandimal fielding at deep square leg and Upul Tharanga at deep mid wicket  both wicket-keepers. Chandimals catch was a dolly one which should have been held nine times out of ten. But more than his catch it was the one that Tharanga missed off Shakib Al Hasan when he was on 11 that proved costly. Bangladesh then 210-5 would have easily been six down for that score, but the miss saw Shakib take the total to 421 before he was finally dismissed for 116. The first innings lead of 129 that Bangladesh gained proved decisive to them in the end.
How Sri Lanka can address this trend is left to be seen. The funny side of it is that they have hired a wicket-keeper/batsman from South Africa Nic Pothas to uplift the fielding standards when the surplus of wicket-keeper/batsmen in the national squad has been identified as one of the main reasons for the drop in fielding standards.
Pothas was at one time regarded as the best wicket-keeper in South Africa and he vied for a place in the national team with Mark Boucher who finally edged him out. Since then he has been playing county cricket for Hampshire and most recently been the academy director at Leicestershire County, and was the cricket director at Guernsey in the past.

Let life begin
Part 1 of this text was carried in Daily News of March 14 and here, it, predominantly is further intended, to continue the insight-oriented and discernment-directed analysis of the NGO global use and the abuse of indigenous law and international bilateral and unilateral conventions, in order to confuse the clarity and blemish the purity of the minds and justify the virtual criminality of forced abortion and birth-control.
Compromise on every point is the foundation of misery. Those who compromise will not be able to forgive themselves. There, where one could have dared, compromises and compromising proves him to be a coward. In the cowardice, one falls before his own eyes and further loses the self-respect as well. Hence, the compromise with the forced abortion and birth control would not help Sri Lankans to have a better fate than disgraceful cowardice, falling before ones own eyes and total loss of self-respect.
The truth is, there is a sense of urgency. Of what Of conscious awareness. Once again, of what Of the threat and the danger of the destruction, cessation and disappearance of a community in the years to come, in a slow, non-discernible and clandestine agenda of the vested interest. Some would certainly oppose this as an impractical and racist statement.
Nonetheless, real racists are those, who conspire to democratically and peacefully end an innocent and existential nation, through the virtual criminality of forced birth control and abortion. The more so it would be, when the abortion and birth-control-compulsion-criminality is brutalized against all fertile women and men of a nation, for whom, no such requirement, as a medical measure, has been prescribed by doctors and no physical and/or death threat has been dashed against the life of the woman. This situation denotes only one destination  vested interest, conspiracy, deception, taking for a ride and causation of cessation of a nation in to total democratic and seeming-to-be non-violent disappearance.
Muslim example
With all the lamentational polemics of womens rights violations and cries of human rights transgression, being yelled by NGOs, the Muslim community, with their patriotic women of absolute majesty, have firmly shown the world that there is a community, the members of which cannot be fooled in to the deception of the criminality of converting their innocent God-gifted wombs in to killing fields with oozing out blood of the conceived fetus.
The deceitful propaganda of mind obfuscation, greed-generating financial help and aids, the real-intension-masqueraded womens rights violation slogan and the rock-cracking palpable lie of the lifelessness of the conceived fetus, have been kicked off as their community-destroying threaty conspiracies of vested interest and the Muslim women, respecting and admiring their religion, the Islam and what is domestically ethical and also not embracing all what is exported from the West, continue to produce their children with courage, perseverance and pride. A vivid example to learn, understand and empirically observe.
Silence of chief incumbents
Whatever is yelled and lamented by NGOs of vested interest, the original name of Sri Lanka is Heladiva and the original community, whom the land belongs to, is Sinhala Buddhist, with the rights of other communities to co-exist with, with the beauty of peace, depth of understanding and the splendor of mutual help. Besides, Sri Lanka is the only country in the globe, wherein, the Buddhism has received the official and contitutionalized state patronage.
In such a situation, the number of Sinhala Buddhist heads, which determines the existential stability of the fate of Buddhism, is a central factor, the Buddhist clergy should be very much vigilant of, careful about and pay attention for. Yet, it is so unfortunate, no Buddhist monk of the higher order, including the Chief Incumbents of main denominations, appear to be resorting to any objection, protest or agitation, in regard to the forced abortion and birth control in Sri Lanka. Here, one may argue that such protest would be against the ethical principles of Buddhism and would end up not in renunciation, but in craving and grasping.
Now, what is the point of renouncing covetousness and grasp, if the Buddhism, as the religion of the original majority community disappears in to total extinction Indeed, the NGOs of vested interest would be pleased with the Buddhist priesthood, if they would plead silence, conducing the cessation of the Doctrine of the Buddha, by means of the diminution of the number of Buddhist heads. Therefore, the burning span of time has dawned for Buddhists priests and particularly, for the Chief Incumbents of the Order, to temporarily keep the attainment of Nirvana aside, march forward, unite the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities, members of the justice administration mechanism, Army, Police and compel the elected governing politicians to have recourse to drastic measures to chase away the NGOs, who violate the human rights of the men and women of Sri Lanka, by forced abortion and birth control. Now, lets come back to the original script orientation of the text  the loop holes of international and domestic law.
Right to life standards
Some Courts refute the proposition that international human rights conventions and declarations protect the right to life prior to birth, finding that such documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and many other international legal instruments do not provide any evidence to substantiate the notion that the embryo could be considered a person.
Hence, finally, in addressing the issue of when life begins, the Justice administrators reason that since there is no an agreed definition of when life begins, adopting one such definition would imply imposing specific types of beliefs on others who do not share them. In this approach of ignorance, it must be illustrated that what is significant is, not when life begins, but the actual fact that life begins.
If someone is not sure of the moment of life inception or believes that the human life begins not from the conceived embryo in the mothers womb, but, from a heap of bones bundled in a grave, then, to consider that the recognition of the rights of the life-potential fetus would be tantamount to the imposition of a belief type on others, who do not share them should not and cannot serve as a basis for not recognizing the rights of the fetus. The artificial, mind fabricated gap between the born human and the conceived fetus does not dispel the rights of the embryo to grow in to the state of fetus and the rights of the fetus to be transformed in a human-being.
A subjective opinion, held by a tiny group of individuals, self-declared to be luminaries of a legal community, cannot betray the objective reality, well beyond and above human conceptualization domain, however metaphysical it may seem to be. These people must not be allowed to threaten the very survival of humanity. Thus, the protection of the rights of the life potential fetus is a must.
If a cancer treatment to a pregnant woman could cause an abortion, finding that the State could not deny her life- and health-saving care, the doctors must provide the patient, the necessary medical treatment.
There is no frustrating issue at all. If the life of a woman, whose pregnancy placed her life in grave danger, which under the existing circumstances required termination of the pregnancy, the presence of the embryo can be caused to be ceased. No one would argue about the infraction of the embryo rights. In such extraordinary circumstances, no legal luminary would and cannot prioritize the health or well-being of the fetus over the pregnant womans rights. Indisputable indeed. No court would grant to a fetus, the recognition of an absolute right to its life before the birth, if it constitutes a threat to the mother.
Real problem
Now, the real problem of the NGO abortion and birth control contention is problemlessness and their ceaseless endeavours to engender a non-existential doctrinal chaos, in order to perpetuate the continuity of abortion and birth control, in relation to certain especially selected communities, while, certainly proclaiming the principle of the application of universality. Hence, it is high time for all the communities of Sri Lanka to gather together, generate an empirical awareness and pressurize the Good Governance Government to crush all and every nation-destroying attempts, structured with the criminality of forced abortion and birth control.

London attack: Five dead in Westminster terror attack

Five people have died and at least 40 were injured after an attacker drove a car along a pavement in Westminster, stabbed a policeman and was shot dead by police in the grounds of Parliament.
The dead officer has been named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a husband and father.
PM Theresa May said the attack was "sick and depraved" and struck at values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.
The attacker has not been named by police.
Acting Deputy Commissioner and head of counter terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, Mark Rowley, said they think they know who he is and that he was inspired by international and Islamist-related terrorism, but gave no further details.
The attack unfolded at about 14.40 GMT when a single attacker drove a car along a pavement over Westminster Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament in central London, killing at least two people and injuring many more.
The car then crashed into railings outside the Houses of Parliament.
The attacker, armed with a knife, ran to Parliament where he was confronted by the police. PC Palmer - who was not armed - was then stabbed and killed.
The attacker was shot dead by armed officers.
Rowley paid tribute to PC Palmer, saying: "He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift, and he had every right to expect that would happen."
"Heartbroken" former colleague, Conservative MP James Cleverly, paid tribute to the "lovely man" he had known for 25 years. The pair had served together in the Royal Artillery before PC Palmer became a policeman.
Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood - a former Army officer whose brother died in the Bali terrorist bombing in 2002 -attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of Pc Palmer.
May said the attack was a "sick and depraved" attack on the heart of the capital. Such attempts to defeat UK values were "doomed to failure", she said.
She paid tribute to the "exceptional men and women" of the police force who responded to the attack, saying: "We will all move forward together, never giving in to terror and never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart."
The prime minister added: "The location of this attack was no accident.
"The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of our capital city where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech."
She is expected to make a statement in the Commons later.
The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox said the "name I will remember" from the Westminster attack was that of PC Keith Palmer - not the attacker.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said: "My message to those that want to harm us and destroy our way of life is: You won't succeed; you won't divide us; we won't be cowed by terrorists."
BBC Newsnight reported there was a suggestion the car used in the attack was hired from an address in Birmingham. However, this has not been confirmed.
In latest developments:
There will be more armed and unarmed officers on duty in London and across the country as a "precautionary measure"
The prime minister said the UK terror threat level would remain at severe - its second highest - meaning an attack is "highly likely"
Westminster underground station was shut and remainedopen for interchange only.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd urged everyone to remain calm but be vigilant and if they see anything they are concerned about report it to the police
A group ofFrench schoolchildren were on the bridge and three were injured.
13 students from Edge Hill University in Lancashire were alsocaught up in the incident- two were taken to hospital and described as walking wounded; two others had minor injuries

Lubricant players concerned over increase in duty and taxes on synthetic lubricants
The recent steep rise in duty and tax imposed by the government on synthetic lubricants effective mid-November is causing alarm in the market, as lubricant suppliers are now starting to pass on the hike to the end users a statement issued by the Ceylon Motor Traders Association said.
The duty and taxes have been increased by 31 percent.
This has forced suppliers in the local lubricant market to increase prices accordingly and consumers are affected adversely as they have to pay substantially higher prices as a result.
Local franchise car agencies too are affected, as they are forced to pass on a substantial cost increase to the customer.
Unfortunately, this duty and tax hike will only result in discouraging the vehicle owners from using synthetic lubricants due to the high price. me development for the country as synthetic lubricants help vehicles to perform better, when compared with conventional oils, thereby saving exchange for the country and less emissions.
With vehicle manufacturers encouraging the use of synthetic lubricants for all types of vehicles, the move by the government will severely impact the vehicle owners.
Synthetic lubricants are proven to be more environmentally friendly, as emission levels are comparatively lower, draining intervals are higher and resultantly more mileage could be achieved.

Mastercard, Eko-Pay to  accelerate digitization of B2B Payments  with Eko-B2B
Recognizing the growing opportunity and need to help digitize business-to-business (B2B) transactions, Mastercard announced its partnership with Eko-Pay to introduce Eko-B2B, a new best-in-class digital payment solution for businesses in Asia Pacific.
Eko-B2B will provide businesses with an automated payment solution that enables them to streamline workflows and improve productivity for B2B payment transactions. Powered by Eko-Pay, a technology company with proprietary solutions for financial and non-financial transactions, Eko-B2B seamlessly integrates with the Mastercard inControl platform to facilitate business payments, reducing inefficiencies and improving transparency.
According to a study by global consulting firm McKinsey on commercial payment growth in Asia Pacific, 90 percent of B2B payments in the region are still conducted in cash, representing a significant opportunity to digitize the payment system. Expansion of customer and supplier networks across markets, growth of cross-border transactions and a large informal economy of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are key reasons cited for the growth of B2B payments in the region.
The Eko-B2B solution brings greater transparency and efficiency to all parties in the B2B payment process. Vendor and supplier web portals will enable round-the-clock access to current and historical payment details and dashboards that track key business performance statistics, eliminating the need for manual payment systems and their associated complications and operational inefficiencies.
Multiple payment systems, non-electronic payment methods and supplier resistance are just some of the common pain points for businesses as they attempt to digitize their payment system across their supplier network. With the Eko-B2B solution, Eko-Pay offers the option to manage this onboarding process for the business, allowing them to experience the full benefits of a digital B2B payment solution with minimal time invested.
Eko-Pay is very pleased to partner with Mastercard on this solution that bridges a critical gap in the B2B payment environment, said Jean-Pierre Gagnon, Chief Executive Officer of Eko-Pay. The entire platform was designed with simplicity in mind to allow for rapid adoption through local and international business networks and provide a long tail acceptance enablement solution.
Nagesh Devata, senior vice-president, Acceptance and Merchant Development, Asia Pacific, Mastercard, said, Many businesses today, regardless of size, engage with a network of suppliers and across multiple markets as they look to not just survive but thrive in a global marketplace. Yet many businesses still rely heavily on traditional, non-digital forms of payments to process business transactions, resulting in wasted time and resources unnecessarily. For businesses that have adopted digital payment solutions, they often face resistance and challenges from their supplier network and vendors in implementing these new processes. By partnering with Eko-Pay to launch a fully automated solution that allows them to experience the enhanced efficiencies and real-time cost savings of using digital payment solutions, we are looking to solve for some of these key pain points.
The Eko-B2B solution is now available in Asia Pacific, interested businesses should reach out to Mastercard or Eko-Pay.

Lanka Hospitals PLC has renewed its partnership with MyDoctor [www.MyDoctor.lk], this collaboration is aimed at taking healthcare services to a higher level. The official signing between the two parties took place on March 15,2017.
Ever since they commenced operations in Sri Lanka in 2002, Lanka Hospitals, known back then under the brand monicker Apollo Hospitals, has had a reputation for being one of the best health care facilities in the country.
To maintain exceptional and compassionate quality while offering cost effective healthcare solutions of international standards, reads Lanka Hospitals mission statement, something they have kept close to the crux of their operations since inception.
Launched in 2012, MyDoctor.lk is a web based medical advisory service specializing in initial medical advice 24/7 at Family Doctor (GP) level.
In addition to this they also act as a portal to a variety of medical services, and host to a wide range of discounts and special offers at leading medical service providers throughout the country to its members.
MyDoctor also features Android and iOS apps, a nifty interface for people to get in touch with service providers and use the full spectrum of services offered with MyDoctor.
The apps are also integrated with EMR, or else known as Electronic Medical Record system.
Tapping into a market that was virtually non-existent a couple years ago, MyDoctor is spearheading their sector combining technology and reputed healthcare service providers to give its users an optimal experience. This includes a wide variety of features in addition to the aforementioned advisory service and electronic medical records such as anonymous consultations for client privacy, sexual health advice and even features like travel with doctor, a handy option to get in touch with a local doctor when youre travelling overseas.

Natures wonders and architectural marvels
Nature is magnificent and living in a tropical country gives us a spectacular view of the wonders of nature. Arch World speaks to Archt. Jeeva Wijesundara about how amazing nature can be.
Tropical countries such as ours are naturally colorful throughout the year. Blue skies turning red in evenings and silver gray in rains, green trees with golden orange matured leaves here and there, paddies swinging with winds and gardens with fruits and flowers, sandy beaches and grounds, brown marshes various creatures such as birds, butterflies, squirrels, insects, reptiles and so on, provide a colorful set up. The use of colors of the nature, which we call earthen colors makes people feel cheerful, comfortable and relaxing, depending on the activity type, explained Wijesundara.
With the provision of optimum natural light and ventilation, automatically, the internal spaces become connected with the natural surroundings. Sounds of water, birds, squirrels, wind, even the fragrance of nature brings a relief to the human mind and body.
Being in the rain under an umbrella and looking at the rain from the window gives two different feelings. Similarly, being in nature and enjoying nature are different. For a person, a house becomes his or her own home with a set of such feelings related to belongingness - physical and mental comfort, relaxation, freedom, delightfulness, spaciousness. Nature and its changes; rising and setting sun, wind, rain, vista, sound, make a series of changes inside the home gradually and smoothly, pointed out Wijesundara
Tropical climate
A tropical climate is a blessing for the built environment to be in line with the natural environment to a great extent. In countries with cold winters and hot summers, people tend to live against nature.
For example, during cold times, heaters, and during hot times, air conditioners are to be used, throughout the year which consume quite a big amount of energy. Tropical climate like ours is one of the best provisions for energy efficiency. Use the optimum amount of sunlight and natural ventilation is one of the best ways to create energy efficient, healthy environments. Solar power, energy efficient and recycling systems, fittings and equipment are modern interventions in application today, said Wijesundara.
Nature is wonderful but so is the genius of man when it comes to architecture.
Apart from the great pyramids, we should look at the examples from our country. People compared great reservoirs such as Parakrama Samudra to the ocean. Sigiriya is considered as the 8th wonder of the world. Sri Lankans built the first ever tallest brick dagabas. All these were done by transferring a dream originated in human mind, into then available technology, with the materials, architectural experience and human power.
Today, the technology is far more developed; modern, and still sustainable. Durable building materials, and time and cost effective construction systems have evolved. The concept of timelessness is not the technology or the use of materials. It is how the buildings or the built environment are dreamed to address the desires and aspirations of the prevailing society, the culture and the economy. Such sensitive creations are ever-living, elucidated Wijesundara
Deeper human needs such as the sense of rest, relaxation, belongingness, identity and security are not only related to the building in which we live or work.
Outdoor environments
Outdoor environments are also responsible in making pleasant feelings in human mind. Public spaces such as parks, jogging tracks, roads, pedestrian pavements, bus-stops, railway stations, service stations, shopping malls or the super markets should give a sense of place,for the users to make them feel that the space is theirs. Then only do they feel the need to protect it, to love it, to keep it clean. This culture is bit rare in our context. This is inter-related with the education levels of the society as well, emphasized Wijesundara
Nothing is permanent. Its true that birth is hand-in hand with death. But we are neither awaiting death nor rejecting death. We all try to spend a good life with our family and others, in a good environment, until we leave the life.
Similarly, Buildings, or the built environment gradually decays with the time. Identifying the heritage, preservation, restoration and conservation aspects would lengthen the life time of the remarkable architecture. In that sense, adaptable re-use of old buildings and environs is a good approach in the stream of urban conservation, for future use, for new generations. This has become successful in most European countries and few good examples are available in our context as well, added Wijesundara.
Architects know all about emotions. Mastering the art of evoking emotions through the use of spaces is their specialty.
Places make people emotional. For example, in a church, kovil or a temple, nobody instructs you to be quiet, but you would be. Even a kid would start whispering there, rather than shouting. Why A quality of a place is sensed and responded by relevant reactions. But how that quality has been achieved through architecture is hard to explain in perfect wordings. It would be a combination of elements; the use of forms, heights, proportions, colors, textures, solid and void effects, light/light effects, shadows, articulation of spaces and so on. It differs from one place to the other. It could be either pleasant and inviting, or harsh and fearful. That is the wisdom; the creativity, informed Wijesundara.
Timeless beauty
The Timeless beauty of a place, which makes the user satisfied throughout the life time is the spirit of architecture, even after making sensitive modifications or alterations as per the changing needs and requirements.
For example, a house for a family with small kids will be modified once the kids are grown up. It would be different once the kids are married and the parents are old. But what is important is the essence of its beauty. Applicability of this phenomenon is not only about residential architecture, but also for other environs as well, with the changes of socio-cultural needs, stated Wijesundara.
Sri Lankan architecture is already fused with modern architectural trends, materials and technology by now.
It is obvious that with the increasing needs and the development trends, modern technology should be applicable for a well-balanced fusion without destroying our identity. To achieve this task, architects should be sufficiently knowledgeable and exposed to choose what is really necessary and suitable. Sometimes, discussions with other architects for different views are fruitful.
Environmental and climatic crisis are inter-related, which has become crucial in our context today. This has to be a national concern. Urban and financial crisis of the country would definitely have an effect on the development of the country, which makes related repercussions to the profession of architecture, as well as the whole construction trade.
For a country or a community to become truly great, its a blessing to have devoted community leaders, and engaged citizens. Use of relevant professional input into the countrys development process makes the educated citizens engaged in the service.
Spaces and places are always related to human thinking and behavior. Spiritual spaces are also places for people. Though not everybody, some are mentally benefitted by their spirituality. Apart from the religiosity, every human being senses and enjoys the serenity of spiritual places and benefitted by the mental relaxation, summed up Wijesundara.

Need for Human Rights Education in schools: Growing up with RIGHTS
Growing consensus around the world recognizes human rights education should be infused throughout the programme of every school - in curricula and textbooks, policies, the training of teaching personnel, teaching methods and the overall learning environment. Children can be easily guided by human rights education to make informed choices in life, to approach situations with critical and independent thought, and to empathize with other points of view.
In Sri Lanka, the Centre for the Study of Human Rights, Colombo university-based institution, has been a key player in building the human rights culture in Sri Lanka since 1994. The programmes of CSHR cater to a number of groups including primary and secondary school students, university students and pre-service and in-service teachers.
Its Human Rights Education Programme for Schools (HRES) targets secondary school students. The programme is designed to teach human rights in a non-formal manner, enabling participants to integrate human rights values into their day-to-day activities.
In spite of such intensive programmes introduced, this writer is in the opinion that human rights literacy is not yet widespread in Sri Lanka. Students of law and international relations or political science may study human rights in a university setting, but most people receive no education, formally or informally, about human rights.
Examples
Though there are many laws, which guarantee security to the common man, we have failed in the strict enforcement of them because of this knowledge gap. How can people use and defend human rights, if they have never learned about them It follows then the first question that we have to answer is how to help students acquire the necessary human rights knowledge, skills and attitudes so they can play their roles effectively within a culture of human rights.
Two modern day examples can be quoted.
(a) Human Rights Education in the School Systems of Europe, Central Asia and North America: A Compendium of Good Practice is a compilation of 101 examples of good practice in human rights education in primary schools, secondary schools and teacher training institutions in Europe and a number of other countries.
This compilation aims to support quality teaching in these areas and to inspire educational policymakers and administrators, teachers, teacher trainers, non-formal educators and all other interested actors. It also intends to facilitate networking and the exchange of experience among education professionals.
(b) In Australia, a course of studies titled, an Introduction to Human Rights and Responsibilities provides students with the opportunity to explore the meaning of rights and develop an understanding of human rights, and the responsibilities that complement them.
This resource has been designed to be used with an interactive whiteboard but can also be used on any internet enabled device, including a computer or tablet hooked up to a data projector. It includes interactive lessons with accompanying teacher resources (including lesson plans) and suggested homework activities and has been mapped to the Australian Curriculum for Humanities and Social Sciences.
Basic objectives
This writer believes it is time we integrate extensively human rights values to a number of subjects in our secondary schools from Grade 6 to 8. If systematically and properly done, such education will have great impact on society, definitely in the long run.
Sri Lanka's education reform does not include human rights education as a new subject although human rights are incorporated in various subjects such as social studies, political science, life competencies, and aesthetics etc. The integration has not been effective.
Few years ago, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam decided among themselves to introduce human rights as a subject to their school curricular frameworks. They had seven basic objectives in mind: (l). To formulate ASEAN Human Rights Education vision and mission; to review human rights standards and principles in order to identify core human rights concepts for basic education; (3) examine linkages between human rights and Southeast Asian cultures in order to help translate human rights concepts into educational materials; (4) to train on how to relate human rights lesson plans to the existing school curriculum; (5) to identify various strategies for infusion of human rights in the formal education curriculum. (6) to identify programmes for extra and co-curricular activities and/or human rights community-based activities (7) to prepare an action plan regarding strategy in regional lobby for human rights education. In these countries, Human Rights Education is a specially integrated subject offered in all educational levels. It serves as a means to develop and perpetuate the human values (humanity, unity, democracy and social justice) in everyday life; to develop in the students an awareness of his/her rights and duties as well as obedience toward laws and regulations, and a noble disposition; and to develop an awareness and understanding of interrelationships among the family, schools, society and the nation. Our Education If we believe that there is a role for human rights education within our school curriculum, then it is both useful and relevant to understand to what extent we are already complying. Through a properly structured survey, it is possible to determine that issue. Most importantly, we should research what is actually is happening in the classrooms No legislature in the world can assure student learning without the active involvement of the classroom teacher. When the media, politicians, teachers, students and others in everyday life begin to refer to such problems as women's issues, children's rights, poverty, international trade, unemployment as human rights issues, our students should gain a basic knowledge of what is been spoken about. They must learn that human rights abuses are not just something that occur in faraway places but happening right here at home they are happening in their homes and neighbourhood. Human rights education can be incorporated into the school curriculum in two ways: (1) The formal curriculum: Schools may choose to examine their present curriculums and identify areas where themes and elements of human rights education already exist. Human rights education is considered the most important part of the core curriculum of good general education. (2) The informal curriculum: Human rights education can also be promoted through the extracurricular and co-curricular activities of the school. Context and approaches The globally accepted approaches to incorporating human rights education in the curriculum are the following: (1) Direct context: This involves including specific topics or subjects that focus on human rights education into civics, science, or history subjects, for example. India has introduced human rights education at the higher education levels. (2) Indirect context: This involves the use of all school subjects as vehicles for human rights education. Some examples are (i) creating learning units in human rights in order to integrate the content of different subjects toward solving a particular problem and (ii) including human rights elements in every subject. (3) Implicit context: This involves the creation of a socio-cultural ethos in schools that will develop students understanding of human rights. Integration The question is how to introduce the new curriculums at various levels. It is obvious that one more subject cannot be added to an already overloaded curriculum. Human rights education can be integrated into existing curriculums. The real question, however, is what and how much is to be integrated. The answer requires a selection of issues. Teaching the basic rights may be done under the umbrella of ethics. At the secondary level, basic and other rights may be introduced into existing curriculum subjects. Only when people are educated about human rights can we hope to prevent human rights violations, and thus prevent conflict, as well. This message has a real relevance to our current political and social scenario. Education is a powerful tool for social transformation and justice. We have to start the process of formation at the root of society by sowing the seed of humanism in the minds of our students, the future of Sri Lanka. The task ahead of us is daunting and challenging. We have many miles to go and promises to keep. In solidarity with like-minded people, the distance becomes shorter and the target achievable.

Abduction and killing of five youths: UPFA MP attempted to influence IGP to stop investigations
UPFA National List MP Malith Jayathilake accompanied by another person met the IGP and influenced him to stop CID investigations into the abducting and killing of five youth in Dehiwala that took place in 2008, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake charged.
Speaking at the Parliamentary debate yesterday, he said the IGP had then summoned CID SSP Shani Abeysekara and inquired about the investigations in front of the MP and the other person.
The MP pointed out that the move was a deliberate attempt to stall the on-going investigations into the above abductions committed for obtaining ransoms under the cover of war.
The MP further charged that the Government was trying to discourage investigations into the killings of senior journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga and ruggerite Wasim
Thajudeen, abductions of Prageeth Ekneligoda and Keith Noyahr and attacks on Upali Thennakoon and Poddala Jayantha.
He said the Government was defending those responsible in these crimes.
The MP further accused that the IGP had taken back about 100 complaints he himself referred to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), adding that serious doubts have been raised whether this move was meant to deter investigations.
He pointed out that the FCID was not given any new investigation for the last several months. He also raised concerns over the transfer of the FCID Director to Moneragala without any reasons. He was an experienced senior officer who provided leadership to the investigations and he should not have been transferred until the end of investigations. The new Director will have to study all cases from the start, he added.
The MP pointed out that those in the Government who came to power with the pledge of taking a hard line on corruption, bribery, fraud and waste, were now trying to stall investigations.
Complaints made by the Top Ten disregaded: JO MP
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian D V Chanaka said that ten complaints have been made by way of the top ten, but no steps have been taken against any.
He made these observations while joining the debate on the motion for revision of limits of Bribery Raids Advance Accounts.
This government came to power saying it would bring about good governance. "The biggest fraud that had been committed in the country is the Treasury Bond issue," D V Chanaka said. "But Arjuna Alosious is being granted more facilities to engage in businesses. He was allowed to commence an Ethanol Company. He was also allowed to commence a company in the East free of tax. How does this happen under a good governance government," he questioned.
He added that there was an allegation against the Finance Minister for importing 700 Prado jeeps by undervaluing. He added that the Finance Minister had caused a Rs 10 billion damage to the country. But without investigating into this allegation, Customs officers had been charged.
Payment of Electricity Bills: A disparity that should be rectified
Nearly half the population who contribute for the production and promotion of the national economy are compelled to shoulder the burden of the other half when they pay their electricity bills owing to the relief provided to those who consume less than 90 units of electricity per month, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday responding to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma in Parliament during the round of questions for oral answers.
The Deputy Minister said that there were 6.5 million electricity consumers and nearly half  2.8 million of consumers use less than 90 units per month.
It is unfair for the consumers who use electricity for production purposes to contribute immensely for the development of the national economy to pay for others electricity bills just because the latter consume less than 90 units a month," the Deputy Minister said. "Currently, around Rs 18 to 19 was spent to produce a unit. Those who use less than 90 units need to pay only four rupees per unit as relief provided to them. Their balance is covered by those who use more than that," he said.
The Deputy Minister also said that it was unfair and a new mechanism was needed. He added that the entire nation should discuss this disparity and unjust that was meted to those who really do some work.
Govt. to increase renewable energy generation by 1,000 MW: Ajith P. Perera
The government has taken measures to increase the renewable energy generation by 1,000 MW during the next five years, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ajith P Perera.
He made this observation yesterday, in response to a question raised by UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara Jayamaha during the round of questions for oral answers.
He also said that the government had reached a policy decision to allow the private sector to engage in renewable energy generation and to make transmission by purchasing the product under competitive billing. He however added that the government had planned to set up the Mannar 100 MW wind power plant with a loan taken from the Asian Development Bank.
He also said that the government had decided to replace the license system by the tender issuing system to grant the setting up of these power plants.
Responding to another question raised by UNP MP Ajith Mannapperunma, Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said the Treasury was paying the loan taken to construct the Norochcholai Coal Power plant, adding that the Treasury settled a US$ 87 million and US$ 25.8 million as loan premium and interest in 2015 to the Chinese Exim Bank. He added that the government had paid US$ 94.7 million and US$ 23.6 million as loan interest in 2016. He added that the income earned by the CEB through the sale of products of the coal power plant was included under the income of the loan premiums and interest paid by the government on the construction of the coal power plant which was not included under the expenditure head which he accepted as some what strange.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera responding to a question raised by Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, said the objection against the construction of the Kuruganga small medium hydro power plant had been directed before a Special Committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena. He added if the damage caused by the same power plant was higher than the benefits, the plant would not be constructed.
No politician involved in Batalanda Torture House: Presidential Commission
The Presidential Commission which was appointed by the then SLFP leader and President Chandrika Kumarathunga, decided that no politician had any involvement with the Batalanda Torture House, said State Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne in Parliament yesterday.
The Deputy Minister made this observation yesterday in response to a query made by an Opposition member, while speaking on a motion for revision of limits of Bribery Raids Advance Accounts.
"I'll clarify it as you question about the Batalanda torture house," Deputy Minister Wickramaratne said. "The Presidential Commission on Batalanda Torture House was appointed by the then President Chandrika Kumarathunga. She was the Sri Lanka Freedeom Party (SLFP) leader then. The Commission decided that no politician had any involvement in the Batalanda Torture House."
UNP MP Buddika Pathirana presents 33 petitions in single session
UNP Parliamentarian Buddika Pathirana yesterday, presented a record number of petitions by presenting 33 which was the the largest number of petitions during a single session in the recent history of the country's legislature. " I might enter the Guinness book of worlds records for presenting the largest number of petitions and raising the largest number of oral questions," MP Pathirana said. According to Parliamentary sources, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara had presented 20 petitions several years ago, while Gemini Lokuge had presented 18 petitions.
JO MPs keep away from discussions on devolution of land, police powers
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly (CA) which met yesterday and the day before, had discussed in length about the devolution of land and Police powers.
The Steering Committee sources said the devolution of these powers was discussed in the light of 13 Amendment to the Constitution. Sources further said necessary safeguards to prevent the misuse of these powers once devolved had also been discussed.
The two MPs representing the Joint Opposition were not present at the meeting presided by Steering Committee Chairman Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday. However, sources said the JO was in attendance to the other meetings of the Steering Committee and they had not withdrawn from it.

## Title: Reshuffling thoughts

Reshuffling thoughts
The reshuffle rumour mill, which had been shut down for some time is now back in action and the reason for that was a public statement by President Maithripala Sirisena who, while attending the opening of a cultural centre in Hambantota, commented that Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera would be given a better ministry to serve the entire country.
The remarks were made off the cuff and almost in jest but in doing so, the President did note that the Hambantota district did have three ministers dealing with the subject of fisheries at different levels. These observations have now set tongues wagging of a possible Cabinet reshuffle, leading ministers to push panic buttons and constantly look over their shoulders.
Previously, there was widespread speculation that a Cabinet reshuffle was in the offing but that it was being deferred until the visit of the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde because it would have conveyed an impression of instability within the government. However, Lagarde cancelled her visit to the country and speculation of a reshuffle has resurfaced, especially after Presidents Sirisenas comments at Hambantota.
Central Bank Bond issue
There is no doubt that some ministries are causing concern to the top echelons of the government- and that is not necessarily because of the ministers heading them. They are embroiled in controversies that have damaged the government or have affected its popularity.
For instance, the Finance Ministry is involved in the Central Bank Bond issue. Similarly, the ministries of Higher Education and Health are involved in the controversy over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). The Ministry of Ports and Shipping is entangled in a tug of war over the Hambantota Port.
While the respective ministers in charge of these ministries are not singularly responsible for these issues, there have been suggestions that a reshuffle would perhaps offer the government the best chance of restoring public confidence and popularity.
However, a Cabinet reshuffle in the National Unity government headed by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is no walk in the park for the President and the Premier. That is because of the complexities involved in a government that includes ministers of parties which have been arch rivals for decades, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
It is worth noting that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, passed by this government repealing the draconian 18th Amendment endorsed by the administration of Mahinda Rajapaksa, stipulates a limit of 30 on the number of Cabinet ministers. The current Cabinet has 45 ministers in addition to the President and the Prime Minister who also hold ministerial portfolios. The total number of ministers, including deputy ministers and assorted others, is close to a hundred.
Article 46 (1) of the Constitution states that, The total number of (a) Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers shall not exceed thirty; and (b) Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers shall not, in the aggregate, exceed forty.
However, a crafty piece of legislation is also included in the 19th Amendment, making a larger Cabinet a possibility. Article 46 (4) of the Constitution states that, Where the recognized political party or the independent group which obtains highest number of seats in Parliament forms a National Government, the number of Ministers in the Cabinet of Ministers, the number of Ministers who are not Cabinet of Ministers and the number of Deputy Ministers shall be determined by Parliament. This is the clause under which the current Cabinet operates.
National Unity government
Article 46 (5) of the Constitution elaborates further on this issue and states that a National Government means, a Government formed by the recognized political party or the independent group which obtains the highest number of seats in Parliament together with the other recognized political parties or the independent groups..
Therefore, it is theoretically possible for a government to offer a ministerial portfolio to one independent Member of Parliament and call itself a National Government, thereby paving the way for a Cabinet much larger than the originally stipulated 30 ministers.
Be that as it may, the current concern for the government is, even if it reshuffles the Cabinet, how it should go about doing it. Given that there are simmering tensions between the UNP and SLFP camps within the Cabinet despite the excellent relationship between the President and the Prime Minister, any reshuffle should be aimed at toning down these differences and not inflaming them further.
How best this can be achieved is the big question. A frequent grouse in the SLFP camp is that the UNP has been allocated most of the prestigious portfolios such as Finance, Foreign Affairs, Education and Justice.
However, it will be recalled that until the general election in August 2015, the UNP held almost all of the portfolios when it led a minority government. Also, it was the UNP that emerged as the single largest party at the general election; hence it is entitled to that privilege.
It has also been pointed out that the lines between the UNP and the SLFP have become a bit blurred anyway since stalwarts such as Arjuna Ranatunga and Rajitha Senaratne, loyalists of President Sirisena who walked out with him from Mahinda Rajapaksas government, were in fact loyal SLFPers who were forced to contest the 2015 elections under the UNP ticket.
It is well known that a great deal of time and effort went into finalising the original Cabinet when a National Unity government was formed. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga was also involved in the negotiations between the SLFP and the UNP and the allocation of portfolios.
There was a lot of give and take from both parties and the eventual allocation of ministries satisfied most ministers in both parties, although there will always been the odd voice of dissent.
Two major parties
It is worthwhile noting that even the Constitution provides a direction on the appointment of Cabinet ministers. Article 43(2) of the Constitution states that The President shall, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoint from among Members of Parliament, Ministers, to be in charge of the Ministries so determined. Thus, any reshuffle would require the concurrence of the Prime Minister.
In the current scenario, there is likely to be firm opposition from both major parties if there is an attempt to change a portfolio held by a UNP minister by handing it over to a SLFP Minister and, even though SLFPers may feel that they too are entitled to at least a few of the more prestigious ministries.
Therefore, the most likely outcome is a reshuffle where the personalities heading the ministries maybe shuffled around but the parties heading those ministries will remain the same. This is the only practical manner in which the already tenuous unity between the two major parties can be preserved.
Currently, President Maithripala Sirisena is on a state visit to Russia. While any changes will have to necessarily await his return to the country, the big question is whether the reshuffle will occur before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year which is due in a few weeks.
The guessing game is on but as with any reshuffle, one can be certain that no matter what changes are made there will be those who will be unhappy- and this is what the government will want to minimize.

River cruise on the Mahaweli: A Cinnamon Citadel experience
The guests of Cinnamon Citadel, Kandy are now welcome to embark on a boat ride along Sri Lanka's longest river, the Mahaweli, to further enrich this idyllic escape from the mundane. The tranquil nature of the stunning environment that surrounds the hotel flows through the entire experience, both within the confines of the hotel and the lush green landscape.
The smooth lull of the boat on Mahaweli waters, is no ordinary boat ride; guests will travel with expert naturalists attached to Cinnamon Nature Trails, the eco-tourism and excursions arm of Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts, further enhancing the excursion via the flashes of colour and the melodious chirps of the endemic bird life.
Sashaying through the Mahaweli, guests will spot an array of wetland birds, the long-legged Herons, the family oriented Cranes and the brightly coloured Kingfishers. Amphibians and reptiles too lurk in and around the banks of the river, exposing visitors to an almost utopian-like co-existence of diverse species.
The dense bio-diversity in the vicinity enables guests the ability to spot bird-life and wildlife even while dining at the main restaurant of the hotel -Panorama, which opens out to the breathtaking view of the Mahaweli and the surrounding mountain range. A dip in the pool, surrounded by natural landscapes, will further envelop guests into the magical healing properties that nature offers in abundance. While all guests who visit Cinnamon Citadel Kandy thrive on the scenic beauty of Kandy and the pure bliss that a Zen atmosphere brings, the expert naturalists of Cinnamon Nature Trails are well equipped to cater to avid bird watching and nature enthusiasts. With the skillful guidance of the naturalists, visitors may venture out of the hotel premises and walk through the forests, trek on the Knuckles mountain range, climb the Adams Peak and camp on the Horton Plains.
All experts necessary for professional level bird watching are available in-house. Guests are therefore welcome to take Cinnamon Nature Trails up on the offer of stepping out of the hotel and into the wetland forests to explore the vibrant birdlife that flutter about. Expert naturalists will ensure that they spot as many birds as the visitor's time will allow. Passionate bird watchers are recommended to spend 10 to 15 days in order to see all 30 endemic bird species and most of the 169 migrant birds among the 490 bird species in existence in the country. Sri Lanka, being a tropical country is blessed with a year round birding season and is the ideal destination for ardent bird watchers any time of the year.
Cinnamon Citadel Kandy offers guests a relaxing getaway on one of the country's most culturally rich regions. The hotel is best known for its amazing views from any part of its premises. Located just 15-20 minutes from the town, visitors can explore much more than the excursions within the vicinity as the hotel is situated inconvenient proximity to gain access to the Peradeniya botanical gardens, the Temple of the Tooth relic or the Udawatte Kele sanctuary to mention a few.

Royal strikers on a historical tour to Down Under
The undisputed National Schools hockey champion team of Royal College will be on a tour to Canberra, Australia from March 23 to April 1 on an invitation from Australian Hockey ACT via the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canberra. The Royal U-18 team won the gold medal and proved its supremacy in 2016.
The history of this team goes back to 2008 and these lads have been playing next to each other for more than a decade beginning from U-9. A few achievements brought back from history would be, U-9 and U-11 Colombo schools champions, U-13 and U-15 Colombo schools runner-up. In the annual encounters of Royal played against 4 popular schools, this team went on to retain all 4 trophies against Wesley College (Dudley K.G.De silva memorial shield), Kingswood College (Lennie De Silva memorial trophy), Trinity College (J.C.A. Corea memorial trophy) and aginst arch rivals S.ThomasCollege (Orville Abeynaike Trophy).
Hockey was introduced to Royal in 1955 with the guidance of Lennie De Silva, a past kingswoodian. The golden era of Royal College hockey commenced in 1991 when a bunch of loyal old boys formed the Royal College Hockey Club to assist in developing hockey at Royal. This new development changed the destiny of Royal hockey and paved way for an astounding performance by the Royal stickers in winning large number of titles over the last two decades.
During the last decade they won the National Schools Games Title four times which speaks volume of their dominance. The present coach of Royal College, Rohan Dissanayake who has been serving since 1991 has been instrumental in the successes of Royal hockey. The Royal College Hockey Club is celebrating its 26th anniversary and striving to maintain the standards of professionalism by organizing events such as the "Blue and Gold Hockey 7s, a premier schools hockey tournament in Sri Lanka.
Royal hockey teams have participated in many foreign tours in the recent past with the sole intention of giving its players the much needed international exposure and that has paid dividends over the years.
During the tour Royal strikers will play five matches, all in the latest blue astro turfs which one match scheduled to be played under lights. Another noteworthy feature is they will be given a training session by Australias Under 21 Coach, Ben Bishop who has also been a member of the coaching staff of the Olympic Gold Medal winning Australian team.

SAITM students request fair and expeditious solution to predicament
Students of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in a press release issued today, called for a fair and expeditious solution to the current predicament that deprive us from completing our internship training to be fully registered medical practitioners.
As graduates and students of the MBBS programme at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), we sincerely urge authorities to provide a fair and expeditious solution to our current predicament, which has and continues to deprive us from completing our internship training to be fully registered medical practitioners, the students said.
We regret that despite the clear directive of the Court of Appeal on January 31st 2017, whereby SAITM MBBS graduates were granted the right of provisional registration, obstacles continue to be placed in our path by various parties with malicious intent, without the greater good in mind.
We were all eligible to pursue our undergraduate training in medicine at prestigious foreign universities. However, we as Sri Lankan citizens, wished to pursue our higher education in the field of medicine in Sri Lanka and SAITM offered us this opportunity. Students registered for the SAITM MBBS degree programme have fulfilled all the stipulated University Grants Commission (UGC) entry criteria and are solely from the Bio Science stream of the A/L examinations. Contrary to various misinformation being disseminated to the public, there are no students from the arts or commerce streams in the SAITM MBBS programme. We further have no hesitancy in submitting our A/L results, as duly required by the SLMC, when applying for provisional registration.
SAITM MBBS students are mentored by respected and experienced professors and lecturers in the country such as Professor Neville Perera (Surgery), Prof. Deepal Weerasekera (Obstetrics & Gynaecology), Prof. Deepthi Samarage (Pediatrics), and Prof. Kolitha Sellahewa (General Medicine), Dr. Narendra Pinto (Orthopedic Surgeon), Dr. Vasantha Perera (Orthopedic Surgeon), Dr. Mahendra Perera (Oncology) and other highly qualified teachers. Most of whom have served in state universities for many years.
The SAITM MBBS programme is regulated by the Ministry of Higher Education of Sri Lanka and the final examinations for the MBBS programme are conducted according to the UGC regulations and are held in a similar manner as in state medical faculties. They are conducted by both internal examiners from SAITM and external examiners from state medical faculties and state hospitals.
Further we wish to reiterate that, upon receiving provisional registration we must still learn under an experienced state doctor and undergo further training and evaluations, prior to being granted eligibility to be a practicing doctor. The obstructions to SAITM MBBS students exercising the legally granted right to provisional registration at this point in time, deprives students from completing the programme.
We are knowledgeable, capable and highly committed to assume our rightful place as fully-fledged doctors to serve the people of Sri Lanka.
We urge all relevant authorities to afford SAITM MBBS students the rightful opportunity and provide a firm and fair resolution to this pressing issue. We are confident that the Government of Sri Lanka, the Parliament and the legal system will ensure that the due process of law will prevail, enabling us to contribute to the healthcare system and serve the people of this country,' it said.

Saving the imperilled sea cows
Shrinking numbers of dugongs, the last remaining marine Sirenian on the planet, has stimulated a global wave to protect the surviving pockets of this species; one such pocket is the shallow waters off Northwest Sri Lanka.
Dugongs, also known as sea cows, are huge and slow-moving creatures having peddle-like forelimbs, no hind limbs, and a horizontally flattened tail. They are strictly marine herbivorous mammals classified as vulnerable to extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
The population of dugongs is restricted to seagrass habitats, as they are reliant on seagrass for food. Then again, seagrass meadows are only found in less than 0.2 percent of the worlds oceans. Studies indicate that seagrass is disappearing at an alarming rate of 110 square kilo meters per year, largely, due to human activities. Dugongs have been reported in seagrass meadows found in the northwest of Sri Lanka, namely the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay, IUCN Coastal and Marine Programme Coordinator Arjan Rajasuriya said.
Arjan was making an introductory presentation to a group of about 20 foreign and local media personnel during a field visit to Dugong and Seagrass Conservation Project sites in Kalpitiya, last week, accompanied with the UN Environment Programme officials.
Underground market for dugong meat
Kalpitiya is a famous tourist attraction for dolphin and whale watching, but lesser known for dugongs. Spotting a dugong is very rare, given its fast depleting numbers and the elusive nature.
Arjan, former Research Officer at the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA), pointed out that dugong was highly threatened in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay, and added that the species was probably critically endangered.
I worked in this area since 1988. My specialty was coral taxonomy. From 1988 to now, I have not seen a single live dugong. It comes to the surface of the water to breathe and then goes down. You would not know of its presence, unless you are very close to it, he explained.
He pointed out that dugong are hunted for their meat, which has an underground market. It faces direct threats from targeted hunting, incidental by-catch, and various destructive fishing practices, including trawling, indiscriminate netting, dynamite fishing, and a general over-exploitation of fishery resources, he said.
About 100-150 dugongs were taken annually in the Manner District in the 1950s. Nobody knows its current population. Dugongs are killed often, but not detected. Every two months or so, we lose an animal, Arjan added.
Locally, dugongs are protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, and internationally, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to which Sri Lanka acceded in 1979, limits or bans the trade of derived products from it.
Moreover, Sri Lanka is signatory to the Dugong MoU since 2012, which aims to promote internationally coordinated actions to ensure the long-term survival of dugongs and their seagrass habitats throughout their extensive range.
GEF Project
Sri Lanka has been selected to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) project on Dugong and Seagrass Conservation. The project, which is considered the first coordinated global effort to conserve dugongs and their seagrass habitats, got off the grounds in January, 2015, and extends till December, 2018.
This project, financially supported by the GEF, is implemented by the UN Environment Programme and executed by the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund with technical support from the Dugong MoU Secretariat. Eight countries from Africa to Asia and into the Pacific have been selected to this global project with an overall investment of USD 6 million.
Thirty eight national projects have been planned in the eight countries, namely Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mozambique, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. Seven of the projects are located in Sri Lanka with a total funding of USD 622,000.
During the media field trip to Kalpitiya, the participants were familiarized with the ground level implementation of these national level projects carried out by local project partners with the coordination of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC).
On the trail of the elusive dugong
The Ocean Resources Conservation Association (ORCA) is involved in research activities to assess the current status and distribution of seagrass beds and dugongs in selected sites in Northwest Sri Lanka. Its Marine Research Team Leader Prasanna Weerakkody said they have recorded 13 dugong deaths last year alone.
This area was closed and inaccessible for thirty long years due to war. Now that the war is over, tourism and fishing are increasing, and these negatively impact the entire eco-system. As of the information available, about 1,000 Indian trawlers enter this area per night, causing severe damage to our sea grass eco-system. If prudent action is not taken, we will lose the dugong forever, he cautioned.
The ORCA has been conducting field surveys using scuba divers and has been collecting information through community interviews to identify dugong hotspots. Often, the local fishing community is reluctant to come out with information about dugong encounters due to fear of taking legal action against them if linked with captures. This reservation restricts the gathering of location information. Our team members spend extra time in the field to let the villagers get familiar with them to make the information gathering a success, he explained.
ORCA and NARA have been using new technology such as drones and sonar devices to identify dugong hotspots, and have been using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map available seagrass beds. Weerakkody also noted, with appreciation, the assistance of Sri Lanka Navy throughout the project.
Taking the local and foreign journalists on a boat ride, Weerakkody, supported by his team members, demonstrated how these field surveys are being carried out in shallow waters towards the West of Kalpitiya peninsula, near the bar reef.
Alternative livelihoods
The majority of families living in the area are dependent on the fishing industry, resulting in heavy fishing pressure. As a component of the GEF project, alternative livelihoods are being promoted to ease the fishing pressure, and thereby, discourage illegal fishing practices frequently found in the area.
Sawing machines, batik toolkits, and ornamental fish rearing tanks have been provided to selected families under this project led by the Sri Lanka Turtle Conservation Project (SLTCP).
Our husbands used to engage in fishing using nylon nets, but now they have abandoned that practice. I support the family income by sewing clothes to match the income we lost after we abandoned illegal fishing. We were educated on the damage illegal fishing causes to the environment. We are happy to discontinue it. The SLTCP has also promised to give us training on batik industry, and we look forward to it, K.B. Nilmini, a resident in Serakkuriya who is a beneficiary of the project, told the media.
In the meantime, the Biodiversity Education and Research (BEAR), another stakeholder of the GEF project, is involved in raising awareness among the local community on the destruction caused by illegal fishing methods, as well as the importance of seagrass habitats and dugong conservation. BEAR project officer Rohana Nanayakkara said awareness campaigns targeting fishing folk and school children are being conducted to meet this end.
All these project partners are being coordinated by the DWC while facilitating communication among them and organizing training sessions. DWC Research and Training Assistant Director Dr. Lakshman Peiris said, they have been working on to set up a National Facilitating Committee for better coordination of all the project partners.

Simply fascinating!: Londons National Gallerys Michelangelo and Sebastiano exhibition
There is a genuinely jaw-dropping moment at the heart of this revelatory exhibition dedicated to the High Renaissance master Michelangelo Buonarroti and his brilliant acolyte, the Venetian Sebastiano del Piombo.
The show is arranged over six rooms that follow Michelangelo and Sebastiano from their first meeting in 1511, through their joint development of a Roman style in tandem with Raphael, and their eventual separation.
By halfway round youll be dizzy with the rediscovery of Sebastianos forgotten genius in big, ambitious oils such as the The Raising Of Lazarus.
On the next wall Sebastianos Lamentation Over The Dead Christ, from the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg, joins Christs Descent Into Limbo, from the Prado in Madrid, for the first time since they were separated in 1646 (a 17th-century copy of Christ Appearing To The Apostles completes the broken-up triptych).
Then you come to Room Fours wide doorway. Inside, two life-size Michelangelo sculptures of The Risen Christ hover at head height, bathed in an apparently heavenly glow.
The one at the back is a plaster copy of the original that never leaves Romes church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. In the Eternal City, Catholic decency requires that Christ wears a bronze loincloth, but here the muscular saviour, Michelangelos fully realised synthesis of Christianity and the classical world, steps forward with unfettered loins.
Before him, miraculously, stands another Risen Christ, known as the Giustiniani - the original marble version abandoned when Michelangelo discovered a vein of dark stone as he carved the face. The pairing knocks you back on your feet.
There are more wonders and some surprises, including a computer-mapped facsimile of Sebastianos frescoes of The Transfiguration and Flagellation Of Christ (drawn by Michelangelo) in the Borgherini chapel. But the pairing of the Risen Christs is a world first.
Gazing upon the finished Risen Christ in 1521 - harder today in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, where visitors are obliged to feed coins into a meter for the spotlight - an awestruck Sebastiano said: One knee is worth all Rome.
The two men - Michelangelo the Tuscan country boy born in 1475 who became the greatest artist who ever lived; Sebastiano, the lute-playing Venetian ten years his junior who swaggered into Rome in 1511 - became remarkably close.
Sebastiano was invited on to the scaffold for an on-the-spot view of Michelangelos progress on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and in moving letters displayed on the gallery wall Sebastiano writes to Michelangelo of the love I have of you.
Yet it was not love that sealed the partnership but bitter rivalry with Raphael, a painter Michelangelo damned for stealing figures from the Sistine Chapel and placing them in the Stanze, or Raphael Rooms, the fabulous decorated Vatican staterooms two floors above the Sistine.
Michelangelo complained of Raphael: Everything he did in art he got from me. Unfortunately, everything Raphael did tended to be painted in oil with a facility that Michelangelo - master of fresco, sculpture and architecture - lacked. Sebastiano had that facility in spades, as a smaller oil, Judith (or Salome), of a woman in luminous blue silk, reveals.
In return, Michelangelo offered an unparalleled ability with the human form that gave the world David, The Creation Of Adam and the heart-breaking Piet, completed when he was only 24, that stands in St Peters and is represented here in plaster but is no less powerful.
The artists were different in temperament and approach, as two pictures in the show illustrate.
Sebastianos unfinished The Judgement Of Solomon bears the marks of a man willing to improvise. Michelangelos The Entombment, also unfinished, is heavily plotted, sculptural in its intensity.
But their collaboration worked, nowhere more so than in Sebastianos The Raising Of Lazarus, the very first entry into the National Gallerys collection, acquired in 1824. Michelangelo took on Lazarus and the workmen around him; Sebastiano took on Christ and the onlookers repelled by the stench of decay.
Lazarus, face still grimy from the tomb and leg cocked to flex off rigor mortis, moves his right arm across his body to push away the winding sheet, eye fixed on the Christ who has delivered him.
It is both an astonishing and intensely moving painting, and mattered all the more to Sebastiano and Michelangelo because, like Raphaels Transfiguration, it had been commissioned for the cathedral at Narbonne.
Why the great enmity with Raphael Simply the resentment of men jostling for the Popes favour A feud between one homosexual artist and another so vigorously heterosexual that his death was allegedly caused by a night of too much sex
We will never know if Sebastiano was Michelangelos lover but they lived in each others pockets. Sebastianos Lamentation Over The Dead Christ is one of the most striking images in the show and features the first nocturnal landscape.
Unlike Michelangelos Piet, here Mary, her eyes to the heavens, sits apart from her dead son.
But go round the back and youll find Michelangelo has, in a few sketched lines on the wood-wormed poplar boards, been working on figures for the Sistine ceiling.
ITS A FACT
In The Agony And The Ecstasy, with Charlton Heston, the paint dripping into Michelangelos mouth from the Sistine ceiling is really chocolate pudding.
The friendship of more than 25 years ended in the Sistine Chapel, when Michelangelos first attempt at The Last Judgement, encouraged by Sebastiano, ran into trouble.
When Sebastiano died in 1547, Michelangelo - hurt, old and perhaps a little cranky by then - dismissed him as a lazy artist.
The claim was manifestly untrue, as this remarkable show, bringing major works together in celebration of their respect and love for each other, proves.
But you might want to go to Room Four first.
Its a bold call to make in March, of course, but Madonnas & Miracles is surely the exhibition of the year.
Based on a holy trinity of solid scholarship, thoughtful installation and fascinating exhibits, it also overturns preconceptions about the Renaissance. Not bad for a show thats free to enter.
In the exhibition were shown that the Renaissance wasnt quite the era of worldliness and secularisation that many today suggest - life was still marked by profoundly observed religious devotion. - dailymail.co.uk

Sketching her dreams in the Big Apple
Fashion photography may have trumped illustration a while back, but hand sketching is anything but dead. The stylish sketches of many a renowned fashion illustrator adorns fashion magazines, newspapers, designers, and apparel companies revealing that in a non-stop digital world, there exists countless ways to experience the fashion industry firsthand.
Known for live drawing at renowned fashion shows and campaigns Sri Lankan born Nadeesha Godamunne can be found sitting overlooking the ramp with her custom palette and colour pen. The drawings are finished by the models final exit off the runway. The 29-year-old is living her dream in the Big Apple, sketching eccentric and bold characters under the name Mokshini.
Her direct and spontaneous approach to drawing has gained her recognition in the live drawing arena, making her one of the most sought after fashion illustrators of our time. She has clients like Prabal Gurung, Alice and Olivia, Erin Fetherston, Neiman Marcus and Unilever in her kitty. Brands like J- Crew, White House Black Market, and Oxosi have also profiled Mokshini. She had also collaborated with publications such as V Magazine, The New Zealand Herald, The Huffington Post, and Afropunk. Working in the textile design arena Nadeesha has sketched for brands such as Siladora, Abby Lichtman and Calvin Klein. She started off her career working as an in-house illustrator and colourist at Ralph Lauren. On the cusp of the HSBC Colombo Fashion Week the young fashion illustrator was in town where she conducted a workshop for upcoming fashion designers and illustrators.
Ever since I could remember, I was surrounded by art supplies. My mother was a preschool teacher and knew I had a natural talent for drawing. I drew before I could write. I loved communicating through art and it was a fun process too. I continued to excel in the arts during high school, and took as many art related subjects as I could: graphic design, painting and art design. Though drawing was a natural part of my being, I never considered it a viable career path, Nadeesha recalled the roots of how it had all begun.
She notes that though she knew that she wanted to work in the creative field, taking up drawing as a profession made her nervous. This is because photography dominates the field over illustrations. Nadeesha studied fashion design at the Auckland University of Technology.
Though I enjoyed the design process of draping, patternmaking and sewing, I kept returning to drawing, and concluded my final year with a collection that featured hand drawn garments digitally printed on shift dresses, giving the illusion of many layers of clothes. The collection, titled Trompe Loeil, won multiple prizes, including the Mittelmoda award, which allowed me to showcase in Gorizia, Italy, Nadeesha said adding that she scooped the prize for Best Three Piece Collection and the Grand Supreme Award for Best Collection at the Style Pasifika Fashion Awards which is known to be New Zealands most prominent fashion competition.
Nadeeshas mentor, Linda Jones, encouraged her to pursue her Masters in illustration. She also taught fashion illustration to freshman at the Auckland University of Technology and later at the Academy of Art University, San Francisco. Her work soon opened her eyes to the fact that drawing was her life.
Today she has her own brand, Mokshini, which originates from her first name.
Though Ive always been called Nadeesha, I felt it was time to nurture more of my true identity. The name change has also allowed me to shift gears and think of myself as a brand, not just a freelance illustrator, says the gifted fashion.
Illustrations leave something to the imagination. Today people are so reliant on an exact image via photography. Many have asked me if I think that fashion illustrations is a dying art form. However I believe that if there is technology, then fashion illustrations will always be alive because people are always craving for hand drawn sensibility, Nadeesha opined.
Her need to push beyond the boundaries of traditional fashion illustrations made her experiment with chop sticks for her early work. With the goal of being a part of the Ralph Lauren team, Nadeesha practiced drawing with markers till she finally got it right and was roped in.
We worked with the designers closely and sketch up ideas. Though they told us what to do they left a lot of room for designing and illustration. All of the work is done in markers. The designers go to the Ralph Lauren warehouse and select a cloth and bring it to the illustrators. Every illustration that we do is preserved by them, Nadeesha expressed.
She says that her work is very much about character. She loves observing ones body language and mannerisms, and then capturing their energy in a few lines. What I record in my daily drawing journal influences my work tremendously, she said.
If she is given time to do a drawing she says that she spends a lot of time drafting her work but does her sketches really fast. Live drawing is her thing and she has worked with the designers at the New York Fashion Week. She generally takes around two minutes to complete a drawing.
A lot of us hone on too much details. We use social media as a means of connecting with the audience. Unlike photos which are photoshopped and air brushed, drawing is down live and that mesmerizes the audience, she explained adding that one cannot capture something on the spur of the moment.
You need to be good at memorizing and drawing from your head. A cool way I discovered in doing it is practicing on the subway. Street style illustrations is an entirely different dimension of the subject, she said adding that she would draw her friends in cool outfits and put the drawing on her blog along with a photo. Soon she moved out into the streets and started drawing real people on the streets and communicating with them. This opened doors to more opportunities including her entrance ticket to featuring her work in the V Magazine.
One of the people I sketched was the editor of V Magazine. I totally freaked out when I found out but then I realized that this is the perfect opportunity for me to tap into something. When you meet people like that dont let those opportunities slip you by. Dont let feel like it is desperate to reach out to people and ask for something. Approach them and you will be surprised to find that they are willing to help you, Nadeesha advised.
Tapping into other areas of illustrations Nadeesha ventured into illustrating for magazines. She pitched her ideas and the magazines swallowed them up. Once she illustrated a whole shoot for a magazine instead of them just carrying pictures of them models donning outfits.
Pitch ideas to people because half the time people are not bothered to think up of ideas. It is so much easier to hand them an idea on a platter, Nadeesha noted adding that she would go through her favourite magazines, note down the editors e mail addresses and e mail some of her work to them.
Nadeesha advices up and coming artists to have a support system of people to help leverage them, market them, and pitch the correct rate they deserve. She had struggled with pricing during her early days and having an agency has helped alleviate this problem.
The good thing about Sri Lanka and New Zealand is that there are many gaps in the field for entrants to make a name for themselves. If you are out there looking for a certain type of work and cannot find it, then that is a good sign. That means that you can be the first person to do that. If you cannot find an agency to represent you, then become that agency. Many more people will seek you then, she said.
According to Nadeesha it takes a lot of confidence to make it as a successful fashion illustrator. Though you develop nerves at the beginning when people are constantly grading your work over your shoulder she says that you would gradually get use to it.
My work keeps me happy and sane! I love the fact that my projects are always different. Drawing keeps me stimulated, creative, and teaches me to see the world a different way. Its like visual therapy, she concluded with a smile.

Sri Lankan woman held in Bangalore for trying to smuggle drugs

In the biggest ever haul of amphetamine byBengaluru CustomsatKempegowda International Airport(KIA), sleuths have recovered 1.64 kg of the contraband worth over Rs 64 lakh from aSri Lankan womanwho was smuggling it in the guise of manure.
 Fathima Azeeka Junaideen, 39, was intercepted in the early hours of Saturday when she was to take a connecting flight to Colombo after landing at KIA on Friday on aJet Airwaysflight from Chennai.
 "Acting on specific information of drugs being smuggled to Colombo through Bengaluru, we carried out detailed checks of passengers travelling to the island nation from here," said an officer attached to the Air Intelligence Unit at KIA.
 While combing Fathima's check-in luggage, the sleuths were surprised to find many green colour sachets of plant manure alongside 48 pairs of sandals. "Fathima, who claimed to be a beautician running a parlour in Colombo, gave unconvincing answers on why she was carrying so much manure. We opened all the packets to find powdered amphetamine laced with a bit of hashish," the officer added.
 A lab test established the 1.64 kg of contraband as amphetamine with traces of hashish. Fathima was a frequent flyer on the Colombo-Chennai sector. The Lankan pleaded ignorance by claiming that she was handed over the packets by an unidentified man in Chennai at the behest of her husband, who, investigators suspect, was orchestrating the drug smuggling from Sri Lanka.
 Fathima was produced before a city magistrate who remanded her in judicial custody.

Survival of the fittest and the harsh spotlight for our experts
The pendulum swings with perfect gusto as we roll out another all inclusive adrenaline happy' rugby weekend in sports mad Sri.
We are islanders thru and thru ..plenty to say and little to do ..especially with the current Singer schools flagship tournament 2017 - still chugging along despite some locked jaw decisions about 13 teams in the fray Huge and consequential questions are being waved at the governing team...with very little practical options available; the rugby community waits with abated breath.
Breathing and more oxygen might be the only way to last the current pace, as the points system and bonus matters including the 1st round, are already got our resident experts ..utterly nervous.
Priority no. 1, no that we are officially Sri Lanka Rugby...and not Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union, what of schools rugby going forward ..Ideally we should in following the parents lead, should be Sri Lanka Schools Rugby
Aloha I hear the faithful exclaim ..what is this ..and in addition to whats currently confusing all the potential ..'Duckworth & Lewis' types crunching numbers in an effort to rescue the association (if that should be our only option).
Ambitions sit well when plans and new directions for 2017 were announced ..naturally if we first get our house and school bus in order...long before mumbling about the grounds, the medical facilities, management staff, the kit and brand partners, all the official process of identifying the home team..all this before we kit up for warm up.
Now the means and organized set for each team..prep mind for match kickoff,...referee checks, rules update, specifics about the scrum and prop instruction...etc etc...mentally demanding by any standard, anywhere in the world. The pressure whatever your level of rugby, is intense and unless well drilled and able to absorb, its pretty intimidating till you get familiar with the warm up and pre game routine ...
Shudders and butterflies at the current stats and figures from the league ...Trinity and Royal, arch rivals even at breathing and anything you can imagine ...are investing big ...both are currently unbeaten and the weeks will add pressure to the mental prep...and reaction time in the middle ..who has the petrol, and will to run it off.....hardest development is to know your own performance level and instinctively, how far you can go past your pain threshold ...basically how far past your point of exhaustion
The warriors step up and stamp their mark on the game ...these are the players that wear the flag and drive their fans nuts ...as Royals skipper Askey what prompted him to drop that famous 3 pointer and bring them home against a marauding Dharmaraja, who were floored by the last min kick and full time ...cant get closer than that!
Trinity are looking the part early season ..hopes are they maintain this pace and momentum all through...watching their willingness to run is inspiring and means the understanding is good, confidence in their skills on the up and the Raikebula influence making the difference.
Wesley are running on pure pride and ra ra petrol that is giving them impact and good gains this first month ..despite the big drop against Trinity ..bouncing back in style against Thomas' and grabbing the shield, much against the run of play.
Peters probably stunned themselves with an absolute stunner against a shell shocked Patana ..15 points in front after 30mins had the fans screaming but Patana, the defending champions struck back in typical green machine pride ..15 all at half time.
The game needed magic in the 2nd half and despite every effort by the green shirts ..plus mistakes ..gave the Bamba brigade and fly half Siva a memorable and welcome back to top form St Peters win ...32:15, on the Saturday just gone.
Royal looked the part and settled early against D S Senanayake and despite some solid tackling from the DS lads, the Reid Avenue storm took it home by 47:7, and coach Malewana with plenty to drill for these debutants in division 1....both in attack and in defence.. I expect them to grow in confidence as experience settles ....and some good hard rugby ahead as the season progresses ...and lots for their friends and family to cheer as they clock in some big yards over the next month.
I rather think its quite an open league title race ..with more at stake than people would willingly admit ..Royal, Trinity and Patana looking sharp ...Peters, Josephs, Thomas, Wesley.... also hungrier and lots to prove.....to themselves and their fans.
Its going to be mighty every weekend ....and lots to breathe in and absorb as you look forward, so best you meditate and ready the brain for performance on a higher level, prepare the mind for massive skills and relentless work rate for pretty much 80mins.
Coaches need to recycle players to save as much of their key players who are pushing dehydration and depletion levels past comfortable for the bench team.. All teams and players must factor in the unforgiving sun and take in plenty of energy for their reserve tanks plus rehydrate max to save their legs.
Playing 80mins at 4.15pm is close to madness than most ..and needs some rational thoughtful medical professionals to explain the fluid and weight loss for these young gladiators ..it also increases risk of impact and odd injuries during the run of play ...so perhaps sensible and much good senses for the stake holders to consider the kick off or play the big uns' under lights
I would prefer to think higher performance and maximum skills with plenty of petrol in the legs to cause mayhem ...worth a thought certainly ...fair
The game needs protection of these warriors and high performance to ensure the thousands of fans to cover their growing economy ..it needs some order to maintain the body and performance at its highest level...so far the teams have managed to limp off the pitch and ice bath or pool recover ..but not all have the luxury ..lets hope sanity prevails and my soap box is heard by a few who matter.
Sri rugby needs to get bigger, better, faster and higher impact performance levels to raise the game beyond expectations.
Big hand to the Sri Womens 7s for grabbing the Borneo 7s Cup and defying the odds in Malaysia at the invitation tournament. Randi Sambu the skipper, Ayesha Perry Perera. the former winger, Tanuja run run Weerakody, Anusha Matate Attanayaka ..enjoying the rewards of professional input over 3 months and hopefully more impact on the Asian circuit starting next month.
Coach Sudath Sampath, our own Serevi junior during our days for Sri ..winning in style and grand to bring some silver home from their first trip.
Bula bula Sri islanders and proud rugby hearts ..cheers.

UK commends measures taken by Lanka
The United Kingdom during the Interactive Dialogue on Sri Lanka at the 34th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council yesterday said it commends several steps taken by the Government of Sri Lanka since January 2015 to improve the human rights situation in Sri Lanka.
We welcome the High Commissioners report. We join the High Commissioner in recognising the steps taken by the Government of Sri Lanka since January 2015 to improve the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, in particular the restoration of important democratic checks and balances, improvements in respect for freedoms of expression and movement, the return of some military-held land, the passing of legislation to establish an Office for Missing Persons, the ratification of the Convention on Enforced Disappearances and the initiation of a process of constitutional reform. We commend these measures, the UK said. The UK representative said that however, as the High Commissioners report clearly states, much remains to be done.
We urge the Government of Sri Lanka to provide the determined leadership required to deliver fully on the commitments it made when co-sponsoring resolution 30/01 and to develop a comprehensive and time bound implementation strategy. In particular, we encourage the Government to deliver meaningful devolution through constitutional reform, establish credible transitional justice mechanisms, return all remaining military-held private land and replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act with human rights compliant legislation, he added.
The UK also commend the work of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms and encouraged the Sri Lankan government to give due consideration to its recommendations.
Bringing about reconciliation and the conditions for lasting peace in Sri Lanka will require a concerted effort from all parties. The UK will continue to support and encourage the Sri Lankan government to this end, he added.

UK inflation rate leaps to 2.3%
Rising fuel and food prices helped to push last month's inflation rate to the highest since September 2013.
Inflation as measured by the Office for National Statistics Consumer Prices Index (CPI) jumped to 2.3% in February - up from 1.8% in January.
The increase has pushed the rate above the Bank of England's 2% target.
Food prices recorded their first annual increase for more than two-and-a-half years, standing 0.3% higher in February than a year earlier. The Bank of England has said it expects inflation will peak at 2.8% next year, although some economists think the rate could rise above 3%.
DON'T PANIC are the words that will be written across the Bank of England's next inflation report, in large friendly letters. Well, maybe not, but the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, said pretty much the same when he was quizzed over today's jump in inflation. Actually, what he said was, Look - single data point, you never overreact to a single data point, but then he is a central banker and not the author of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
It does, however, amount to much the same thing. The Bank of England is not going to be panicked into increasing interest rates to try to control price rises just because of one month's figures. But that doesn't mean they aren't important.

Dr.De silva said that Sri Lanka will be co-sponsoring the Resolution, and thanked the Council, the UN, and the bilateral partners for their support to strengthen reconciliation in Sri Lanka, and for the extension of the timeline.
 We are especially appreciative that the Council, in recognition of the firm commitment of the National Unity Government to the process of reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, endorsed the proposals made by the Government in 2015, for credible Government of Sri Lanka-led processes embodied in Resolution 30/1 he added..
He made these observations following the Presentation of the Report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka.
Dr.De Silva went on to say With the help of all our citizens in all walks of life, our friends and partners in the international community, and Sri Lankans overseas; with patience, understanding, and constant and consistent effort and perseverance; we strongly believe that we can make the reconciliation process a success, and establish a progressive and united society, working in harmony to take our nation towards new heights of socio-economic development.

As we go through the complex process of establishing new mechanisms, we are considering the Report of the Consultation Task Force, and we will continue to consult with all segments of our society. We will also seek international expertise and assistance, as all countries do, when they undertake such responsibilities he added.
He also requested the support of all Council Members and Observers to help Sri Lanka succeed in this transformative and challenging agenda that it has undertaken, including economic development, that plays an important role in ensuring the success of the reconciliation agenda.

Wimals farce revisited
Joint Opposition and MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena, after a weeks enforced vacation from parliament, had apparently begun from where he left off when he was given marching orders to leave the House, by the Speaker, during the last sitting day. On that occasion, what got Gunawardena into trouble was his vociferous defence of colleague Wimal Weerawansa, who is now serving a stint at the state lodge. Gunawardena was insistent that WW be granted his request to function as an independent MP, severing links with the UPFA- a request the Speaker rejected as irregular. It was the shindig raised by DG on the Speakers ruling that got him thrown out of parliament for one week.
On Tuesday, fresh from his enforced vacation, Gunawardena, this time though, went on a different tangent but with the same intention of defending, nay, coming to the rescue of his beleaguered colleague. The JO stalwart, rising to his feet in parliament, called on the Speaker to look into the possibility of MPs being incarcerated granted bail, since they could not serve their constituents who elected them to parliament by continuing to remain behind bars. Though, Gunawardena did not mention Weerawansa by name it was clear to whom he was referring to. The Speaker, for his part promised to look into matter and see what could be done.
True, the Speaker is the custodian of parliament, and, by extension, is bound to look after interests of all its members. But we are here not certain of the propriety of the Speaker to get involved in something that is well outside his remit. Weerawansa had been charged under the Public Property Act for misappropriating government vehicles and causing a loss to the state to the tune of Rs. 90 million. The MP had challenged the Magistrates court order refusing him bail and subsequently the High Court too held with the Magistrate and struck down Weerawansas appeal for bail. In doing so the HC held that there is no exceptional circumstances warranting the MP being released on bail at this juncture.
It was no coincidence Gunawardena raising the matter hardly 24 hours after Weerawansa was denied bail for a second time. How Speaker Jayasuriya can now intervene on behalf of the MP by pledging to look into the matter is unclear. By making an attempt to do so the Speaker will no doubt be letting himself open to the accusation of interfering into judicial matters, an accusation the JO takes delight in making against the government. On the other hand, no such request for bail was made by Dinesh Gunawardena or any of the JO members when one of their own colleagues, Ratnapura District MP, Premalal Gunasekera was languishing behind bars for close to one year. Are some JO members more equal than others in the eyes of Dinesh Gunawardena and his ilk
But lo and behold, hardly had this plea for bail made by DG, Weerawansa, as is his wont, commences a death fast in his remand cell, seeking his release. It is not clear if this is being done to hasten the Speakers hand or another gimmick reminiscent of the death farce of the MP opposite the UN compound, not many moons ago. On that occasion, as the whole country was to witness over Live Television, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa played the Good Samaritan and came to venue to offer life giving water to the dying man after mounting the make shift stage whereon our hero was lying, never mind the stories that he was being constantly fortified by Lemon Puff, during the long vigil. One could have expected a replay of the same scenario, only this time our protagonists are handicapped not been able to receive the benefit of Live Television coverage.
Are Wimal Weerawansa and those of the JO who mooted this idea really going to make the public believe that the MP really means business this time around and that the death fast would continue to its logical conclusion It is no secret that Weerawansa had amassed considerable wealth during his time as Minister in the Rajapaksa government, his assets said to include luxury mansions and even a garment factory. Isnt it stretching the credulity of the public to the limits to imagine that Weerawansa is going to jettison all these worldly possessions of his and take his own life just because the courts have refused to grant him bail
Hopefully the Weerawansa high jinx will not start a chain reaction, where other prisoners too start death fasts. The MP will do well to fight his case to the end and face the consequences like all the rest of them. As a self proclaimed socialist, and a patriot, he should set an example by practising what he preaches and stick to the doctrine of equality to all. He cannot be more equal than those who are languishing behind bars for years, including members of the Sangha, who the likes of Weerawansa and the rest of the JO like to identify with.

Wimal on hunger strike in remand prison
National Freedom Front leader and MP, Wimal Weerawansa had commenced a hunger strike in prison, protesting against the rejection of his bail application, it is reported.
According to Prison Department sources Weerawansa started the hunger strike yesterday morning claiming that he had been kept in remand prison for 74 days without being released on bail. However, it has also been reported that several members of the Joint Opposition (JO) who visited Weerawansa yesterday have instructed Weerawansa to give up the hunger strike as the case is before courts.
They had prevailed upon Weerawansa to give up the hunger strike since it is inappropriate to launch a protest against a court decision.
According to Prisons Spokesperson Thushara Upuldeniya ,Weerawansa has been engaging in the protest fast refusing meals since last morning.
The MP , who is in remand prison, after being arrested on charges of misusing state vehicles, was further remanded till April 3, following the rejection of his bail application by the High Court.
He was arrested by the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) on January 10 when he arrived to give a statement pertaining to allegations of misusing state vehicles.
A few years ago, he launched a hunger strike against Ban Ki-Moon, the then United Nations Human Rights Commission chief , opposite the UN compound in Colombo . However, he gave up that protest when he received a glass of king coconut water from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Wounds of Healing: An Easter Chorale Reflection
The Prestantia Chorale in collaboration with Chraft (Christian Arts Foundation) will present Wounds of Healing, a choral reflection for the fourth consecutive year to celebrate the Lent and Easter season. The program will be held at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour, Colombo 7, on Sunday, April 2 at 7pm. The music is directed by Dr. Priyeshni Peiris Perera and the original script is adapted from Steve Moores narrative based on the human struggle of Thomas refusal to believe and experience the inner healing which comes through Christ.
The chorale wishes to raise funds through a Free will love offering for the Deaf and Blind School in Rathmalana.
As in the past years, this event is free and open to both young and old with an interest in music. The Prestantia Chorale promises an evening of reflective, spirit-filled choral music to celebrate the season as witnessed in the past years by attendees.
At present, the choir consists twenty two passionate singers who devote their precious time to sing in four-part (SATB) with the Prestantia Chorale. They are Pavithra Madapatha, Ranthilini Fernando, Sudarshi Nonis, Sunara Ranasinghe, Praveeni Fernando, Prashanthi Perera, Privanka Fonseka, (Dr) Amal Shehan Perera, Janaka Fernando, Melantha Fernando, Wasantha Kumara Geekiyanage, (Rev)Upul Fernando, Shavan De Mel,Pabasara Jayarathne, Tharaka Peiris, Dave Fernando and Shamal Fernando, Michelle Refuge, Sanduni Perera, (Dr) Sanuri Pandikorala and Siroshni Illangage,. The group consists professional and amateur musicians who areBankers, Medical Doctors, Lawyers, Clergy, Software Engineers and Music Practitioners by profession.
The Prestantia Chorale has performed at Church Services, Weddings, and on National Television and the MTV Good Morning Show at various occasions. The presentations of Easter Musicals such as The Borrowed Tomb by David Clydesdale (2014 & 2015) and On Wings of Angels (2016) by Dhanan Senathirajah has functioned as musical underpinnings of Prestantia Chorales evolution as a leading choir in the country. The highlight for the Chorale was the presentation of the National Anthem sung SATB in both Sinhala and Tamil languages probably for the first time in Sri Lanka in 2015 to an original SATB arrangement by Dr. Priyeshni P. Perera.
The chorale has appeared as invited guest performers at thePrestantiaMusica2014 & 2015,the Throne of Praise and The Priests in Concert atthe Holy Emmanuel Church among others. Subsequently upon requests that were made, the musicals were re-presented at the Methodist Churches as fundraisers.
Wounds of Healing plays a prominent role towards communicating a variety of emotions through songs ranging from Classical to Contemporary Repertoire.With the energetic and lush choral harmonies of Thomas Rutter, David Clydesdale, Steve Townsend and Keith Getty and selections from The Messiah by G.F.Handel combined with the creative writing abilities of Steve Moore, this Easter musical dramatically portrays the story of Christs death and resurrection through the eyes of three symbolic characters namely Thomas, Peter, and Mary Magdalene.
The audience will experience the emotions of how the death and resurrection of Jesus affected their lives. It will portray the inner tensions the disciples walked through during this period because of their expectation of a king to heal their wounds, the self-inflicted emotional turmoil behind Peters denial of Jesus, and the doubt that Thomas had to overcome to be ultimately healed through the resurrection of Jesus.
The Junior Choir of the Prestantia Music School will join-in with the Chorale this year too.
The instrumental ensemble will consist of (Dr.) Priyeshni P. Perera(Piano), Christopher Prins (Drums), Nimalka Marian (Keyboard Synthesizer), Saranga Cooray (Cello,) Sachiththa Fernando (Violin) and Tironi Rathnayake (Flute).

Zeid acknowledges positive advances : Still insists on Hybrid Court
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein yesterday acknowledges some positive advances on human rights and Constitutional reform in Sri Lanka.
Issuing a report on Sri Lanka pursuant to Council resolution 30/1 at the UN Human Rights Council 34th Session in Geneva Zeid Raad Al Hussein noted I welcome the constructive engagement of the Government with my Office. We have continued to provide technical assistance through our presence in Sri Lanka, complemented by frequent expert missions and support by the United Nations Peace building Fund. Five Special Procedures mechanisms visited Sri Lanka to address enforced disappearances, transitional justice, torture, the independence of judges and lawyers, and protection of minorities.
He also went on to say that, four treaty bodies reviewed Sri Lankas progress in implementing treaty obligations, and had made detailed recommendations regarding racial discrimination, migrant workers, torture and discrimination against women.
I note promising progress regarding constitutional reform, with the Parliament establishing itself as a constitutional assembly. Inclusive public consultations conducted by the Public Representations Committee were followed in November by reports from six subcommittees appointed by the Constitutional Assembly to make recommendations regarding fundamental rights, the judiciary, finance, law and order, public service and centre-periphery relations. But these reports have not yet received adequate consideration he observed.
The High Commissioner said although progress to establish transitional justice mechanisms has been slow, he was heartened by the recent report of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms, synthesising thousands of submissions from across all ethnic and religious groups.
I urge the Government to embrace and make the broadest possible use of the report, following its inclusive and thoughtful consultations. What is needed now is agreement on a comprehensive strategy, with a time-line and detailed benchmarks, to address all the transitional justice pillars identified in Resolution 30/1  which as the Foreign Minister recently reminded us, was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka he added.
The High Commissioner also commended Sri Lankas ratifications of the Convention on Enforced Disappearances and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as significant steps forward.
 They now require rapid integration into domestic law, in accordance with international standards. Following last years legislation to set up an Office of Missing Persons, I recommend that there be swift progress in establishing this body, which could play a crucial role in resolving enforced disappearances he added. Also the High Commissioner noted that in the face of rising frustration among victims, a number of confidence-building measures must be accelerated.
These include the release of land occupied by the military, which remains slow. While an effort is underway to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with legislation that complies with international human rights law, this work has yet to be concluded. Numerous pending cases under the Prevention of Terrorism Act have not yet been resolved. It will also be essential to effectively operationalise an appropriate vetting procedure  including an independent, civilian human rights component  in advance of any future deployment of military and police personnel to UN peacekeeping missions he explained. While noting that the design of truth and reparations processes appear to be underway, he said that but these efforts need to be in consultation with the victims and civil society. It is important for the countrys future to send the signal that impunity is no longer tolerated
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that he was particularly troubled by the lack of progress in a number of emblematic cases.
The consistent failure to effectively investigate, prosecute and punish serious crimes appears to reflect a broader reluctance or fear to take action against members of the security forces. Combined with a general lack of trust in the impartiality of the justice system regarding past violations, this continuing unwillingness or inability to address impunity reinforces the need for international participation in a judicial mechanism. For this to be credible, it should include a special counsel, foreign judges and defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators. The National Consultations also identified international participation as a way to gain the trust of the victims he added. He also welcomed a number of Presidential directives with regard to some aspects of detention.
However, cases of torture, excessive use of force and failure to respect due process continue to be reported. There is clearly a need for unequivocal instructions to all branches of the security forces that any such conduct is unacceptable and that abuses will be punished. Ensuring that detainees have unrestricted and prompt access to counsel from the moment of arrest will help mitigate the risk of torture he added.
