FDI is increasingly active in SL construction sector
Sri Lankas construction sector is increasingly played by foreign investments (FDI), rather than locally generated funds. The sectors annual output value is now totalling to $3 Bn without even counting values of such mega projects as the Colombo Port City or Hambantota Port constructions, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
He was addressing the gathering at the launch of the seventh construction industry exhibition, Construction Expo 2018 held at BMICH on June 29.
Sri Lankan construction sector has become increasingly responsive to our FDI flows, the Minister said.
Sri Lankas premier construction exhibition brings together local, international suppliers and service organisations in the building, construction, engineering and architecture industries. It is a collaborative efforts of Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (Pvt.) Limited and Ceylon Institute of Builders 9CIOB). It ends on July 1.Green building is a major theme at this years expo. Over 240 local and international vendors, including 20 Indian companies by the Export Promotion Council of India (at India Pavilion) and 30 Chinese firms in the Chinese pavilion (mostly from Liaoning Province- Chinas industrial and steel province) are displaying a wide spectrum of construction products, services and information for the local construction sector.
A China Liaoning Sri Lanka Business Forum was also held on the sidelines of the expo opening at BMICH on June 29.
Liaoning Province Commerce Department Section Chief Qyu Wanliang addressing the Forum said Sri Lanka is an important stopover of Chinas One Belt One Road (OBOR) and an important trade partner of China. Liaoning-Sri Lanka total trade in the first five months of this year was US $51 Million. Liaoning Province believes it has opportunities to partner with Sri Lankas economy which is growing steadily, he said.
Though Sri Lankas construction sector declined somewhat in the first three months of this year by 5 per cent, it still has an important place in our economy at 7.4 per cent in our GDP, Minister Bathiudeen said
:This is a larger share than our agricultural sector. More importantly this sector has increasingly become responsive to our FDI flows. The sector grew by 6.6 per cent in 2014 but thereafter, slowed down recently, syncing with somewhat weaker FDI inflow to Sri Lanka. The Construction Expo 2018 will therefore be a great step and in fact the much needed promotional effort that this sector urgently calls for. I commend the organisers and all the stakeholders for their commitment in highlighting our construction sectors capacities to the international, local participants and visitors especially at a time when such an event is really needed to uplift it, the Minister said.
Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIoB) President Dr. Rohan Karunarathna said the CIOB has given a new lease of life to the Sri Lanka construction sector. It has become very competitive due to foreign contractors. At present almost 40 per cent of Sri Lankan construction projects have been taken up by Chinese firms. The China International Contractors Association (CHINCA) is bidding and winning them. These projects are other projects apart from the Port City and the Hambantota Port area related projects. In the next three years, CHINCA wants to increase their stake in Sri Lankan construction industry to 70 per cent of total projects. This can be detrimental to our local firms. As a result, the Construction Chamber of Sri Lanka has signed an MoU with CHINCA to share all their projects here with Lankan construction firms, so that the risk is mitigated. We have also moved a cabinet paper-all such projects by foreign firms from any country should have a Sri Lankan partner from now on, he said.
CIoBs Dr. Karunarathna said the total output value of Sri Lankan construction industry in 2017 is now estimated at $3.03 Bn (SL Rs 480 Billion).

Many schoolchildren addicted to narcotics
Many schoolchildren use narcotics and many of them are addicts, National Dangerous Drug Control Board (NDDCB) Chairman Prof. Saman Abeysinghe said.
He was addressing the gathering at the launching ceremony of the National Week for Drug Prevention (June 26 to July 2) in the Southern Province held concurrent to the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on June 26, at the Galle Four Gravets Divisional Secretariat Auditorium on Thursday.
Tri-force officials, officials of the Police, Health, Excise, Prisons and Education Departments, Galle District Secretariat and Divisional Secretariats participated.
"Many individuals get addicted to drugs through deception. Criminals influence the younger generation to use drugs. Therefore, parents should guide their children away from this menace. They should not be over confident that their children would not go wrong. They should be highly observant over the bahviuors and lifestyles of their children," NDDCB Chairman said.
"President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe try their best to eradicate the drug menace. It is a national tragedy now. The Presidential Secretariat provide their full support to make the National Week for Drug Prevention a success. The President has established a Presidential Task Force to ensure a country free of intoxicants. Excise, Prisons, Education, Police and Health Departments and Tri-forces contribute outstandingly towards eradicating the usage of narcotics. All State agencies work together according to a common agenda to eradicate drug abuse," Prof. Abeysinghe said.
"Galle, Colombo and Moneragala will be main cities of the programme.We have a special plan to establish anti-drug committees throughout the country in Grama Seva Niladari Divisions. Grama Niladaris, Samurdhi Officers and Agricultural Research Production Assistants will join this endeavour. The circulars in this regard were already issued by the Presidents Secretary," the Chairman said.
A informative programme will be launched throughout the country to educate the public about the menace and preventive methods. Government institutions and departments will support the initiative, he said.
Galle DIG Chandana Alahakoon, Assistant Divisional Secretary Chatura Mihindukula and several other officials spoke.

Sri Lanka turning to upper-middle income country
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna yesterday said the government has started a number of programmes including the Enterprise Sri Lanka Loan Scheme to help Sri Lankas transition to an upper middle income country.
He was addressing a media briefing held at the UNP Headquarters Siri Kotha yesterday.
The MP said the World Bank Sri Lankas new development update released recently has praised the countrys economic growth.
The report mentioned that the country is already marching towards the Upper-Middle-Income status and more and better jobs hinge on the economys competitiveness and its ability to pursue a private sector-led growth model.
The WB update said that for the first time in decades, Sri Lankas fiscal revenue exceeded expenditures excluding interest payments, leading to a primary fiscal surplus. This is the significant growth achieved by us, he said.
We were given a debt-ridden country by the former government. But we have somehow managed to overcome these obstacles while providing benefits of the economic growth to the people, the MP said.
Official reserves have too increased making stronger the Treasury. The governments aim is to strengthen enterprises and build a strong economy and create job opportunities, he said.

Ageless Federer targets title number nine
LONDON, Friday - Roger Federer is already the most prolific and oldest winner of the Wimbledon mens singles title but when he saunters into the All England Club on Monday he will do so as favourite to lift the trophy for a ninth time.
The seemingly ageless Swiss, who turn 37 in August, has planned his year around defending the title he claimed last year by beating Croatias Marin Cilic.
If anything Federers 2017 Wimbledon fortnight was the most impressive of his career as he swept through the draw without losing a set for the first time  ending a five year wait to nudge ahead of Pete Sampras on the all-time list.
Nothing that has happened in the past 12 months suggests Federers hunger is diminished with victory at this years Australian Open taking his Grand Slam title haul to 20. He skipped the claycourt season which was against dominated by his great rival Rafael Nadal who earlier this month won the French Open for an 11th time to move to within three of Federers record Grand Slam tally. Federer returned to the grasscourts in Germany, winning the title in Stuttgart before reaching the Halle final this month where he was surprisingly beaten by Croatian Borna Coric.
While Corics victory offers some encouragement for the rest of the field, Federer will not have dwelled on it. After all, he lost to veteran German Tommy Haas in the build-up to last years Wimbledon but was untouchable once he arrived in his favourite English country garden.- Agencies

Appoint Presidential Commission to probe New York Times report on MR Election campaign- Ven Amila
Puravesi Sanvidhana Ekamuthuwa Co-convener Ven.Dambara Amila Thera yesterday said a Presidential Commission should be appointed to investigate into revelations made in the New York Times report which suggested that a Chinese company funded former President Mahinda Rajapaksas election campaign.
The Thera said a Parliamentary debate should be held to discuss the facts revealed in the New York Times report and the debate should be telecast live on media.
Addressing a press conference at the CSR yesterday, Ven.Amila Thera said the news report suggested that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had betrayed the country after Don Juan Dharmapala.
Rajapaksa betrayed the country for the second time by granting the outright ownership of the land in which Sri Lanka Army headquarters was located to China and this plot of land no longer belonged to us, he said.
The Thera said that the country had no control over the land in which work on the Port City development project is in progress. The Thera said the former President had violated election laws by allegedly acquiring funds from China, while the Chinese Government should make a statement over the revelations made by New York Times. No country should be allowed to abuse Sri Lankas independence and sovereignty.
A fully fledged Presidential Commission should investigate into these allegations.The former President should submit an affidavit in this regard, the Thera stressed. The taxes have increased because of the previous governments illegal and irresponsible activities.The poor tax payers in the country have to bear the brunt of the financial blunders of the previous regime, the Thera said.

[Appreciation]
Somaweera Senanayaka, a literary and media genius
It is with profound sorrow that I write an appreciation of a simple, but great personage, who left this world on June 9, 2018. His parting is a loss of a Kalyana Mitta, a congenial companion to me.
Many articles were written about him in almost all newspapers and portrayed in the electronic media illuminating vivid achievements of this personality. His contributions as a journalist, short story writer, teledrama and film script writer, editor of newspapers and magazines and as a novelist are a testimony to his versatility.
The distinction of his writings were for people of all walks of life mainly focusing the society, from children to adults guiding them in the right path with his deep knowledge in the Buddhist way of life inherited from his father and grandfather.
One interesting incident in is life is that at the tender age, he was trained to carry the 'Jathaka Poth Vahanse, the story book of past births of the Buddha on his head clasping the same with both hands in a difficult terrain to the Temple.
It was duty of young Somaweera to recite the stories aloud to the village folk men, women young and old who gathered at the temple to listen to his recitals in a loud and melodious voice. This devotion and dedication he evinced for Buddhism from his young days blossomed into full stature until his demise.
One of the main themes in his writings were to bring some morals to families and mend the disintegrated families for harmonious living.
The Doo Daruwo teledrama and Eka Gei Minissu, the latest short teledrama where he highlighted the role of a mother who strived hard to raise the family, where children were preoccupied with their own obsessions.
Although he earned many accolades and encomiums at prestigious audiences, he never lost his touch with the Welfare, Educational, Cultural and Religious activities of the locality which he adopted for living.
Being a distinguished member of the Boralesgamuwa Welfare Society formed over three decades ago, the Senanayaka name as a house hold name of fame with highlights in the press and electronic media regarding the teledramas and films produced by him, was boost to society.
Somaweera Senenayaka as a mentor helped to compile a book about the village of Boralesgamuwa.
Boralesgamuwa Udanaya was produced with his able guidance under a pool of resourceful academic achievers like Prof. W. N. Wilson of the University of Colombo, educationist W. B. P. Boteju and a host of other professionals who adorn Boralesgamuwa.
Being encouraged with the launch of Boralesgamuwa Udanaya and the response received, another book to highlight the transformation of Boralesgamuwa to the present day Urban status was tasked to Prof. Wilson to edit the Pibidena Boralesgamuwa with the acumen of Senanayaka always at his disposal.
Senanayaka always referred to Boralesgamuwa as Pathirupa Desa, a congenial place to live in. It may be that a person with a fascination for people and for the natural, historical and religious places like Bellanvila Raja Maha Viharaya Pepiliyana Sunethra Maha Devi Raja Maha Pirivena and Vapikarama temple, I together the charm of the lakes, Weras Ganga, the Attidiya Birds Sanctuary would have conceived in his mind to come to this view. It is also a complement of the highest respect a person of his caliber can bestow on a place where he chose to adopt for living.
His services to schoolchildren specially in the area where teenagers who relished to listen to his talks delivered in his inimitable style captivating their attention spoke volumes of his ability at addressing people at large, apart from his prowess in writing.
Until his demise he closely associated with the Vapikarama, a temple by the lake and he compiled an academic digest called Weva Thera Saasadu Ananda, an eulogy of Ven Ponnilawa Rathanapala Thera, Viharadhikari of Vapikaramaya Temple who dedicate with untiring sacrifice to educate and bring up nearly 30 Samanera bhikkus with able assistance of few young Upasampada Bikkus.
Senanayaka frequently attended the Dayaka Sabha meetings in which he was the Lay Patron.
I recall with grief the irreparable loss to our Cultural and Educational Foundation in which he was the first Lay Patron. Late Ven Prof. Bellanvila Wimalaratna Thera was the Clergy Patron of the Foundation and was a beacon of light to our foundation until his passing away.
I console that he took life in good spirit with his unshaken faith of impermanence of all Sanskara Dathu all living beings and thing as preached by the Buddha.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of
Nirvana!
- N. D. de Silva,Patron, Boralesgamuwa Educational and Cultural Foundation.

Belgium pip England to top spot as Japan sneak into World Cup last 16
KALININGRAD, Thursday - Belgium beat England to top spot in their World Cup group on Thursday after Japan sneaked into the knockout phase on the back of their superior disciplinary record.
The 1-0 win for Roberto Martinezs much-changed team in Kaliningrad earns a second-round tie against Japan while England have a trickier-looking match against Colombia.
But the result also means Gareth Southgates young side avoid the top half of the draw in Russia, which contains heavyweights France, Argentina, Portugal and Brazil.
The two managers made a combined 17 changes to their starting line-ups, with World Cup top-scorer Harry Kane missing for England and Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne all absent from Belgiums team.
Former Manchester United forward Adnan Januzaj made the difference, curling a superb shot past the outstretched hands of Jordan Pickford in the 51st minute.
Belgiums Martinez was delighted with the win, saying it was impossible to plan the ideal scenario as the World Cup unfolds.
In the other match in Group G, Tunisia notched their first win at a World Cup for 40 years, beating debutants Panama 2-1 to leave Russia on a high.
The Belgium win capped a strange last day of the group stages in Russia after Colombia earlier qualified top of Group H, with Japan joining them in the knockout phase despite a 1-0 defeat to Poland in Volgograd.- AFP

Boost for domestic aviation
If you take a cursory glance at most major cities in the world, one thing stands out: they are transport hubs with at least two international airports. From Dubai to Istanbul, many cities have two airports while cities such as Moscow and London have four or more airports.
Sri Lankas main (and to all intents and purposes the only) international airport is the Bandaranaike International (BIA, IATA Code CMB), which was opened in the late 1960s. The other international airport at Mattala is largely non-functional, after the withdrawal of the last international carrier (Flydubai) which called there. That leaves us with the rather interesting option of Ratmalana, which goes by the IATA Code RML.
Ratmalana, a former RAF base, was in fact the countrys sole international airport until the BIA was commissioned. But as bigger jets such as the Boeing 747-400 entered service, Ratmalana did not have the runway length (just 1,800 metres) or the facilities to accommodate them. Hence the decision to move all commercial jet operations to BIA.
But one cannot undermine one simple fact  Ratmalana is just 15 Km away from Colombo, whereas the BIA is 35 Km away, though the Katunayake Expressway has reduced travel times. With the BIA bursting at the seams, attention has once again shifted to Ratmalana  and to the question whether at least some international operations can resume there. True, the BIA is undergoing a massive expansion that will enable it to process more than 15 million passengers per year, but given the exponential growth in tourism and the rising demand from airlines even this may not be enough.
It is in this context we welcome the good news that the Ratmalana Airport is poised to undergo a major expansion. According to Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Government has received an additional 25 acres of land in the Ratmalana airport from the Sri Lanka Air Force, which had facilities adjacent to the civilian airport. But even this step will not fully solve the problem of helping the private entrepreneurs who want to come into the Ratmalana Airport to commence aviation related businesses. The Government is also installing the latest navigation equipment at a cost of Rs.1 billion.
These are commendable steps, but the authorities should also explore the possibility of extending the runway to accommodate short and medium range jets that can fly to domestic and regional destinations from Ratmalana. Actually, even the present runway can accommodate 100 seater commercial jetliners like the Bombardier CS100. There was talk of creating an underpass to replace the Galle Road near the airport and extending the runway, but we do not know what happened to this plan. Another obstacle is that unlike the BIA Ratmalana Airport is located in a heavily built up residential area subject to noise regulations. Most airports get around this by prohibiting night operations, but there is another option - a total no to the bigger jets (business jets, currently the bread and butter of RML, should have no problem) and permitting only regional turboprops such as the Q400 and ATR 72 to operate. One prime example for this arrangement is the Billy Bishop International Airport in the heart of Toronto, Canada. With a maximum range of around 2,000 Km, these planes are ideal for regional and domestic operations.
As one of the leading tourism destinations, Sri Lanka should have a much better domestic flight network. Right now, there are only a very few companies in this business, which enjoy a virtual monopoly or duopoly. However, the Government has since opened up the sector and more companies have expressed a willingness to begin domestic flights. There should be a much bigger selection of cheaper domestic flights to choose from. This will be a major impetus for tourism and investment. In fact, even developing countries much smaller (and poorer) than Sri Lanka have vastly superior domestic flight networks. Since these countries are our tourism and investment competitors, we must catch up without delay.
This cannot be accomplished without an equally good domestic airport network. There should be domestic connecting flights from the BIA and Ratmalana that should take the lead in all other domestic operations. The Batticaloa airport has now been converted to a fully-fledged civilian airport and Hingurakgoda, Palali and many other airports are in the process of being transformed into completely civil international standard airports. This is a step in the right direction. We also need more flying schools given the projected pilot shortage in the next few decades. Mattala cannot be allowed to lie idle  it should be equipped with world-class MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) facilities to attract regional airliners for their repair needs.
The country is entering a new era of development and in view of the large tourist influx and the inflow of investors, the aviation industry needs to flourish. As the Transport Minister points out, internal flight services, airports and allied services must undergo rapid development to meet these objectives. A robust aviation industry is essential for the countrys development over the next few decades.

Climate change will affect four million in Sri Lanka by 2020: World Bank
The World Bank issued a special report on Thursday entitled, South Asias Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living Standards, and warned that 800 million people in South Asia will be seriously affected by climate change by 2050.
South Asias Hotspots adds to a body of knowledge that has previously looked at the consequences of extreme eventsdroughts, floods, heat waves, storm surges, and rising sea-levelsand the authors investigated the way that climate change effects South Asians living standards.
The survey painted two scenarios for the global future of climate change: one in which collective action is taken to limit greenhouse gases, a climate-sensitive scenario, and another in which no action is taken to limit carbon emissions, a carbon-intensive scenario. It found that higher temperatures reduce average living standards in most of South Asia.
The study examined temperatures on a detailed, spatial level, and concluded that within Sri Lanka, the 3.9 million people living in the countrys northern and northwestern provinces are the most severely at risk to climate impact.
For the first time, the World Bank study linked extensive household surveys with daily temperature fluctuations to offer a glimpse of the worsening standards of living in South Asian hotspots, and found a connection between poorer communities and greater climate impact. Ultimately, the effects of climate change will serve to accentuate poverty and inequality.
The authors repeated a familiar piece of advice: in order to adapt to exceptional climate vulnerability, South Asian countries will have to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases.
The survey also pointed out that inclusive economic growth will help mitigate the negative effects of climate change.

Corporation will streamline film distribution - Minister
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the film distribution process should be carried out by the National Film Corporation (NFC) again so as to streamline the film industry.
The Minister said that film distribution process had faced many issues with irregularities in the film distribution process, which was undertaken by four private companies from 2000.
The four private companies had been assigned for film distribution by the Film Corporation violating the Film Corporation Act of 1970 in 2000.
As the result of irregularities in the film distribution process, 74 Cinema halls had been shut down by now.
Moreover those companies do not spend a single rupee for the betterment of the film industry even though those distribution companies collect 10 per cent of the revenue from each film.
According to Film Corporation estimates, Rs 200 to 300 million is earned annually by those companies, that are engaged in film distribution.
The Minister said that it is needed to end the monopoly of these companies to protect the film industry from falling bankrupt.
When the Minister was asked how the Film Corporation is going to end the film distribution monopoly, he said a proper mechanism will be formed with the participation of the all stakeholders in the film industry such as directors, producers, artistes, film hall owners and other stakeholders.
The proposed mechanism will be put into practice and then there may be an impartial and a just film distribution process.
It is important to take the mantle of film distribution again to the National Film Corporation or else it is hard for the film industry to survive, the Minister said.
Minister Rajapaksha added that legal action will be taken in this regard in due course to get the film distribution process back to the Film Corporation.

Europes migrant crisis
Ever since the fall of the Belin Wall in 1989 Europe has seen a continuous influx of migrants. The open border policy of the European Union was an incentive for the immigrants. According to law immigrants seeking asylum should apply to the first country they enter but many wish to move on to more developed or economically well off countries before applying.
The first crisis situation developed in 2015 when 1,257,000 applied. It was more than double the 2014 figure of 562, 700. This was the highest since the end of the Second World War. The figure was a little lower in 2017. It was only 1,204,300.
Of the migrants majority were Syrians. According to Eurostat, the official statistics agency of the European Union, in 2016 they numbered 334,000. Next came the Afghans, numbering 183,000. Iraqi immigrants were 127,000. Together they comprised more than half the total number of immigrants. These immigrants were fleeing from the war or violent conflict zones. Many perished in crossing the Mediterranean ocean. International Organization for Migration (IOM) states that more than 1,000 perished in 2016 alone. There is big scale trafficking in persons by organised groups, who benefit out of the plight of the displaced persons.
Of EU countries Germany received the highest number of applications seeking asylum. It received 8,789 applications per 1 million of its population. Slovakia received the lowest number  18 per 1 million population. France received 10 %, Italy 6%, Greece 4%, Britain 3% and Austria 3% respectively. The large influx of immigrants amidst deteriorating living conditions of the European Union has caused a huge political problem. Nationalist and far right political parties have made headway during elections giving rise to ears about a resurgence of fascism. Germany has been the most liberal in accommodating the migrants but Angela Merkels party had suffered heavy losses because of it.
Germany could not form a new Government for several months after the elections because differences over migrant policy prevented a coalition agreement until Angela Merkel agreed to limit migration.
A European Summit on Migration this week may find it difficult to come to any agreement.
While Germany, France and Spain seek a common solution within the EU framework Italy is unlikely to agree. Poland, Czech Republic and Slovenia have also refused to consider any agreement on taking refugees.
UN summons anti-terrorism Conference
The first-ever United Nations High-level Conference on Counter-Terrorism has been summoned this week in New York by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
Heads of national counter-terrorism agencies and representatives from international institutions and civil society will discuss how to improve international cooperation and build new partnerships.
According to the UNSG, the conference will focus on four key areas. First, it will consider how governments, security agencies and law enforcement bodies can improve the exchange of critical information and strategies to detect disrupt and prosecute terrorist networks. Second, the conference will discuss how the United Nations can do more to assist countries around the world affected by terrorism.
Third, it will address the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. With the military defeat of ISIL in Syria and Iraq, large numbers of these ideologically-driven mercenaries are relocating to other theatres of conflict or returning home, passing on their battlefield expertise, recruiting new followers and planning further attacks.
Fourth, I intend the conference to focus on how we can prevent terrorism and violent extremism. Improved security will never be enough. We need to address the underlying conditions that make people susceptible to toxic ideologies.
The UNSG also notes that terrorism is a transnational threat that cannot be defeated by any single government or organisation. It needs a concerted multilateral response at global, regional and national levels. It is essential to strengthen counter-terrorism structures and institutions. But we must also address root causes by promoting education, tackling youth unemployment and addressing marginalization,he concludes.
Trump-Putin Summit
A month after the historic Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore President Trump will meet Russian President Putin in an effort to normalize relations between the two countries. Of late the relations between the two countries have worsened with the United States imposing sanctions on Russia and carrying on a policy of containing Russia through eastward expansion of NATO and intensification of the arms race.
It has also had several skirmishes with Russia on Syrian territory where the US is supporting some Islamic militants opposed to the Syrian Government.
In this context any meeting, even with mediocre results would be a step forward and away from politics of belligerency and confrontation.
Conservative sections in the United States are displeased with the prospects of the meeting as they charge that Russia interfered in the last US Presidential elections. Russia denies the charge.

Fight for democracy
It was the common practice to assume any intervention by America in the developing world to be reactionary. Sama Samajists in particular condemned the intervention in Middle East, South East and Latin America.
There were campaigns within the United State which supported third world agitations implying imperialism. However in the last few years US interventions to protect minorities and human rights violations indicated a change in the system. Most certainly within US and Europe internal agitations and subsequent pressure, has made leaders to change the attitude. In particular with the victory in South Africa and rise of Obama, this positive change made right wing leaders in the developing world to accuse US for interference to defend rebels, and support human rights activists.
Recently one right wing Lankan critique said no one should be surprised at outgoing US Ambassador Atul Keshaps comments on the Lankan political situation and potential presidential candidate Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Apparently Keshap had told former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that the US and other western nations do not welcome the prospects of his brother Gotabhaya becoming president and are opposed to such a move. US would not permit Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to renounce US citizenship at this juncture, which would make it illegal for him to contest as per the restrictions enshrined in the 19th Amendment. Apparently, Gotabhaya needs to clear himself of allegations against him over war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations before the US would allow him to renounce US citizenship formally. one could laugh that Here we have a representative of a country which was build on and sustained by war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations now fighting against such crimes.
American imperialism
One does not need to read Noam Chomskys What Uncle Sam really wants to understand the attitude of American imperialism about world matters. Anybody interested can look at the PalestinianIsrael problem and how the UN rulings were violated without any concern. Obviously one should not get too excited what a US President, Secretary of State or Ambassador talks about democracy.
Chomskys book traces how for decades US intervened in all parts of the world with the use of subversion and force, for economic and political hegemony. Also, Chomsky shows, to achieve the various ends the USA often supported violent regimes and dictatorships. Thus he exposes, for all the bleeding-heart talk about democracy, good governance and peace, how the USA has had no qualms over propping violent in any part of the world. Having said that we have to accept it is Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American, philosopher, social critical and political activist who make use of democracy to expose this villainy of America.
Sometimes described as the father of modern linguistics, Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science.
He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of over one hundred books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics Chomsky vocally opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, believing the war to be an act of American imperialism. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled The Responsibility of Intellectuals.
Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on Nixon's Enemies List.
One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the IsraeliPalestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements.
Economic inequality
Having said all that we have to answer the question how such a person do all that in US; the centre of reaction. Not only Chomsky but also people such as Bernard Sanders and other radicals play hell as conservatives say.
He is an American politician serving as the junior United States Senator from Vermont since 2007.
The longest-serving independent in congressional history, he was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 and has caucused with the Democratic Party since, which has entitled him to congressional committee assignments and at times given Democrats a majority. A self-described democratic socialist and a New Deal-era American progressive, Sanders is pro-labor and emphasizes reversing economic inequality.
So these people are powerful because of the strength of the American proletariat or the working class. This power of modern proletariat is spread throughout the developed world where democracy function one form or the other.
This power compels western radical politicians to fight for democracy and human rights in the developing world. UN human rights and social rights organisations are at least partially controlled by the power of modern proletariat in the developed world.
While we speak on bad effects of imperialist countries we have to admit the constant and consistent pressure of the left and the workers organisations in those developed world who are conscious, educated and active.
Hence it is not just bad and oppressive but also vigilant and conscious of rights of all sectors in the world.

To stop countrys cricket from plunging further:
Former cricket administrators urge Sports Minister to appoint interim committee
Former Sri Lanka Cricket presidents and administrators have written a strong letter to Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha urging him to appoint an interim committee to resurrect the countrys cricket from plunging further into the mire it has fallen into.
The letter signed by the first interim committee chairman Rienzie Wijetilleke and past presidents of SLC Ana Punchihewa, Hemaka Amarasuriya, Sidath Wettimuny, Vijay Malalasekera, Jayantha Dharmadasa, Upali Dharmadasa and Arjuna Ranatunga have pointed out the misdeeds, waste and corruption that has taken place from the time the Thilanga Sumathipala administration was elected to office in January 2016 that has resulted in the national cricket teams fall from grace in the rankings in all three formats..
They urge the Minister to appoint an interim committee to look into all the misdeeds and to streamline the election process with necessary amendments to the constitution of Sri Lanka Cricket to prevent the rampant abuse of power as practiced by the incumbent administration, leaving no room for such brazen acts to be repeated in the future.
The SLC administration is currently under the Sports Minister appointed Competent Authority following the postponement of elections due to a legal injunction which is pending.

Godin, Uruguay look to stop Ronaldo as Madrid rivalry comes to World Cup
SOCHI, Friday - The man who has marshalled the best defence in the World Cup so far will relish the task of trying to stop his old foe Cristiano Ronaldo when Uruguay and Portugal meet in Sochi on Saturday.
The Madrid derby comes to the shores of the Black Sea in the last 16 with Uruguayan captain Diego Godin, of Atletico, and his club team-mate Jose Maria Gimenez coming up against Real and Portugals five-time Ballon dOr winner.
It will be a fascinating battle at the Fisht Stadium with Ronaldo, at 33, enjoying his best World Cup but Uruguay the only side to come through the group stage in Russia without conceding a goal. Godin is an expert at keeping clean sheets, as the leader of an Atletico defence that is the most formidable in the European club game -- they kept 34 in all competitions last season -- and of a Uruguay side that has not conceded a goal in 2018 in six games.
Ronaldo, though, has already scored four times at this World Cup, including a hat-trick on his last visit here when Portugal drew 3-3 with Spain. That means he has 85 international goals, more than any other male European player in history. In the last two years, he has scored two hat-tricks for Real against Godins Atletico, having also emerged victorious in two Madrid derby Champions League finals.
But the rugged and brave Godin, who needed reconstructive dental surgery after having three teeth punched out in an aerial challenge with Valencias goalkeeper earlier this year, has succeeded in muzzling Ronaldo on plenty other occasions at club level going back almost a decade. Godn is a star. He defends, commands, scores goals, wins titles, and does not miss a game, said Diego Maradona recently.
On Saturday, Gimenez -- who scored Uruguays late winner against Egypt -- is set to rejoin Godin in central defence after missing the 3-0 victory over Russia due to injury. Ronaldo, meanwhile, will look to get back among the goals having had a penalty saved in Portugals 1-1 draw with Iran. That, and the VAR-awarded late spot-kick for the Iranians, condemned the defending European champions to this tie rather than a meeting with the hosts in Moscow.

Hambantota Port deal beneficial to both parties - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while defending Chinese investment in the Hambantota Port yesterday said this project with 15 industries, will transform the Hambantota district.
Delivering the key note address at the Saman Kelegama Memorial Conference at the Taj Samudra yesterday, the Prime Minister said, A lot has been written about how we were forced to give it up but I always thought that we held the cards. Since I was in charge of negotiations, Minister (Malik Samarawickrema) was there, we discussed it with Chinese Prime Minister Lee and President Xi.
It was a tough deal but finally we came up with something that was beneficial to both parties, the Premier said.
The PM had invited President Xi Jinping to visit Sri Lanka to see the benefits of it for himself.
I would like to place on record the appreciation for the Sri Lankan team as well as President Xi, PM Lee and many others.
When we took over, Hambantota was the largest swimming pool in the world but from next year onwards, we will see ships coming in. We are used to turning white elephants green, he added.
Answering questions of having leased land to the Chinese to build an industrial zone around the Hambantota Port, the PM stressed that, China Merchants would not have taken over the Port as charity. It had to be made a viable business model. The 15 industries that would be set up, would rapidly transform and industrialize the Hambantota District. This is one of the many industrial zones planned in the country, We are not building industrial zones just to take out loans. These developments will transform loans into FDI.This is the process that we need to push hard, increase exports, build up reserves and finally bring about a manageable debt ratio (55 percent).
To repeated questions of Chinese submarines coming in to the Port, the Prime Minister said, We have told that they cannot use it for military purposes and they have agreed.
The PM who spoke on the theme of Managing Domestic and International Challenges and Opportunities in Post-Conflict Development: Lessons from Sri Lanka outlined the challenges the government had faced in the economic front over the last three years and the future economic outlook planned for the country.
The priority for the Sri Lankan economy in 2015 was for an economic stabilization package and fiscal consolidation and having achieved that at present- the time had now come to expanding. This expansion would have to come as Sri Lanka manages its large debt burden as a result of the previous regime opting for infrastructure led growth with foreign finance soon after the war.
Now we have to address the structural reforms pertaining to trade competitiveness, further trade liberalization (GSP+, Singapore FTA and ongoing discussions with China and India on FTA), eliminating other barriers to trade, enacting anti-dumping legislation, helping domestic industries to be competitive and ease of doing business, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister who stressed on the need to build economic partnerships to expand our own export market, highlighted the countrys strategic location and that despite the power struggles within the Indian Ocean, the country would be open to trade with all.
The paradigm shift with the rise of China and India, and the growing importance of the Indian Ocean, will certainly impact us- the issue has been brought to our doorstep. There is no way in which we can ignore it.

Hitlerite memories and poll funds from China
The twists and turns of politics are moving into fresh confrontations both within the government, and between the government and opposition. The call for a local Hitler by a senior member of the Maha Sangha continues to hold the interest in the political debate, while Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition will certainly have to face questions about Chinese funding for MRs election in the Presidential Poll in January 2015, and Mahinda Rajapaksa is offering to be a political courier to bring his cousin Udayanga Weeratunga for investigations on corruption.
The birthday anusasana where Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was asked to follow the Hitler tradition of using the army to rebuild what was seen as a fast declining country, continues to echo in the discourse on politics, with Gotabhaya himself stating the reverend monks counsel was for him, which he clearly understood, while those who did not understand it are making a big noise about it.
It is interesting to know what exactly is understood by anyone, listening to an important anusasana or advisory sermon by one learned in religion, who reminds a former officer of the Sri Lanka Army, who as Secretary of Defence, is said to have been known as a Hitler, and is a likely candidate for the next Executive Presidency, to follow the example of the German Nazi leader, and give leadership to the Army to face what is seen as the noticeable decline in the country.
The letters published in the media show an interesting twist in thinking about Hitler. There was one writer (in The Island) who had learnt from his readings about Hitler, when in the UK, that he was a vegetarian, a teetotaler, a non-smoker, and an Austrian. He never learnt about the Nazi concentration camps, and more than six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. There is also light reading that reminds us of how many in the early days of World War II, had a high regard for Hitler, as part of the anti-Colonial British thinking over here. But, many of them did change their thoughts when the truths about the Holocaust were revealed. The defenders of the Hitler message are at great pains to say that what the Anunayake Thera wanted Gotabhaya to be was a righteous leader - in the context of righteousness as found in Buddhist teachings. There are also some who recall Adolf Hitler's special interest in the Aryan race, and his thinking of Germans as a higher race. We did have politicians and lay people in our country who were impressed by this Aryan interest of Hitler - Caucasian people of Nordic descent, who are not Jews. The way the current thinking goes, it is not impossible that we would soon see supporters of a new Arya Sinhala Hitler, who would take the leadership of this country, with the full support of his family of authoritarians, who are seeking a return to the offices of power they held not too long ago, and the business interests who benefited most from that regime.
It is certainly surprising that a monk of the rank of an Anunayake of the Asgiriya Chapter of the Siyam Nikaya, having to use an example of a Hitler for the benefit of this country, which we are told was his goal. It is necessary to tell those who try to explain the Hitler goal in terms of a dahaemi or righteous leadership, shown to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Was there no dahaemi leader in all the history of Buddhism and the teachings of the Buddha, to seek such an example in the most brutal dictator of the modern age Is the burning down of the Reichstag by the Nazis in 1933 a sign of the righteous leadership that was to follow from Adolf Hitler We do have a parliament that needs major changes, but will any righteous or dahaemi leader think of burning it down
This Hitler rhetoric, which Gotabhaya Rajapaksa says was meant for him and was understood, certainly calls for much better education on political history worldwide in this country, especially in the education of those who will preach messages of righteousness to their followers, of whatever faith or conviction.
The China benefits
Talk of how Western powers funded the political campaign that saw the major political change, defeating of the Rajapaksa Regime in January 2015, has been the frequent chorus of the Joint Opposition (JO) and other forces opposed to the coalition of unity in office today.
The Western powers who they see as being supportive of the LTTE's separatist agenda, and Indian interests which are certainly opposed to the LTTE, but are opposed to the Rajapaksa, are seen as the key funders and manipulators of the political campaign that saw the defeat of the authoritarian Rajapaksa Regime. The weak publicity strategies of the government, being more involved in internal divisions that in larger issues outside, have done little to meet this propaganda of its opponents. But there is new information of a major foreign influence that funded the Rajapaksa political and polls campaign, which does turn a new light on the political realities of Sri Lanka.
The New York Times (NYT) has reported on June 15, 2018, that the Mahinda Rajapaksa campaign received large payments from Chinese sources, which were linked to the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport construction projects, associated with China's own efforts to tilt influence away from India in the South Asian region.
What is most interesting in the NYT report is that these payments from Chinese companies were confirmed by documents and cash cheques detailed in government investigations, seen by the NYT. What is disturbing is that Sri Lankan officials involved in these negotiations had underscored the intelligence and strategic possibilities of the Hambantota and Mattala locations, and had gone beyond the commercial considerations of the projects.
As the January 2015 election moved closer, payments from Chinese companies had moved more to the former president's office. It is reported that US $ 7.6 million was dispersed to affiliates of Mahinda Rajapaksa's campaign. Just 10 days before the poll US$ 3.7 million had been given for printing of T-shirts and other promotional material, US$ 297,000 given for gifts to supporters of the candidate, US$ 38,000 paid to a popular Buddhist monk supporting the Rajapaksa presidency, and cheques totaling US$ 1.7 million given to pro-Rajapaksa volunteers via Temple Trees.
Knowing the nature of the campaigning that was done, with T-shirts and other publicity gimmicks at enormous costs, there is little doubt that the Rajapaksa campaign did receive funds from so far unknown and undeclared sources. The case decided in Court about sil redi, is just one example of the propaganda strategies. The news of the large sums of money that was removed from Temple Trees just as the election results were coming is also an indication of the corruption that was taking place.
It is now the duty of the Government to make clear statements on whatever investigations have been conducted on foreign funding for the Rajapaksa campaign at the last presidential poll, and take steps to prevent such expenditure in all coming elections in the country.
Namal Rajapaksa stating that the NYT report has inaccuracies is hardly the required response to it. Why not give details of the amounts received and what they were used for.
Udayanga courier
Mahinda Rajapaksa is now giving assurances that his cousin, Udayanga Weeratunga, Sri Lanka's former ambassador in Russia, who is allegedly associated with massive corruption over the purchase of MiG fighter jets from Ukraine, will be brought to Sri Lanka by him, with the government still failing to bring him from Dubai, despite an Interpol Red Alert.
The former president has certainly made an interesting offer. The question arises as to why he had to wait so long to make this generous offer, when he knew for a very long time that Udayanga Weeratunga was wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities for a serious probe Udayanga Weeratunga did meet him abroad on several occasions when the country was taking steps to have him brought down to the country. Is it because the Interpol alert is now moving into action, and he sees a good opportunity to give special assistance to his cousin, whom he would bring down

ICC launches app to battle corruption in cricket
The ICCs latest means to battle corruption in the game is an Integrity app that will be available to players, officials and support staff at all levels of the game and across all formats.
The app will give anyone in the game easy access to information they need to tackle issues relating to anti-corruption and anti-doping, the ICC said on Friday. While the app will serve as an information source, it will also provide those in the game a secure platform to report any suspicious incidents or behaviour related to corruption or doping.
Players and officials were first made aware of the app at a soft launch during the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand in January. India Under-19 coach Rahul Dravid said he found the app useful, and encouraged all those involved with the game to download it.
Its fantastic to see that the ICC has come up with an Integrity App, Dravid said. Its got a lot of information on anti-doping and anti-corruption. You can make a report about anything that you notice that is untoward. I think its terrific to have easy access to this information on your fingertips. I would encourage all players, and those involved in cricket, to download the app, to use it and to read up on all the information. Its something that will keep the game clean, fair and something that we are all proud of.

2018 Milo President trophy schools knock out tournament
Joes have a slight edge over Peterites
Defending champions St.Joseph College Maradana will go out all guns blazing to win the 2018 Milo President trophy schools knock out final against arch rival and underdogs St.Peters College Bambalapitiya today at Race Course grounds due to kick off at 6:30pm under lights.
The Joes head into this championship as slight favourites as they dominated this tournament last year. Peterites has a reputation of giving the Josephians a hard time but the defending champions has the advantage over Peters as they won the league match this year between these two sides when they last met at Longden Place by 10 points to 5
St.Peters have shown tremendous improvement under the guidance of veteran Sanath Martis winning seven out of nine matches losing only to league champs Royal College and runners up St.Joseph during their schools league rugby campaign and eventually finished in third place in the tournaments standings.
St.Joseph's head coach Nilfer Ibrahim who is a past Kingswood College rugby player expects a tough encounter for his charges and highlighted his opponents prowess in defence.
Speaking exclusively to the Daily News he said They have a very good forward pack and a three quarter line and they are overall a very good team in schools rugby at the moment, So weve got a huge challenge on our hands and one that we really wanted to face. It is going to be a close game and we expect a very good fight from them, but we will come out executing our plans l to be victorious in the end concluded Nilfer. If Peters manage to beat St.Joseph in this match, they will end Joes hopes of winning the knock out cup championship for the second time in succession as they are the defending champions.
The match is a historic one for St.Peters too, as they became the first Peterite side to get in to school knock out championship after 2010. Incidentally they emerged joint champions with Royal that year under Keith Gurusinghe and what a co incident as that year Sanath Martis was the head coach of the victorious Peterite side.
For Peters their nippy scrum-half Jason Karunaratne will be highly motivated to do well against the defending champions. Karunaratne is blessed with a vast array of skills and that along with his crisp service to his outside backs makes him a danger in attack. Hes also a superb reader of the game and will not let his side down if he gets opportunities to score tries.
Also there will be lots of pressure on play maker cum captain fly-half Kenneth Wimaladasa when he takes on his opposition counterpart Santhush Algama in what should be an exciting duel. Although small in stature Wimaladasa has shown flashes of brilliance and his playmaking skills will have to be at their best if he wants to get the better of Algama, who seldom plays a poor game
Wimaladasa is regarded as one of the games best attackers and will be hoping to continue where he left off against Wesley College outfit in the Semi final match last week at Sugathadasa Stadium where he dished out a sensational game with his running rugby controlling the game well according to the situation as well as his fabulous kicking boot where he shocked the entire crowd with 100% accuracy.
Speaking to the Daily news Sanath Martis the veteran head coach of St.Peters College said The fact is that rugby is a game in which teams make mistakes, so the team who tends to make less mistakes on that day will ultimately win the game . While wishing both teams for an exciting game of rugby, may the better team win the finals and become schools knock out champions for the 2018 rugby season.  concluded Martis.
Predicting the outcome of todays finals, former S.Thomas College Mount Lavinia rugby player, CR & FC rugby captain, Sri Lanka national player cum coach and the Sri Lanka rugby (SLR) president Asanga Seneviratne said In the league I believe St. Josephs were really unlucky as they have lost only one game to league champs Royal. Its going to be a close game, but my personal view is that St.Josephs might pull off a win.

Volleyball 78 years old in Kandy
Volleyball is the national sport of Sri Lanka. In Kandy at one time volleyball was a popular sport, but today sadly the much needed support for the game is missing. If the proper backing is there, this game too, could be making big news. The first volleyball league was formed in Kandy in 1941. At one time there were two tournaments annually - one on a league basis and other on a knockout. Volleyball in Kandy needs a fillip. The game was introduced to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1916 by R. W. Camack, then Director of Physical Education at the Colombo Y.M.C.A. The newly appointed governing body should give a hand for Kandy volleyball.

Let Chandimal be an example
We read with dismay the news that the captain of our cricket team was banned for ball tampering.
Cricket is a gentlemens game and when we were schoolboys, it was drilled into us to play the game fair and let the better side win. But of course the game has under gone drastic changes since then and today it is played to win and that too ruthlessly.
Over the years our team had skirmishes at play and they were not insurmountable. The most damaging was the bowling of Muralitharan, but he came through it unscathed. Muralitharan went through a torrid time due to his unusual action.
Now the ball tampering by the captain is unpardonable and has set a bad example. After the hearing of the appeal if he is found guilty he should be dropped from the team, not so much as a punishment but as a warning to young players for the future.

Matara heist suspects house raided in Homagama
The wife of Abeysinghe Arachchige Wasantha Kumara Perera alias Habarakada Wasantha, a suspect evading arrest following the recent jewellery shop robbery in Matara, was arrested yesterday.
A revolver and live ammunition was found during a search operation carried out by the STF on Thursday night, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Organised Crimes Division yesterday, he said the firearm and bullets were found after Police Special Task Force (STF) personnel searched the house of the wanted suspect.
The STF also arrested three occupants of the house for questioning and handed them over to the Organised Crimes Division. One of them is the wife of Habarakada Wasantha Athukoralage Ranjani Hemamala (42), the other his mother Dayawathie Perera and his father Victor Perera.
A few days ago during the robbery at a jewellery shop in Matara, one policeman was killed while two others were injured. A civilian woman and man were also injured in this incident.
A suspect was arrested at the scene and these suspects had come prepared to change their clothes after the robbery and flee. However, suspect Chamara Indrajith Jayasundara had pulled out a grenade targeting the police, when they had escorted him to the spot where they had hidden the clothing in the Kiralakelle forest area and he was shot by a policeman, SP Gunasekara added.
Three other suspects who had sustained injuries had been admitted to the Karapitiya hospital and is in remand custody.
Investigations revealed that seven suspects had come for the robbery. Six of them had arrived on three motorcycles and one had come in a car. The Police Spokesman said three others are still at large, while, four suspects have so far been arrested by the police. All three of the suspects have been identified while one of them is Habarakada Wasantha, a resident of Habarakada, Homagama.
The STF officers had received a tip-off that he had come to his home at 275/2, Habarakada, Homagama and they had gone to search his home on Thursday night.
At the time the suspect was not in his home but three others were in the house. Upon searching the house, the STF had found concealed in the house a .38 revolver and four live ammunitions and two empty bullet casings. We suspect that Habarakada Wasantha had come specifically for the Matara robbery and we suspect that this weapon that was recovered is one of the weapons brought by the suspects to commit this robbery. We will subject it to the Government Analysts examination, the Police Spokesman said.
Habarakada Wasantha is wanted for a number of crimes and has several warrants pending against him.

Messi must deliver and France must fire in World Cup last 16
KAZAN, Friday - Argentina and Lionel Messi need to find form fast if they are to go any further in the World Cup on Saturday when they meet a France team who have yet to live up to their billing.
The first last-16 match in Russia promises to be a fascinating clash of two under-achieving sides who are supposedly on different trajectories. All the flaws of an ageing and unbalanced Argentina team were ruthlessly exposed in the thrashing by Croatia in the group stage. But, roared on by a pumped-up Diego Maradona, Messi finally opened his account in this tournament before Marcos Rojo volleyed in a stunning winner against Nigeria as the losing 2014 finalists punched their ticket to the knockout stage.
Didier Deschamps France, meanwhile, among the pre-tournament favourites, have looked sluggish despite easing through the group stage unbeaten.
First-choice striker Antoine Griezmann has been unable to recapture his best form and the creativity has failed to flow from midfield.
Deschamps is adamant that France will get it all right on the night when the business end of the tournament kicks off on Saturday. A whole new competition begins now, direct elimination, Deschamps said. We got what we wanted. Now the mountain looms up in front of us, but were there and were aiming to get through to the next round after that.
Five-time Ballon dOr winner Messi underlined his importance to Argentina with a sublimely-taken opening goal against Nigeria on Tuesday.
But it only partly made amends for the Barcelona icons penalty miss against Iceland in a lacklustre 1-1 draw that dampened Argentine hopes from their opening match.
Messi was then virtually missing in action when Jorge Sampaolis men suffered the chastening defeat to Croatia.
The tension of the win over Nigeria had 1986 World Cup winner Maradona grimacing towards the sky, a crazed look in his eyes. Maradona later played down concerns over his health after he was checked over by paramedics inside his VIP box.
But Argentina, and Messis health is under scrutiny too, according to former France captain Marcel Desailly.
A World Cup winner with France in 1998, Desailly told Britains Guardian newspaper:
We know Messi is great but were confused and sad for him.
He is such a pure Barcelona product but with Argentina right now, Messis in a mess.
And lets face it, France have yet to show anything to make us feel optimistic, to give us hope, said Desailly. - AFP

PM praises Mahabodhi Societys role
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera met with members of the Mahabodhi Society including Society President and Bhutan's former Speaker, Dasho Passang Dorji yesterday.
The Prime Minister said their meeting was auspiciously timed falling just a few days after Poson Poya and praised the Society for forming a vital link between India and Sri Lanka through Buddhism.
"You have come to Sri Lanka to see how Buddhism has flourished here," Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. "The Mahabodhi Society has played an important role, both here and around the world."
The Premier, addressing members of the society who were visiting from India and Bhutan, affirmed the importance of Sri Lanka's links with Mahabodhi, which was founded by Sri Lankan Buddhist leader, Anagarika Dharmapala in 1891 in an effort to revive Buddhism in India. Since then, the Society has opened offices around the world.
He expressed hope that the life and services by The Blessed One will continue to live on in a strong relationship between Sri Lanka and India in the future.
The event was followed by a reception where members of the society were able to meet the Prime Minister and Minister of Buddha Sasana.

Police hunt for unauthorised weapons continues
Police had found 14 T56 rifles, 11 pistols, 10 revolvers, 16 locally manufactured Galkatas improvised guns, 284 other types of weapons and 7,375 live ammunitions in the first five months this year.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the police had recovered 34 T56 rifles, 23 pistols, 22 revolvers, 17 galkatas, 702 other types of weapons and 2,882 ammunition last year.
Illegal firearms are used for many homicides and robberies each year.
The types of firearms that are used in criminal activities today are increasing.
The police believe that these are circulated in society, especially the underworld, as a result of the long war that had gripped the country for 30 years.
This is generally expected when a country has gone through so many years of war and these weapons can surface from time to time and some of these weapons have got into the hands of the underworld gangs, the Police Spokesman said.
Todays criminals largely use automatic pistols, revolvers or T-56 and despite what the police have found, it is believed thousands more are circulating in the country and many of them are possibly in the possession of criminals.
The government periodically has offered firearms amnesty, but only a few respond and a fraction of the firearms circulating ends up being handed over.
In addition to the firearms that had been in the hands of the LTTE, there is evidence to suggest that a considerable number of firearms that were issued to politicians have also ended up in the hands of criminals.
It is also said that there is a large number of military deserters and many illegally kept weapons obtained from these deserters.

SLFPYPA questions CEBs essays
Sri Lanka Freedom Party Young Professionals Association (SLFPYPA) vehemently condemned the process in which the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry recruited unskilled electricians.
SLFPYPA Executive Member Rajika Kodithuwakku said the recruits were asked to write essays about the success of United National Party(UNP) and about the Ceylon Electricity Board.
And the letter stated that those essays had to be sent to the Power and Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera. It further said that they will be recruited to the permanent cadre after four years of training and qualifications of these recruits were also not mentioned, he said.
He requested President Maithripala Sirisena to look into it and to make sure that similar recruitments dont happen in the future.
Kodithuwakku said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa can be arrested for saying that he could bring down Udayanga Weerathunga.
He said that former president could be arrested for not revealing information about a fugitive on whom a warrant had been issued and added that the police can inquire from him to get to know about Weerathungas whereabouts.
He said that sometimes law is not equal to everyone referring to MP Mahinda Rajapaksa not being inquired and Gotabhaya Rajapaksas case not being heard in courts.
Kodithuwakku speaking about the recent New York Times article over allegations against former President Rajapaksa he said Rajapaksa has to give a clear explanation to people on that matter.
If he could get media attention to speak about every other thing why not clarify on this issue, he questioned.

Speaker to head Parliament Committee on building national unity, co-existence
A special Parliament Committee headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is to be appointed to come up with a series of proposals to build national unity.
Speaker Jayasuriya, addressing the media at the end of a conference on National and Religious Reconciliation attended by multi-religious representatives at the Parliament complex yesterday, said the Committee would take the opinions of the religious leaders, intellectuals and the public and present a realistic and practical set of proposals to improve ethnic and religious co-existence in the country.
He said the proposal to set up an all-party Parliamentary Committee for the purpose would be discussed at the next Party Leaders Meeting. The Committee will have the power to make recommendations on any matter related to reconciliation and to review their implementation.
The Speaker, recalling the recent ethnic and religious violence unleashed in Kandy and Ampara, said those incidents were a black mark that brought disrepute to the country. Highlighting that many among those who acted violently in Kandy were youth between 18 and 21 years, Jayasuriya pointed out the urgent need to reform our education system to embed values of ethnic and religious co-existence since very early age.
The religious leaders who took part in the conference emphasised that political parties framed on ethnic and religious lines are a bane for national unity. Vidyodaya Pirivena Pirivenadhipathi Ven. Balangoda Sobitha Nayaka thera called on the political authorities not to allow such parties to mushroom and take measures to prevent such parties from creating frictions among communities seeking political mileage. Bishop Winston Fernando said such political parties divided on ethnic and religious lines would only contribute to the failure of the country.
Bishop Fernando and Kandy Chief Moulavi Fazlur Rehman also highlighted that Police needs to be more vigilant and act instantly to prevent isolated incidents from becoming racial or ethnic clashes, adding that a lapse on the part of Police was apparent in Kandy during the recent communal tensions.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara had briefed the gathering on measures taken to protect peace and harmony in the country, also giving an undertaking to implement the law without fear or favour against any offender who breach the countrys laws.

Steve Smith, the former Australia skipper, scored a half-century in the Global T20 Canada on Thursday, to mark his return to professional cricket.
Smith was handed a one-year ban from international and domestic cricket by Cricket Australia for his involvement in the ball-tampering scandal that erupted in South Africa in March.
However, he is allowed to play in the low-key Canadian event. The 29-year-old eased his way back by scoring 61 off 41 balls for the Toronto Nationals in a six-wicket victory over the Vancouver Knights at King City.
Smiths knock included eight boundaries and one six before he was out stumped off the bowling of Fawad Ahmed. - AFP

Suranga Lakmal joins a rare list of captains in Test cricket
109 wickets in 46 Test matches at an average of 42.46. These are the bowling numbers of Suranga Lakmal, the latest player to lead Sri Lanka in Test cricket. Dinesh Chandimal bagged a one-Test ban for ball-tampering during the 2nd Test between Windies and Sri Lanka. This meant the vice-captain Lakmal got the chance to captain his country for the first time in his career during the recently concluded Bridgetown Test.
Keeping his past record aside, Lakmal made most of the opportunity and led his side from the front in the first day/night Test in the Caribbean which Sri Lanka won by four wickets to share the three-Test series one-all. He dismissed Devon Smith in the very first over of the game and sent back the other opener Kraigg Brathwaite in his 3rd over. The hosts lost five wickets for just 53 before Shane Dowrich and Jason Holder rescued them out of trouble with an unbeaten 77-run stand for the sixth wicket on day one.
Thus, Lakmal became the first Sri Lankan captain to take a wicket on the very first over of the match and also the first such skipper in the last 15 years. Interestingly, the right-arm pacer was also the first captain to bowl the first over of a Test match since Heath Streak in 2004.
The last captain to take a wicket in the first over of a Test was Pakistans Waqar Younis who did that against Australia in the 2002 Test series played in Sri Lanka and UAE. Waqar achieved the feat twice in that series of taking a wicket in the first over of a Test while leading the team.
Another former Pakistan skipper Imran Khan struck four times in the very first over of the game while Kapil Dev gave his team a break-through on three occasions in the first over while leading India. Lakmal is overall the 9th captain to take a wicket in the first over of a Test match but only the 3rd to do it on their captaincy debut. Ray Lindwall bagged a wicket in the first over of the only Test match he led Australia. Pakistans Fazal Mahmood also began his Test captaincy with a wicket in the first over of the game. - CricTracker

Technologies that changed cricket over the years
There is absolutely no doubt that over the years, technology has become an integral part of the game. In crickets rich history of more than 140 years, technology has grown with every passing year and decade.
In 1922, the first-ever radio broadcast of a cricket match took place in Australia covering a domestic game which took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). The first time a match was televised was way back in 1938. Since then, there were constant ball-by-ball coverage, detailed coverage of the matches being played (at least international ones).
Slowly, but surely, the technology kept up pace as the game evolved and grew. More and more games started being broadcasted, there was radio commentary like never before. Third umpires came into the fray as the 20th century went into its last decade. Replays became better, the quality of broadcasting was constantly improving.
Technology in cricket kept up pace with other things around the world. More and more cameras were involved, speed guns were invented, spider-cams came into the picture, Decision Review System (DRS) which involves ball tracking, Snicko, Hotspot and we can go on and on and on. Hence, technology is an integral part of the game today and players, umpires, analysts, everyone is dependent on it some way or the other.
With Anil Kumbles Spektacom technology which gives an in-depth analysis on batting (bat speed, power, ball contact with the bat among other things) making its debut in this years Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) which begins on the 11 of July, lets take a look back at some of the technologies that have impacted and changed the game of cricket over the years.
SPIDERCAM
Spidercam is a type of a camera that is suspended from the stadiums roofs and poles. It offers a complete three-dimension view of the game.
The Spidercam gives a complete and a detailed view of every small part of the game. It functions as the game progresses and moves. As the bowler runs in to bowl a delivery, it captures his/her run up all the way until the batsman plays a shot and the ball becomes dead. It then covers how the bowler is going back to his mark or how the batsman is preparing to face the next delivery.
Hence, the Spidercam has been a great help not only to the broadcasters but also the match officials if they want to watch specific parts/details of an instance that took place during the game. Every game played now (that is covered) has a Spidercam and it has become an integral component of broadcasting.
STUMP CAMERAS
In todays game, we often have a hawk-eye view and how the game looks from the stumps. This is because of a camera installed in the middle-stump (mostly) at either end of the pitch.
This stump camera often helps third umpires making some crucial runout or stumping decisions, especially in cases when the bat (or leg) is on the line (popping crease). It provides them with a different angle which helps them determine whether the bat (or leg) is in or not. It also helps in recording every moment of the game from a stumps view.
GUN (SPEEDOMETER)
Weve often heard about former fast bowlers who were champions and how they intimidated even the best batsmen in the world. The likes of Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, the famous West Indies pace quartets and many others ruled international cricket in their time. As the experts and former batsmen say, they were quite quick and it was sometimes a nightmare to face them at their peak. However, nobody knows at what speed they operated at. Or who was the quickest during their time.
Hence, the advent and the introduction of the speed gun helped in determining whose bowling at what speed or which bowler is/was the quickest. The speed gun measured at what speed the ball was delivered i.e the estimated speed of the delivery bowled.
BALL TRACKING (HAWK-EYE)
Ball Tracking is a technology used to determine the path of the ball after it has been released from the bowlers arm i.e. it is generally used to determine the how the ball might travel if the ball was not in contact with the batsman. In other words, it gives a detailed view of how particular deliveries have been bowled and what their paths were.
It helps in determining how much swing/seam, spin, bounce or any kind of movement that was there on the ball. It has helped in reviewing LBW decisions. It is one of the key components of the Decision Review System (DRS).
SNICKO (SNICKOMETER) AND HOTSPOT
Snicko (or Snickometer as it is known as) is a type of a sensitive microphone which picks up any sound when the ball passes through (whether it hits the bat, pad or the body of the batsman). It was invented to pick up edges for caught-behinds or inside-edges for LBWs.
This Snicko usually detects the presence of an edge i.e. if the batsman has nicked a delivery or has got an inside edge onto the pad. The Snicko has become an integral part of the Decision Review System (DRS) and has helped the third umpires detect edges.
Hotspot is currently an integral part of the Decision Review System (DRS) in most places around the world. It is a very expensive technology but it is used in conjunction with Snicko to detect edges and faint nicks. Hotspot is an infrared technology used to capture images of whether the batsman has made any contact with the ball.
Sometimes, the Snicko might fail if there is too much disturbance around the batsman and the Snicko might detect a lot of sound waves but Hotspot works on heat waves and sometimes can determine faintest of edges as well. Like Snicko, Hotspot is used to help third-umpires detect edges for caught behind, or an inside-edge for LBW and more such decisions.
WAGON-WHEEL AND PITCH-MAP
Here are two technologies that help teams analyze and strategize. The Wagon-wheel is that technological innovation which shows how a particular batsman has scored runs i.e. which region or part of the ground, where does he get his boundaries, where does he look for ones and twos and so on. It gives a detailed view of a batsmans or teams innings or multiple innings as well.
On the other hand, pitch-map gives a detailed view of the bowlers. It gives a complete view on a particular bowler or a team has bowled in a particular innings or multiple innings. It helps them figure out what line and length theyve bowled and what improvement can be made.
These two technologies not only help in the improvement of the respective teams but also helps in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of opposition bowlers and batsmen.
LED BAILS
The stumps and bails have also evolved with time. The stumps started having cameras and were used to record the stump-view of the game.
But now the bails have evolved too. There are LED bails used in todays game. They were brought into the picture to eliminate touch and go cases during runouts and stumpings while determining when the bails were off the groove. Hence, with the advent of LED bails (and stumps), we can easily know when the bails (and stumps) were completely dislodged.
Also known as Zing bails, these contain sensors which light up when the bails are completely off their groove and hence, decisions on runout and stumpings can be made when these bails light up and where was the batsman when these lit up.
SOME OTHER TECHNOLOGIESSUPER SLO-MO:
This is nothing but an advancement in the cameras which record the motion of the video in very slow motion. It gives a complete picture of how a particular event happened. For example, take the recent ball tampering incident where Cameron Bancroft was caught putting the sandpaper back in the pocket and then in his trousers.
 BOWLING MACHINES:
These are machines which are fed balls (any kind of balls) and a particular speed is set for a batsman to practice. It can help a batsman face a particular kind of delivery while practising.
BALL RPM:
This is a technology that measures the revolutions put behind a delivery. This is usually measured for spinners as to check the revs behind the ball.

World Cup wide open after dramatic group stage
SOCHI, Thursday - Only six countries have won the World Cup in the last 50 years, but a thrilling group stage in Russia has increased the possibility of a fresh name at least making it to the final.
The first phase, featuring just one goalless draw and already a record number of penalties, has been marked by Germanys stunning exit, their earliest in 80 years.
So after the drama of the last fortnight, who is best set to go far in the knockout rounds
BRAZIL FINDING THEIR FEET
Of the half-dozen winners of the trophy since 1970, Germany have gone home, while Italy, of course, never even qualified. Meanwhile, France and Argentina play each other next, so only one will make the quarter-finals.
That leaves Spain and Brazil, with the latter fresh from topping their group at a 10th consecutive World Cup even if they have been slow-burners so far.
This team created high expectations because of what we did in qualifying and in friendlies. But now we are at a World Cup, its a new cycle, a new format, said coach Tite in an attempt to keep feet on the ground.
Neymar has not yet captured his best form, but the five-time champions have other match-winners, not least Philippe Coutinho, and have looked strong at the back.
A DRAW OF TWO HALVES
The standout last-16 tie on paper pits France against Lionel Messi and Argentina, two teams who laboured through the group stage -- in Argentinas case they were lucky to advance at all.
We didnt start in the best way. We got ourselves into a real mess, admitted Javier Mascherano, while France coach Didier Deschamps still seems incapable of getting the very best out of his talented squad.
Argentinians might be happier than anyone at Germanys elimination, having been knocked out by them at each of the last three World Cups.
But they could find themselves on a collision course with Brazil in the semi-finals, as they lie on a side of the draw that features countries totalling 10 World Cup wins between them.
European champions Portugal are there too, and if Cristiano Ronaldos side beat Uruguay in what could be a real battle of attrition in Sochi, he might find himself up against Messis Argentina in the last eight.
CAN CROATIA KEEP IT UP
Uruguay, though, are the only team not to have conceded a goal. Recent World Cups have tended to be won by the side with the best defence, with Spain letting in just two in their victorious 2010 campaign.
Along with England, Spain are the only past winners in the other side of the draw and they face Russia in Moscow on Sunday, with question marks surrounding their back line, and the form of goalkeeper David De Gea.
Obviously we can improve. Five goals in three matches is not the way forward, said coach Fernando Hierro of their defensive record, as it remains to be seen if Spain were right to sack Julen Lopetegui on the eve of the tournament.
Croatia are possible quarter-final opponents for Spain. They won all three group games, and a run to the semis like in 1998 is not beyond them, although coach Zlatko Dalic had a warning for his team before facing Denmark.
Its all great for the history books in Croatia but if we dont win against Denmark, when someone asks you what you did, what can you say Nothing, Dalic said.
Meanwhile, England might feel a route to the last four is opening up nicely, thanks to Thursdays defeat against Belgium.
But Colombia are not to be taken lightly in what manager Gareth Southgate has called Englands biggest match in a decade.
And beyond that could lie Sweden who, it should not be forgotten, have been responsible for knocking out the Netherlands, Italy and Germany from this World Cup.
There are 10 European teams in the last 16, and only one of 10 past European World Cups has been won by a side from another continent. That was Brazil, in 1958.  AFP
