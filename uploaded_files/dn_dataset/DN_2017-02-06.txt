Eat early and burn more fat!
More evidence suggests it may not be all about what you eat, but when you eat that will help you control your weight. People who finished eating all their meals by early afternoon had smaller fluctuations in hunger and burned slightly more fat than people who ate throughout the day, a small new study has found.
More research is needed, but the results show the timing of calories likely does matter, said Courtney Peterson, the study author and an assistant professor of nutrition sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
The more you can eat your food earlier in the day, even if youre not changing the timing of your meals, the better, Peterson told TODAY.
Not everyone can always change their diet. But most everyone has some sort of control over when they eat or how much food you eat at each meal.
The timing of meals may matter because the body has an internal clock  the circadian rhythm, which follows a 24-hour cycle  and does certain things better at different times of the day, Peterson explained.
We know your best blood sugar control is in the morning, she said. We also know that when you eat food, the energy it takes to digest it is a little higher in the morning.
Research in mice has already found rodents who graze throughout the day gain more weight than those who eat all their food within a window early in the rodent day. Mice that munch when they should normally be sleeping may also disrupt their learning and memory.
For the study, 11 people tried two eating schedules for four days. In one, they ate all their food between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. In the other, they engaged in a more typical meal schedule, starting to eat at 8 a.m. and finishing at 8 p.m. They ate exactly the same amount of calories on both eating schedules.
The changes didnt affect how many calories people were burning, the researchers found. But when the participants ate all their food early in the day, they burned about 6 percent more fat and their hunger levels were more even throughout the day, even though they were essentially fasting for 18 hours between dinner and breakfast. Perhaps thats because when your body realizes youve had all your calories for the day, theres no need to get hungry, Peterson theorized.
The findings might be promising for weight loss, she said.
If youd like to try a similar eating plan, she noted most people find squeezing all their meals into a six-hour window to be too difficult. Eight hours  from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., for example  is more doable, she said.
Another strategy may be to keep the same meal times, but make breakfast and lunch your biggest meals, Peterson said. In other words, follow the old adage: Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. Traditional societies, like the Mediterranean culture, often do just that and consume their biggest meal in the middle of the day.
Peterson presented the findings at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society. -www.today.com

## Title: Ending the SAITM impasse

Ending the SAITM impasse
The recent Court verdict on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was crystal clear: The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should register those passing out from SAITM medical courses as doctors. There is room for an appeal, but the general direction of the verdict is clear enough  SAITM degrees have to be recognized by the relevant professional bodies.
The level of hostility displayed towards SAITM and its students by the medical fraternity, including Government medical students is somewhat surprising given that the very same segments did not utter a word when the previous Government started a medical faculty at the Kotelawala Defence Academy (KDU).
It is also difficult to comprehend why medical studies have to be singled out for a different policy when many public and private educational institutions in Sri Lanka offer degree-level courses in practically all other sectors including engineering, the second most aspired for course among A/L students. No one has objected to these institutions or courses, some of which have existed for a couple of decades or more.
Then there is the paradoxical situation of the SLMC recognizing medical graduates who have completed their studies abroad (e.g. in Russia or Nepal) after they pass the Act 16 Examination. The SLMC and the GMOA which have raised doubts about the efficacy of the SAITM seem to have accepted these overseas qualified graduates without questioning the quality of the facilities and teaching personnel at many lesser known overseas medical schools. On the other hand, the clinical and teaching facilities at Malabe-based SAITM can be inspected and any improvements can be suggested.
In the above paragraph we touched on an aspect that opponents of private universities rarely admit. Hundreds, if not thousands of Sri Lankan students enroll in foreign universities each year which results in a massive drain of foreign exchange. If Sri Lanka has enough high quality private universities to cater to the students who are unable to enter the state universities due to capacity constraints (only around 25,000 students can enter State universities per year), the Treasury can save millions of dollars. There is also the possibility of attracting students from other South Asian countries to private universities here, which can actually bring in foreign exchange.
Thousands of private universities exist around the world, including those offering degrees in medicine. We do not have to look far for inspiration  neighbouring India has around 250 private universities, with Rajasthan alone having 42. We indeed have a long way to go.
However, there is no question that private universities and indeed all private educational institutions including international schools have to be thoroughly regulated. This should not be a difficult process. If the GMOA and other medical bodies are truly interested in developing healthcare systems, they should cooperate with the Government to improve any alleged shortcomings in private medical education without launching trade union actions on this issue.
This Government has not been reluctant to admit that it is in favour of promoting private education which includes private universities. Judging by the comments made by the public in both the vernacular and English press, a majority of people seem to be in favour of private universities. The GMOA as a trade union should not agitate about a policy decision of the Government and a court order which seek to improve healthcare facilities. It is well known that GMOA doctors conveniently strike only during the working hours of Government hospitals  in the evenings, most of them can be found in their channeling consultation rooms in private hospitals. This gives the distinct impression that they do not care for the poor and innocent people who come to Government hospitals for treatment.
The doctors must bear in mind the fact that these very same people have paid for their free medical education through duties and taxes. Indeed, it is pathetic that most university students and professionals do not value free education as they do not have to pay for it. This is human nature  people tend to value things they actually pay for. But there is nothing called a free lunch  all Sri Lankans, from the farmer in the field to the domestic worker in the Middle East pay for free education.
The Government medical students behaviour on the roads last week cannot be condoned. They do have a democratic right to protest, but they should not inconvenience the public. Traffic was held up on rush hour, with people having to wait in cars and buses. The medical students also exhibited their darker side, hooting at the police. The public expects higher moral standards from the would-be doctors  in this country, the medical profession is held in high regard. However, incidents of this nature can erode that feeling of respect.
We are now nearing the third decade of the 21st century and it is time to discard certain archaic notions about education, which is a dynamic field that needs private sector participation. Both the Government and the private sector have a role to play, separately and together, to take education to greater heights.

England finish strongly to edge France 19-16
LONDON, Saturday - England overcame a poor first half to grind down France for a 19-16 victory to open the defence of their Six Nations title on Saturday, setting a national record of 15 successive victories in the process.
England were lucky to be level at 9-9 at halftime and trailed 16-12 after an hour as Rabah Slimani scored the opening try for France.
However, England's strength off the bench turned the game as the replacements poured on and one of them, centre Ben Teo, grabbed the decisive try nine minutes from time.
The performance was ugly, but the result is beautiful, said relieved England coach Eddie Jones. We made some silly handling errors, but we have some great finishers on the bench, we got really good value from them. Captain Dylan Hartley added: Week one of the tournament we'll take that win, but there's plenty to work on.
Last season England started poorly in Paris before emerging 31-21 winners to secure the grand slam and they were again slow out of the blocks on home ground.
A first half full of errors, poor decisions and the concession of avoidable penalties  including one dangerous tackle that earned Jonny May a yellow card  ensured that France were in the driving seat.
However, both defences were solid and three Camille Lopez penalties for the visitors against two from Owen Farrell and a monster 48-metre effort by Elliot Daly produced the only points.
France, seeking their first Six Nations title since 2010 and with only one tournament win at Twickenham in the past 20 years, will have been frustrated not to have taken more from their impressive opening, with young scrumhalf Baptiste Serin looking a lively addition.
England were much more assured in the second half and after Daly had a try ruled out for a toe in touch, finally edged ahead with another Farrell penalty after sustained pressure.
France then struck with their first attack of the half on the hour mark as good aggressive running and great offloads by the forwards sent replacement prop Slimani over.
England coach Eddie Jones responded by throwing on most of his bench, who made an immediate impact.
James Haskell, who has barely played this season, looked a man possessed and after a superb passage of play, Teo blasted through with Farrell converting.
This time England were not about to let the lead slip and showed the sort of game-closing nous that was their trademark under Clive Woodward when his side set the previous record of 14 straight wins from 2002-03.
After Scotland's surprise victory over Ireland earlier on Saturday, England's title odds have shortened dramatically and they will travel to Wales next Saturday delighted to have found a way to dig out this victory.
There was plenty for the French to like too as they turn their attention to next Sunday's game against the Scots in Paris but the immediate reaction was one of frustration.

Export earnings, workers  remittances increase marginally
External sector records modest performance in October
Sri Lankas external sector recorded a modest performance in October 2016 with a deterioration in the trade deficit amidst continued growth in tourist earnings,the Central Bank said.
The trade deficit widened in October as a result of higher import expenditure despite a marginal growth in export earnings.
The significant increase in import expenditure in October 2016 was primarily due to the import of a dredger vessel for the Port City construction project. Meanwhile, workers remittances were marginally higher while a healthy growth was observed in earnings from tourism during October 2016. Although inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and long term loan proceeds to the government supported the financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP), the government securities market witnessed a net outflow during October 2016.
Earnings from exports at US dollars 855 million in October 2016 reflected a marginal growth of 0.9 per cent from US dollars 847 million in October 2015. Industrial exports, led by machinery and mechanical appliances, petroleum products, rubber products, textile and garments exports, largely contributed to this growth while agricultural exports declined. Earnings from the export of machinery and mechanical appliances increased by 32.6 per cent, year-on-year, in October 2016 mainly due to higher exports of engineering equipment. Despite the decline in bunkering prices, export earnings from petroleum products increased owing to higher (52 per cent) export volumes of bunker and aviation fuel. Export income from rubber products also showed a growth mainly due to higher earnings from the export of surgical and other gloves as well as rubber tyres.
In addition, income from textile and garment exports, which accounts for around 46 per cent of total export earnings, increased by 1.3 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 392 million, mainly due to the growth in garment exports to non-traditional markets, such as Canada, China, Australia and the UAE, despite a decline in exports to the European Union (EU) market. Export earnings from tea, which account for about 13 per cent of total exports, however, declined by 9.4 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 108 million, reflecting lower export volumes despite the increase in the average export price by 14.7 per cent, year-on-year, in October 2016. Further, earnings from the export of spices declined by 21.8 per cent, year-on-year, due to lower export volumes of all major spices, including cinnamon.
However, seafood exports to the EU continued their impressive growth for the 5th consecutive month after the lifting of the ban on fisheries exports from Sri Lanka to the EU. Export earnings from seafood increased due to higher prices and volumes, specifically to the EU, which accounts for about 21 per cent of seafood exports.
On a cumulative basis, export earnings during the first ten months of 2016 at US dollars 8,618 million, contracted by 2.6 per cent, year-on-year, reflecting lower proceeds from transport equipment and petroleum products.
Agricultural exports, such as tea and spices, also contributed to the contraction in exports during this period. However, earnings from textile and garment exports, which account for about 48 per cent of total exports, increased during the first ten months of 2016 due to higher exports to both traditional and non-traditional markets.
The leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during the first ten months of 2016 were the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy, accounting for about 52 per cent of total exports.
Import Performance Expenditure on imports increased by 16.4 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 1,906 million in October 2016.
The increase in expenditure on imports was mainly due to the importation of a dredger vessel by CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd, which was categorised under investment goods. Excluding this, expenditure on imports increased by 5.2 per cent, year-on-year, in October 2016. Import expenditure on intermediate goods and food and beverages increased by 9.6 per cent and 44.1 per cent, respectively, while that on other consumer goods decreased by 25.8 per cent.
The increase in intermediate goods imports was largely driven by the higher import expenditure on textiles and textile articles, gold and fuel. Import expenditure on textiles and textile articles increased by 35.5 per cent due to the increase in import expenditure on fabric. Import expenditure on gold amounted to US dollars 57 million in October 2016, in comparison to a negligible value recorded in October 2015. Import expenditure on crude oil, refined petroleum and coal increased by 4.5 per cent, 14.4 per cent and 8.1 per cent, respectively.
Import expenditure on investment goods, excluding the importation of the dredger vessel in October 2016, increased by 8.0 per cent during the month. Import expenditure on building material increased by 6.3 per cent, year-on-year, with import expenditure on cement increasing by 65.5 per cent and that on articles of iron and steel decreasing by 29.4 per cent. Expenditure on road vehicle imports decreased by 13.9 per cent, mainly owing to the decrease in auto-trishaw imports despite a substantial increase in import of lorries and agricultural-tractors.
Expenditure on consumer goods imports contracted by 6.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 377 million in October 2016, with an increase in expenditure on food and beverages and a reduction in expenditure on other consumer goods. The increase in import expenditure on food and beverages was driven mainly by the increase in import volumes and increased prices of sugar. Import expenditure on vegetables, spices, fruits and beverages also increased significantly. The decline in import expenditure on other consumer goods was due to the reduction in the import of personal motor vehicles. Expenditure on imports at US dollars 15,852 million during the first ten months of 2016 increased marginally by 0.2 per cent from the corresponding period of the previous year. On a cumulative basis, import expenditure on food and beverages, other consumer goods and intermediate goods reduced while that on investment goods increased. China, India, Singapore, the UAE and Japan were the main import origins during the first ten months of 2016, accounting for about 58 per cent of total imports.
Workers Remittances Receipts from workers remittances increased marginally by 0.4 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 607.5 million during October 2016 from US dollars 605.1 million in October 2015. However, cumulative inflows from workers remittances during the first ten months of 2016 amounted to US dollars 5,989.5 million, a growth of 3.5 per cent, in comparison to US dollars 5,787.3 million in the corresponding period of 2015. Financial Flows Foreign investments in the CSE recorded a net inflow of US dollars 8.3 million in October 2016. However, cumulative foreign investments in the CSE during the first ten months of 2016 recorded a net outflow of US dollars 10.8 million. This included a net outflow of US dollars 12.2 million from the secondary market and an inflow of US dollars 1.4 million to the primary market. Foreign investments in the government securities market recorded a net outflow of US dollars 157.2 million in October 2016. On a cumulative basis, the net outflow of foreign investments in the government securities market amounted to US dollars 109.2 million during the first ten months of the year in comparison to a net outflow of US dollars 1,043.3 million during the corresponding period of 2015. During the first ten months of 2016, the government received long term loans amounting to US dollars 950.6 million on a net basis, in comparison to a sum of US dollars 226.2 million received during the first ten months of 2015. Overall BOP Position During the first ten months of 2016, the overall BOP is estimated to have recorded a deficit of US dollars 273.6 million, in comparison to a deficit of US dollars 2,337.2 million recorded during the corresponding period of 2015. International Reserves and Exchange Rate Movements Sri Lankas gross official reserves as at end October 2016 amounted to US dollars 6.1 billion, equivalent to 3.8 months of imports, while total foreign assets stood at US dollars 8.5 billion, equivalent to 5.3 months of imports.
The rupee, which depreciated by 3.8 per cent against the US dollar in 2016, recorded a further depreciation of 0.5 per cent from end 2016 to 02 February 2017. Reflecting cross currency movements, the rupee also depreciated against the euro by 2.7 per cent, the pound sterling by 3.5 per cent, the Japanese yen by 3.3 per cent, the Canadian dollar by 3.8 per cent, the Australian dollar by 5.7 per cent and the Indian rupee by 1.2 per cent during this period.

Skittish investor sentiment along with minimal retail activity dragged indices lower, but HNI and Institutional investors made a strong return this week as they accumulated mid-caps such as ASIR (39% of crossings), and blue-chips such as HHL (16% of crossings), HNB and JKH (10% of crossings) and COMB (4% of crossings).
Crossings over the week consequently amounted to ~58% of the weeks total turnover (cf. ~25% last week and ~67% the week prior) helping push daily average turnover levels 44.2% higher over the week (to LKR 0.69Bn).
Foreign investors meanwhile, reverted back to a net buying position, with inflows of LKR 108.6Mn helping pare down last weeks net outflows of LKR 285.0Mn.
Meanwhile, initial corporate earnings for the quarter ended Dec16 has been mixed with ~ 59% of the 41 companies who have reported earnings thus far recording year-on-year growth in earnings.
With earnings releases gathering pace over the next few weeks, Markets are likely to cues from the overall direction of the earnings.
Equity markets in the week ahead are also likely to look to next weeks Monetary policy meeting (the 1st of the 8 meetings scheduled for the year) for future direction.
Cumulative 10 month B-o-P improves
The Balance-of-Payments (B-o-P) during the first 10 months of 2016 improved to a deficit of $273.6Mn relative to a deficit of $ 2.4Bn in the comparable period in 2015 (deficit of $1.5Bn for full year 2015*).
Import expenditure over the period remained largely flat (+0.2% Y-o-Y) as imports of consumer goods fell 9.2% Y-o-Y) led by declines in Vehicle imports (-42.8% Y-o-Y).
Imports of intermediate goods meanwhile, fell 1.3% Y-o-Y over the 10-month period led by declines in Fuel imports (-15.7% Y-o-Y).
However, fuel imports over the month of October rose 10.9% Y-o-Y with refined petroleum imports increasing 14.4% Y-o-Y due to higher thermal power generation over the latter half of 2016.
Imports of investment goods too, rose over the 10-month period (+13.2% Y-o-Y) with a notable increase in October (+52.2% Y-o-Y) due to the importation of a dredger vessel by CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd.
Exports over the 10-month period meanwhile, declined 2.6% Y-o-Y helping push the countrys trade deficit 3.7% Y-o-Y higher over the period.
Nevertheless, steady service and financial flows helped ease pressure on the overall B-o-P position over Jan-Oct with stronger tourism earnings (+14.6% Y-o-Y) and steady worker remittances ($5.9Bn) along with easing net outflows from G-Sec ($109.2Mn cf. $1.0Bn in 2015) and fund from ISB issuances and long-term loans helping financial flows.

How to battle hateful workplace tittle-tattle
Problems at work are anything but uncommon. One of the most recurrent problems that someone might run into is slander in the workplace. This can be malicious gossip, or outright lies. Slanderous gossip in the workplace involves telling lies or spreading half-truths that might hurt or damage someones reputation when they are not present to defend themselves.
Such defamatory tittle-tattle is widespread in most workplaces. Sometimes, it seems, as if people have nothing better to do than engage in scandalous chit-chat. Ok, lets admit it. It is darn difficult not to become involved in tell-tale natter at work. After all, people revel in gossip and fascinating bits of scandalous information that beats the pants off monotony any day. It is true that in small communities and workplaces scandalous rumour travels at the speed of boredom.
In every community or institution there is always a great deal of idle chit-chat swirling around. Yet we are all aware that juicy calumny is what no one claims to like, but everybody enjoys. The only time we dislike slanderous hearsay is when gossips gossip about us. And always remember the old adage that whoever gossips to you will be certain to gossip about you. Although most people will claim to disapprove of such damaging chatter, curiously enough in these same places of employment there are so many who dont approve talking about others behind their back. Slander in the workplace will often continue to happen, even if there are rules mandating that employees not participate in this type of behaviour.
Learning how to deal with slander in the workplace involves understanding why it happens in the first place. Most people engage in defaming others because of deeply entrenched fears that they have about their own values and life. These low-life creepy, crawly creatures are referred to as the Slander Serpents who slither around hissing their poisonous canards into as many scandal-starved ears as possible.
Bringing a lawsuit
There are also some who use mudslinging as a shield so that they can participate in conversations without having to reveal anything about themselves or their own feelings. Bringing a lawsuit against a company that you work for is an option if the slander becomes so severe that it causes harm to your reputation that is life damaging.
But not everyone wants to go to such lengths to deal with slander in the workplace. Gossiping can develop like a cancer spreading through the office and creating a backbiting and stressful environment where half-truth and innuendo replaces truthful transparency. Spiteful workplace gossip is self-defeating, corrosive and belittles both the speaker and the person who is the victim of the gossip.
It can be a vicious way in which ambitious staff may see to undermine a competitor. Or it may be idle gossips, lacking a motive, but still being corrosive and damaging. Rumour can be an insidious form of bullying. It is demeaning. It promotes lies and half truths about people when they are not present. It is often designed to hurt and denigrate people and destroy reputations behind their backs. It is equivalent to a bullying episode putting someone down or denigrating them without the victim knowing it is occurring. The victim may only be aware of sniggers behind their back and the whispers in the background, which can destroy morale and trust.
Here are some tips on how to battle malicious tittle-tattle. One of the first things you can do to help with the problem of slander in the workplace is to not participate in it yourself. The main reason you dont want to do this is that if you do say the wrong thing, the person you are talking about can take you to court. Another reason that it is best to avoid such prattle is that you earn a reputation as being a gossiper.
Derogatory tales
If you do hear someone gossiping about a co-worker, you could talk to them and ask them to stop for the good of themselves and the entire workplace. Explain how they could end up in court for spreading derogatory tales about others. They should be apprised why such behaviour is just not on in the workplace, making it impossible for colleagues to get along with one another. In the case of someone gossiping about you, the best thing to do is to try and find out where the gossip started. Office gossip can spread like wildfire and you really have to take some time to find out who started it. Once you know this, talk with that person and ask them why they are saying damaging things about you.
If the slander has got so out of hand that makes it uncomfortable to go to work, talk with your boss or supervisor about the situation. Ask them to take care of the problem. In many cases this helps curb the scandal mongering. But if it doesnt you do have the option of changing your place of employment.
Spreading their evil
Thus, the poisoned smear campaigns spread their evil like a virus, not only reaping anger, fear and distress about the intended prey, but compounding it with accusations and lost friendships. Such bad-mouthing is often sparked as a result of malignant envy. They are people obsessed with a revolting emotion which focuses on the removal or destruction of the envied object and his or her reputation. More often than not the muck-raking is triggered by jealousy, spite or malice.
It can be tempting to listen in on office gossip but to do so puts your career at risk. Although work may be frustrating for you at times, it's best not to indulge in the exchange of incendiary workplace stories, even if it helps you cope with your frustrations.
The best thing to do is disassociate yourself from the person and try to defuse any gossip when you find yourself unable to get away. Slander in the workplace is simply wrong and detestable. Not only should you curb any gossip about others if you hear it, but you should not participate in giving ear to it. If everyone could follow this simple advice, spending time at work could be a more pleasant experience.

I was forced into a deal with India, Jayewardene told U.S. envoy
Sri Lanka was forced into making a deal with India as its own armed forces had twice refused to take Jaffna, then President J.R. Jayewardene had been quoted as saying in a declassified document, nearly 30 years after the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was deployed in the island nation.
Jayewardene told visiting American diplomat Peter Galbraith that he had twice ordered his troops to take Jaffna  burn the place to the ground  and they had talked him out of it on grounds of unacceptably high casualties. A little over 1,200 Indian soldiers died in IPKF operations against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in northern and eastern Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990.
In May 1991, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had signed the July 1987 peace deal with Jayewardene, was assassinated by the LTTE. In response to significant promises of devolution of powers to the Tamil minority and recognition of Tamil as an official language, India agreed to provide military assistance  the IPKF  to ensure peace according to the 1987 Gandhi-Jayewardene accord.A mad fellowHe [Mr. Jayewardene] made clear that he shared the GOIS [Government of Indias] implacable hostility toward Prabakaran, calling the LTTE leader a mad fellow,  a declassified CIA document said about the February 1988 conversation.
He stressed, though without obvious bitterness, that none of his outside friends would help him, so he had no choice but to make a deal with India, the CIA document read.Interestingly, the then President opened up to Mr. Galbraith and said he would hold elections in the Tamil-populated northern and eastern provinces in Sri Lanka.
Polls were finally held in November 1988.Mr. Galbraith also provides an insight into the relations between the IPKF and the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), and the ground situation in the Jaffna peninsula after being flown to the area during his visit.the IPKF and the Sri Lankan forces are getting on well together, andthe situation in Jaffna, while still far from normal, is gradually improving, the American diplomat said in an assessment.
An SLA officer, Brigadier Jayaratne, is quoted in the memo as saying: The IPKF is doing a jolly good job in Jaffna. He added that the SLA and the Indian troops were getting along famously, like a house on fire. The document recounted that the Indian officers were warm and responsive in their interaction with the American visitors, which included Mr. Galbraith and the then U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka.
It appears that the Americans also played a behind-the-scenes role in ensuring channels of communication between President Jayewardene and Prime Minister Gandhi, a second declassified CIA document said. In 1986, Jayewardene held a very negative view of India given that New Delhi had been training Tamil insurgents as he conveyed to visiting U.S. Senator Charles H. Percy.
I am a very peaceful man. But Indias role in this [ethnic] matter is reprehensible and the Indians have to be held responsible for their actions. Percy, who carried a letter from U.S. President Ronald Reagan to Jayewardene, offered to be of assistance in conveying any message from the Sri Lankan President to Rajiv Gandhi.Indian interventionInterestingly, a third CIA intelligence assessment of September 1986 stated that India was rapidly expanding its armed forces to intervene in Sri Lanka.India, it said, was improving its ability to deploy airborne troops.
The paratroopers probably would try to seize an airfield so that reinforcements could be brought in by air. U.S. defence attach sources report the Army and Air Force practised such an operation late last year [1985] at Trivandrum, with the assault force receiving offshore fire support from Navy ships. Trivandrum, the memo argued, resembled Colombo in topography.In the CIAs assessment, India would intervene in Sri Lanka in two scenarios  one, if the government collapsed and, the other, if Tamil insurgents established a separate State.
In our view, an Indian intervention would most likely come [exactly what happened in 1987], as in 1971 [to deal with Marxist insurgents] following a request from Colombo to help in restoring internal order, the assessment said.
Interestingly, the CIA believed that the poorly trained Sri Lankan Army would offer token resistance and opposition to a prolonged Indian intervention would come from Tamil and, possibly, Sinhala insurgents.-

The Importance of Play: On Finding Joy in your Writing Practice
On the last morning of a writers retreat I went to a year ago, there was a tiny bell lying on the seat of every chair in the spacious conference center. The weekend was unlike any gathering of writers Id ever been to: for two days, we attendees had listened, enthralled, to one heresy after another. Find a hobby that isnt writing, one speaker said. Take walks. Do yoga. Dont be literary. Be a human being. Another went further. It doesnt take that much time to get writing done, she said, and a gasp rippled through the audience. Here were writers who took their art seriously, but not themselvesat least, not all the time.
I was charmed to find the little trinket on my seat. What was it for While the auditorium began to fill, people traded them, pocketed them, bounced them from hand to hand.
One of the workshop leaders took the microphone. He asked us to take our bells, hold them as tightly as we could, and give them a shake. Nothing happened, although several faces turned red with exertion.
Now take your bell, he said, hold it loosely in your hand, and shake it.
Lovely tinkling music filled the giant room up to its vaulted ceiling.
Thats how you need to approach writing, he told usnot with clenched fists, but with open hands.
Relaxed. Playful. Open to possibility.
I returned home from the weekend, set the bell on my desk, and told myself the next hour or two was just for fun. Then I started to writewith results that surprised me. I began to wonder if other writers knew something I didnt. Could writing be as enjoyable at the outset as at the conclusion Could it bedare I say itsomething close to play
I interviewed four of my favorite writers to find out, and, although they didnt all use (or even like) the word play, some clear themes began to emerge. Themes like surprise, laughter, and a willingness to let go of self-consciousness and convention. These writers have discovered ways to bring joy into their work, so perhaps its no surprise that their writing is a delight to read.
One of the workshop leaders at the retreat was Brenda Miller. As she walked us through the steps of writing short, powerful pieces, like her much-anthologized apologia Swerve and the sensory-rich What I Could Eat, she couldnt stop smiling. On the last day of the conference, I asked her about her generative writing group, which meets every week to do a series of unusual exercises: first, five minutes of subject-verb-object sentences; then, ten minutes of linking sentences; and finally, one long, continuous run-on sentence for twenty minutes. I was puzzled by so much prescription.
Its an interesting paradox, she said.
Sometimes, the more constraints we give ourselves, the more fun we can have. Think about the rules of a sport or a game: while a free-for-all may sound like fun, we often prefer to have rules and guidelines, and to see how much creativity and mastery we can accomplish within those guidelines. For these particular exercises (which were taught to me by the artist and writer Nancy Canyon), the rules give your intellectual mind something to concentrate on, and then your subconscious mind can come out to play. The time limit quiets the inner censor and forces you to keep writing whatever comes out.
Miller said she also plays in her writing practice by trying pieces as hermit crab essays:
In a hermit crab piece, you are adopting already existing forms to tell your story, such as a recipe, a how-to article, etc. Ive written pieces in the forms of rejection notes, field guides, a table of figures, and how-to pieces. I end up having so much fun developing and playing with the voices of these forms that the writing barely seems like work. In the rejection note piece, titled, We Regret to Inform You, I begin by cataloging all the rejections one receives from grade school on, so it starts on a lighthearted note and gets progressively more serious as the chronology goes along, including my experiences with two miscarriages in my early twenties.
Miller has talked about seasons in her writing lifewriting in solitude, writing in community, and, most recently, writing in collaboration:
Ive been doing two different collaborations over the last year: one with my colleague and friend Lee Gulyas and one with my friend Julie Marie Wade. With Lee, weve been trading photographs and writing to the images, sometimes together and sometimes individually. You never know what the image will trigger, how our two perspectives will either mesh or diverge.
With Julie, weve written many different kinds of essays, usually with one of us starting on a specific topic and lobbing the essay back to the other. In this way, the essay builds bit by bit, shifting directions, always surprising us. Sometimes, it feels like a conversation with each section referring directly to something that came before (such as the essay Toys in CNF #60); sometimes, it feels more like parallel play.
I asked if she had always approached writing with this attitude of play.
I can say that after writing for more than thirty years, and teaching for almost twenty, I had to find some new ways to approach the writing process, or I would have stopped writing altogether. As a creative nonfiction writer, it can be easy to feel like youve used up your material, so the emphasis becomes finding new perspectives and forms. And yes, this approach makes me very happy to write. I get that thrill of writing something new and unexpected almost every time I come out to play.

Indias cricket board rejects proposal to trim revenue
New Delhi: India has voted against a proposed shake-up of crickets global governing body that threatens its influence as one of the games Big Three powers along with Australia and England.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India rejected a proposal to radically alter the financial and governance structure of the International Cricket Council, a move that would curb its earnings and clout.
A majority of Test playing nations -- including Australia and England -- agreed to the proposed restructure at the ICCs headquarters in Dubai.
But India and neighbouring Sri Lanka rejected the idea, and unsuccessfully sought to postpone a decision until the next ICC gathering in April.
Vikram Limaye, Indias representative in Dubai, said the board had insufficient time to take an informed view on the proposal.
The ICC announcement comes just days after Indias Supreme Court appointed a new team to oversee the cricket board, after sacking its top officials for failing to implement reforms.
Indias cricket body is the wealthiest in the world, attracting one-fifth of all ICC global revenue.
If adopted, the proposal would reverse a 2014 decision to cede control of the ICC to the Big Three, a move which saw Australia, India and England attract the lions share of the games global revenue.
The ICC, under the guidance of Indias Shashank Manohar, wants to revise the revenue sharing model to ensure equitable distribution and equal weight of votes for all 105 board members, regardless of their membership status.
Today was an important step forward for the future of the ICC and cricket around the world, said Manohar Saturday, referring to progress on the proposed reforms.
Crickets global governing body said Saturday it had reached agreement in principle to constitutional and financial change, adding a detailed proposal will be put to the ICC board in April.
Indias cricket board has been undergoing its own sweeping changes, with a panel headed by former government auditor Vinod Rai the latest development in its shakeup.
The board has been embroiled in a series of scandals, including accusations of corruption in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a betting scandal involving an IPL team linked to its former head Narayanaswami Srinivasan. AFP

JVP, GMOA to unite to fight SAITM

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) and the JVP held a discussion this morning (6) on the SAITM issue and agreed to fight together on a common platform to defeat SAITM.
SAITM puts the medical service and patients' lives in a great danger, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He told the media that legal issues relating to the judgment by the Court of appeal on SAITM was discussed at the meeting as well as possible steps to be taken together in future to tackle the issue.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda confirmed the GMOA had met with JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Bimal Ratnayake and others.
We especially discussed the strong disapproval for SAITM by three independent academic expert committees, which is the committee appointed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), the committee appointed by the Health Ministry and the committee of the state Medical Faculty Deans.
These are the committees any country in the world appoints to make recommendations on health and medical education, he said.
Dr. Ananada said the GMOA and the JVP would fight on a common platform against SAITM. We agreed that the responsibility of safeguarding patients' rights belong to all of us.
Therefore we will do certain things in future together to maintain the minimum standard of medical education in Sri Lanka, he said.
We agreed that it is the SLMC which is the supreme body when it comes to regulating the standard of medical education and patients' safety in Sri Lanka similar to any other country in the world.
The GMOA will meet some parliamentarians today and tomorrow.
Requests have already been made to meet the President and the Prime Minister, he added.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman Prof. Carlo Fonseka said that the Council would call an emergency session on Wednesday where they are expected to take certain crucial decisions.

Kandy keeps league title intact with Havies win
Kandy Sports Club quenched their thirst to retain the league trophy for yet another year when they thrashed title-seeking Havelock SC by 26 points (4 tries, 1 penalty, 1 drop goal) to 11 (1 try, 2 penalties) in their Dialog A division league rugby second round match played under lights at Havelock Park yesterday.
Kandy showed better control of the ball under flood light conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing second half rally.
The Kandy boys put up an unthinkable effort to topple the Havelocks who led 3-0 with a Dulaj Perera penalty in the 5th minute.
The winners dared to run the ball and gained in meters whenever a gap in the opponents defence was detected.
Kandy was always sure of what to do, in contrast to the Havies who only knew to run straight, often ramming into their opposite numbers.
Havies, who dominated the first 20 minutes of the first half lost the grip as they seemed hampered and hopes of winning seemed thrust under a dark cloud when the teams place kicker, Dulaj Perera who put over a 35-meter penalty was carried off the field with a serious knee injury and didnt take any further part in the match.
In the 13th minute Kandy equalled the score to 3-all with a Thilina Wijesinghe 30-metre drop goal. They scored again with a Richard Dharmapala unconverted try in the 20th minute to grab the lead 8-3.
Havies closed the gap to 8-6 with a Rahul de Silva penalty in the 32nd minute.
At half time the score read 8-6 in Kandys favour.
Kandy made a striking return to the game in the second half with two tries scored in the 56th and 61st minutes through hooker Damith Dissanayaka and centre Danushka Ranjan. Wijesinghe missed both the conversions. Kandy led 18-6.
In the 67th minute Havelocks cut down the lead when centre Nishone Perera scored the try of the match going through six Kandy defenders. Rahul de Silva missed the conversion and the score read 18-11.
The Hill capital boys increased the lead to 21-11 with a simple Wijesinghe penalty in the 76th minute.
The winners who enjoyed the major share of possession from the set pieces, sealed the game in the 80th minute when Srinath Sooriyabandara found his way over the Havies try line from a midfield run, Wijesinghe who had a miserable day with the boot missed the conversion for the final score to read 26-11.
Referee: Charlie Brown (Singapore)
Police SC upsets Army 27/21
In another Dialog A division league match played at Army grounds in Diyagama yesterday, Police SC beat Army SC by 27 points (3 tries, 3 conversions, 2 penalties) to 21 (3 tries, 3 conversions). At half time the winners lead 20-7.

Keeping national spirits high
National pride is inherent to every nation. Every nation upholds her own national identity with the national flag in the global arena. Sri Lanka is no exception, though comparatively small in size, albeit cognitively, culturally, socially, politically, to top them all intellectually and affectively play no second fiddle to any other nation on earth.
Our pristine glory, international relations and cultural roots that date back to centuries and centuries bear ample testimony for our presence.
Our national anthem and the national flag are definitely two significant columns that hold our spirits high. They are inseparable.
The time is opportune more than ever before to imbibe the quintessence and breathe the fragrance of both for the forward march of the nation to bestow her legacy to the posterity.
The national flag deserves the pride of place at the nations Independence Day and it enhances its pride when it goes high to the tune of the national anthem.
They tune up the grace and majesty of the nation that descends from a lion. The fluttering lion flag high above the nations rulers injects new blood for the frog leap of the nation to prosperity.
The nuance in the above preamble facilitates us to derive the true essence of the national flag with a renewed spirit today.
British colony
It is associated with nations respect. It is the symbolic presence of the nation even at United Nations Office at Geneva. Geneva is gained to the nation when it flutters undulating with other nations.
Following World War II, public pressure for independence increased. The British Colony of Ceylon achieved independence on February 4, 1948, with an amended constitution taking effect on the same date.
Independence was granted under the Ceylon Independence Act 1947. Military treaties with the United Kingdom preserved intact British air and sea bases in the country; British officers also continued to fill most of the upper ranks of the Army.
Don Stephen Senanayake became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon. Later in 1948, when Ceylon applied for United Nations membership, the Soviet Union vetoed the application. This was partly because the Soviet Union believed that the Ceylon was only nominally independent, and the British still exercised control over it because the white, educated elite had control of the government. In 1949, with the concurrence of the leaders of the Sri Lankan Tamils, the UNP government disenfranchised the Indian Tamil plantation workers. In 1950, Ceylon became one of the original members of the Colombo Plan, and remains a member as Sri Lanka.
Issue of national languages
Don Senanayake died in 1952 after a stroke and he was succeeded by his son Dudley. However, in 1953  following a massive general strike or Hartal by the Leftist parties against the UNP  Dudley Senanayake resigned. He was followed by John Kotelawala, a senior politician and an uncle of Dudley. Kotelawala did not have the personal prestige or the political acumen of D. S. Senanayake. He brought to the fore the issue of national languages that D. S. Senanayake had suspended. The Queen of Ceylon, Elizabeth II, toured the island in 1954 from April 1021.
It is aspirational and inspirational before the nation. Its true effect on the true patriot is felt in the whole blood circulation. Ones shoulders straighten when the auditory effect is felt. The earth feels it. In this sense, attitude formation in the children at their formative years about the national flag is of paramount importance.
My memory compels me to mention here how my father took me to the Independence Day celebrations in the city of Galle and passed on its value to me.
It still remains with me. Proper guidance by parents at tender age regarding national events goes a long way. Parents, teachers, elders and above all, the true patriotic rulers and writers could sow the seeds with the sublime aim of reaping the harvest later. The harvest would certainly be bountiful.
Lets resolve to put the country before self. Its the need of the hour. Its echo is heard in every nook and cranny in our cherished soil. Lets shun all the differences and march as one nation.

Lankas overall record of poverty reduction encouraging - World Bank
When N. Eswari came back to Sri Lanka after decades of work in the Middle East, she knew she was ready to settle down. She invested her savings in setting up a grocery store. Her little business thrived and with a loan from a local womens cooperative she was able to buy a fridge. She could now offer customers in her neighborhood yoghurt and cold drinks, and was turning over some 20,000 Sri Lankan rupees a day  more than she had hoped for.
Her own parents had never been particularly well off, but Eswari is supporting not just herself and her daughter, but an extended family of six. At 51, she says she is ready to start planning for retirement.
Eswari is one of many Sri Lankans who have seen their lives improve since the end of a nearly 30-year long civil war. Weve seen major progress since 2002. In this new era, we wanted to see how the economy and welfare of Sri Lankan citizens was being affected and improved, says David Newhouse, a senior economist with the World Bank and one of the authors of Sri Lanka Poverty and Welfare: Recent Progress and Remaining Challenges.
The report, which draws on data between 2002 and 2012, notes that trends in poverty have shifted, and better wages have transformed lives. Post-war domestic economic growth and fluctuations in global markets have reduced poverty and driven substantial changes in Sri Lankas economic environment.
Sri Lankas gradual transition out of agriculture, and the increase in urbanisation and agglomeration around the Colombo-Kandy-Galle corridor have brought workers greater access to more profitable opportunities. These parallel processes are a sustainable source of better livelihoods. However, challenges still remain. The question is, how can Sri Lanka build on its successes What gaps need to be addressed Below are some key findings.
Overall, Sri Lankas record of poverty reduction has been encouraging
We find that increase in labour earnings and higher returns to work is what drove the poverty reduction, says Newhouse. As demand for labour rose across a broad range of sectors, so did wages. The report highlights how sizeable increases in minimum agricultural wages led to higher earnings for agricultural workers. Excluding the Northern and Eastern provinces, the poverty headcount rate fell from about 22.7 percent in 2002 to 6.1 percent in 2012/13.
However, living standards remain low and pockets of severe poverty persist
However, pockets of severe poverty remain, cautions Newhouse. Whats striking is that there are such regional disparities, even among areas that are geographically close to each other.
The report identifies high levels of poverty in key districts in the north and east of the country, including Mullaitivu (28.8 percent), Mannar (20.1 percent) and Batticaloa district (19.4 percent). At 20.8 percent, the data from Monaragala district in Uva province also offers cause for concern. Within Batticaloa, estimated poverty rates run as high as 45 percent in Manmunai West and 38 percent in Karalai Pattu South.
Across the board, poverty rates are disproportionately high for vulnerable groups such as youth and ethnic minorities; and unemployment is high for youth and women.
The report highlights a contradiction in the Estate sector, which despite relatively low levels of monetary poverty, is severely disadvantaged in terms of alternative welfare indicators. These include access to education and healthcare, the quality of diet and the condition of housing. Such non-monetary indicators offer researchers and policymakers critical insights. Non-monetary poverty can take longer than purely monetary poverty to eradicate, but in some ways it is easier to measure and so it provides a very important complimentary indicator on welfare, says Newhouse.
Social assistance programs need attention
Sri Lanka has a very rich tradition of social and human capital investment both on the health and education side, and we are seeing dividends there, he says. However, the report notes that, in the long term, adjustments to Sri Lankas social protection system are necessary to address challenges related to a growing middle class and an aging population. Policies also need to be developed in order to speed up the structural transformation out of rural and peri-urban agriculture into more productive work.
Today in Sri Lanka some 11 different ministries oversee over 30 welfare programs. A lack of digital record-keeping has meant authorities can struggle to coordinate, monitor and evaluate their progress. As a result of such issues, some beneficiaries remain in the program longer than they should, while others in need never gain access.
Important knowledge gaps remain
While working on this report, Newhouse and his team became aware of many existing knowledge gaps. These included issues like a need for data on internal migration and access to infrastructure. Longitudinal data on how, or how frequently, households enter and exit poverty was also unavailable. The report noted that little is known about the underlying causes of the rise in labour demand  did workers skills improve or was technology used more effectively
There is also a call for more detail on the social assistance programs, some of which have run for decades. The evidence base in terms of their effects is quite weak, says Newhouse, pointing to a lack of rigorous impact evaluations of policies.
Bridging these knowledge gaps and documenting how public policies affect the poor can inform much-needed efforts to further improve their living standards. The report suggests practical steps that could include adding new questions to existing surveys on the quality of services and programs, supporting one-time evaluations of selected programs in particular areas, and establishing a longitudinal household survey.

Let butterflies flutter by...
Watching butterflies bask in the sun or flit from flower to flower has to be one of the 20 great pleasures of gardening. Here's how to give these gorgeous creatures a good place to hang out:
Give them a good home - for life: It's not just the lovely adults you want to attract: you want the babies too. The best butterfly habitat is a diverse landscape. Depending on the species, butterflies need particular host plants for laying eggs. You may think of plants like milkweed, wild mustard and nettles as weeds, but for some butterfly species, that's food for the young caterpillars.
A variety of broad- leafed trees and shrubs will provide cover from wind, rain and predators. Locate your butterfly garden in a sunny site; if you can't find a protected spot, plant a windbreak of mid-sized cultivars of dense conifers like spruce, juniper or cypress.
Plant nectar sources: Choose a wide range of flowering plants that differ in color, type of flower and bloom time to welcome multiple species and give them plenty of options. Butterflies feed on tubular flowers and they especially love those with "landing strips." Yarrow, stonecrop, coneflower, verbena, phlox, butterfly weed (Asclepias), bee balm, cardinal flower (Lobelia), coreopsis, black-eyed Susan, joe pye weed, pentas, and various asters and sedums can keep your garden in butterfly blooms throughout the season.
Butterfly bush (Buddleia) is an obvious choice for a butterfly garden, but keep in mind that this plant is pretty aggressive in the landscape. You'll need to regularly pull up volunteers. On the plus side, butterfly bushes offer nectar over a long period if you keep pruning off the spent blooms.
You can also supplement their diet with an artificial feeder; mix one part sugar to four parts water. An overripe banana or a melon rind will also do the trick.
Offer them a drink: Put a mixture of sand and soil in a plant saucer or a shallow bowl and add enough water to saturate the mixture thoroughly, but not so much that there's standing water. Butterflies like to rest on wet sand or soil and absorb moisture and minerals from it. If the "drinking station" dries out too fast in your climate, sink a bucket filled with a wet mixture of soil and sand into the ground.
Invite them to sunbathe: Cold-blooded insects, butteflies like to warm themselves in the sun. Create a few perches out of the wind; chances are you'll also see them resting on a sunny rock or on top of a fence post.

Let us commit to win economic freedom through sustainable development, poverty alleviation: President
President Maithripala Sirisena called upon all sections of the society to work with determination and commitment to win economic freedom through achieving the goal of sustainable development and poverty alleviation.
This goal will be achieved through the commitment of intellectuals, the strength of the labour force of workers and peasants, active participation of the youth of the nation as well as efficient utilisation of innovative human resource force, the President said.
Addressing the nation on the 69th Independence Anniversary at the Galle Face on Saturday, the President said economic freedom could be achieved through a knowledge based economy with innovative technical skills development.
He pointed out that the nation had the capacity and strength of skilled human resources and intellectuals as well as resourceful young generations to carry out such development endeavours.
The President said that in the 21st Century, the nation's need knowledge based education, knowledge economy, innovative economy, digital economy and in this process the youths should play a pivotal role. Stating that the youth of Sri Lanka has the determination and desire for absorbing new technology and innovative skills, he said the government would provide all requirements essential for the youths to obtain that knowledge.
The young generation are the inheritors and custodians of the building process of the knowledge based economy. I trust that the youths, intellectuals, politicians and all other sections of society would fulfill their responsibilities and duties with absolute commitment and determination to build the Motherland, President Sirisena said.
He said there is a new meaning in todays freedom as we are talking about a freedom that blows freely across the skies.
This is an era in which the human freedom, media freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of thought and freedom to assemble, freely blow across the skies.
The President, pointing out that there are strengths and weaknesses in social democracy and market economy, said we should understand those strengths and weaknesses to adopt a mixed system by obtaining positive segments of both the systems.
He emphasised the imperative need for eliminating corruption, bribery, malpractices, waste and fraud and said it is essential for the politicians and public servants to work honestly and with commitment.
When we attempt to achieve economic prosperity, it is essential for the politician to be a character of honesty and commitment. Furthermore, I trust the politicians and public servants to fulfill the responsibilities and duties honestly and with commitment to build the Motherland.
The President recalled the sacrifices made by all the communities to gain independence during various struggles from 1505 to 1948.
We have to remember that sweet fragrance of their great sacrifices with gratitude today. During the 30-year old conflict to liberate the country from the LTTE, the heroic soldiers made many sacrifices. Hundreds of thousands people sacrificed lives and limbs and their families also suffered immense difficulties. The economy was ruined. Today we have to ask the question whether all those who died were the losers and all those who are living are the victors I believe that all of us should learn a lesson from that, he said.
The President pointed out that the governments endeavour for reconciliation and communal harmony has been praised locally as well as internationally.
He said that he considers the opportunistic forces that are against reconciliation process as the forces against the country.
President Sirisena called upon everybody to fulfill the responsibilities and duties to build a nation which is economically prosperous, fortified in knowledge and maintains international goodwill.

## Title: The letters of Ernest Hemingway
## Supertitle:

The letters of Ernest Hemingway
The publication of Ernest Hemingways complete correspondence is shaping up to be an astonishing scholarly achievement. We are already on the third of a projected seventeen volumes, minimum, which will include in their entirety every surviving letter, postcard and telegram sent by Hemingway. Meticulously edited, with shrewd introductory summaries and footnotes tracking down every reference, the series brings into sharp focus this contradictory, alternately smart and stupid, blustering, fragile man who was also a giant of modern literature.
The third volume, ably edited by Rena Sanderson, Sandra Spanier and Robert W. Trogdon, takes us through a particularly eventful and productive patch of Hemingways life, from 1926 to 1929. At the beginning he is just tackling the rewrites of The Sun Also Rises (1926) and seeing through publication his satiric novel The Torrents of Spring (1926)  his first, chronologically speaking, though it is seldom credited as such. He will switch publishers to land with the prestigious editor Maxwell Perkins at Scribners, will write some of his greatest short stories for the collection Men Without Women (1927), and go on to compose his second proper novel, the hugely successful A Farewell to Arms (1929). Having entered the four-year period aged twenty-seven as a promising if uncommercial newcomer backed by obscure experimental presses, he will exit it at thirty transformed into a literary lion and international celebrity. In the process he will leave his first wife Hadley, on whose slender trust fund he has been subsisting, for his second wife Pauline Pfeiffer, a much more wealthy heiress; he will abandon bohemian Paris and return to the United States, indulging a newfound passion for big game fishing; his father will have committed suicide and he himself will assume the role of paterfamilias and the responsibility of extended family provider.
Painfully reserved
Throughout these years, Hemingway will dash off letters to some ninety-nine recipients, varying the tone with each: to Maxwell Perkins, for instance, he is respectful, keeping up the salutation Dear Mr. Perkins until well into their collaboration; to F. Scott Fitzgerald he is jokey but also longing for the other mans companionship; to his mother Grace, he is painfully reserved and hostile. He is most unbuttoned with chums and acolytes, who pose no threat. Ezra Pound brings out the nasty, name-calling side of Hemingway: anti-Semitic and homophobic terms like kikes and fairies abound (one is reluctant simply to blame the times), as well as vicious put-downs of his contemporaries. He is often threatening to sock someone on the nose. Letter-writing seems to have offered him a chance to be casual, rash and wilfully unfair.
Considering what a conscientious stylist Hemingway was in his serious prose, he brought little precision or care to his correspondence. Nor did he use letters as an opportunity for introspection or self-examination. Indeed, he confessed to having a hard time putting his private life into them. He apologized for being an irregular, undependable correspondent, begging off with the excuse that he needed to save the verbal energy for his books. He loved to receive mail and be connected to the literary worlds gossip, but one senses his own responses were the reluctant obligatory dues paid to stay in that sphere. An irony of this monumental project is that Hemingway was not one of literatures great letter writers; his efforts are nevertheless steadfastly interesting to read, partly because he could never write poorly, and partly because they offer many insights into his character and milieu.
While Hemingway frequently expressed dissatisfaction with his writing, his comments about the actual problems involved in composing were sparse, in keeping with his conviction that Its a terrible mistake to talk about a book. He would state the number of pages hed written but little about their substance. As someone who never attended college, he was always playing catch-up, reading omnivorously, with an eye towards finding models for the rhetorically chaste style he tried to perfect. He had little patience for Whitman or Stendhal or Henry James. About James, his opposite, he wrote: My impression is that he knew NOTHING about people . . . . He seems to need to bring in a drawing room whenever he is scared he will have to think what the characters do the rest of the time and the men all without exception talk and think like fairies except a couple of caricatures of brutal outsiders. In the original draft of The Sun Also Rises he ridiculed James as impotent from a rumoured bicycling accident, but Maxwell Perkins made him change it.
Satirical takedown
Overall, Hemingways relationship to other writers, living or dead, was comparative and pugilistic: Writing whether you want it or not is competitive, he wrote to Perkins in September 1928. This outlook led him to demean many of his contemporaries, even  perhaps especially  those who had helped him on the way up. One famous example was his satirical takedown of Sherwood Anderson in The Torrents of Spring. Anderson had been one of his staunchest supporters, and Hemingway had learned a lot from the older writer. As he wrote to Owen Wister in March 1929: He wrote some stories that I thought were lovely  all the time he was working as an advertising writer but he wrote simply and to me, anyway, very beautifully  about people and the country and, its true, best of all about adolescence  he went to New York and a number of Jews  Stieglitz, W. Frank, Paul Rosenfeld got hold of him and turned his head with praise. Leave it to the Jews and New York to corrupt a pure admans soul. Hemingway thought Andersons 1925 novel Dark Laughter was mediocre, so he took it into his head to dash off a parody in a week. It may not have been accidental that he was also trying to get out of his contract with Horace Liveright, who published his first story collection, In Our Time (1925), and who had an option on his next book, in order to switch to Maxwell Perkins at Scribners. As Anderson was one of Liverights star authors, the publisher would be expected to reject Hemingways manuscript on that ground alone, even if he hadnt hated it.
Self-justifying letter
Almost nobody liked it, including Hemingways wife Hadley and his friend John Dos Passos, but Perkins agreed to publish it in order to sign up The Sun Also Rises and all his subsequent books. About the Torrents  I never could figure out what happened to it  I was very fond of it  but nobody else seemed to like it . . ., Hemingway wrote to an admirer, perplexedly.
He sent Anderson a self-justifying letter when it came out. You see I feel that if among ourselves we have to pull our punches, if when a man like yourself who can write very great things writes something that seems to me (who have never written anything great but am anyway a fellow craftsman) rotten, I ought to tell you so . . . . Outside of personal feelings nothing thats any good can be hurt by satire. When they next met, the two men had a few drinks and Hemingway came away feeling that everything was swell between them. Quite the contrary. As we learn from Lesley M. M. Blumes excellent book, Everybody Behaves Badly: The true story behind Hemingways masterpiece The Sun Also Rises, Anderson remained hurt for the rest of his life. He found Hemingways missive probably the most completely patronizing letter ever written . . . . It was a kind of funeral oration delivered over my grave.
It is instructive to read Everybody Behaves Badly in tandem with Volume 3 of Hemingways letters, which it precedes and overlaps with chronologically. Moreover, it fills in many gaps by reporting the reactions of those who suffered collateral damage from Hemingways exuberantly belligerent behaviour. He unabashedly took what he needed and usually moved quickly on  repaying most of his patrons for their generosity in unexpected ways, to put it mildly, Blume writes. Without sounding unduly disapproving or moralistic, Blume gives us a portrait of the artist as a young opportunist. We see him befriending, exploiting and ultimately turning on everyone who had benefited him: Anderson, Liveright, Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Robert McAlmon, Ford Madox Ford, Gerald and Sarah Murphy, Dorothy Parker, Donald Ogden Stewart. Blume also furnishes sketches of the original group who would be pressed into service as the thinly disguised cast of characters in The Sun Also Rises, starting with Harold Loeb (the unfortunate model for Robert Cohn). Hemingway had a little bit of poison for everyone during this time, and he was becoming quite adept at co-opting the lives and vulnerabilities of others as grist for his literary mill.
Blume maintains this calm, witty tone, though when she comes to the break-up with Hadley, you can sense her itching to pounce: Hemingway became irate when Hadley confronted him back in Paris.
Yes, he was having an affair, he admitted, but then he turned the tables on Hadley: she was the one doing irreparable damage to the marriage by bringing it up. Everything would have been just fine if she hadnt dragged it into the open  or at least, that was Hadleys interpretation of his position. Meanwhile, he was hiding the news of his divorce from his parents, and when he finally came clean to his father, he insisted that he had never been unfaithful to Hadley. He also let it be known to everyone that he was nobly letting all the royalties for The Sun Also Rises go to Hadley and their son left behind. Years later, in A Moveable Feast (1964), he would blame the rich expatriate crowd, the Murphys et al., for persuading him to leave Hadley and go with the more fashionable Pauline. (By that time he had left Pauline as well and was nostalgic for the Hadley years.)
The few letters to Hadley and Pauline that survive from this period are suffused with an expressive torment and self-pity uncharacteristic of Hemingway. In love with both women and not knowing how to resolve the problem, he felt he was going to pieces and considered killing himself. - Times Literary Supplement

A Long Game of Scrabble: A Memoir of Graham Greene
I saw a good deal of Graham Greene in the late forties and fifties. Once he mentioned that he was writing a film script. He told me the plot and it sounded pretty boring. I wondered who would want to see it. It turned out to be The Third Man. Grahams account of it ranks with Orwells of Animal Farm as the most inadequateprcis of a work by its author that I have heard or can imagine.
Graham was a great practical joker. Once he heard that Cyril Connolly was giving a party to which he felt he should have been invited, and telephoned Connolly in the middle of it saying in an assumed accent that he was their chimney sweep and would be coming first thing next morning, so would Mr. Connolly please have the dust covers over all the furniture The impersonation proved successful, for Connolly, after vainly pleading that the sweep should postpone his visit, obeyed, which must have been a tedious chore in the small hours after the last guest had gone.
Graham also invented a terrible game, usually played around midnight or later. Each of you opened the telephone directory at random, picked a name blindly and rang the number; the winner was whoever kept his or her victim talking the longest. Graham always won. He told me that he had discovered another Graham Greene, a retired solicitor in Golders Green. The first conversation between them went something as follows: Are you Graham Greene My name is Graham Greene, but Are you the man who writes these filthy novels No, I am a retired solicitor. Im not surprised youre ashamed to confess youre the author of this muck. No, really, I assure you If Id written them at least Id have the guts to admit it, etc. Graham told me that he had made several such calls using different accents, and that in the end the unfortunate man removed his name and number from the directory He also kept other peoples visiting cards, which he would use for a variety of harmless purposes, such as sending them across restaurants to friends who had not spotted him, with cryptic and sometimes obscene invitations written on them. This was the bright side of his temperament. I glimpsed the other side only a few times during these years, but I remember asking Edward Sackville-West, an old friend of his, what he thought Graham would be writing in twenty years, and nodding in agreement as Eddie replied, Oh, Graham will have committed suicide by then. The fifties were for me a period of great happiness and great torment, Graham wrote in Ways of Escape. Manic depression reached its height in that decade.
I had seen him fairly often in England without getting really close to him until, in November 1955, he passed through Stockholm on his way to Poland. His Swedish publisher, Ragnar Svanstrom, gave a dinner for him to which I was invited, and towards the end of the evening Graham asked if I would join him and the Svanstroms as his guest for dinner the following evening. I explained that I had a date, but he said, Bring the girl, adding, Perhaps you could bring one for me. Immediately he added, No, I was joking, but it seemed a good idea. I pondered, and thought of Anita Bjrk.
I had come to know Anita and her husband Stig Dagerman two years earlier, having met them at a party at Ragnar Svanstroms house in the skerries, and during the summer of 1953 had been a frequent visitor at their house in Enebyberg, a few miles north of Stockholm. Stig was the best writer of his generation in Sweden, and one of the best in Europe, the author of two brilliant plays. The Man Condemned to Death and The Shadow of Mart, and of several fine novels and short stories. Anita was a beautiful and gifted actress who had become internationally famous through her performance in the title role of Alf Sjbergs film, Miss julie; as a result, she was offered a Hollywood contract, but the moguls were alarmed when she arrived with Stig, to whom she was not yet married. The head of the studio, no paragon himself, begged her to marry Stig, explaining in a deathless phrase: We cant have immorality in Hollywood.
Anita replied that neither of them wished to marry and, on being told that under these circumstances the studio could not employ her, packed her bags and returned with Stig to Sweden. But a year later, in that summer of 1953t having by then produced a daughter, they decided they would after all marry. I was a guest at the wedding feast, at the end of which they pronounced me unfit to drive home.
I protested that I could not occupy the guest room on their wedding night, but they overruled me and together made up my bed before retiring into the bridal chamber.

Messi collects another record as Barca sink Athletic Bilbao
BARCELONA, Saturday: La Liga champions Barcelona stayed on the heels of leaders Real Madrid by coasting to a 3-0 home win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday as Lionel Messi became the club's top scorer from free kicks.
Paco Alcacer scored his first league goal since joining from Valencia last year by turning in a pass from Neymar in the 18th minute while Messi whipped in an angled strike in the 40th, his 27th goal from a free kick for Barca.
Aleix Vidal scored the most impressive goal of the game by finishing off an audacious solo run in the 67th minute.
Barca stayed second in the standings, moving one point behind Real Madrid having played two games more. The leaders were due to visit Celta Vigo on Sunday but the game was postponed after the Balaidos stadium roof was damaged by storms.
Third-placed Sevilla visit Las Palmas on Sunday.
Fernando Torres made the most of a rare start by scoring both goals as Atletico Madrid beat neighbours Leganes 2-0 on Saturday.
Torres, who made his debut for Atletico against Leganes back in 2001, looked lively throughout the game. He could have scored as early as the second minute when he came charging at goal on the counter-attack but his attempted chip missed the target.
He won a penalty in the 14th minute and followed up on the rebound to put the hosts in charge after Antoine Griezmann saw his spot kick repelled by goalkeeper Iago Herrerin.
Torres scored his second goal in the 51st minute, beating the offside trap and latching on to a through ball before calmly lifting it over Herrerin. Atletico are fourth in the standings on 39 points.
Valencia were thrashed 4-0 at home by tiny Eibar, Voro's side suffering a second straight defeat after their troubles had been temporarily eased by two consecutive wins. Valencia are 16th on 19 points, six above Sporting Gijon who occupy the final spot in the relegation zone. Eibar move up to seventh on 32 points.
Espanyol are also on 32 points, in eighth position, after winning 1-0 at Malaga, their third consecutive league win.

More chores plus more risks equals happy kids
Considering 2016 was the year Brits embraced the cosy Danish concept of hygge, then 2017 may be the year in which we tire of candles and adopt the rougher and readier Dutch version: gezelligheid.
For while hygge has been hijacked to flog cashmere blankets and luxury log burners, gezelligheid, according to Michele Hutchison, a British writer who moved to the Netherlands in 2004, is simply 'a biscuit tin on a table and a mug of coffee. It's hot chocolate or pea soup and the sound of lively chatter with anoraks drying in the hall'.
She also thinks it's the key to explaining why a 2013 Unicef study found that Dutch children are 'the happiest in the world'. British kids came a lowly 16th.
In this entertaining new book, co-written with another expat mum, Rina Mae Acosta, Hutchison says that: 'The Netherlands has a reputation for being a liberal country with a tolerance of sex, drugs and alcohol, yet beneath this lies a closely guarded secret: the Dutch are actually fairly conservative people. At the heart of Dutch culture is a society of home-loving people who place the child firmly at the centre.
'Parents have a healthy attitude towards their kids, seeing them as individuals rather than as extensions of themselves. They understand that achievement doesn't necessarily lead to happiness, but that happiness can cultivate achievement.'
The duo's book on the joys of going Dutch will be a relief to any parents who felt shamed by Pamela Druckerman's 2012 paean to formal Gallic childrearing, French Children Don't Throw Food. There's a very funny passage in which the authors cringe at the noisy, sprawling games their kids enjoy on a French beach while the local children all sit quietly on their towels. But they also pity those perfect French children raised as 'mini adults', who miss out on delights and empowering life lessons learned through free-range play.

Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said he knew former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a person with peculiar traits.
He said for instance, the former President did not prove by deed some of the words uttered on the spur of the moment.
His statement about the Joint Opposition contesting the forthcoming local government election as a separate party may also be a statement made on the spur of the moment which may not materialise as some of his previous statements, the minister said. Dissanayake said a majority of SLFP Members of Parliament in the Joint Opposition group were in secret talks with President Maithripala Sirisena on their possibility of joining the main SLFP group.
He said the Joint Opposition group would taste imminent defeat if it contested the local elections as a separate party.
Minister Dissanayake commenting on the future prospects of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he said he could win if he contested the local elections but he had not clout to win a countrywide election like a presidential election.

## Title: No more pain in the neck!
## Supertitle:

No more pain in the neck!
Today Dr. Harindu Wijesinghe (MBBS, MD, MRCP), a Consultant Rheumatologist and Specialist in Sports Medicine attached to Nawaloka Hospitals PLC speaks about Cervical Spondylosis, one of the ailments that affects many in our society. Here are the important facts that you need to know about the disease.
Q : What is CervicalSpodylosis
A- Cervical spondylosis occurs due to wear and tear of bones and cartilage in your neck. This leads to neck pain and sometimes pain and tingling sensations going into your shoulders, arms and hands. This is one of the commonest diseases worldwide. Cervical spondylosis is age-related degeneration ('wear and tear') of the bones (vertebrae) and discs in the neck. To an extent, we all develop some degeneration in the vertebrae and discs as we become older. It tends to start sometime after the age of about 30. Your neck (cervical spine) is made up of seven bones called vertebrae. These vertebrae are roughly cylindrical in shape between each of the vertebrae is a 'disc'. The discs are made of a tough fibrous outer layer and a softer gel-like inner part. The discs act like 'shock absorbers' and allow the spine to be flexible allowing us to bend our neck and turn it from side to side.
Strong ligaments attach to adjacent vertebrae to give extra support and strength. Various muscles attached to the spine enable the spine to bend and move in various ways.
The spinal cord, which contains nervous tissue carrying messages to and from the brain, is protected by the vertebrae and discs. Nerves from the spinal cord come out from between the vertebrae in the neck.
Q: What are the symptoms ofcervical spondylosis
A- Some people will have wear and tear of the neck (spondylosis) but they will not have pain. While for others they will develop pain in the neck which can range from being mild to a very severe pain. It may be difficult to move the neck. Pain usually is not limited to the neck but can radiate in to the shoulders and hand. It may also go down the spine and radiate up into the head.
Pain in the neck:
This may spread to the shoulders and base of the skull. Movement of the neck may make the pain worse.
The pain sometimes spreads down an arm to a hand or fingers. This is caused by irritation of a nerve which goes to the arm from the spinal cord in the neck.
The pain tends to come and go with exarcebations from time to time. You may have a flare-up of pain after unaccustomed use of your neck.
However, a flare-up often develops for no apparent reason. Some people develop chronic (persistent) pain.
* Some develop neck stiffness, particularly after a night's rest.
* Headaches may occur. The headaches often start at the back of the head just above the neck and travel over the top to the forehead.
* You may develop 'pins and needles' in part of an arm or hand. This symptom is caused by irritation of nerve as it leaves the bony (vertebral) area. This is called a 'cervical radiculopathy'.
* More rarely, clumsiness of a hand, problems with walking, or problems with bladder function occur when pressure from a worn bone (vertebra) or disc damages the spinal cord(nerves going down the legs). This is called 'cervical myelopathy'. Again, it is important to report these symptoms to a doctor.
Q: What are the riskfactors of this disease
A- Aging is the major factor for developing cervical osteoarthritis (cervical spondylosis). In most people older than age 40, the discs between the vertebrae become less spongy and provide less of a cushion. Bones and ligaments get thicker, all these lead to spondylosis.
Another factor might be a previous injury to the neck.Recurrently lifting heavy loads can lead to damage of the discs. Also, jobs in which the neck is kept in the same posture for a prolonged period of time will lead to spondylosis. Ex- Computer work, writing, reading, cooking, cleaning , house work etc....
Q: How do youdiagnose this condition
A-You doctor will ask you about how long you had the pain and other details. He or she will then examine your neck and if necessary check nerves in the arms and legs.
Most patients do not need any further investigation and the diagnosis is made on clinical groundsalone. (based on the details the patient provides and the examination done by the doctor)
* Plain X-ray of cervical spine will show changes of wear and tear of the spine. They will show narrowing of the distance between the bones (vertebrae) which indicates wear and tear of discs.However these changes area common finding even in normal middle-aged patients without pain.
* Patients with neurological abnormality will need magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine, particularly if they have severe pain, weakness or pain going down their arms which is not responding to treatment.
Q: What treatments are available

A- Not everyone needs drugs to treat this condition. If the patient is in severe pain, then pain killers(NSAIDS) such as diclofenac sodium , celecoxib, naproxen, ibuprofen are used . Also analgesics such as Paracetamol , tramadol will be used. If there is pain going down your hand steroids and drugs such as gabapentin and pregabelin may be used. If the patient is not in severe pain patients can be managed without any of these medications.
Also, it is important to realize that currently there is no medicine to grow the worn out cartilage. Drugs like glucosamine and chondroitin are not proven to grow cartilage. Thus these don't play a prominent role in managing spondylosis. All patients are advised to rest for a period of time and specifically avoid any postures or work which makes the pain worse. A neck collar is used for the shortest possible period if the pain is severe. (prolonged use of the collar is not recommended). Though rest is recommended early it is always recommended to avoid prolonged rest and patients are encouraged to start work again as early as possible.
Hot or cold fermentation and various physiotherapy techniquescan be used to reduce the pain.
Exercises are given initially to stretch the tightened and irritated muscle. Later exercises will be given to strengthen the muscles around the neck. It is important to continuously do these exercises to prevent worsening of neck pain. By doing these we can slowly reduce the nerve irritation and the pain. It also important to adopt proper work postures as detailed below to prevent neck pain from reoccurring.
Q: What preventive measuresshould one adhere to
A- We can't avoid wear and tear occurring in the neck as it is a normal part and parcel of growing old. As previously mentioned there is no medicine to grow the worn-out cartilage. Drugs like glucosamine and chondroitin are also not proven to grow cartilage.
Preventing further wear and tear of cartilage is the most important thing to do. This can be done with a combination of proper postures and exercises to strengthen neck muscles.
Maintaining the neck in a correct posture during various activities is very important. These activities include sitting, standing, sleeping, driving and various others. The correct position to maintain your neck is as follows. Keep the neck straight and look straight ahead. keep Your ears in line with your shoulders. Your nose should be in line with the mid line of your body. You should try to maintain this position during all activities. Even if you can't do this all the time try to maintain this position whenever possible It is also important not to maintain the neck in the same position for more than 15 minutes. So intermittently take a break from whatever you're doing.
Q: Do cervical collars help
A- Cervical collars can be worn when you have pain and during any activity which worsens your pain such as travelling in a vehicle. However it should not be worn for prolonged periods as it can weaken the muscles in the neck. Weak neck muscles will lead to long term neck pain.
Q: Is there a need for surgery
A- Fortunately most neck pains don't need surgery, however if there is a very large disc compression causing weakness of your arms or legs then surgery is needed.
However for other types of neck pains even with severe pain and pain going down your arms it is advisable to try and manage without surgery.
(Next week: Lumbar Spondylosis, that affects your lower back.)

Northern CMs hybrid court only a dream: minister
Northern Province Chief Ministers pledge to set up a hybrid court in the North will remain a dream forever, Skills Development and Vocational Training Miniser Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Addressing the gathering at the 69th Independence Day celebrations in the Kalutara town on Saturday, the minister said certain individuals had become enslaved to foreign countries and organisations to gain certain privileges for themselves.
Samarasinghe said he had the privilege of leading the Sri Lanka delegation which went to the UNHRC in Geneva to counter allegations levelled against Sri Lanka.
As a government we would never betray the war heroes or police personnel to the international world.
Samarasinghe said he recently read a certain newspaper report that there were moves to set up a hybrid court in the Northern Province.
He said he would categorically say such a thing would never materialise and if any one has promised to do so, it would remain a dream.

ODEL launches Spring 2017 collection denims
Denim never goes out of fashion, but the ubiquitous fabric gets fresh expression in a dynamic and chic new Spring collection unveiled by ODEL, already the largest fashion repository in the country. The new collection reinforces ODELs status in on-trend fashion, as the go-to destination for branded denim wear from leading global brands.
Creations in denim of multiple finishes and degrees of distress form the core of the energetic new collection, supplementing ODELs extensive offering from brands such as Levis, Pepe Jeans London, Wrangler and Lee, as well as other denim and indigo items on the shelves of the countrys premier high fashion retail chain.
Aptly titled Denim & Co. the new collection also features a range of compatible and complementary fabrics such as linen, chambray, viscose, single jersey, lite-stretch cotton, French terry, crape, and chiffon. Since the 1950s when rebels like James Dean made the fabric iconic, denim has always had a place in fashion, said Ms Desiree Karunaratne, Group Marketing Director of Softlogic Holdings, which owns ODEL. Its timeless trendinessenables denim to hold its own globally. Denim has the unique adaptability of either being dressed up or dressed down to suit virtually any occasion, so we are delighted to introduce an array of iconic denim brands in store. Customers can take their pick from our wide range of season favourites to be bang on trend this Spring.
ODEL is a destination that always reflects global trends with the multiple international brands that itpresents, she said. The new collection is a great example because denim is still one of the most versatile and practical fabrics, and continues to make a statement for the casual-chic facet of fashion.
The Spring 2017 collection also uses textured crape, burnouts and soft rib fabric and prints including cameo, stripes and florescent detailing for effect. Shades of blue, black and green take pride of place.

Oman Air increases weekly capacity to India
Oman Air, the national carrier of the Sultanate of Oman is growing its capacity to India whereby it will increase its weekly frequencies from 126 to161 flights per week between Oman and its 11 destinations in India.
The growth in capacity follows the recently signed agreement between the Governments of Oman and India, where both sides agreed to increase the weekly seats.
Effective February onwards, Bombay, Delhi, Calicut and Hyderabad will be operated with 21 weekly flights each, and Lucknow with 14 weekly flights. With this development, Oman Air is flying its multi award winning wide bodied aircraft to select Indian destinations.
Chief Executive Officer of Oman Air, Paul Gregorowitsch, commented, India is a key destination for Oman Air and we are delighted to be offering thousands more guests the opportunity to travel between Oman and India (and beyond).
The demand for all 11 of our Indian destinations has always been high and the increased frequencies offer yet more choice and convenience to our guests. Oman Air first launched flights to India in the 1990s and the demand for seats has grown exponentially amongst both business and leisure travellers, not only increasing tourism traffic and revenue but also promoting vital trade agreements between the two countries.
The extended traffic entitlements will give a further boost to the tourism sector, prompting many discerning tourists to visit magnificent Oman as well as Indias beautiful touristic spots. The bilateral trade and investment opportunities between the two countries are even further encouraged.
I would like to thank the Public Authority of Civil Aviation in Oman and the Indian Government for being so receptive to our proposals as well as our trade partners, travel agencies and sales agents who have all been incredibly supportive and contributed to this growing demand.
They have fully endorsed our award winning product and our unique onboard service and hospitality, which help to differentiate Oman Air from the competition.
This growing commitment in India is part of Oman Airs ambitious and dynamic programme of fleet and network expansion. This has included the delivery of new aircraft and the introduction of a range of exciting new destinations and new products and services which contribute to a seamless passenger experience.

One Address, Three Generations
The debate has run for years. "Crabbed age and youth cannot live together," warned Shakespeare. Luckily when I was growing up in a house filled with two grandmothers, two uncles, several aunts, four cousins as well as two cats and one grumpy hen, I had not yet read my Shakespeare (he made a dramatic entrance many years later with Romeo and Juliet) and so, found it quite normal that all of us should be under one roof linked to each other with invisible threads.
That was long ago. Much has changed today. Both grandmas are no more and each family now lives in separate houses. Yet, some things remain the same. I still live with my parents.
Romantic ideal
I know the thought of three generations living under the same roof could strike different people in different ways. To some, it could represent a romantic ideal of family life, a throwback to the good old days, when grandparents were venerated as elders of the family. To others, it could conjure chaos, raised eyebrows, skeptical thoughts - the cons would significantly outweigh the pros("That must be so nice"), sarcastic ("Good luck with that") and incredulous ("All five of you!"). Can it really be possible to survive inter-generational clashes of lives that move to different speeds Of Jim Reeves and the latest, loudest rock music
The answer is yes. Look around you to discover that some brave groups are proving that multi-generational living can do more good than harm for the individuals involved. Closer to (my) home, a shared love of cats, books and gardening can turn out to be the glue that holds three generations together. Not only for me, but for many others too, including the ex US president and his family.
Living in harmony
It is heartening to note that until this January the trend of three generations living in harmony was seen even at the White House. Marian Robinson-Michelle Obama's mother, has made the White House home during the past eight years. She was often spotted shuttling granddaughters Sasha and Malia to school and was known by the unofficial nickname of FGOTUS (First Grandmother of the United States). In a 2012 Essence magazine essay, she wrote, "One of my biggest blessings is getting to see my granddaughters grow up...my job here is the easiest of all: I just get to be Grandma."
Things may not be the same for those of us who are not living in the White House, and it may not always be easy for different eras to co-exist in tight spaces, but a recent University of Oxford study found that teenagers are happier when grandparents are involved in their upbringing. The study, which followed over 1,500 school-age kids in the U.K., reported that teens who spent more quality time with a grandparent had fewer emotional and behavioral problems than their peers.
They were also better prepared to handle adversities such as a death in the family or a school bullying incident.
The same study has been replicated in Israel, Malaysia and South Africa with similar results. According to another study by Boston College, both adult grandchildren and their grandparents showed fewer symptoms of depression if they maintained an "emotionally close relationship."
Reasons
Of course, it might not be right for everyone - space, family history, finance, all sorts of reasons might jeopardize things. But there are just as many reasons why it might be a great way to live.
Here is how it works. Three plus two plus my aunt and uncle who often drop in for overnight stays make it seven of us under one roof. My family of three sleep in my old bedroom with a photo of Ben Jonson frowning on us from his high perch on the wardrobe (a relic from my lecturing days) while stickers of Dora and Pooh Bear adorn the other walls. On some nights, my daughter sleeps between her grandparents in their room because they allow her to read in bed breaking my bedtime rules. We have an encyclopedia on call-my father-for any middle of the night homework assignments. A brilliant "chef"-my mother, who modestly insists her cooking is useless. My morning routine, which could have been a harried and solitary affair, is one smooth dance with my mother searching for misplaced hair bands, my father frying eggs and me trying to wake up a seven-year-old who refuses to believe it is already 5.30 in the morning. A uniform needs alterations A white dress with a blue ribbon for the concert No problem. My aunt is ever willing to help out with her expert skills with needle and thread. Can life get any better
Sure, there are times when my mother would ignore my parenting rules (deep down I know she is probably right to do so), and if I get late to come home, my phone will buzz constantly with my father's concerned texts and ever so often my aunt decides to buy Popsicles for the whole family regardless of whose nose is running and whose is not. But these can hardly be called hitches, and hardly a day passes with me feeling overwhelmed by gratitude for being able to have my own family as well as my parents living with me enlivened every now and then with visits from my brother and his family, my aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews.
Safety net
You see, an extended family does not demand as much as people think it does. And, even if extended family members judge or criticise it is all done out of love. More often than not, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins provide a safety net.
In desperate times,and in happy times we know we could turn to any of them, and they would give us succor. The beauty of such an extended family therefore, is simple.
It doesn't really matter whether or not its members "get on", because we will always be close, for we are people cut from the same cloth, who owe each other nothing, but offer each other what we can, whenever we need it, and unconditionally.
Don't forget, happiness is homemade.
The Good, the Bad, the Tolerable things you find in an extended family
1. Convoy: Wherever you go - a party, a trip - it is a convoy going along with you. You and your live-in buddies (aka family) basically form an inseparable team outside the house more than INSIDE the house
2. Privacy is bombarded (literally) constantly. "Eavesdropping" is a common practice. Talking on the phone Your uncle, aunt, sibling, cousin, everyone knows what you're talking about. Obviously. Because no matter where they are sitting and what they are doing, their ears are with you, for you, forever.
3. Even your thoughts are not yours. If you're thinking, your uncles/aunties/cousins/siblings - they will all be guessing what you are really thinking.
4. Free unwanted opinions when you get dressed. You have ten different opinions about how you are looking when you get dressed to go out.
5. You need to cry like a baby, you need to do that OUTSIDE the house premises. You can rely on a hundred shoulders in your own house when you're hurt, which also means the person making you cry is cursed like there's no tomorrow.
Plus you don't want 20 other people crying because of you. So, you need to find a better place to truly express your feelings!
6. You don't need a friend who's just a call away, you have your brothers and sisters and cousins around to take care of that. Whether it is boredom at 2 am in the night or you need to take out your frustration somewhere, you have someone around indefinitely to give you company.

Police uniform change: nod from IGP for survey
The Inspector General of Police granted approval to conduct a survey whether the police uniform should be changed to improve the image of the Sri Lankan Police Service.
Opinion from police officers and the civil community will be obtained for the survey.
A survey was conducted following a feedback from the public, public officers, MPs and police officers. However, a proper analysis was not conducted due to limitations of the questionnaire and the methodology adopted.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara instructed to eliminate the lapses of the previous survey, use a proper methodology and send the questionnaire to target groups of the public, public officers, judicial officers, public representatives and police officers. The survey focuses on public opinion on changing the police uniform, identification of the uniform colour with the responsibilities of the police officers, affects of the change on the civil society and on the change of attitude of the public towards the Police based on the changed uniform. The survey also seeks public opinion on tailoring a two colour police uniform. The survey provides colour recommendations as the presently used khaki coloured shirt with khaki trouser or white shirt with black trouser, light blue shirt with dark blue trouser, light grey shirt with dark grey trouser, light brown shirt with khaki trouser or any other colour recommendation chosen the target population.
The current standard police uniform comes after the changes made in 1974 followed by several more additions to the khaki uniforms adopted in the beginning of the 20th century.

Polmama: Nonagenarian vegetarian
Ninety-seven-year old R.G. M. Dingiri Banda of Pahala Polwatta, Karaliyadde, Teldeniya, still looks agile and sturdy and belies his age as a nonagenarian.
He still engaes in his lifelong small business of selling coconuts. He is such an omini-present individual in the Dumbara Valley that he had earned the sobriquet, 'pol mama'.
Dingiri Banda, who claims a long list of grandchildren, attributes his good health to his frugal and disciplined life and dietary habits. He says he takes a vegetarian diet and eats a lot of fruits. Liquor has been a taboo throughout his life.
He is the oldest member of Sri Uposatharama Viharaya Dayaka sabha at Karaliyadde and makes it a point to observe sil on all poya days. He was born on January 20,1920 at Gampola but later moved to Karaliyadde and settled down there during his youth.
He says his eyesight is clear still and reads books and newspapers daily.
He started his business a long time ago when a coconut cost a meagre five cents. During his youth, he collected coconuts from home gardens on a bullock cart and delivered to sathipolas (weekly fairs) in the area. Although he had given up that big time business now, he still engages in his simple coconut business.

President Maithripala Sirisena takes credit for including pledges and proposals for the benefit and welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers in a Presidential election campaign manifesto for the first time in Sri Lanka. Two such pledges were already fulfilled by him after assuming office, and this is a happy augury for the migrant worker population in the country, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale said.
She was addressing the "Shramika Surakuma' mobile service programme participants in the Thambalagamuwa Divisional Secretariat division on February 3.
Among the pledges were ensuring the security for migrant worker families, a pension scheme, and 2.5 percent interest for non-resident bank accounts, Minister Atukorale said .
She said the 'Shramika Surekuma' programme was launched on January 8, 2016 to mark the first anniversary of the President's assumption of office. Development officers assigned to Divisional Secretariat offices were entrusted with the security and welfare of migrant worker families. Arrangements were underway to introduce the pension scheme for migrant workers in this year. She said the good governance government had taken all measures necessary to cater for the welfare of migrant workers who remit the largest slice of foreign exchange to the country.

Queen makes history as she reaches her Sapphire Jubilee

The Queen has today madehistory as she becamethe first British monarch to reach their Sapphire Jubilee.
On February 6, the anniversary of the day she became Queen, Elizabeth II will have reigned for 65 years.
She is expected to commemorate the landmark date privately at her Sandringham Estate, Norfolk, with no official engagements planned.
Royal gun salutes will be staged in London on Ascension Day, as is the tradition, with a 41-gun salute by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park at noon.
The Band of the Royal Artillery will play a selection of celebratory music close to the firing position, and 89 horses will pull six First World War-era 13-pounder field guns into position in the park.
A 62-gun salute by the Honourable Artillery Company will be fired at the Tower of London at 1pm.
The Royal Mint is to mark the 65th anniversary with a range of specially designed Sapphire Jubilee commemorative coins, as the Royal Mail issues a Sapphire Blue 5 stamp.
A portrait by David Bailey, taken in 2014 and showing the Queen wearing a suite of sapphire jewellery given to her by King George VI as a wedding gift, will also be reissued.
The Queen, who missed church over Christmas due to a heavy cold, will may well be matter-of-fact about the historic occasion.
In 2015, when she thanked the nation for its kind messages after overtaking Queen Victoria to become the longest-reigning monarch in British history, she admitted the royal record was "not one to which I have ever aspired".
She added: "Inevitably, a long life can pass by many milestones. My own is no exception."
The Queen celebrated her 90th birthday last year, with activities including a walkabout, beacon lighting and a black tie dinner for family and friends in Windsor on her actual birthday.
A weekend of national celebrations, including a party on The Mall, was held for her official birthday in June.
It is likely that any large-scale jubilee celebrations will be reserved for the Platinum Jubilee in 2022 - although any events will take into account the fact that Queen is due to turn 96 that year.
The Duke of Cambridge will this summer become a full-time royal, increasing his official duties on behalf of the Queen.

Ranjan issue: SLASSA not to go ahead with TU action
The Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SLASA) will not participate in a trade union action over the recent incident involving Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary.
Association Secretary Sunil Galagama told the Daily News yesterday that a special meeting was convened to discuss the matter on Friday and it was decided not to rush into any trade union action considering the inconvenience the people could face.
The President, Prime Minister, Public Administration Minister and Home Affairs Minister talked to our representatives over this incident and expressed their regret. However, Deputy Minister Ramanayake is yet to make an apology. He has now made a complaint at the Bribery Commission against the Divulapitiya DS, he said.
We decided to await the outcome of the investigations into this complaint. If she was acquitted from all charges then an apology is due from the Deputy Minister. At the same time, if she wishes to proceed to take legal action against Ramanayake, then our Association is ready to support her, Galagama said.
He also defended the Divulapitiya DS stating that she has acted within her ambit on the written complaints on illegal soil mining.

Revision bail application by Anura Senanayaka fixed for Feb.8

Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke today fixed for support on February 8, the bail revision application filed by Western Province former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake, arrested and remanded over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in former rugby player Wasim Thajudeens murder.
However, the Attorney General had raised objections to releasing the suspect on bail at this juncture saying the police were yet to conclude investigations into the incident.
Through the revision application, former DIG had sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrates refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said that the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on number of occasion since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder.
The petitioner said there is no evidence to prove that he was involved in conspiring to commit a murder, and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The prosecution maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had beem involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder, since circumstantial evidence suggests the suspects had conducted their investigations in a manner to record Thajudeens death as a fatal road accident.

Setback for Trump: Appeals court rejects demand to resume travel ban for now

A federal appeals court early Sunday morningdenied the US government's emergency requestto resume President Donald Trump's travel ban.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has asked for both sides to file legal briefs before the court makes its final decision after a federal judge halted the program on Friday.
What this means is that the ruling by US District Court Judge James Robart, who suspended the ban, will remain in place for now.
The US Justice Department filed an appeal just after midnight Sunday, asking to pause Robart's sweeping decision that temporarily halted enforcement of several key provisions of Trump's executive order.
The order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Homeland Security suspends travel ban
The Justice Department's strongly worded court filing lodged a multi-pronged attack on Robart's decision, emphasizing that halting enforcement of the travel ban "harms the public" and "second-guesses the President's national security judgment" in the immigration context.
"(Robart's ruling) contravenes the considered judgment of Congress that the President should have the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of aliens,"the Justice Department wrote in its filing.
"Courts are particularly ill-equipped to second-guess the President's prospective judgment about future risks. Unlike the President, courts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations, the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States, or gaps in the vetting process," the filing said.
Justice Department lawyers further argued that the parties who filed the lawsuit -- the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota lack the ability to sue in federal court because their alleged harms are too "speculative."
Since the federal appeals court rejected a request to immediately reinstate the travel ban, lawyers for Washington state and Minnesota have until 3:59 a.m. ET Monday to file legal papers, and the Justice Department lawyers have until 6 p.m. ET Monday evening to reply.
The 9th Circuit extended the filing deadline for one hour because of computer system maintenance.
Then a three-judge panel will decide whether to schedule a hearing or issue a ruling.
Robart, a Bush appointee sitting in the Western District of Washington, ruled Friday that the states that filed the lawsuit "have met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the executive order."
Robart explained that Trump's executive order adversely affects "residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel."
When Trump was asked at a gala in Florida on Saturday whether he was confident his administration would prevail in the appeal, he replied, "We'll win. For the safety of the country, we'll win."
On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had suspended "any and all" actions to implement the immigration order and would resume standard inspections of travelers, as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban.
After the Ninth Circuit's decision on Sunday, a US Embassy official in Baghdad said that holders of valid US visas, including Iraqi Special Immigrant Visas, would be allowed to travel to the United States.
"The US Government has determined that it is in the national interest to allow Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders to continue to travel to the United States," the embassy official said, adding that the embassy had been in contact with the SIV applicants.

Some afterthoughts of Independence : The role of Piyadasa Sirisena
In most colonial societies, nationalist and religious agitation have been critical in the drive for independence. In the early 20th century, in India especially, the rise of nationalism has been an important element in the battle against alien rule.
In Ceylon too, similar trends prevailed. But in this country, the nationalist stream of resistance to the British rule was a non formal force that had as its frontiersmen the indigenous leadership. The formal leadership were largely the English educated who intermixed with the British administrators. During the period of the legislative and State Council, Ceylonese leaders like D.S. Senanayake, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Sir D.B. Jayatilaka, and Sir James Peiris formed the core of the leadership. It was they who were in the forefront of the formal battle for freedom from the British rule.
Pre-colonial history
If history of the colonial era is to be viewed in its proper perspective, one has to retrospectively examine the work of the non-formal leaders in the vanguard of the movement for freedom. It is in this context that this presentation will examine briefly one of the key proponents of that drive to freedom. Piyadasa Sirisena was a man of many natural gifts and talents, who was also imbibed with a genuine love for this country. As a historian and notable legal personality, N.E. Weerasooriya observed in his monumental History of Ceylon, 'Piyadasa Sirisena was an instrument of the silent revolution that swept this land and prepared its soil for political emancipation.
How did Piyadasa Sirisena contribute to Ceylons political emancipation
What was the means of reviving nationalism and a love of this land through which Sirisena wielded a pervasive influence on the minds of the indigenous populace It was through communication, the most potent weapon in any society whether it be colonial or post colonial. Nothing could be more effective in transforming the mindset of the people.
He not only backed the drive to regain our freedom conducted by the other leaders referred to before, but also engaged himself in the arduous task of restoring their lost cultural identity.
In this regard, he used his pen more effectively than any other leader of his time. And whats more, he used it fearlessly and with little care for his own safety against the mightiest imperial force of that era, the British.
Sirisena used two formidable instruments of communication with telling effect to bring about a transformation in the minds of a fallen people. One was the many novels he authored and the other was through his newspaper which he struggled to publish and which had a chequered history.
During the early years of the 20th century in Ceylon, Anagarika Dharmapala, the peerless Buddhist reformer and nationalist, had begun the Mahabodhi Society in Maradana. This society issued a number of publications directly connected with the rekindling of Buddhist and nationalist sentiment.
Such revivalist work no doubt led to a lateral formation in the early years of the freedom movement.
As this second front progressed, it provided support to the leading Buddhist families who joined the movement as it entered the mainstream of the agitational campaign which took different forms. One of the most important was the Temperance Drive.
Back in the 1930s when the Temperance leaders like the Senanayake brothers, D.S and F.R, the Hewavitharanas and the Wijewardenas worked hard to curb the growing habit of alcohol consumption. Piyadasa Sirisena backed the Temperance lobby through his newspapers. Besides this, his novels also attacked the growing menace of alcoholism and its harm to society.
The colonial administration undoubtedly viewed with increasing concern, the rising tide of nationalism and anti-colonial activity. They noted with alarm, the work of the two principal agitators, Anagarika Dharmapala and Piyadasa Sirisena. Dharmapala had launched an Island wide crusade against imperialism and superimposition of our society with an alien culture. Dharmapalas fiery rhetoric aroused the Sinhalese in a manner that had not been experienced since the first religious debate against the British Christian missionaries in 1873 led by Venerable Migettuwatte Gunananda.
Press freedom
The British Colonial Administration had, long before the local campaigns using publications to arouse people, looked at press freedom with concern in India. It was as far back as 1857 that the colonial office enacted Press laws applicable to both India and Sri Lanka.
As this country proceeded towards 1930s, certain political reforms had been granted. But freedom was quite a distance away. Piyadasa utilised his novels, and the newspaper he published, in a sustained anti-colonial campaign.
By this time he had a large following and the masses were influenced by his varied work.
Historians are also of the view that Sirisena had a role to play in the movement for political formations. In fact, one such movement presaged was the formation of the Sinhala Maha Sabha. Siresena was the most popular novelist of the era and his novels were on nationalistic and patriotic themes. Piyadasa Sirisena died at the age of 71 just 2 years before independence. He had played an important role in the indigenous movement for freedom from the British colonial rule. His death prompted D.S Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Independent Ceylon, to state that Sirisena had departed when Ceylon was at the doorstep of freedom, for which he had unobtrusively made a significant contribution.

Sri Lankas first footwear and leather hub rises in East
Footwear & Leather exports also up by 28%
We are planning to set up Sri Lankas first footwear and leather industry city in the Eastern Province, said Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the inaugural event of National Footwear and Leather Exhibition Footwear and Leather Fair 17 at BMICH, Colombo on last Friday.
We welcome the strong Indian delegation to the ninth fair in this series. Our footwear and leather exports in 2016 increased by 28% in comparison to 2015 revenues to $140 million showing strong growth trends. What we need to understand in this is that 84% of these exports were in footwear. The global footwear and leather market is expected to exceed $ 600 billion by 2020. The global footwear market is estimated to be around $ 370 billion by 2020. The leather goods industry is estimated to reach $ 247 billion by that time, the minister said.
In a background of rising middle class consumption and demand for luxury goods across the world I believe that footwear has great promise for branding of Sri Lanka in international markets through a low cost export product, the minister said.
As the middle income population increases it is clear that the demand for designer footwear too would rise rapidly. Even though Casual footwear are leading the growth at present with more and more people entering an active sports lifestyle demand for athletic and sports footwear too are driving this growth.
Analysts say that sports footwear can give as much as 45% profit margins -the highest in footwear industry! Therefore I call Sri Lankan manufacturers and exporters again to pay closer attention to this sector and enter it by supplying more to established brands.
I also Obtained Cabinet approval for setting up a Dedicated Leather and Leather Goods Manufacturing Complex in Baticaloa District at an estimated cost of Rs. 450 million. More importantly we are planning to set up a footwear and leather industry city in the eastern province with Public Private Partnership. Realising that it is important to protect local manufacturers of this sector we have increased the taxes on footwear imports and introduced duty exemption facilities for import of finished leather for manufacturing of Footwear and Leather goods products, minister added.
A key objective of foreign participant facilitation to this series by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is tech transfer. Chennai based GTFC, a footwear materials and components supplier, is joining the Colombo fair for the first time and showed high enthusiasm.
GTFC and Rhenoflex  Germany are here for the first time and I am excited. I represent Germanys Rhenoflex, the world leader in Thermoplastic materials for Toe, side and counterpart reinforcements in shoes. Today we are introducing modern, green manufacturing based, recyclable shoe components to Sri Lanka through our partner Indias GTFC, for the first time through this Fair said Rhenoflex Germanys Vice Sales Director Rainer Godel. We are exploring to partner with Lankan manufacturers in many ways he added.

Sri Lankas major religious places switching to Solar  Power with JLanka
Sri Lankan can gain huge benefits from switching to Solar Power. But although being a tropical countrys that has a sunny weather throughout over a half year annually only a less than 0.5% all households in the country had adopted Solar Power to their day to day electricity generation that is being consumed.
Whilst the government has also stepped in to promote Solar Power as a renewable energy source that helps creating a sustainable and greener environment countrys leading Solar Power solutions provider JLanka has taken an initiative to install Solar Photovoltaic systems in countrys major religious places of worship and religious institutions.
Accordingly five major scared sites of historic and sacred Atamasthana in Anuradhapura including Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Ruwanweli Seya. Thuparamaya, Abhayagiriya, Jetavanaramaya, Mirisavetiya, Lankaramaya and the Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, Malwathu Maha Viharaya, Asgiri Temple, Thanthririmale Rajamaha Viharaya, Somawathi Rajamaha VIharaya, Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya will be Solar Powered under the project. Further Archdiocese of Colombo, Muslim Mosque in Galle, Sabaragamu Maha Saman Devalaya, Nallur Kandaswamy Temple Jaffna, Koneswarama Temple are also included to per powered with Solar Photovoltaic systems under the project.
On the other hand, Solar Power engineers highlight that Churches are ideal places for Solar panels. In a benefit, unforeseen by medieval architects, the traditional east-west structure, with the altar at the east end of the nave, calls for a long, south-facing roof with a pitch that perfectly captures sunlight.
JLanka Technologies, this initiative will help the religious places and temples at large to bring down their energy and utility bills while contributing to a more greener and a sustainable environment which will also indirectly motivate the devotees to switch to renewable energy. Experts outline that over the past six years, the cost of solar energy has dropped dramatically, to the point where it is now even cheaper than wind power in emerging markets like in Sri Lanka, China and India.
This may be largely due to rising investments in solar over the last few years. This is great news for developing nations like Sri Lanka, which do not generally have the kind of infrastructure that developed countries have dedicated to fossil fuels already in place.

Sri Lanka aims to further strengthen ties with Saudi: envoy
Sri Lanka looks forward to further strengthen ties with the Kingdom, especially in the fields of employment, trade, investment and tourism, Ambassador Azmi Thassim told Arab News.
Appreciating the long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia, our country wholeheartedly supports Vision 2030 under the wise leadership of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman and the NTP (National Transformation Program) 2020 initiated by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, second deputy premier and defense minister, Thassim said.
The envoy, who met with Riyadh Gov. Prince Faisal bin Bandar recently, expressed hope for the enhancement of bilateral ties.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, trade and tourism have tremendously increased for the benefit of the people of the two friendly countries, Thassim said, adding that nearly 38,000 Saudis visited Sri Lanka last year.
The diplomat said his country is an ideal tourist destination for a family holiday: We have plenty of attractions to offer Saudi tourists, and we are making every effort to attract tourists from this part of the world.
He added that Saudi families who had visited Sri Lanka had always opted to repeat their visits because of the islands natural scenic beauty and the hospitality of its people.
Muslim visitors will feel at home in the city of Colombo since they can see mosques in the vicinity of every shopping centre, he said, adding that women in hijab are a common sight in the capital.
A good number of Saudis are currently visiting Sri Lanka for their leisure and honeymoon.
Thassim said: Our target is to promote trade and investment with the Kingdom. Sri Lankan exports to Saudi Arabia include tea, garments, fruit and vegetables, cut flowers, leather goods and porcelain products.
Ever since we established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom in July 1974, the two countries have maintained excellent relations in social, cultural, political and economic fields, the ambassador said.
He added that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is significant not only because it is home to nearly 200,000 Sri Lankans, but also because it is a holy land for the Muslims who form 10 percent of the islands population of 24 million.
A large number of Sri Lankan Muslims regularly travel to the Kingdom for the annual Haj and Umrah pilgrimage.
Thassim thanked the Saudi leadership for the special care given to Muslims from all parts of the world, including Sri Lanka. He also thanked Crown Prince Mohammed bin Naif, deputy premier and interior minister, and Prince Mohammed for their cooperation in maintaining relations with Sri Lanka. - Arab News

Still the little Oshin
Oshin, the Japanese serialized morning television drama, was originally aired on NHK television from April 4, 1983. Although, it did not garner much attention at the start, the drama gained
popularity as time passed by and word spread. Later every morning of the week except Sunday, Japanese people from all walks of life turned on their television sets after finishing breakfast to watch the struggles of a poor little girl (Oshin) who overcomes numerous hardships to become a successful businesswoman. As the programme gained in popularity Oshin became a heroine and the
show became one of the most popular programs in Japanese television history.
Over the years the name Oshin has worked its way into the Japanese vocabulary, as a synonym for patience and endurance. Be like Oshin, people urge often in Japan and elsewhere in the globe as well where the drama has gained high popularity. It is said that
there is a full array of Oshin dolls, Oshin posters, Oshin songs and even Oshin sake in Japan. Even foreign leaders, who have visited Japan, have not forgotten to mention Oshin as a symbol of Japans postwar emergence from devastation.
Oshin is based on the fictional biography of a Japanese woman, modeled after the mother of Kazuo Wada, a Japanese businessman who created Yaohan,
a Japanese supermarket chain. It is said that the structure of the
story was developed using a collection of anonymous letters assembled
by Japanese Script writer Sugako Hashida.
Oshin has been aired in more than 70 foreign countries, with subtitles and dubbing. Rupavahini is the first Sri Lankan channel to telecast foreign tele dramas. The most popular of them was Oshin, dubbed in Sinhala. Oshin was first brought to Sri Lanka by the veteran artiste Henry Jayasena from Japan in 1989.
The task of dubbing the program in Sinhala was assigned to Titus Thotawatte, a man in abundance of innate skills, a veteran of Sinhala cinema.
Titus and his colleague Athula Ransirilal with a team of 250 dubbing artists did the job to a level which was eventually admired by all Sri Lankan television viewers.
The Sinhala dubbed version of Oshin has enthralled Rupavahini viewers for almost three decades and when it comes to foreign TV dramas dubbed in Sinhala,
Oshins popularity is unsurpassed.
The young Oshin was played by an unbearably cute 10-year-old named Ayako Kobayashi. Kobayashi, now 45, was in Sri Lanka last Friday for the opening of Japan Expo Premier Sri Lanka  2017 at the BMICH, which showcased both Japanese business and culture.
Kobayashi was one of the star attractions of the exhibition and she also spoke with fans before the film Oshin was screened at the main theatre at BMICH on Friday morning. Here are excerpts from an interview with Kobayashi.
Q: It is many years since you gave life to the childhood character of Oshin. Yet the character is still alive in the memory of fans all over the world. Did you ever imagine that Oshin would become a household name in Japan and abroad
A: I am surprised actually. I never thought Oshin will be so famous in the first place. But today I am very happy about it. Oshin was shown here in Sri Lanka more than 20 years ago. Before coming here I did not have a good idea about how famous Oshin was in Sri Lanka.
But when I got here and got down from the plane I was surprised by the reception I got. The people I met had big smiles on their faces and they greeted me with much enthusiasm and affection. I had to take a lot of pictures with most of the people I met.
I only played the childhood character of Oshin. Now my appearance has changed a lot.
But people tell me that when they see me they see the cute little face of Oshin.
In Sri Lanka I have been quite moved and delighted by the warmth and love shown to me. Now I have a clearer idea of how famous Oshin is in Sri Lanka.
Q: What is the purpose of your visit Is it only for the Japan Expo
A: Yes, it is for the Japan Expo. I was invited and am very happy to be a part of this great event. I was able to promote the newly released version of the Oshin film here too. I was able to talk with fans at the opening ceremony. They were thrilled to meet me and I was thrilled to meet them. I will be carrying home both fond memories and new friends.
Q: How can serials like Oshin develop links between Sri Lanka and Japan
A: I think programs like these are very important to build strong links between two countries both culturally and otherwise.
I think Oshin has helped us to show the life style of the Japanese people, the resilience we showed to rise from the devastation of war, our history etc.
After visiting your country for the first time I think Oshin has definitely helped to strengthen friendly relations between Sri Lanka and Japan.
Since I got down from the plane I never felt like a stranger here.
The warmth I have been received with has left lasting impressions.
From the moment I got down from the plane I got the feeling that I am among old friends.
Q: What are your thoughts on Sri Lanka and its culture
A: From the information I have gotten you have a rich cultural heritage like in Japan.
I did not have much time to visit a lot of places in Sri Lanka as this was a very short visit. However, I saw beautiful beaches, trees and a lot of nature from the plane. It is really amazing!
I also like the buildings and structures here.
They are very lovely. Most of all I like the Lankan peoples affection and their hospitality. Sri Lankans are very warm people. I am impressed with their lovely smiles as well.
Q: What is your fondest memory acting in Oshin
A: I will never forget my first shooting as Oshin. It was a very emotional scene.
In that scene little Oshin has to be separated from her mother at a river bank. The parting between the mother and daughter was very emotional.
The shooting was done in deep snow at Yamagata in the northern part of Japan. It was so cold. I can still remember it very vividly.
Q: What was the most challenging scene you had to take on
A: The most challenging was to play Oshin in the cold river waters in Yamagagata in the dead of winter.
I was very small and the water was freezing.
Q: Oshin was later made into an animated movie. And you did young Oshins voice. Tell us a bit about that experience.
A: I did not have any difficulty although I was much older at the time. I always remembered the role I played as little Oshin. It all went very smoothly.
Q:What is the response you get from people in Japan.
A: Oshin was telecast in Japan more than 30 years ago. But still people there relate to me as little Oshin. The show is still famous in Japan.
Q: Have you been involved in any Sri Lankan TV or film productions
A: I was involved in a joint production by Sri Lanka and Japan. There was some shooting in spring and winter. This morning I met the director who made the film. I was very glad. [Kobayashi was involved in the film Kandak Sema based on a novel by Sumitra Rahubadda]
Q: Do you have a message for your Sri Lankan fans
A: It may surprise you when you see me as an adult and not as the little child you have seen. But still I am the little Oshin that you loved dearly. I will be very happy if Oshin helps build a bridge between Japan and Sri Lanka.

Strive for economic prosperity and national reconciliation  Chief Minister
What we have to do is to strive for prosperity as a unified Sri Lankan nation, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said
"Economic and social crisis we face today are not recently formed ones. They have been gradually advanced since the independence. Therefore, it is meaningless and fruitless to hold one group or party responsible for the economic and social evils of the day," he said.
He was addressing the Southern Provincial 69th Independence Day celebrations held opposite the Galle Central Bus Stand on Saturday.
"The 69th Independence Day is a paramount juncture to ponder honestly as a nation if we could genuinely be contented over our long journey of economic, social and national progress since we gained Independence. According to prominent economists our countrys economy is at a seriously risky state.
This is not a recently progressed situation. It is a gradually deteriorated economic, social and national predicament. Not a single group or party is responsible for this crisis. It is pointless to hold one section or group answerable," he said.
"By the end of 2015, our foreign debt burden had risen up to USD 44.8 billion. It will be doubled by 2019. By the time the new government came to power, we have to pay out 54.4 percent out of our total GDP to settle our foreign debts.
During the past two years, even the situation continued to be similarly aggravated, the Chief Minister said.
He said mere criticism over this situation does nothing to rectify present problems and a way should be found out to overcome the national problems.
The Chief Minister said it was also an achievement of national unity and concord.
"People of all ethnic and religious groups fought united against the imperialists. Among our national heroes there are leaders of all nations and religions. Although we strived as Sri Lankans to obtain Independence, we failed to uphold the same national unity in building our country.
We were divided over petty religious and ethnic issues. The situation aggravated day by day until it ended in a disastrous war. We could defeat the separatist war. Now we have to win the hearts of people which were wounded during the 30- year-long civil war.
The present government of President Maithripala Sirisena has launched a number of significant initiatives for national reconciliation. We all should struggle for a prosperous country where sustainable peace and harmony among all nations flourishes forever," the Chief Minister said.
Galle Distirct Secretariat under Galle District Secretary S.T. Kodokara. Southern Provincial Minister U.G.Ariaythilake, Provincial Councilors, former Local Government representatives and a large number of state officials led by Southern Province Chief Secretary R.C. De Zoysa participated.

Thousands protest in US, Europe over Trump travel ban
US: From London and Paris to New York and Washington, thousands of people took to the streets Saturday in American and European cities to protest US President Donald Trumps travel ban, even as it was suspended by a federal judge.
The biggest demonstration by far took place in the British capital, where an estimated 10,000 people turned out, chanting Theresa May: Shame on You to denounce the British prime ministers support for the new US leader.
Brandishing placards declaring No to scapegoating Muslims and Socialism not Trumpism, the protesters moved from the US embassy toward Mays Downing Street office.
In an executive order issued on January 27, Trump slapped a blanket ban on nationals of seven mainly Muslim countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- barring their entry to the United States for 90 days. Refugees were also barred from entry for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were blocked indefinitely.
However, on Friday, a US federal judge suspended the ban, a move which the Republican president -- who took office on January 20 -- condemned and vowed to fight.
On the other side of the Atlantic, about 3,000 people demonstrated in New York, Trumps home town where protests against the property magnate-turned-world leader are near-daily. Activists and supporters gathered outside the historic Stonewall Inn, a landmark of the gay rights movement in New Yorks Greenwich Village, to show support for Muslims and others affected by Trumps immigration order.
Democratic Senate minority leader Charles Schumer led the crowd -- which carried rainbow flags and Americans flags -- in cheers of Dump Trump. In Washington, hundreds marched from the White House to Capitol Hill to show their solidarity.
Donald, Donald cant you see, we dont want you in DC, chanted the demonstrators in the largely Democratic-leaning US capital.
Many waved homemade signs with slogans like Love knows no borders and Will swap Trump for 1,000 refugees.
I was born and raised here and for the first time in my life, I dont feel safe, said Abu Bakkar, 26, whose parents are originally from Pakistan.
The Department of Defense consultant said the new president has revealed hate thats been underground for so long.
He has divided one of the greatest countries in the world.
In Britain, more than 1.8 million people have signed a petition saying Trump should not be afforded a formal state visit because it would embarrass Queen Elizabeth II.
Were going to bring this capital to a halt on the day he comes over. We are going to make it impossible for him to have a state visit, Chris Nineham, vice-chair of the Stop the War Coalition, told AFP.
The Guardian newspaper said around 10,000 people attended the London protest, while organizers claimed 40,000.
Elsewhere in Europe, about 1,000 people turned out in both Paris and Berlin, while smaller gatherings of several hundred people took place in provincial British cities including Manchester and Birmingham.
We are here to say we dont accept hate, said 20-year-old American Michael Jacobs, co-organizer of the Paris rally, surrounded by signs saying Refugees are welcome! In Berlin, protesters rallied in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
I hope they will change something, but I am really disappointed, said Mahsa Zamani, a 26-year-old Iranian medical student who had been due to head to a Florida hospital for an internship.
It is still discrimination, and I dont know if I really feel like going even if they are changing (the rules). On Saturday evening, hundreds of protesters were planning to march near Trumps Mar-a-Lago club and vacation home in Florida, though police were expected to keep them far from the property.

UNPARALLELED PATRIOTISM
Had the insurrection been successful Keppetipola would have been honoured and characterized as a patriot instead of being stigmatized as a rebel and punished as a traitor, wrote Henry Marshall, Deputy Inspector General of Army Hospitals in his book, Description of the Island and its Inhabitants.
The Kandyan Convention drafted chiefly by John DOyly was an agreement between Governor Robert Brownrigg and the Kandyan Chieftains signed at the Magul Maduwa  the Audience Hall of the kings of Kandy, on March 2, 1815.
According to the terms the Governor pledged to safeguard the powers and privileges of the chieftains and laws, customs and institutions, above all Buddhism, Buddhist clergy and places of Buddhist worship were to be maintained and protected.
The Kandyan Convention was signed in the absence of other chieftains assembled outside the Magul Maduwa and without the participation of the people. Prof. K.M. de Silva opined British took the stand on English constitutional law treated the convention as more than an ordinary treaty capable of an amendment by subsequent legislation.
Revolt against British rule
However the events that followed, Chieftains, Buddhist clergy and people began to get discontent over the change of the government. Moreover the authorities planned to establish a seminary which irked the feelings of the Kandyan people.
Hardly before the lapse of two months, Madugalla and Ihagama Thera with some leading monks of the Malwatta Vihara held a secret discussion to overthrow the British rule and erase the stigma of being under foreign domination.
Their plan did not materialize when Eknaligoda Mohottala revealed it to the authorities. Madugalla was arrested and charged for planning a revolt against the British rule. Madugalla was imprisoned for two years in Jaffna and later was released on August 12, 1817 on account of the birthday of King George III of England while Ihalagama Thera escaped from arrest.
Kepptipola was one of the signatories to the convention and with Galagoda and Galagama signed the convention in Sinhala, whereas other chieftains signed their names in Grantha  a combination of Sinhala and Tamil characters.
The settlement following the signing of the historic document, the Governor Brownrigg appointed Keppetipola the Maha Disawa of Uva. Earlier King Sri Vickrama Rajasinha in 1804 sent Keppetipola to oppose the advancing British troops from Batticaloa under the command of Captain Johnstone.
Once he spoke to Muhandiram David de Alwis, Interpreter to the British Agent in Badulla, said that the British rule must end and a Sinhalese king was essential for the welfare of the people and Keppetipola Disavas brother-in-law Ehelepola Maha Adikaram in due course of time should be raised to the throne.
Kandyan Kingdom
The family of Keppetipola hailed from Galboda Korale in the Kegalle district, the vanguard of the Sinhalese army. In the 18 century, the then chief of the clan Keppetipola after he was appointed Maha Disava of Matale and Tammankaduwa, migrated to Matale Disavany (the area under the Disava), married a lady from Monarivila Pattuwa in the Matale Disavany.
The descendants of Keppetipola held high office in the Kandyan Kingdom. One of them was Disava of Matale and Nuwarakalaviya and others of the family held the offices of Saluwadana Nilame and Maduwe Lekam.
Another Keppetipola viz. Golahela Nilame held the office of Diyawadana Nilame under Rajadhi Rajasinha, married Monaravila Kumarihamy and had three sons and three daughters. The second son, Kepptipola the Disava of Uva married Delwala Etanahamy who had been described as young and handsome. The sister of the Disava married Ehelapola Maha Adikaram who served under King Sri Vickrama Rajasinha.
Once, Keppetipola as Maha Disava punished certain headmen in his Disavany for rendering honours to the British Agent at Badulla. He as the Disava was entitled to Madi Hungam  transit duties, at the Idalgashinna Kadawata. The Governor on hearing this information was constrained to instruct DOyly, the British Commissioner in Kandy to remind Keppetipola that the agent appointed by the British Agent represented the interests of His Majesty King of England.
The people of Sabaragamuwa were encouraged by the British because they rendered assistance in the conquest the Kandyan Kingdom and when they refused to pay the duties, Keppetipola immediately placed a total embargo at the traffic at Kadawata. He also as Disava, and not the Agent was entitled to the payment at the Kataragama Devale.
Thus it became clear that the Disava did not accept the new government gladly.
The uprising of the people broke out in October over the appointment of a Moor Muhandiram Hadjee over a predominantly Muslim population in Wellassa. In the meantime a Pretender claiming to the throne named Doraisamy, claiming himself to be the son of Kalu Nayakkar, brother-in-law of Kirti Sri Rajasinha appeared in Wellassa, who proclaimed himself king and demanded allegiance and it was met with success.
On October 12, 1817 when Sylvester Wilson the Assistant Agent at Badulla received the information of the Pretender, decided to send the Moor Headman Hadjee whose appointment was offensive to the people, to Wellassa to apprehend the Pretender.
Hadjee left accompanied by a party of Moors and at Wellassa they were attacked by armed gangs who assailed them.
At this encounter Hadjee was captured while his brother who accompanied him was wounded. On hearing of this incident Wilson set out for Wellassa in October with a party of Malay soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Newman.
Wilson conferred with the insurgents for two days, yet his efforts proved futile and he was eventually killed on his return to Badulla.
Governor Brownrigg lost no time in making defence plans and placed Wellassa under martial law on November 1, and offered a reward of 2000 Rix dollars for apprehending and capture of the Pretender Doraisamy.
Dr. Davy of the British army hospitals had described Keppetipola as active, enterprising and an ambitious man.
William Tolfrey the Chief Translator of the British, stationed in Kandy foresaw the spirit of revolt among the people and wrote to the Governor stating that a deep and extensive plot to annihilate British power is being organised in the Kandyan provinces.
In the meantime Sawers the British Commissioner in Kandy decided to send Keppetipola Disava to quell the rebellion. Instead of taking soldiers he took with him 12 selected armed men loyal to him to meet the rebels.
Keppetipola Disava was addressed by the rebels namely, Maha Badulu Gama Rala, Butave Rate Rala, Kiulegedara Mohottala and Kohukumbure Rala. They impressed upon him the need of his leadership and convinced him to join their struggle to free the country.
British troops
The Disava convinced of their request took a firm decision to join them and sent back the men who accompanied him with their muskets and ammunition issued by the Army and a message to Sawers informing him that he decided to join with the rebels.
The resentment of the people against the British rule first surfaced in Wellassa  the most sparsely populated and isolated area in the Kandyan provinces where people enjoyed some independence even under their own kings.
The Disava knew the need of a claimant to the throne, although he was aware that Doraisamy was merely a pretender and not a prince. Nevertheless he was declared a prince of the displaced king Sri Vickrama Rajasinha and was named Veera Vickrama Keerthi at a solemn ceremony held in May 1818 at Wellawaya and he appointed Maha Badulu Gama Rala, Butawe Rate Rala, Kiulegedera Mohottala and Kohukumbure Rala as his officials.
The pretender thereafter appointed Keppetipola as his Adikaram. The rebellioin became intense and during the following months it began to spread into other areas. Among those who supported the rebels were Adhivasis.
The British troops were placed on alert and their positions were fortified in the provinces and Lady Brownrigg was sent to Colombo for her safety.
With the setting of the rainy season the authorities found it difficult in sending an adequate number of soldiers because they were depleted in their numbers. The mail service was also disturbed by the rebels and hence Uva became isolated from Colombo.
In the latter part of 1817, Wariyapola Sumangala Thera had been planning to send the Sacred Tooth Relic from the Sri Dalada Maligawa for its safety. But it was in April 1816, that the sacred relic was removed secretly in the night and at Wellagiriya in Maturata it was handed over to the rebel leader Keppetipola, who declared before a gathering of people that the Sri Dalada had been handed to him at Hanguranketa.
The exposition of the relic drew crowds of people from the neighbouring villages. The authorities came to know from Rambukpotha Mohottala how the relic was removed from the Sri Dalada Maligawa. He related this incident to Sawers.
The rebellion under Madugalla began to spread into Dumbara followed by Hewaheta and reached Sabaragamuwa. The rest of the areas joined in the struggle. The British power in the Kandyan provinces appeared to be in great peril by April  May. The Governor declared Martial law over the whole of the Kandyan provinces.
Earlier on February 1818, all the Kandyan districts put forth their own leaders. The authorities feared since Keppetipola was connected to all the leading families and they would rise against them.
The rebels fought against the British soldiers adopting tactics when they passed through the jungle in a single file.
The area through which they passed was familiar to the rebels but not to the British soldiers. The rebels attacked them with bows and arrows, spears and muskets. They underwent hardship especially on rainy days.

Uva-Wellassa freedom struggle leaders to be declared patriots
About 900 Sri Lankan leaders who shouldered the Uva-Wellassa freedom struggle in 1818 including Monarawila Keppetipola, will be declared patriots by President Maithripala Sirisena on March 1.

Waters Edge Opens Doors to Our Shop
Waters Edge recently opened a welfare shop to benefit its staff. A part of an ongoing welfare program to uplift the lives of those that serve the hotel wholeheartedly, the welfare shop named Our Shop will provide daily essentials at concessionary rates to all employees.
The idea for the welfare shop first dawned on Susil Silva who is currently the President of the hotels Welfare Committee.
Our Shop stocks a wide variety of staple products needed for a household such as powdered milk, rice, sugar and childrens products besides fruits and vegetables.
All these are made available to employees of the hotel at discounted prices. Further benefitting them, the system in place deducts the entire months grocery bill from the respective employees monthly salary. This is designed in a way to also educate employees on smart money management.
Waters Edge has an extensive staff welfare programme that is headed by a skilled committee and they carry out many projects annually that benefit the employees.
Another project under this programme is opening of a staff gym for all staff commencing from this year.

SAITM Parents Union Secretary Anura Wanigasekera categorically stated yesterday, that they would bring to Court anyone trying to stop the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe from carrying out a medical faculty and awarding of medical degrees.
The Court has held that the institute is empowered to award medical degrees (MBBS) and there was no obstacle to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), he said.
We will take legal action against any person or groups that dare to stand in the way of the judgement of the Court, he said.
SAITM had yet to register at the SLMC. Meanwhile the office bearers of the Government Medical Officers Association have maintained that they are studying the 42 page judgement given by the Court of Appeal as concerns the SAITM issue.
Wanigasekera said, the SLMC could see to the registration of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) and there could be no obstacle for it to do the same with SAITM.

Why we need pre-1972 Parliamentary democracy
The Mahinda Rajapaksa group believes that India and America intervened to topple the previous regime and the incumbent government is guided by this combination of super powers.
He once said: India should not do this. They have to be very cautious about it. Because when the people go against you all, go against the country it is not good for them, not good for us.
However Rajapaksa has admitted receiving New Delhis help to defeat the LTTE. Also, he has admitted that there was some truth in the criticism that he failed to unite the country after the civil war ended. When I wanted to move on political solutions, I invited Sampanthan and other political parties. They did not want to have anything to do with me at that time.
They did not even want to discuss with me, he said. The Tamil leaders expressed the feelings among the Tamil people who suffered under the genocidal attack of the Rajapaksa regime. Mahinda Rajapaksa came to power after sabotaging the peace attempt by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
However Rajapaksa, based on his imperialist theory, made a scathing attack on the United States, which vocally criticised him during his presidency. He said the US had spent nearly 650 million dollars to bring about a regime change.
Shared values and common objectives
The MR team always blamed the civil society for supporting western imperialism. In that scenario, the Pakiyasothy Saravanamuththu narrative contributes a significant change. I dont think we have the licence or the liberty to sit on the sidelines and criticise. We have to engage in a critical and constructive engagement with the government on the basis of shared values and common objectives, he said.
One of the arguments J R Jayewardene of the UNP made in the 1970s was that we need a strong executive to ensure uninterrupted and smooth economic development. But interestingly, after the executive presidency was set up, there was an insurgency in the South and a civil war which went on for three decades, he said. That is a powerful argument against the dictatorial presidency.
Obviously the answer is to share and diffuse power and there should not be a single office relatively immune to checks and balances. That is why it is important to move back to the parliament democracy we had before 1972, and not after 1972, he said.
This intervention counter balances the activities of the JVP and its offshoots, including the Weerawansa faction. After all, still JVP has not completely broken out of Sinhala Buddhist majoritist thinking. That influences all offshoots including Frontline Socialist Party.
TNA leaders
Then in the North, liberal minded Sumanthiran has come under terror attack. The arrested suspects are former LTTE members. Information available from the government investigation, about overseas Tiger involvement in the plot, indicates that serious steps are taken for the security of the MP.
Some believe this was another exercise in the series of attempts by the Diaspora Tigers to revive the LTTE again in the country. The TNA leaders believe that it was too premature to arrive at conclusions whether this was a case of the LTTE being revived or not.
What is clear now is that some misguided former LTTE cadres living in Lanka are being exploited by certain overseas elements through cash incentives to engage in acts of violence on Lankan soil.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa group is also interested in creating clashes and violence. Considering various conspiracies going on, no one can be sure at this time whether this is an individual act targeting Sumanthiran or whether it is part of a more comprehensive design to revive the LTTE again. The TNA is confident that the security agencies will probe this further and arrive at definite conclusions very soon.
Sinhala and Tamil radicals
Sumanthiran is hated by both Sinhala and Tamil radicals. Sinhala chauvinists consider Sumanthiran to be a clever rascal working-out Eelam project with the support of US and other western countries.
As a leader emerged from Chelvanayakam tradition, he has become the western agent of Tamil plot to destroy Sinhala nation. On the other hand, Tamil radicals believe Sumanthiran is a traitor come to destroy the Tamil Eelam project.
So, Sumanthiran has the right to say that it is too early to speculate whether the targeting him is an isolated matter or part of another broader attempt to revive the LTTE again in Lanka.
There have been many such attempts before and have been discussed seriously both in the north and in the south.
Sumanthiran has been playing a very fearless role in bridging the gulf among the nationalities and striving to ensure the liberation of Tamil people, through mass struggle in democracy.
In recent times he has been making a creative contribution to the Constitution making process as the TNA member of the Constitutional Assembly steering committee with Dr Jayampathy Wickramarathne.
It is the expectation of all democratic people that the enactment of a progressive Constitution would be a significant achievement in the struggle for resolving the Tamil national problem. Hence both Sinhala fascistic groups as well as Tamil separatists are being united in opposition to the envisaged Constitution for different reasons. It is necessary to defeat both tendencies and go forward in the path of democracy.

Women and children attacked in Dortmund fan clash
Berlin: Hardcore Borussia Dortmund fans attacked terrified RB Leipzig supporters, including children and women, in football battles that led to 28 arrests, German authorities said.
A crowd of 81,360 saw Dortmund's 1-0 home win over second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday, but there were ugly scenes outside Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium before kick-off when some of the 8,500 visiting fans were targeted.
"In the build-up to the match, in the Strobelallee area (outside the ground), RB Leipzig supporters were bombarded with stones and cans from Borussia Dortmund fans," police said in a statement.
RB Leipzig were unable to tell SID, an AFP subsidiary, how many of their fans were hurt, but German daily Bild claim at least 10 visiting supporters were hospitalised.
After a group of around 500 hardcore 'Ultra' Dortmund fans went on the rampage, police weighed in with pepper spray and batons.
Arrests were made for offences including assault, grievous bodily harm, breach of the peace, insulting behaviour and resisting arrest.
"All in all, there was extreme aggressiveness and violence from Dortmund supporters, which was directed against any person recognised as a Leipzig fan, regardless of whether they were small children, women or families," said Dortmund police.
"In connection with this, four officers and a police dog were injured."
Borussia Dortmund said they "deeply regretted the riots" and wished the injured Leipzig fans a speedy recovery.
Leizpig, who are in their first season in Germany's top flight, have demanded an explanation from Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and president Reinhard Rauball.
"The attacks of Dortmund fans against opposing spectators and the police, plus insults and offenses against women and children, are not acceptable and are embarrasing for the whole of football in Germany," said RB Leipzig in a statement.
"The fact that people were confronted with violence at a football match is unacceptable.
"We expect from Mr Watzke and Mr Rauball that these scenes, which were committed by several perpetrators, will be fully explained in the interests of the entire Bundesliga.
"We are glad that, according to our information, the injured RB Leipzig fans were able to return home."
RB Leipzig, who are backed by energy drinks giant Red Bull, are unpopular amongst German fans for the commercialism the club is perceived to represent, but Dortmund fans were particularly unwelcoming. There were several offensive banners in the Dortmund stadium aimed at RB, including "Burnout Ralph, go hang yourself!" after Leipzig's sports director Ralf Rangnick resigned from Schalke in 2011 with burnout.

## Title: All about Lady Gaga's Super Bowl show

All about Lady Gaga's Super Bowl show

First things first: is Lady Gaga OK She was last seen dropping the mic, grabbing a flying football and seemingly jumping into a deep pit.
That all came at the end of 13 minutes of frantic action that started on the roof of a stadium in Houston, saw her plummet down to ground level before apparently running a few kilometres. All while singing, and fitting in one costume change. Not bad.
The consensus was that Lady Gaga nailed it - it being the half-time show of the Super Bowl, the big date in any American football fan's diary.
In doing so, she followed such names as the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson and Beyonce (more on her later.)
But there was one big question before the game: how political would her show be So, naturally, our first question is:
How political was her show
In the past, Lady Gaga has not been shy in addressing the questions that matter most to her, most notably LGBTQ issues.
The show took place barely two weeks since the election of Donald Trump, who is reported to have been preparing an executive order rolling back LGBTQ rights.
And given that her showcame a year after Beyonce's blistering, politically-charged half-time show, all the expectations were that Gaga's show would be a platform for some sort of pointed message.
So in the end, it was perhaps a bit of a surprise that there was not a more explicit message delivered.
It was what she had promised, to be fair.
"The only statements that I'll be making during the half-time show are the ones that I've been consistently making throughout my career," she had said. And so it proved.
There were no dancers dressed as Black Panthers, a la Beyonce.
But we did get a brief introduction incorporating the lyrics of Woody Guthrie "This land is your land/This land is my land" and the Pledge of Allegiance "One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
To those seeking a political statement from Lady Gaga, it did the job. And it will have appeared purely as a patriotic message to everyone else. So win-win.
But one moment did stand out for those watching - one of the six songs she delivered was a message to all those who feel excluded, Born This Way.
"No matter gay, straight or bi/Lesbian, transgendered life/I'm on the right track baby/I was born to survive."
So, did Lady Gaga perform a Satanic ritual
Apparently not.
In the build-up to the Super Bowl, this was a legitimate concern ofthe right-wing organisation Infowars.
There were no immediate reports by Houston Police of Satanic activity on Sunday night.
What about the adverts
Well, this is one place where there was an unmistakable message, on a weekend in which a ban on new arrivals to the US from seven Muslim-majority nations was blocked by a judge.
That message was: "We're all one nation together, and we respect where people come from and the journey they took to get here."
This was most obvious in the advert by Airbnb showing people of different colours under the hashtag #weaccept -an ad apparently produced in only a few days last week.
"We believe no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong," the advert said. "The world is more beautiful the more you accept."
The company, which has been attacked in the past for not being inclusive enough, went on to announce a programme to support refugees.
It was obvious too, in the advert for a lumber company showing the journey made by a family from Central America to the States (a longer version posted online shows them arriving at a huge wall, only to find someone had built a door into it).
And it was obvious too in the advert by a leading beer company showing the (no doubt fictionalised) struggle its founder had in moving to the US.
All reports in Florida, where Mr Trump was on a brief trip, indicate he did not watch the whole match. He did not tweet his opinion of Lady Gaga's show.

All Blacks lock Tuipulotu tests positive, shocked at result
CHRISTCHURCH, Saturday - All Blacks lock Patrick Tuipulotu tested positive for a banned substance last year and was shocked at the result, New Zealand Rugby (NZR) said on Sunday.
Tuipulotu was sent home from the All Blacks end of season tour last November after testing positive for an unspecified banned substance. The team said at the time he had departed for personal reasons.
NZR and the New Zealand Rugby Players Association (NZRPA) issued a statement confirming the positive test after a report in the local media on Sunday.
NZR and NZRPA can confirm that, in November 2016, they were notified that a doping control sample provided by Patrick Tuipulotu had, reportedly, revealed the presence of a specified substance listed on (WADA)'s prohibited list, the statement said.
Patrick was shocked by the test result and is working hard to identify the source of the specified substance. In accordance with WADA regulations, Patrick remains provisionally suspended pending resolution of this matter.
Further to these regulations, NZR and NZPRA are bound by strict confidentiality obligations.
The 24-year-old Tuipulotu made his All Blacks debut in 2014 and was in contention for the 2015 World Cup squad but underwent surgery for a congenital hip problem and missed most of the season.
He returned to the national team last year but returned home early after he played his 12th test in the 68-10 victory over Italy in November.
Tuipulotu has not reported to his Super Rugby side for pre-season training due to the provisional ban, the Auckland Blues also blaming an ongoing personal matter for his absence.
World Rugby are signatories to the World Anti-Doping Agency Code and, as a first-time offender, he could face sanctions ranging from a warning to a two-year ban.
Former women's sevens player Lavinia Gould was the first New Zealand international to receive a ban for doping in 2013 after she tested positive for methylhexaneamine.

Alhaj S.M.A.M. Muzammil
He was respected by all
A light has gone out without as much as a flicker. All that was left is the precious memory how brightly it burnt and the warmth it gave us while alive.
With much respect and affection, I write this appreciation for an untold icon of the Southern Sri Lanka and a moral scholar of Panadura, Kaleefathushazuli S.M.A.M. Muzammil (Gafoori) on his 24th year of demise.
Born on February 18, 1926 to Sheikh Madhar Aalim and Hajiyani Azeezumma at Thotawatta, Kaleefathushazuli. Muzammil had showed early brilliance in his primary studies at Al-Fahriya Muslim Vidyalaya. He completed his moral education (1939-47) at Maharagama Ghafooriyya Arabic College and graduated as a Moulavi. His outstanding skills created a pathway where he was invited as a teacher from the Arabic College.
As a teacher, his journey covered Arabic College (1947-49), Colombo Zahira College (1949-55), Dharga Town Zahira College (1958-59) and again Colombo Zahira College (1959-60).
He also graduated from the University of Peradeniya (1955-58) and received the Al-Aalim award at a young age.
Between 1960-61, he was employed at the Ceylon Labour Department changing his career flow. He was also a Deputy Principal at Panadura, Thotawatta, Al-Fahriya Muslim Vidyalaya from 1961 to four years. For his excellence in the education field, he was inducted to the Education Ministrys Textbook Production Crew. Later, he completed the Diploma in Education at the University of Peradeniya and served Weligama, Arafa Maha Vidyalaya (1966-70) as a deputy principal.
He served Panadura, Henamulla, Jeelan Muslim Vidyalaya (1970-72) as a principal.
He was later promoted and served the community as the Tamil Education officer at Kalutara, Pelmadulla Educational division for many years until his retirement. His efforts in establishing Sunnat-wal-Jamath policies and effectively initiating Shazuliya Thareeqa concerns are commendable.
Khalifa as he was fondly called, ws a remarkable mentor for the Panadura, Thotawatta Jumma Masjids Administrative Committee aka Annadvathul Fasiyathush Shazuliya Committee. He authoured many books but not limited to Masjid and Islam  A Law as his literal outcomes. More over, he was the deputy president of the All Ceylon Jammiyathul Ulama Association. He was honoured and appointed as a member of the Wakf board.
His service continued as he excelled as a director at Bahjathul Ibrahimiyya Arabic College, Galle. A straight forward personality, he was the founder creator of the current law policies and implied terms of Panadura, Thotawatta Jumma Masjid Administrative Committee. He also upgraded Al Fahriya Muslim Vidyalaya to the state of Central College.
His achievement as the winner at the all island research article competition on the presence of living beings in other planets do resemble his excellence in literature. He served the Muslim community of Thotawatta, by heading masjid's administrative society for nearly 30 years.
It is noteworthy that his elder son, a Registrar of Muslim Marriages and former Panadura Alhaj. S.MA.M. Muzammil (Ghafoori) who served the community and the country from different aspects left this world on February 4, 1993.
Innalillahi Wa Inna Ilaihi Rajiyun.
May the almighty grant him Jannath-Ul-Firdawz.

Randolph Gomes and Anthea Gomes
Their memories will never fade
February 4, 2017 marked another death anniversary of Randolph Gomes. He was lovingly called, Bagi by his family members and friends.
A teenager riding a motorcycle without a license crashed into him outside his house at Mattakkuliya. His head hit the parapet wall. He was taken to hospital, but died at the ICU on February 4, as the nation celebrated 65 years of Independence. His tragic death shocked his family and friends.
During his younger days, automobiles were his passions and in his later life, he was interested in various types of clocks. He had a spacious garden, and enjoyed every moment with his collection of clocks.
I got to know him, because we worshiped at St. John's Church. Mattakkuliya. Later, my children Patricia Jerome and Lester became members of St. John's Church. Cynthia and Anthea were my friends, and Baji and his family took part in all the church activities. I was shocked to hear that Anthea passed away on February 6. Bagi and she were twins.
It was a shock when I heard of Anthea's death. This shows how much she loved Bagi, and how she couldn't bear his sudden parting. She was the live wire of the family.
As Christians we belive that we will meet our loved ones, on the heavenly shore and that there won't be any parting.

Back to the future: US passed immigration ban 100 years ago

PresidentDonald Trump has dismissed as "ridiculous"a federal judge'sdecision to halt his controversial executive orderdenying certain refugees and immigrants entry into the United States.
Many Americans are up in arms. But in fact, keeping out desperate souls seeking entry into America has deep roots. On this day 100 years ago, the United States passed the strictest immigration law of its time: the Immigration Act of 1917.
The law restricted the immigration of "undesirables," including many people from the Middle East and Asia, through increased taxes, tests and outright bans.
Trump's ban, which has promptednationwide protests and widespread condemnation, is eerily similar targeting some of the same people and imposing tests in the form of "extreme vetting," according to observers.
"In some ways this is kind of back to the future," said Kevin Johnson, an immigration law expert and dean at the UC Davis School of Law.
What was the Immigration Act of 1917
TheImmigration Actbarred an ambiguous and long list of people from entering the country.
According to the law, these included "all idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, epileptics, insane persons ... persons with chronic alcoholism; paupers, professional beggars," and those with tuberculosis and other contagious diseases. It barred felons, polygamists, prostitutes and their traffickers, and -- similar to Trump's ban -- it blocked entry to those who "advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of the United States, or of all forms of law" and anyone who would "advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety" of killing of US officers or officials.
To keep these people out, the law raised the tax imposed on most adult entrants. It also imposed a literacy test, requiring newcomers older than 16 to demonstrate basic reading comprehension in any language.
Moreover, the law kept out people from what it called the "Asiatic Barred Zone," which included modern day India, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Southeast Asia and the Asian-Pacific islands.
China was not included, but the Chinese were already denied immigration visas under the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act -- which became more discriminatory over the years until it was repealed in 1943 after Beijing became a World War II ally.
Exempt were Japan and the Philippines. The former had voluntarily limited its peoples' immigration to the United States in 1907. The latter was a US colony at the time.
Who supported the law and why
US lawmakers who drafted and passed the immigration law characterized it as necessary for the country's security. WithWorld War I in full swing, the issue of national security was on everyone's mind.
"There was domestic anxiety and uncertainty and frustration and the Soviet Union was being formed," said Johnson, author of "The Huddled Masses Myth: Immigration And Civil Rights."
"There was a Red Scare on the horizon. There were political tensions. There was a concern with widespread immigration."
The State Department'sOffice of the Historianadds: "The uncertainty generated over national security during World War I made it possible for Congress to pass this legislation."
Domestically, Johnson said the law was fairly popular.
"In 1917, segregation and Jim Crow is alive and well and keeping out Chinese from the country and all Asians seems as normal and natural as apple pie," he said.
What did critics say
The immigration law did not pass unopposed. In fact, it was vetoed by President Woodrow Wilson, but Congress overrode the veto.
Wilson argued that the law contradicted US values and prevented good people from joining American society.
Invetoing an earlier version of the act, Wilson said it would "all but close entirely the gates of asylum which have always been open to those who could find nowhere else the right and opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they conceived to be the natural and inalienable rights of men."
"Restrictions like these, adopted earlier in our history as a Nation, would very materially have altered the course and cooled the humane ardors of our politics," he wrote.
"The right of political asylum has brought to this country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land, and who has yet become an ornament to our citizenship and to our public councils."
International reaction to the law was also harsh, with many of the named countries condemning the law, Johnson said.
How is Trump's immigration ban similar
On January 27,Trump signed an executive order that suspended immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, halted the US refugee program for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States.
"I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry," Trump's order reads. Other countries impacted included Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.
The order also instituted screening tests on refugees and immigrants to see if they held American values. The President has described the process as "extreme vetting."
"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America," Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. "We don't want them here."
The total number of refugees admitted into the United States was also capped during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.
The order followed Trump's campaign promise to tighten borders and stop certain refugees from entering the United States.
Although the the Immigration Act of 1917 is more far-reaching than Trump's order, observers say they're similar in at least three ways: First, supporters of both argued the restrictions were necessary for national security. Second, the restrictions imposed a type of test. Third, the bans seemingly discriminate against people based on their national origin.
What was the impact
It's difficult to quantify theimpact of immigration bans. When refugees and immigrants are barred from entering countries, persecuted people cannot escape danger and may be harmed or killed,families are separated, opportunities are lost and finances spent on travel are squandered. Host countries may also lose out on labor, knowledge and expertise that could potentially strengthen their societies and economies.
In fact, the Immigration Act of 1917 was challenged by businesses in the Southwest that said literacy tests barred much-needed Mexican laborers from entering the country.
Trump's executive order banning certain immigrants also risked preventing students from finishing academic programs anddoctors from returning to their jobs in American hospitals. It also prevented sick people from receiving life-saving treatment.
Iranian infantFatemeh Reshand, for example, almost missed the opportunity to receive medical treatment for a serious heart defect. It took much lobbying from family members and community leaders to grant her and her parents a medical exemption.
Where do these laws stand now
The Immigration Act of 1917 was revised by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act. The law abolished racial restrictions but retained quotas for nationalities and regions. It also established a preference system that placed higher value on some nationalities and immigrants with specific labor skills.
As for Trump's executive order on immigration, it wastemporarily haltedFriday by a federal judge. The Department of Homeland Security then suspended implementation of the order, saying it would resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the ban.
But later Saturday, the Justice Department said it wouldfile an appealof the judge's order.

Bank of England sharply raises 2017 growth outlook
The Bank of England has made another dramatic rise in its growth forecast for this year.
It expects the economy to grow 2% in 2017, up from a November forecast of 1.4%, which was itself an upgrade from the 0.8% forecast made in August.
The Bank also made a striking forecast about the savings rate, which it expects to fall to 4%, the lowest rate since the early 1960s.
As expected the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.25%.
The raised growth forecast follows much criticism levelled at the Bank for being too gloomy when it drastically cut its growth forecast after Junes vote in favour of Brexit.
Domestic demand has been stronger than expected in the past few months, and there have been relatively few signs of the slowdown in consumer spending that the committee had anticipated following the referendum, the Bank said in its latest Quarterly Inflation Report.
The Bank said the latest, improved forecast was partly the result of higher spending and investment contained in Chancellor Philip Hammonds Autumn Statement.
It also credited stronger growth in the US and Europe, rising stock markets and the greater availability of credit for households, for its more optimistic outlook for the UK
economy.
However, the Bank still sees the economy slowing in 2018, when it expects growth of 1.6%.
It blames that deceleration on an expected slowdown in spending by households as they adjust to higher inflation. The Bank thinks that income growth, when adjusted for inflation, will stall in 2017.
It predicts a significant fall in the saving ratio over the next three years as consumers take time to adjust spending growth to weaker income flows. The savings rate is expected to fall to 4%, the lowest rate since records began in the early 1960s.
The erosion in consumer spending power is partly down to higher consumer price inflation, which the Bank forecasts running at 2% this year, slightly higher than its previous forecast of 1.8% made in November.
Much of that inflation is the result of the weaker pound, which is making imported goods more expensive.
The pound is still about 16% below the level seen before the referendum. In recent months it has fallen below $1.21 against the dollar, but has bounced off those lows.
The Bank expects the weakness in the pound to propel inflation higher and it expects inflation of 2.7% next year, which is well above its target rate of 2%. BBC News

Batticaloa women take RTI route to seek details on loved ones

Last week, when Sri Lankas Right To Information Act came into effect, a group of women in Batticaloa had a plan.
After years of petitioning government offices and testifying to innumerable commissions, they decided to use the brand new Act, to seek information about their missing relatives.
We set out at eight in the morning, and went from one office to the other until 5.45 p.m., P. Deepa toldThe Hinduover telephone.
Adopted in 2016
In June 2016, Sri Lankas Parliament unanimously adopted the Right to Information (RTI) law, inspiring hope among sections pushing for greater transparency and accountability in Sri Lanka. The Act came into effect on February 3.
The very same day, nearly 15 women went by foot to the District Secretariat, the provincial and district police headquarters, the Human Rights Commission and the prisons department to submit applications asking for details on their disappeared family members. They walked around the town in the blazing sun, skipping lunch and fighting pessimism.
Sri Lankas Eastern Province witnessed some of the most brutal aspects of the islands protracted civil war  tens of thousands lost their lives, and thousands were abducted reportedly by the Sri Lankan armed forces and, in some cases, the LTTE. Enforced disappearances remains a key concern for many families in Sri Lankas Tamil-majority North and East.
For the women, who have been running from pillar to post hoping for some clue about their relatives, Fridays effort was yet another attempt. But it did not make them optimistic.
No convincing response
It was like all our previous efforts  yielding no convincing response, said Ms. Deepa, who has been searching for her husband since 2009.
Ironically, the small group of women ended up educating officials on the Act passed by the government, said A. Amalanayaki, who has also been looking for her husband.
Most of the government officials were not aware of the Act, let alone be prepared to receive applications, the women said.
Insensitivity of officials
Sri Lankas Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake has said that since the Act was new to the country, they cant be 100 per cent right just as yet.
The women understand that teething troubles are likely in any such intervention. However, it is the now-familiar insensitivity in government offices that makes women like Ms. Amalanayaki feel dejected. A few officials were courteous, but many others were insensitive, the women said.
One officer asked us you have waited for eight years; cant you wait another few days Clearly, they do not realise what we go through without any information on our loved ones, she said.

Bench strength turned ugly display into beautiful win - Jones
LONDON, Saturday - England's growing strength in depth was underlined in bold at Twickenham on Saturday as the influx of replacements in the last 20 minutes dragged the initiative from France and helped the Six Nations champions battle out a 19-16 victory.
England trailed 16-12 after an hour as Rabah Slimani scored the opening try for France, who had been the better team for most of the first half.
Within minutes coach Eddie Jones had virtually emptied his bench and the fresh men made an immediate impact.
Flanker James Haskell, who has played only a few minutes all season after toe surgery, prop Matt Mullan, winger Jack Nowell, scrumhalf Danny Care and burly centre Ben Te'o were all immediately involved in a sustained period of pressure, as was Maro Itoje, who seemed to get a second wind after being switched back to his preferred lock role after starting in the back row.
The relentless attack and fresh legs punched holes in the tiring French defence and Te'o blasted through one of them for the decisive try two minutes after coming on.
The finishers made a fantastic impact on the game, we got really good value from them and that is the strength of our team, we have a brilliant 23-man squad, said Jones, who were without five first-team regulars.
Hooker and captain Dylan Hartley, who as usual gave way to Jamie George midway through the second half, agreed. A huge amount of credit needs to go to our finishers today. Ben Te'o and James Haskell gave us some go forward at the end there, he said.
Jamie George came on and our set-piece was outstanding, Matt Mullan came on and shored things up. Everyone who came on today added something to the performance.
The strong finish could not, however, disguise the fact that England had been poor to the point of ragged in the first half and were lucky to reach the break at 9-9. So there was no fanfare from Jones, despite chalking up a national record 15th successive victory.
It doesn't get much uglier than that, said the coach, who during the week had called for his side to be daring.
We weren't our usual urgent selves and maybe I've got to look at the preparation I gave the team.
The performance was ugly, but the result is beautiful.
A losing bonus point and man of the match honours for number eight Louis Picamoles were scant consolation for France, who have won only one Six Nations game at Twickenham in 20 years.
It was a very good performance from us but we lose again, he said. We need to win and continue to work hard but it was a good performance.
The positive to take is the spirit we had. We stayed strong the whole game against a strong side but we need to be more pragmatic and we need to take the points when we go on the attack.

Boult knocks Aussies for six as N.Zealand take series
Trent Boult of New Zealand celebrates taking the last wicket of Australian Josh Hazlewood during the one-day international cricket match between New Zealand and Australia at Seddon Park in Hamilton AFP
HAMILTON : A six-wicket haul for Trent Boult and a Ross Taylor century carried New Zealand to a 24-run victory over Australia in the third one-day international Sunday to win the series 2-0. Their masterclass saw New Zealand reclaim the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy while Australia also lost their outright hold on the world number one ODI ranking.
They slipped to 118 ranking points, equal with South Africa, who beat Sri Lanka in Johannesburg on Saturday to go 3-0 up.
South Africa will overtake Australia if they win the remaining two matches in that series. When Kane Williamson won the toss he had no hesitation in batting first on the Hamilton wicket, correctly forecasting it would slow up as the day wore on and Boult would come into his own.
But in the prime early batting conditions, New Zealand appeared to have under-performed with their 281 for nine, despite Taylor's 107 off 101 balls and his century partnership with Dean Brownlie who made 63.
With rankings and the series at stake after New Zealand won the first ODI by six wickets and the second was washed out, Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh made a flying start to Australia's reply, averaging more than six an over.
They were particularly harsh on Tim Southee, whose opening four-over spell cost 30 runs, while new-ball partner and man-of-the-match Boult then had one for 10.

Busy bees South Africa rout Sri Lanka by seven wickets
JOHANNESBURG, Saturday  South Africa routed Sri Lanka by seven wickets to take the third one-day international at the Wanderers on Saturday in a match held up for an hour after bees swarmed onto the famous arena.
The hosts also took a winning 3-0 lead in the five-match series after bowling out Sri Lanka for 163 before South Africa captain AB de Villiers starred with an undefeated 60.
In what has become a traditional pink day at the Wanderers, with the South African players and most of the capacity crowd wearing pink in support of breast cancer awareness, De Villiers apologised for not providing the feast of run scoring that has marked four previous such occasions.
The crowd was amazing although we didn't score 300 and hit a lot of sixes, said De Villiers.
Our focus today was on winning the series and our bowlers did a fantastic job. It wasn't an easy wicket to bat on and if Sri Lanka had got a hundred runs more they could have made it difficult for us.
Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga was left to bemoan another sub-standard batting performance, with five batsmen falling to short-pitched bowling.
We had a very good start but we didn't capitalise. Niroshan Dickwella batted well but didn't have support.
Despite Dickwella's 74, Sri Lanka were bowled out in 39.2 overs after being sent in to bat. It was the third time in as many matches they failed to bat for a full 50 overs.
It was never likely to be enough, although pace bowlers Suranga Lakmal and newcomers Lahiru Kumara and Lahiru Madushanka made the hosts work hard in the early stages of the chase.
Kumara and Madushanka both picked up a wicket while Lakmal had Hashim Amla dropped by wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal when the opening batsman was on 12.
Amla went on to make 34 before being run out by a superb throw from deep extra cover by Madushanka.
The left-handed Dickwella was dropped on 25 when JP Duminy, running back from backward point, could not hold on to a high leading edge from Kagiso Rabada's bowling.
He was tested several times by some short-pitched deliveries from South Africa's fast bowlers.
With Dickwella on 55 and looking settled, there was a delay of an hour after a swarm of bees drove the players from the field with the total on 117 for four after 26.3 overs.
The bees were eventually cleared with the help of a local beekeeper who was watching television and rushed to the ground with his equipment and talked his way in.
Dickwella added another 19 runs before his 80-ball innings was ended when he gloved an attempted pull against a short delivery from Dwaine Pretorius to present wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock with his 100th dismissal in 72 one-day internationals. Dickwella hit seven boundaries.
Sri Lanka got off to their best start of the series with Dickwella and Tharanga putting on 60 for the first wicket before Tharanga (31) top-edged a pull against Rabada, one ball after Dickwella had been dropped, and was caught at fine leg.
Sea mer Pretorius, playing in his first match of the series in place of Wayne Parnell, took three for 19 and was named man of the match. - AFP

Chelsea crush Arsenal, Liverpool lose in Premier League
LONDON, Saturday - Chelsea moved another step towards regaining the Premier League title with a 3-1 drubbing of Arsenal in the table-topping London derby at Stamford Bridge on Saturday as only Tottenham Hotspur maintained their distant pursuit of the leaders.
Antonio Conte's side moved 12 points clear of Arsenal with a performance decorated by one of the goals of the season, a dazzling individual effort from Eden Hazard starting from near the halfway line.
The 2015 champions command at the top of the table was strengthened further with fourth-placed Liverpool falling 13 points adrift after their wretched 2017 continued with a shock 2-0 defeat at resurgent Hull City.
Only second-placed Spurs, the one team to have defeated Chelsea in their last 17 matches in all competitions, appear up for the fight, reducing the gap at the top to nine points with their 1-0 win over Middlesbrough in the day's late match.
Hull's win over Liverpool saw them clamber up one place to 18th in the relegation zone while another startling result featured Crystal Palace, who lost 4-0 at home to bottom club Sunderland, with all the goals coming in the first half.
Conte was a satisfied man as he watched Chelsea avenge their worst defeat of the season in September at the Emirates, the 3-0 reverse that prompted him to change their tactical approach.
The Blues have never looked back since and an early header from Marcos Alonso, the dazzling second-half solo goal from Hazard and a poor clearance from Petr Cech that allowed Cesc Fabregas to chip into an unguarded net in the dying minutes sealed their revenge.
Hazard's goal was, by his own admission, beautiful. The Belgian picked up the ball just inside his own half, swerved away from Laurent Koscielny, outmuscled Francis Coquelin and turned Koscielny inside out again before beating Cech from close range.
Olivier Giroud earned a stoppage-time consolation goal but a fourth defeat in nine league matches effectively ended Arsenal's title hopes for another season as they now lie third on 47 points, after 24 games, to Chelsea's 59.
It was an important game. I consider Arsenal one of the six teams that can fight for the title until the end of the season. To put them 12 points behind is very important for us, said Conte, after presiding over a 14th home win in 15 games at Stamford Bridge.
In every session they show me great attitude and great will to fight and win this league.
Liverpool's defeat looked to have ended their challenge too as Juergen Klopp's men succumbed to goals from Hull's on-loan Senegalese strikers, Alfred N'Diaye and Oumar Niasse. It continued a woeful run for the Reds in 2017, who have won just once in their last 10 games, leaving a baffled Klopp to suggest their slump made no sense.
Tottenham, though, appear to continue to believe as they stretched their unbeaten run in all competitions to 14 games and hit the half-century of points, with Harry Kane's second-half penalty earning victory in a game they dominated but made heavy weather of sealing at White Hart Lane.
Sunderland's Jermain Defoe scored twice in first-half stoppage time as he turned Sam Allardyce's reunion with his former club into a nightmare, the Palace boss having to watch his side ship three goals in six minutes before the break.
Sunderland remain bottom on 19 points but now have the same tally as Palace, one behind Hull, who are making dramatic strides under new Portuguese boss Marco Silva.
Everton, unbeaten in the league since Christmas, continued their excellent run with Romelu Lukaku scoring four in their helter-skelter 6-3 win over Bournemouth, his first coming after just 30 seconds to equal the fastest in the League this season.
The Belgian international striker is now the league's leading marksman with 16 goals with Chelsea's Costa and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez on 15 and Kane and Defoe on 14 along with Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

China will not be allowed to set up military facility at Hambantota port: envoy
Sri Lanka will not allow China to set up a military facility at any port in the country, the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Beijing said on Saturday, adding that Chinese investors have been informed that no civilian facility will be allowed to be used militarily.
We have to consider the concerns of the neighbours. We do not want to create any situation, which may become (a source of) suspicion. We know the Indian Ocean is a very important ocean in international trade, Sri Lankan Ambassador Karunasena Kodituwakku said.
We can have friendly joint exercises with India, US, Pakistan and with China. In case of Hambantota port, there will be a base for the Sri Lankan Navy, he said. The terms of handing over the Hambantota port to the Chinese company, China Merchants Port Holding (CMPH) company have been broadly decided, Kodituwakku said.
I do not know about other countries, but Sri Lanka has very categorically informed the investor that it (Hambantota port) will not be allowed to be used for any military purposes, he said.
Not only the Hambantota port, any port in Sri Lanka will not be allowed to be used by any military.
Kodituwakku said that the Hambantota port hasnt been a viable project so far.
Very small numbers (of ships). Even the incoming they have received is not even enough to maintain the port maintenance, forget the salaries about the people who are working, he said.
With officials from both countries working to finalise a free trade agreement (FTA) this year, marking the 65th year of trade ties, unease over Chinas financial influence could see a spike in the coming months.
The FTA and several facets of Chinese investment in Sri Lanka will be on the agenda when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visits Beijing in May to attend an international seminar on President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Teachers disgrace
It is disheartening to voice via the multi media that some teachers have resorted to corporal punishment in schools in spite of its ban by law. Then how can these emotionally excited pedagogues take the law into their hands after having studied educational psychology before entering the noble profession of teaching the younger generation
Recently, some teachers have been reported to have used broomsticks to punish their students for some mistakes the latter have committed unintentionally. Then, when the students parents took up this case in the courts, the judge punished the particular teachers by imposing upon them payment of compensation to the injured students while serving imprisonment for a fixed period.
What a disgrace to the teachers community! The noble character of teaching service is utterly lost in public. The parents are compelled to lose trust and confidence on the teachers in general.
Then can we entrust our young children to these arrogant teachers for gradual development of character linked with education May I draw the earnest attention of Education Minister and the Department of Education to the criteria of an ideal teacher just before appointment. Besides, the education planners and inspectors of schools should inspect the teaching tasks of these teachers at least once a month and should assess the teachers performance in relation to students and the condition of discipline observed by both teachers and students.
In cases of misbehaviour, the principal and inspectors should submit reports about this matter to higher authorities in education for deterrent punishment without getting involved in police arrest and courts action.
Therefore, I am making a special appeal to the teachers who deviate from the ethics of teaching service to maintain their noble character in the best interest of the younger generation engaged in education.

Clean, green and organic
A good home garden gives you mental satisfaction knowing you are eating healthy food. Just imagine seeing a beautiful cluster of oranges on a tree in your home garden! Tasting it, you know that it is 100 percent natural! Garden Talk speaks to District Agriculture Instructor and Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Ratmalana K.N.K Jayathilake on Urban Agriculture and Home Gardening.
"If we take Urban Agriculture, it was introduced to the Western Province in 2000. The reason was, we felt that in urban areas, the populace are not able to produce healthy vegetables and fruits in healthy conditions and we also felt that there are certain difficulties in maintaining a Home Garden in the city. This concept was introduced by Provincial Director of Agriculture, Western Province, Dr. T.T Ranasinghe," said Jayathilake
If you take the district of Colombo it is very urbanized. Even the suburbs of Colombo are also going through rapid urbanization. So because of this, horizontal spaces are becoming fewer and fewer and limited. This also can be attributed to industrialization and population growth. That is why they have introduced Urban Agriculture to the Western Province.
"When we take Colombo, there is the high income earning, middle income earning and low income earning bracket. But all segments face a common problem which is obtaining healthy vegetables and fruits. So the reason we have introduced Urban Agriculture, is to teach people to utilize the small, limited, existing spaces to grow vegetables, fruits and medicinal herbs. So we want to teach them to grow what is required by their families. We also want to, if possible introduce animal husbandry on a small scale. That is basically what Urban Agriculture is about," explained Jayathilake
Also people can start small businesses growing mushrooms, growing vegetables and growing flowers. So we can plan out our urban home garden by using the concepts formulated by Urban Agriculture. Here we observe five methodologies.
* Family Nutrition
* Technology Adaption
* Crop Management
* Post- Harvest Technology and Value Addition.
* Landscaping and Housekeeping
Following these concepts we can outline our plan for our Home Garden.
Family Nutrition
"When we take Family Nutrition, you consider the requirements of the members of your household. So you grow certain types of plants under the healthiest possible conditions. We know that in cities there are health problems. So we need to consume healthy foods and be mindful of it. We need to grow nutritious food that is required by the specific family and grow them in the right amounts. We need to keep in mind that we are dealing with small and limited spaces in the cities. So we need to focus on growing more of what is necessary. If we can grow what we need in our own home garden, then we don't need to go to the market. We can grow vegetables in our own environment and keep it healthy and devoid of chemicals. So this will be an organic production," added Jayathilake
This will be a huge support economically. It will help us save our money as we don't need to go to the market.
"Also it is important to have a diverse source of nutrition by growing more types of nutritious plants. Without consuming the same vegetables or fruits over and over again, we need to get used to a variety of it. So you need to manage your home garden focusing on nutrition," added Jayathilake
Technology Adaption is the second methodology. There are challenges in maintaining an urban home garden.
"In Colombo many people live in apartment buildings. Even in some houses there is no garden space. There is limited sunlight and there is a lack of proper soil. So we need to use new technologies. So we need to think of the long term when using these technologies. So here we need to go for vertical planning. We need to think how to use vertical spaces," informed Jayathilake.
Here there are so many methods that can be used. The following are the vertical spaces you can create-
* Cultivation Towers
* Cultivation Racks
* Cultivation Tat
* Cultivation Bottle
* Cultivation Frames
* Cultivation Umbrella
These are the types of vertical structures you can create.
The third is methodology is Crop Management. Here we need to be extremely mindful of the soil.
Proper nutrients
"The plants need proper nutrients. The composition of the soil is also important. You need proper amounts of organic manure to be mixed with the soil. So this is very important when planning out your home garden or even when growing in pots. You need a lot of compost. There should also be a good drainage system. Then you can get very good crops. When growing in pots you need to mix organic manure in the soil in the pots. When preparing a home garden, if you don't have proper soil in your garden you need to buy it from the market. If you do have soil but it needs organic manure, then you need to buy organic manure from the market," stated Jayathilake
Irrigation is also important because you need to administer the recommended amount of water.
"Here, if you have a limited amount of time to spend in your garden, you can employ a drip irrigation system, bottle irrigation system or sprinklers. Here you can take a plastic bottle and fill it with water. Then you pierce the cap and insert the bottle into the pot. Then drip by drip the plant will be watered. This is a technology that will provide wetness. So doing this three times for one week is enough. In a garden you need proper drains to ensure that water does not collect and is properly drained. We also need to minimize soil erosion," explained Jayathilake
Rain water harvesting is another method that we can use for our home garden.
"The rain that collects in the gutters can be collected in a tank. So then we don't need to use water from our taps. This will save us a lot of money. The water collected in the tank can be used for our home garden. But we must prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. That is something we must be mindful of," noted Jayathilake
If you take the busy city of Colombo, vegetables and fruits, can be grown in their rooftops and balconies when there is a space limitation.
What to grow
"So as I mentioned before, you need to select what to grow and in what amounts suited to your family. In balconies one has to opt for growing in pots. Since you are growing in pots in your balcony, you will need to get soil from the market or from somewhere else. Then you can also grow on rooftops. Sunlight is important as there are a lot of sun loving crops. There are also crops that require less amount of sunlight. So you have to adjust according to the situation," elucidated Jayathilake
So this is how we create our home garden. You only grow the amount needed by your household. Ideally you can grow a lot of varieties in small amounts. "You can get a good harvest by using organic manure. Also the plant material must be of good quality. The seeds must be of good quality. The soil also must be fertile. We can also take up Bee-Keeping and get some honey. This can support pollination in the home garden," pointed out Jayathilake
Post- Harvest Technology and Value Addition mainly involves plucking the ripened harvest in the correct time and in a careful manner. Pruning is also important here. The final methodology is Landscaping and Housekeeping.
"To increase the beauty of the Home Garden, one can even grow attractive flowers. Growing vegetables, fruits and flowers makes the home garden look beautiful," summed up Jayathilake
COMBATTING PESTS
It is vital that we do not use chemicals in our home garden to combat pests. There are methods that we can use.
* We can cover the fruit or vegetable hanging on the branch with a polythene bag. This can be used for Snake Gourd, Bitter Gourd and Luffa. Both ends of the polythene bag are opened -the end covering the fruit (which is tied up) and the opposite end. So insects cannot access or harm the fruit.
* Another way, is to invite birds into the garden by laying food (rice or fruits) for them. They then get used to catching pests and eating them.
* There is another way where you hang greasy polythene parts in the garden. Small pests get stuck to it.
* Then you can make use of Marigolds, a flower. We can grow them in many places in the garden. Because of its strong scent it repels pests.
* Neem extract also acts as a repellant against pests. The extract needs to be carefully prepared by those who have an in-depth knowledge of agriculture. It is sprayed every two weeks.
* Another extract sprayed is the garlic extract.

COPE probe on hedging deals
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has decided to launch a full scale investigation into the oil price hedging deals of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in 2007 which resulted in heavy losses to the state.
COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told the Daily News yesterday, that a similar investigation as the Central Bank Treasury Bond transaction would be commenced on the much talked-about hedging deals.
He said the estimated loss incurred from oil hedging deals is Rs. 14 billion as of now. The COPE asked the Petroleum Industries Ministry Secretary to submit a report to the Auditor General (AG) on the status of all investigations hitherto conducted into the hedging deals.
These include ministry level probes as well as CID and the Bribery Commission. The AG was asked to furnish an audit report to Parliament within a month after studying all these reports, he said.
Handunnetti said the AGs report in this regard is expected towards the end of this month. Through the COPE investigation we will reveal the loss incurred from this controversial agreement and will recommend taking legal action against those responsible, he said.
Handunnetti said former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and former Finance Ministry Secretary P.B. Jayasundara would be summoned before the COPE if they were identified as parties responsible for the controversial hedging deals as the investigation proceeds.
The CPC entered into oil price hedging deals with Standard Chartered Bank, Citi Bank, Deutsche Bank, Peoples Bank and Commercial Bank in early 2007, and these later resulted in negative payoff for CPC when the oil market crashed.

Country caught in debt trap by previous regime: Amaraweera
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the country was caught in a debt trap by the previous regime and he was also a minister of the government that rules the country now.
We cannot abstain from settling these loans as a responsible government," he said.
He was addressing the gathering at the 69th independence day celebrations in Hambantota opposite the Hambantota International Convention Center. The State Fisheries Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi also participated.
The minister said Rs. 9,90,000 billions has to be repaid as a result of constructing the sea port and other mega projects in Hambantota and that every child born in future and is living now is indebted to Rs. four lakhs each.
The minister said a country like Sri Lanka cannot march forward under such circumstances and added that mighty plans had been drawn under the intiative of the President and the Prime Minister to launch programmes to strengthen the economy. Investors around the globe were invited to set up industrial and service projects in Hambantota and provide jobless youth with jobs.
Amaraweera said false rumours spread like wildfire that 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota would be given to Chinese investors and that ten lakhs of Chinese people would arrive at Hambantota and that Chinese colonies would be set up.
"Those who spread such rumours are dead against the youth in the area," he said. The minister said another rumour was that traditional dwellers in Hambantota would be evacuated and that the temples would be dismantled.
A regime dedicated to safeguard Buddhism will ever do it he queried. Hambantota District Secretary W.H.K Arunarana, Additional District Secretary Suneth Lochana, heads of Tri-forces and state departments participated.

Crescent Global to support  insurance awards
When the crme de la crme of the local insurance industry come together to meet students who have won awards and obtained exam certificates from the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, it creates a day to remember.
This signature event was held at the Bishops College auditorium earlier this month, and was exclusively sponsored by Crescent Global South Asia, part of Crescent Global Group, a Lloyds accredited insurance broker.
Understanding the need for more qualified and recognized personnel in the insurance industry, the Crescent Global Director, Indrajith Fernando said, his organization takes a personal interest in the graduates of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute.
It is the only institution that produces the quality of individuals that the insurance industry in Sri Lanka so desperately needs, he says.
Dr. Jagath Alwis, Chief Guest said that this approach requires a particular precision training, and Insurance industry captains have come to respect the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, as it produces candidates who have the right attitudes, and of course the right level of industry based knowledge to drive the industry. We are committed to developing the Insurance Institute and to support in any way to further this cause.
Crescent Global South Asia operates in many countries across the region and understands the issues of both the local and global Insurance industry like no other. At this moment where the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute, the industry educational body is awarding their successful students, Cresent Global is delighted to partner the worthy cause said director Fernando
The Insurance business is expanding to such an extent that Fernando sees that there should be a new approach to training new recruits for the insurance business.
He hopes that Crescent Global South Asias alliance with the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute will help the industry evolve and provide the highly skilled and knowledgeable individuals that the industry needs. We are discussing and hoping to advance education further with Crescent by using the Web-educate portal, which is owned by the Crescent
He believes that the Institute works with the signal desire to produce the future leaders of the insurance industry. The Institute also facilitates the special kind of learning that peers appreciate and the Insurance industry elites desire, which is why when a cohort of Insurance industry practitioners graduate from the institute, the mentors of the industry have great expectations for their future and as such they feel it is so important for them to be present at this event, for which Crescent Global is the sole principal sponsor. This is a prestigious unique event of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute (SLII), and we wish to thank Crescent Global South Asia for their commitment to support.
SLII is the pioneer educational body in Insurance education and we look forward to the support of all stakeholders to enhance the necessary talent for the industry, Thusitha Nandasiri President SLII said.

Deposit Protection Society of  Standard Credit Finance Co wants redress
The Committee of Management of the Deposit Protection Society of the Standard Credit Finance Co in response to a call by about 60 members of the Society met as pre-arranged at a conference hall in Bambalapitiya recently to discuss and find a way forward of recovering their long lost monies which they had been denied access to, for the past 8 years.
Lakshman Croos-Moraes a member from the Deposit Protection Society of the Standard Credit Finance Co told Daily News Business that some depositors have committed suicide due to dejection and some have have become bed ridden since they did not have money to obtain medicine.
They also expressed their regrets that although the current Chairman and Board of Directors of The Standard Credit Finance Co:, had been appointed by the Central Bank with the purpose of finding ways and means of repaying the depositors as it was a Central Bank registered company, they had done nothing tangible in this respect except to hold monthly Board Meetings, for which they were remunerated. Moreover they had allowed a number of employees including the Acting CEO who had been brought into the company, Deposit Protection...by the previous Board of Entrust Ltd, to remain within the ailing company drawing emoluments totaling over Rs 600,000 monthly occupying non-existent posts, while the depositors financial base of Rs 1.9 billion in shares and Rs 825 million in deposits remained within the company and was dwindling on a daily basis.
They were all of the view that these redundant employees must be replaced.They also expressed their displeasure at the remote control mode of management practiced by the current Chairman and Board of Directors, who could not be easily contacted by the depositors at the Head Office.
We now only have faith in the President, Prime Minister and the Central Bank Governor and hope they would intervene in this matter.They also cautioned, Or else we too would have to take to the streets. (SS)
