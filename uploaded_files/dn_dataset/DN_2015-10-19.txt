Children should have a positive mindset - Grero
We should not be concentrating on changing governments, but, instead to change the mindset of our children, since they are the future of our nation, said University Education and Highways State Minister Mohan Lal Grero.
He was delivering a lecture at Waga Vanarathana Maha Vidyalaya.
He further said the education system of our country specially laid emphasis on a competitive examination system which focuses on mathematical intelligence, language intelligence and rhythmic-intelligence. For instance, the Grade 5 scholarship exam, G.C.E O/Ls & A/Ls cannot measure the inter-personal intelligence, Emotional intelligence etc.
We must identify our child and his talents which are given them by birth. We cant expect wormwood tree from a banyan plant. Even you cant expect a sandalwood tree from a banyan plant, State Minister Grero said.
There are some children who have the inter-personal intelligence where they can gather information within a few seconds. Their communication skills, inter-personal skills are unbelievable. They are the people who leads to countries. Therefore, we must identify their skills at the very first period and help them to improve themselves, because we need to make educated leaders. As parents and teachers, we have the responsibility to infuse confidence in our students,he said.
We require people with special skills in many areas to compete with the ever changing world. If you can identify the capacities and capabilities of your children at the inception, then you can direct them to the right path. The foremost duty and responsibility of the older generation is to guide youngsters to identify their inborn talents, he said.

CID probe points to Ekneligoda being killed
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers conducting investigations into the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda have unearthed evidence to suggest that he may have been killed and dumped in the seas off Trincomalee. Police said Ekneligoda may have been taken to a camp in Soriwila in the Manampitiya area before being murdered and dumped in the sea off Trincomalee. According to sources, one of the suspects under arrest in connection with the case has said that Ekneligodas body was first buried in Soriwila.
The CID teams handling investigations found information to suggest that Eknaligodas body had later surfaced due to the flooding of the pit and following this, the body had been removed from the site and had been dumped into the sea, a highly placed Police source told the Daily News.
Investigations revealed that Ekneligoda was abducted in 2010 by two Army Intelligence Division Officers, who are already in CID custody.
Sources revealed that the two Intelligence Officers were former LTTE members belonging to the Karuna faction.
It is believed that Ekneligoda may have been killed in a transit camp at Mannampitiya which was under control of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman and Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan.
At that time Pilleyan had acted as the officer in charge of the camp.
Meanwhile, information has surfaced that Ekneligodas disappearance was due to direct orders by a high ranking individual in the defence establishment during the time of the previous regime. Eknaligoda was abducted two days before the Presidential election in 2010.
At present, 11 suspects including several Army Officers are still in CID custody and investigations are ongoing.
The CID teams took the suspects to the Girithale Army camp last week, under the protection of the Military Police, to identify places where the abducted journalist was allegedly kept.

'GSP plus coming'
Trade concessions under the Generalised System of Preference Plus for Sri Lanka, which were revoked by the European Union (EU) in 2010, will likely be reinstated next year, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
"By the end of December 2015, we will be formally reapplying for the GSP Plus. It is extremely critical that it be reinstated," he said.
The EU is the largest export market and the second largest import source for Sri Lanka, and in 2008, textiles and garments accounted for the bulk of exports from Sri Lanka - 37.4 percent of exports from Sri Lanka went to the EU, while 22.4 percent went to the United States. The GSP Plus ensured duty-free entry into EU countries, facilitating a boom in the textile trade and employment in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka gained about US$ 150 million annually due to preferential tariffs. In 2010 however, the textile trade suffered a blow when the GSP Plus was suspended due to the Sri Lankan government's violation of human-rights agreements.
The government refused to allow the EU to probe into its rights records, claiming it was a violation of the country's sovereignty.
The GSP Plus withdrawal meant that Sri Lankan shipment to the EU would bear an import-duty of almost 10 percent and that factory workers were fearing losing their jobs. Dr. de Silva explained that the country "has not been able to leverage the GSP Plus for the past five years, and if we were able to do that, we would have seen more jobs created, increase in growth and poverty alleviation."
Clothing exporter and Joint Apparel Association Forum chairman A. Sakumaran also concurred that there is an obvious correlation between GSP Plus concessions and economic growth via Sri Lanka's apparel industry. The new government today means a new relationship between Sri Lanka and the European Union. "We now meet all the criteria required by the EU for the GSP Plus," Dr. de Silva said.
"Good governance, democracy, respect for human rights - these are things we are supposed to do. And by doing so, we can utilise it to our benefit. The previous government completely ignored the need for GSP Plus, but the fact is that the loss of GSP Plus has had serious negative implications on the economy. Foreign policy and economic policy need to be in synch with each other - we can't have them at cross-purposes like it has been in the past," he explained.

ISIS is 'crowdsourcing terrorism' - US Justice Dept.
US: Ardit Ferizi, a well-known hacker, who sympathizes with Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), and his Kosova Hackers Security (KHS) group, are suspected by the US Justice Department of illegally obtaining personal information, including home addresses and social security numbers of some 100,000 individuals by hacking into a US computer network belonging to an unidentified retailer in Phoenix, Arizona.
Among the data was information about 1,351 US military personnel and federal governments, which Ferizi apparently datamined and shared with IS. The list was distributed in August through jihadist social networks and was intended as a 'kill list' for IS sympathizers in America. Many of the phones and emails on the records turned out to be out of service, but some were still in use.
Although people from US-allied countries, such as the UK and Australia were included amongst the data, the majority of names belonged to Americans - everyone from lowly bureaucrats to those at the top of the chain. One person who's personal information was breached, a social-services provider, told NBC he was surprised to have been contacted by the FBI a month ago, but did not think much of it at the time.
"They said they didn't think it was a high-level risk. I was a little more vigilant at first. But then I kind of forgot about it."
A counterterrorism analyst with NBC, Evan Kohlman, believes Ferizi achieved his task by homing in on emails that ended with .gov and .mil (for military), and that his choice of people to condemn to death was not a specific. Kohlman called the idea "crude but effective."
The authorities say Ferizi had been in contact with Junaid Hussain, who also calls himself Hussain Al-Brittani.
He is a British-born hacker and a social media expert with the IS, according to the Justice Department. He is said to have been the inspiration for a number of lone-wolf attacks in the US, including at a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Texas.
Ferizi reportedly supplied the hit list to Hussain in July. The names were circulated to the terrorists a month later. There was a message attached for the US authorities, claiming jihadists are "in your emails and social media accounts" and would use the confidential data they extract to strike at Americans on their home soil.
Hussain was assassinated in a drone strike two weeks later in Raqqa, Syria - the city, which IS, calls its capital.
Apparently, Ferizi was also in contact with an Arizona-based hosting service, from where he sourced the names.
He threatened the body, saying "bad things will happen to you," if they were to attempt to remove his malware from their systems.
He also threatened to publish the entire list of 100,000 names with attached personal data.
He had allegedly tried to blackmail the company for two bitcoins ($500, approximately) in return for stopping the attacks and revealing how he had carried them out, according to court papers.
Ferizi was arrested in Malaysia.
He had moved to Kuala Lumpur in August 2014 to study computer science and forensics. He is expected to be extradited to the US to stand trial, Malaysian police reported.
The hacker group KHS claimed to have hacked more than 20,000 websites, including Serbian government sites, Interpol's website in 2012, and an IBM research domain in the same year, according to the criminal complaint.

Practising yoga may cut health care costs
US:Practising relaxation-response techniques, such as meditation, yoga and prayer, could reduce the need for health care services by 43 per cent, according to a new study.
Previous studies have shown that eliciting the relaxation response - a physiologic state of deep rest - relieves stress and anxiety, and also affects physiologic factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen consumption.
The study, based at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)'s Institute for Technology Assessment and the Benson-Henry Institute (BHI), found that individuals in the relaxation-response programme used fewer health care services in the year after their participation than in the preceding year.
"Our study's primary finding is that programmes that train patients to elicit the relaxation response - specifically those taught at the BHI - can also dramatically reduce health care utilisation," said James E Stahl of the MGH Institute for Technology Assessment, who led the study. -DECCAN HERALD

The Japanese Wife
Rare, artistic standpoint
Delving deep into her native roots of Bengal, Aparna Sens The Japanese Wife portrays a charming love story which reaches across borders. An adaptation of one of Kunal Basus well loved short stories, the movie touches your heart because of its flesh-and-blood characters embodying emotions which you can relate to.
Rahul Bose plays Snehamoy, a young school teacher who makes contact with Miyage, a Japanese girl, as a pen friend in Yokohama. Both are able to write English though they cannot speak the language fluently. Over the years they write to each other regularly. Since both are shy people they reveal their inner feelings only to each other. They bond big time and their casual exchange goes as far as to make them agree to become man and wife.
Their only token of marriage is a ring which she sends him while he sends her some conch shell bangles and vermilion to apply at the parting of her hair. Despite the fact that both will not be able to visit each other due to lack of funds and household responsibilities, they carry on with their relationship through snail mail and occasional phone calls.
Unexpected houseguest
Years roll on and the aging Snehamoys life takes a complicated turn with the arrival of an unexpected houseguest, the pretty widow named Sandhya. Though certain incidents happen to throw Sandhya and Snehamoy together, the latter keeps his distance. Meanwhile Miyage begins to suffer from a terminal disease. Snehamoy undertakes the task of trying to save her life by sending medication after describing her symptoms to Indian doctors. This brings a smile to the audience but it also touches their heart. It is a bittersweet emotion. What is truly touching about the story is that Snehamoy keeps his vows until old age event though he had not seen his wife for 15 years. Despite forming a domestic bond with Sandhya, Snehamoy remains Miyages devoted husband at heart. When each of them fall sick the other is frantic with worry and prays for their partners recovery.
The only drawback of the film is that the scenes drag on. Some episodes such as those in the kite flying competition could have been omitted. Some incidents roll by unhurried. The kite flying sequences remind us of Khaled Hosseinis novel The Kite Runner, which had also been made into a film by Marc Forster.
Kite flying
The kite flying competition which Hassan and Aamir engage in Afghan landscape seems to be imported to India. However unlike in The Kite Runner where the protagonist emerges winner of the kite competition, Snehamoy was unable to save his Japanese kite. Interestingly the kite also has an emblem of a Japanese woman and the Indians cry out that the picture is of Snehamoys Japanese wife. Bose carries on his character with skill. Chigasu Takaku too delivers a good performance as Miyage though she is rarely seen on screen because much of the tale is told in Snehamoys point of view.
Raima Sen is decent in the robes of a suffering widow who pines for Snehamoys affection but the eye catching performance comes from Moushmi Chatterjee who is Snehamoys feisty aunt. She is not the typical stereotypical village woman but thinks ahead and encourages child education, long distance marital relations and widow remarriage. Each time she makes a presence she adds colour to the haunting atmosphere of the movie.
The Bengal mood is beautifully captured on lens in its rustic landscapes.
Typical glamour
Some Japanese tunes played in the background set the tone of the story which is mostly based on Indian soil. This element reminds us that this is a story which had emerged due to the alliance between Japan and India. The theme does not provide much entertainment because it is not your typical glamour and romance filled love story.
However the undercurrent message encompasses an emotional theme which brings the audience closer to the lead pair.
Wonderfully shot and skillfully acted the movie needs to be viewed from an artistic standpoint.
It is one of those rare films which stay with you after curtain call.

Sex workers call for protection of rights
Prostitution should be legalized, said National Organizer, Centre for Sex Workers' Rights, Attorney at Law Senaka Perera.
He said there is no one to speak on behalf of sex workers.
"Their rights should be protected," Perera said.
He was speaking at a press conference held at Colombo yesterday.
"Legislation should be introduced for the protection of sex workers. They do not choose to become sex workers. It is the situation that compels them to take to this profession," he said.
"We do not promote prostitution, but, we support the rights of sex workers. Police should behave in a more responsible manner when handling cases with regard to sex workers," Perera said.
"Sex workers are arrested under the Vagrant's Ordinance of 1841 and Brothels Ordinance of 1889.
These laws should be abolished and new laws introduced to safeguard their rights.
The Vagrant's Ordinance was introduced to control the Indian labourers and alleged that the Police treat sex workers in a rude manner under that Ordinance," he added.
He further said that the perception of society towards sex workers has to be changed. If this situation continues, even their children will not have a secure future.
"There are around 600 members in our centre. It is for the first time in Sri Lanka that a centre has been formed for the betterment of sex workers," Attorney at Law Perera added.
"The Police, people and society look down upon them as they do not have any provisions in law to safeguard them, said Attorney at Law Thushara Daskon.
Chairman of the Centre for Sex Workers Rights B. Maheshwari said the male population and society in general are the prime reasons for women to become sex workers.
She said that women choose this as profession as they do not have any alternative solution and only when women are trapped financially in the hands of men.
"The government needs to look into the problems faced by the sex workers. The media and the police reveal the identity of the women who are alleged to be involved in prostitution unaware of the consequences on the women and their children.
She also quoted the Police Media Spokesman as having said that there are over 6,000 people involved in prostitution.
Sakuni, a transgender said the government should make arrangements to provide identity cards for transgenders. "I have faced several issues as I do not have a proper Identity Card. Not only me, there are several people who fear to reveal their names," said Sakuni.
"The government has granted us voting rights, but, they do not take any measures to provide identity cards," said Sakuni. It was also claimed that provisions should be made insisting that Women Police Constables be present when women involved in prostitution are arrested. Nava Lanka Samasamaja Party General Secretary Dr. Vickramabahu Karunaratne said the sufferings of sex workers should be redressed through law.
"The people who are against this process are the ones who promote this trade illegally. They lack virtue,"he said. Vickramabahu further said that young girls and women are raped and murdered today as sex workers are not legally accepted in society.
Attorney at Law Lakshan Dias and several other members attached to the centre were also present.

Thrill-seeker balances over pool of hungry alligators
US: Professional slackliner Josh Beaudoin walked over a Colorado pond full of hungry alligators just itching for him to lose his balance.
The 33-year-old Alaskan started off carefully measuring his steps while a bunch of interested gators followed him closely just waiting for him to make an error. Early into the stunt however Beaudoin recovered his confidence and went on to show off his skills.
At some point he can be seen balancing on one leg above an audience with one thing on their mind: hes dinner.
To the dismay of the alligators, Beaudoin safely made it to land. The predators had to suffice with slabs of meat thrown at them by Joshs partner in crime.
He later took to the internet to describe what he felt at the time and also warn others from following in his steps.
Wow, all I can say is I made it out alive! Walking over these alligators have been a challenge that I wanted to do for a while, but please do not try this stunt!!! I have had thousands of hours on the slackline and hundreds more in performances. This is strictly for your entertainment. Beaudoin wrote on his Facebook page.
Although he admitted he probably wouldnt do it again, he called the experience unique.

US: A grainy black-and-white photograph showing an iceberg in the middle of a calm sea that caused the RMS Titanic to sink in 1912, is up for auction, the media reported on Sunday.
It was taken by the chief steward of the ocean liner Prinz Adalbert on the morning of April 15, 1912, hours after the RMS Titanic sank following its collision with an iceberg the previous evening.
The Titanic had sunk by the time the Prinz Adalbert came along, and the chief steward was unaware of what had happened, CNN reported.
What sets this photograph apart from others that purported to show the famous berg is a note the chief steward wrote to accompany the picture.
In it, the steward said he saw red paint "plainly visible" on the iceberg that appeared to have been left by the scraping of a vessel. The photograph hung for decades on the walls of the law firm representing the Titanic's owners, White Star Line. The firm closed in 2002, and the four partners of the firm have now put it up for auction, along with the note.
Both are being offered by Henry Aldridge and Son auctioneers Britain, with a presale estimate of 10-15,000 pounds ($15,400-$23,200). The auction is scheduled for October 24. - AFP

Tom Hiddleston sings as Hank Williams in Nashville
British actor Tom Hiddleston gave a once-in-a-lifetime performance when he hopped on stage in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday to sing after a premiere of the Hank Williams biopic, I Saw the Light.
Hiddleston spent months learning how to talk and sing like the iconic country singer for the role in the Sony Pictures Classics film, set for release in March 2016.
He surprised guests at an after-party following the premiere with a short set of Williams classics including, Hey Good Lookin,' Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To Do, and Move It On Over.
The crowd, which included his co-stars and musicians, clapped and danced along to Hiddleston's performance at a bar in downtown Nashville, just blocks from the famous Ryman Auditorium. While on stage, Hiddleston cracked jokes in a mix of British and Southern accents and even gave a quick encore.
Actor Bradley Whitford, who plays renowned songwriter and music executive Fred Rose in the film, joked that a Nashville audience might be a tough crowd to please.
In front of dark, cynical, inside musicians, will be quick to jump to judgment No tension. No anxiety, Whitford said.
Writer/director/producer Marc Abraham said he was nervous about the premiere because of the city's musical history.
Without Nashville, there is no story, Abraham said. And without the people in Nashville that helped me, there is no story. So big deal for me to come down here and present the film to people who know a lot about this subject.
The movie focuses on Williams meteoric rise and fall in the 1940s and 50s through the stories of his personal relationships with women, including his mother, his wife Audrey Williams and his second marriage to Billie Jean. He died at the age of 29 in 1953. At the time of his death, his body was wracked by alcohol and drug abuse.
Hank Williams is someone I think who loved women, but he was also unintentionally cruel to them, Hiddleston said. He was a hard man to live with and he was afflicted by so many addictions, so many demons.
Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Audrey Williams, said the film portrays so many strong women who had a lasting impact on Williams songwriting.

Will Barack Obamas foreign policy impact on Joe Biden
US:When President Barack Obama announced this week that the United States would leave more troops than planned in Afghanistan, his Vice President, Joe Biden, stood right at his side.
And for Biden, still mulling a presidential bid, that could pose a problem.
As he calculates all the angles that would influence his candidacy a decision is reportedly coming within days Biden has more than the looming obstacle of front-runner Hillary Clinton to consider. As a candidate, he would become the chief defender of a foreign policy that critics say has been incoherent and that gets increasingly low marks in public opinion polls.
Beyond Afghanistan, the White House is under fire for its response to Russian action in Syria, where Vladimir Putin has assumed the superpower role there that the United States has declined to take, for the enduring threat posed by Islamic State, and for the Iran nuclear deal that has spiked tensions with ally Israel.
Biden, who prides himself on being a full partner on Obamas national security team, would own all of it. Foreign policy is a liability for Biden, Democratic strategist Douglas Schoen said.
The Afghanistan shift was a personal setback for Biden, the most influential voice in the administration pushing for hard timelines for the removal of US troops from the country. Clinton, by contrast, favoured a more robust military presence there during her tenure as Secretary of State during Obamas first term.
Clinton, whose status as the prohibitive front-runner wouldnt change even if Biden jumps in, has distanced herself from Obama by calling for more aggressive action in Syria and opposing the Pacific Rim trade deal. As a sitting vice president, Biden wouldnt have the luxury of distancing himself from Obamas policies, even if he were so inclined.
How does a presidential aspirant like Joe Biden reach for a bold American foreign policy without fundamentally distancing himself from his boss Its tough, said Aaron David Miller, a former official in the Clinton and Bush administrations who is now with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Obamas approval ratings with the US public on foreign policy have tumbled since Biden stood at the Democratic National Convention three years ago and pronounced, Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.
According to Gallup, Obama enjoyed about a 50 percent approval rating on foreign affairs during his first term. That number fell to 36 percent this summer.
National security is often overshadowed in US presidential races by domestic issues, most notably jobs and economic growth.
