AI companies spot a business opportunity in space
Innovation, massive investment and lower costs are fueling a new commercial space race.
One area thats booming Geospatial analytics, an industry where satellites are used to track everything from retail footfall to food production.
Companies working on the technology have attracted big money. Orbital Insight raised $50 million in funding last year, while Descartes Labs attracted $30 million and SpaceKnow raised $4 million. One of the industrys pioneers is James Crawford, who worked for NASA and Google before founding Orbital Insight in 2013.
We were seeing an explosion in commercial satellites, said Crawford. And I thought, Once all that data comes back to earth, we have to do something with it. 
Orbital Insight can provide data on how much oil is being held in large land storage containers, or how many cars are in a Walmart parking lot, Crawford explained.
This data has real economic value.
Supermarket car counts, for example, are a predictor of sales, Crawford said.
Were sifting images of the whole world every day, and artificial intelligence allows us to process that. Were in the middle of two major revolutions: AI and commercial space, he added.
Descartes Labs got started in 2014, with its sights set on using AI to processvast amounts of satellite data. The first application of its technology was building a model for US corn production.
Cornfields are great for satellites in terms of image resolution. Cornfields are big, corn grows slowly and it doesnt wander, said Mark Johnson, co-founder and chief executive of Descartes Labs. Satellite imagery was used to locate fields, figure out what crops were growing in them, assess how healthy the crops were and then calculate likely production levels.
Satellites are taking pictures of the whole world. Thats a global dataset, he said. We are applying modern machine-learning techniques to that data, and using it to better understand our planet, he said.
SpaceKnow builds economic indexes using earth observation imagery blended with other data. For example, it tracks 6,000 industrial facilities across China to generate an index of manufacturing activity. Hugh Norton-Smith, vice president at SpaceKnow, said the company aims to take the messy, unstructured physical world and index it on a digital platform in near real-time.
SpaceKnows clients include defense agencies, commodity traders, hedge funds and other investors. Crawford, from Orbital Insight, believes the resolution of satellite imagery will improve and become cheaper, meaning quicker, more accurate insights.
Well be able to tell, mid-way through Black Friday, how sales are going by counting cars in mall carparks. Were three to five years away from intraday data insights from satellite data. It will grow from there in terms of its ability to help us really understand whats going on in our economy. CNN News

Australia assists SLs disaster preparedness effort
Ninety-six percent of disasters in Sri Lanka are caused by climate, such as flooding, landslides, extreme winds and drought. Sri Lanka was ranked the fourth most climate changeaffected country in 2016 according to the Global Climate Risk Index, 2018.
The annual cycle of floods and drought is causing severe household economic and social stress in Sri Lanka. This cyclical pattern gradually decreases the coping strategies of families and the possibility to return to normalcy in the long run.
Simultaneously, heavy rainfall during the southwest monsoon period in 2016 and 2017 caused widespread floods and landslides in the southern and western regions. Over 500 people were killed (including 191 people still reported as missing in official documents) and over 1.3 million people were affected during the two years. The high number of deaths is being attributed to inadequate emergency preparedness measures.
In response, the Australian Government, WFP and UNICEF have signed a three-year partnership (2018-2020) with a funding of AU$ 750,000 (around Rs. 89 million), to ensure stronger preparedness and faster, more integrated responses to natural disaster emergencies in the country.
The Australian Government has supported Sri Lanka in disaster management and emergency response since the 2004 tsunami. We are pleased to now join forces with two of the leading UN humanitarian partners in Sri Lanka to deliver a programme with the dual focus of helping Sri Lanka be better prepared to handle natural disasters and respond to emergencies, remarked, Australian High Commissions Head of Development Cooperation, Victoria Coakley.
The project targets the most vulnerable districts which are adversely affected by recurrent disasters, particularly the annual monsoons, including Ratnapura, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa. Investments to enhance emergency preparedness and response capacities are critical to mitigate the impact of shocks. In periods when emergency response is required, 25,000 severely affected people will receive assistance through UNICEF and WFP, with a main focus on children, adolescents and pregnant and lactating mothers.
The assistance will include food security and nutrition, and child protection, said WFP Deputy Country Director Nguyen Duc Hoang.
Children, particularly the most vulnerable children, are at the heart of UNICEFs work in Sri Lanka. Initiatives such as this are vital to help build resilience and reduce the impact of disasters on the lives of the most vulnerable children and their families, said UNICEF Representative Tim Sutton.

Backbenchers call for  systematic change - Mayantha
Changing the structure of the party was no easy task but the backbenchers were not yet ready to give up the push for it, said UNP backbencher Mayantha Dissanayake.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, the MP was answering questions posed by journalists on the recent UNP party reforms.
It is true that many of our supporters on the ground are not happy with how things have played out but we need to introduce change in a systematic manner, he further said.
UNP backbenchers especially have been leading the call for reforms within the party and this was further intensified after the losses faced by the UNP at the last Local Government elections.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who promised changes, took steps to introduce a new body called the politburo, consisting of younger ministers and made changes to several party leadership positions.
Meanwhile, Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando at an event held at his Ministry yesterday said that the party has to show its supporters of what it is capable of and earn their confidence.
The UNP has to show a big difference to the public within 3 or 4 months. We already had discussions for a comprehensive three year plan with the Prime Minister. We have to show our supporters of what we are capable of and earn our trust back, Minister Fernando said.
The Unity Government consisted of ministers whom we liked and did not like and they all came and went. We did not have any issue with it. However, it is evident now that the journey our government embarked was delayed and disrupted by the ministers who quit the Unity Government. The people also lost their trust in the government cause of their actions.
However, there is an emerging leadership in the government and the top level leadership understands this which is a good sign.

CIC to grow hybrid agriculture seeds  for export, local market
CIC Holdings PLC will be tying up with a South American company to grow hybrid agriculture seeds for exports and local use. 
Managing Director, Chief Executive Officer of CIC Holdings PLC, Samantha Ranatunga said that a team from the South American Company visited them last week and also visited some of the CIC sites.
He said that they were also looking at growing sweet corn for which there is an increase in demand. 
Ranatunga said that in addition CIC was involved in growing high value vegetables in protected environments for export. For this they also launched Cropwiz (Private) Limited, and the companys greenhouse complex of 7 hectares is located in Walpita, Divulapitiya. 
We have invested over Rs. 1.4 billion for both these projects and it will support increasing national exports, provide around 80 new employment opportunities, and bring new technologies to expand frontiers of high tech agriculture systems in the country. 
This facility in Divulapitiya is equipped with state-of-the-art high tech production facilities including automated climate control facility, computerized irrigation & fertigation system, physical and bio-security measures to minimize pest and disease occurrences and rainwater harvesting and irrigation water recycling system to ensure sustainability. 
The facility has been designed and constructed by Israeli experts to be in par with highest standards in modern greenhouse production systems in warm climates. The project constriction and commissioning is nearly completed now and once fully operational will be managed with growing and processing protocols in line with Global GAP (Good Agriculture Practices) standards to ensure product quality, safety, and traceability from seed-to-shelf. Automated sorting, grading and packaging facility and cold rooms are parts of the on-site integrated Greenhouse system to ensure freshness of the produce. 
The main products include, Bell Peppers Hydroponic Lettuce and herbs. The products will mainly be exported to Gulf countries and Singapore as customized packaging. 
He said that they have been investing heavily in the agriculture sector including paddy, dairy, plantains, agri seeds and also on research and development. Though agriculture in not a high profit yielding business for our bottom line we keep moving in this direction to help the rural economy. 
Ranatunga who is also the former Chairman of Chamber of Commerce said that it was sad to note that though 30% of employment is generated from the agri sector it contributes only less than 15% to national GDP. CIC Agri Businesses (Private) Limited also celebrated 25 years in the agri business recently.
He also said that they have a huge farmer outgrow community over 40, 000 whom they support with a buyback program, technology, high yielding seeds and also bank loans. We cannot turn our backs on them now. He also said that they grow over 25 traditional Sri Lankan healthy rice varieties and these are even exported to many countries including USA. We are also proud of the fact that CIC produce over 30% of local seed paddy and is the biggest exporter of bananas.

CLEARING THE MIRISSA BEACHFRONT
Please help those who lost their livelihood after the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management demolished unauthorised structures on Mirissa beach start afresh, appealed Edwin Silva, the Patron of the Mirissa Tourist Business Operators Association (MTBOA) at a press conference held at the Sunset Beach hotel in Mirissa last Thursday (17).
The beachfronts of some hotels on the picturesque Mirissa beach looked like battle fields, a week after officials of the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management together with the SriLanka Police tore down the unauthorized structures on May 11, 2018. The owners and staff of 23 hotels and restaurants on the Mirissa beach that had gradually expanded their establishments without obtaining prior permission, neither complied with the demolition notices served on them on more than one occasion, watched helplessly as the authorities brought down the unauthorized structures that day.
Even though it was after a Presidential directive, the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management should be commended for finally expediting the law. The Mirissa beach will be more attractive and more picturesque once the rubble and debris is cleared, opening up access as well as a larger extent of white sand to the tourists and public.
Enforcing the law
Under the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Act No 57 of 1981 amended by Act no 64 of 1988 and Act No 49 of 2011, the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management has the power to remove all unauthorized temporary or permanent structures within the coastal zone of Sri Lanka. It is imperative that a permit is obtained from the Department prior to commencement of any development activity including constructions for tourism, houses, other constructions and fillings within the coastal zone. The coastal zone is defined as 300 meters inward from the main high waterline, 2km seaward of the main low waterline, 2km measured on a perpendicular straight base line towards the land from the entrance points of any water body, thus connected to the sea and 100 meters inland from the periphery of that water body.
Although for some years the Coast Conservation Department has been threatening to expedite their order to demolish unauthorized structures on the Mirissa beach, the MTBOA was able to appeal to the relevant Ministers to intervene and gain time hoping that the authorities would review the situation and be more lenient, Silva admitted.
But unfortunately, it was during this time that some local youth assaulted and sexually molested a group of Dutch tourists. It is the media that repeatedly highlighted the unfortunate incident so much that the President was compelled to take action, he alleged.
A few days before the demolition took place, we were able to discuss the issue with the private secretary to the President. He was very attentive and we were aware that he was consulting the Director General of the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management as well as keeping the President informed of the progress, the MTBOA Patron said. We repeatedly requested that the CCD mark out what structures needed to be removed and give the owners a day or two to remove them. This official even secured an appointment for us with the Director General of the CCD for the same evening but the DG avoided meeting us when we went to his office, Silva added.
Losing livelihoods
Donald Weerasekera, President of the MTBOA said that Minister Faiszer Musthapha was of the opinion that if these so called unauthorized structures are demolished, many people would lose their livelihood. Minister Mustapha even walked the length of the Mirissa Beach one evening to see for himself, he added.
If a youngster builds three attached toilets to the three room beachfront ancestral house he inherited from his grandparents, does it become an unauthorized structure Weerasekera questioned.
Damith Sisira, owner of the Sunset hotel in Mirissa said that the Department had given him notice in 2012 to remove unauthorized structures on his premises. They hadnt specified what buildings were considered unauthorized and we were under the impression that it was structures that were within 5 meters inwards from the high water line but they went much more than that.
On May 11, the authorities had demolished the seaward wall of the hotels swimming pool and the kitchen with all its stainless steel equipment. They didnt give any opportunity to remove my belongings and I was helpless as they destroyed stainless steel kitchen equipment worth over four million rupees, he lamented. The sea side wall of the swimming pool was on the boundary of the 5 meter line and they had the right to demolish it, he said with a sigh.
Even with the adverse publicity it has received off and on, Mirissa attracts those who love the sea, the sand and the sun. There are many tourists who visit the resort regularly. Sandra Steinlechner, an Austrian tourist is one of them who has fallen in love with the Mirissa beach,
I love the sea and the beach and have been visiting Mirissa each year since 2003.
I even held my wedding ceremony on the Mirissa beach! she said. I always stay at the Summer Breeze Hotel and was heartbroken when the authorities uprooted some palm trees I had planted on one of my visits she lamented.
Although the hoteliers claim that they lost equipment and structures valued at millions of rupees and evident from what lay on the beach, business is bound to flourish again at all but one of the 23 establishments once the tourist season in Mirissa resumes next November. But sadly, Nissan Hotel and Restaurant will not be able to resume operations again as the establishment was totally demolished.
If the President considers our appeal for help favourably, Nissan Hotel should top the list reaffirmed MTBOA s President. The hotel was our sole livelihood and we invested all we had in it sobbed 49 year old Helma, wife of proprietor P. H. Gunasiri. My husband invested most of what he saved by working as a welder in Japan to commence the hotel and restaurant in 2001. It was a three room hotel situated on 12 perches of beachfront land and better known as a restaurant, she said.
The Nissan Hotel survived the 2004 tsunami but was razed to the ground by unknown miscreants in 2011.
It was also at the Nissan that the Mirissa Beach Party was held every Thursday during the tourist season. We employed a staff of 35 and the hotel was my only source of income. It is with this money that I provided for, my wife, two children and my 80 year old mother, Gunasiri said speaking over the phone.
It was the opinion of those present at the press conference that the losses would have been minimal if the authorities performed their duty and demolished unauthorized structures as soon as they were put up, rather than postpone the action in return of gratification and favours.
We mistook the repeated postponement of expediting the demolition orders as a green light to improve the structures, said a hotelier who had lost much but did not want to be named.

Cyaniq.Social to host SLs first Instagram  Collaborator Forum on June 22
With the rising popularity of the Instagram platform in Sri Lanka, Cyaniq.social, a premier proponent of the platform has announced plans to host the platforms first Collaborator Forum in Sri Lanka on June 22 at the Galle Face Hotel.
Over the past year, Instagram has seen a rapid rise in popularity with the youth segment of Sri Lanka mirroring global trends and taking to the platform in a big way. As a result, many marketing outfits including Cyaniq.social have started including Instagram based marketing activities in their portfolio.
Cyaniq.social in particular has championed the idea of influencer led social media marketing, a marketing strategy in which focus is shifted from the market to key thought leaders and specialized individual content creators.
This type of marketing has proven to be highly successful in verticals such as F&B, Hospitality, Fashion, Consumer Goods and Electronics.
It is in this context, that Cyaniq.social in collaboration with Galle Face Hotel and a host of other corporate partners including Oppo Mobile, Wine World, Olu, Elephant House and Hello Print has announced the first ever Collaborator Forum event to be worked out in June.
The Collaborator Forum is an initiative that brings together the Instagram ecosystems most notable content creators, personalities, marketers and brands in one place to share ideas with each other and learn from one another. We are focused on the Instagram platform in our first installment of the Collaborator Forum given that we have championed the platform heavily ourselves, but we hope to expand to other platforms soon, said Dilshan Senaratne, Founder of Cyaniq.social.
The Collaborator Forum has been planned to include three independent segments of which the first will be keynote presentations, the second will be performance acts and the final segment being a round of networking among the 100 invitees.
Bhanuka Harischandra, CEO of new media marketing company Surge Global and Riaan George, the globally acknowledged luxury blogger based in India have been confirmed to deliver keynote presentations. More prominent figures are expected to join the foray.
Bhanuka has succeeded in rallying an engaged audience around his video content dealing with entrepreneurship, business and motivation. His content strategy modeled from his own experiences building a successful media business is insightful and engaging, making him a natural selection for a keynote delivery at the forum.
Riaan is a journalist with decade-long experience covering the most lucrative events around the world. His transition from print to digital and from digital to social has earned him his prominence as a luxury blogger continuously collaborating with the worlds biggest brands. In the performance segment, Stephanie Sansoni, whose cover performances of hit songs have garnered her collective following exceeding 100,000 individuals across her social media channels is set to serenade the invitees.
It was important for us to maintain the communal integrity of the platform ecosystem with this first event. As a result, we have opted for an invitation based event of no more than 100 attendees. Anyone with an interest in the proceedings can log in to our live stream of the event. The invitations are based on prominence and activity on the Instagram platform itself, explained DIlshan.
The planning and execution of the event has been charged to Events by Vibe, the official Event Planner whose contributions have been vital in designing and coordinating the event to its expected stature.
Networking and fellowship among the ecosystems most prominent collaborators is an avenue that the Collaborator Forum looks to fully engage in. Platforms such as Instagram have shown tremendous potential for collaborative content, an aspect that international content creators have been highly successful at leveraging to their benefit. Collaborations between brands, content creators and personalities have all reaped benefits for involved parties. The influencer marketing industry which borrows heavily from the collaborative aspect of social media is valued currently at nearly USD 2 Billion.

Designing the future
To reach for the future through the window of the present  two young minds recently found themselves occupied by that very task. Intelligence, where the design is born and an intention full of empathy. This is the story behind that endeavor, that success. Nippon Paint celebrated the successful conclusion of the Asia Young Designer Award (AYDA) themed You for tomorrow future living as envisioned today, in Sri Lanka for the second consecutive year with a glamorous awards ceremony held at the Hilton Hotel Colombo recently.
AYDA 2017 was held in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA). Two winners of both Architecture and Interior Designing were given opportunities for a visit in Malaysia (sponsored by Nippon Paint) for further training with one student from each discipline being awarded Rs. 100,000.
Winning tour
Getting an award at the stage of a student is a dream, remarked Sachintha Fernando from the City School of Architecture, the winner of the Gold award for the Interior Design Category. Especially, in terms of design because we dont really have the opportunity for design competitions within Sri Lanka. It gives a good recognition to us, to our universities and toour tutors as well.
The Gold award winner for Architecture category was Dilushan Madhuranga from the University of Moratuwa. In student life, a design award is a rare thing especially when its an internationally recognized award. That means a lot, he confirmed.
The two winners attended a three-day workshop held in Malaysia with the participation of 30 other Asias best young designers. During the Summit, 25 talented students represented their countries to showcase their winning design ideas in line with the theme You for Tomorrow to a panel of 56 renowned judges from across Asia, for a chance to win the highly sought-after Asia Young Designer of the Year title.
In Malaysia, we got the opportunity to speak with the tutors of other students, said Fernando. It was a very good exposure; they tutored us on our designs, as well.
We got the opportunity to meet very important architects in the field. They taught us how to present ourselves on the international stage. And we also got the opportunity to visit the Malaysian institute of architects.
The design
What was meant by You for Tomorrow in terms of design was not something futuristic, explained Fernando. The theme meant you should cater for the issues of tomorrow and to cater for the comfort levels of tomorrow. Our building should meet the comfort requirement of people while fulfilling their needs.
Following this path, Fernando presented a design of a rehabilitation center for teenage mothers. Its a rising issue in Sri Lankan society, she remarked. We have to help them build their future. They have kids and their kids are our future generation.
Fernando created the design within two categories. One for teenage mothers and one for their kids, like a daycare facility, she said.
What made her design stand out from the others was the issue I chose and the concept for that, explained Fernando.I gave two different themes for teenage mothers and their kids because their mentality is different. For children, Ive introduced a bit of a luxurious finish. And Ive given the place for mothers a very rustic effect.
They have pallet selling stalls around their place of living so Ive used palleted furniture for my building to give it a more homely effect, to attract the young mothers.
We couldnt just throw in our ideas, we had to thoroughly prove that the issue existed, stated Fernando. Near the garbage dump [where they lived] is where the issue was. Drug addiction, child abortion, child labour, prostitution and teenage mothers.
I visited the place; I approached the young children, made conversation and recognized the issue. Then, I started researching on that area, and I got the statistics from the municipal council. My research went on for like a month, she recalled.
In order to secure the winning position, Madhuranga created a design using abandoned container boxes. Were trying to reduce our carbon emissions and other material wastage. So, I created a design using abandoned material we could find in Colombo harbour. I chose a vacant lot and designed a place to hang out. It can be created by using very low budget and we can spread this trend to other places.
To make his design stand out from the rest, Madhuranga used different technology. The technology I have used is the joinery methods used to bind containers when theyre being shipped, he explained. I have used the same details to join my container boxes together and pick them. Even a non-professional can look at this building and get inspired.
And other thing is sustainability. My design doesnt require any new material so the carbon footprint will be very low. And it can be erected within a short period of time, he elaborated further.
I went to the harbour and found plenty of abandoned materials.
Container trailers boxes, joinery parts, cables timber pallets and such. We met with authorities and got the records. I calculated them and found that there are many abandoned materials we can use for a design, said Madhuranga.
Learning through experience
It was a very good motivation. When were doing a design, we undergo many hardtimes. This is a very good memory, said Fernando.
After the presentations, they held some sessions, by previous winners and they presented their works, how they stepped up the ladder in their careers. It helped us to expand the barriers of our thinking and get to the next level, confirmed Madhuranga.
One thing I observed is, in our country, our technological knowledge is very little compared to other countries, he said.And the attitude towards adapting the technology is low, especially when it comes to the digital design age.
Our hotels and aesthetically oriented designs are nice butif we dont update our technology and use it when it comes to high rises and performance oriented designs, what happens is we have to handover our projects to foreign architects and only do the local consultant part.
Words for eager peers
You should work hard for your passion, said Fernando. To gain victory, you should identify the issues and build up a strong concept. In design, you must create useful space which can fulfill the comfortable levels of future.
Getting awards and participating in international conferences and events finds you recognition in the industry, said Madhuranga. Such events open up many other opportunities. There are so many open competitions and opportunities we often ignore. Find a little time and take part in them, it will do a bigger change that you expect.
To seek, to seize, to improve. These enthusiastic, youthful personalities never fail to prove that there is always hope and possibility for a society like ours to reach great heights.

DFCC bank inaugurates CSR project  Samata English Program
Fulfilling its commitment to impart essential life skills and knowledge amongst the public, DFCC Bank is continuing its impactful CSR project, Samata English, which delivered impressive results during its inaugural year in 2017.
Now in the second phase, the Samata English program is currently underway in Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala. This CSR program was conceptualized with the objective of teaching Spoken English to equip students with the knowledge required to enter into the workforce on a strong and confident footing.
The second phase of the programme will benefit youth between the ages of 18-25 with improved English speaking skills over a three-month period. Education is a key pillar in DFCC Banks corporate social responsibility initiatives. In line with this, the Bank has actively supported education in the country through various initiatives over the years.
The selected students sat for an initial assessment prior to starting the course which consists of practical activities, presentations, skills development and free tutorials in classrooms with modern facilities. The English speaking course is conducted by Gateway Educational Services and the final assessmentwill also be conducted by Gateway with a CALSDA Certification.
Commenting on the success of the Samata English program, Lakshman Silva  CEO, DFCC Bank said, Being able to speak in English is crucial for youth in order to succeed in the local or international job markets. DFCC Bank launched Samata English to bridge the spoken English skills gap.
A pilot project was held last year in the Kalutara and Gampaha areas, which was very successful and it was encouraging to see the trained youth scoring high in spoken English skills as a direct influence of the programme. Encouraged by the improved confidence and positive outlook that this programme instilled in the youth in Gampaha and Kalutara last year, we are pleased to continue the programme in 2018 as well. This year, we are focusing on youth in Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala to help them fulfil their professional aspirations. In operation for over six decades, DFCC Bank remains dedicated to advancing financial inclusivity whilst supporting the growth and development of the nation.

Du Plessis powers Chennai into 7th IPL final
MUMBAI, Tuesday:South Africas Faf du Plessis smashed an unbeaten 67 to lead Chennai Super Kings into their record seventh Indian Premier League final with a thrilling two-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad on Tuesday.
Chasing 140 for victory, Chennai were in a shambles at 62-6 when Du Plessis stepped up with his 42-ball blitz that made the two-time champions achieve their target with five balls to spare in the first qualifier in Mumbai.
The Kane Williamson-led Hyderabad, who topped the league table, have a second chance of making the final in the second qualifying match Friday when they will meet the winner of an eliminator.
Du Plessis hit five fours and four sixes to propel Chennai, who returned this season after a two-year corruption ban along with Rajasthan Royals, into the final.
Three-time trophy holders Mumbai Indians, who bowed out in the league stage, have been involved in four title clashes since the popular league started in 2008.
Du Plessis opened the batting with Shane Watson (0) and put on a crucial 27-run unbeaten stand with tailender Shardul Thakur, who made 15 off five balls.
Good to win games like this. But whats important is to learn out of this game. Its about constantly improving. This is the best combination that we have got, skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after the win.
Right from the first game weve used different bowlers in different ways to find out who is the best bowler at the end... They will have to step up in the final, he added.
Paceman Dwayne Bravo set up the win with impressive bowling figures of two for 25 to restrict Hyderabad to 139-7.
Fast bowler Siddarth Kaul and Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan then picked up two wickets each to dent Chennais chase but Du Plessis absorbed the pressure and finished the game with a six.
Khan bowled Dhoni with his trademark googly for nine. Medium-pace bowler Sandeep Sharma also got two wickets.
Earlier, 2016 winners Hyderabad who topped the league table in this edition -- faltered after being put into bat first despite a 29-ball unbeaten 43 from Carlos Brathwaite.
After losing their openers quickly, skipper Kane Williamson made a 15-ball 24 to lead this seasons IPL batting chart with 685 runs before walking back to the dugout. The 34-year-old Bravo got two important wickets of Shakib Al Hasan and Yusuf Pathan, who was spectacularly caught and bowled by the West Indian allrounder.
It was a decent wicket and we would have liked 20 more (runs), said Williamson. Saying that, the game swung back our way, the bowlers were outstanding only didnt execute (in the death) as we have in the past, he added of his bowlers who have been excellent in defending low totals throughout season 11.
Kolkata Knight Riders will take on Royals in the eliminator on Wednesday in Kolkata.
The IPL final is on May 27 at Mumbais Wankhede Stadium with $4 million going to the winner. - AFP

England chief Strauss  to step down for summer
LONDON, Tuesday: England cricket director Andrew Strauss is to stand down temporarily for the season while his wife Ruth continues her treatment for cancer, with Andy Flower filling in while the former Test captain is on leave.
My wife was diagnosed with cancer in December, Strauss told reporters at Lords on Tuesday. We are very lucky she has been very well up to now although she is starting a new treatment on Friday which is going to be more challenging for her and as such I am going to be stepping back from my day-to-day duties while that treatment is going on.
He added: On a day-to-day basis Andy Flower is going to be stepping in for me over the course of the (English) summer.
Flower was Englands coach while former opening batsman Strauss enjoyed a successful spell as national captain that included a 2010/11 Ashes series victory in Australia.
The former Zimbabwe batsman has remained in the England and Wales Cricket Board set-up and is currently the coach of Englands second-string Lions.
We all know about his qualities and his experience of both England and English cricket and he will fill in my shoes very adequately, said Strauss.
I look forward to returning and grabbing the reins again but at this period of time my focus has to be on supporting Ruth and my family at a challenging time for us.
England face Pakistan at Lords on Thursday in the first of a two-Test series following a miserable 2017/18 tour programme that saw them fail to win any of their seven Tests in Australia and New Zealand. Strauss has since appointed a new national selector in Ed Smith, a former England batsman. - AFP

FIFA player rules in turmoil
Brussels, Wednesday: Some of the most important football action of the summer could take place on Thursday not on a pitch but in a Belgium court and could transform the transfer market. More than two decades after the Bosman case created freedom of contract, ended nationality quotas and shifted power to the wealthiest clubs, a Brussels court will hear an appeal on third party ownership (TPO) of players, which is banned by footballs world governing body, FIFA.
TPO allows investors to hold a financial stake in players and cash in by taking a cut when they move between clubs during their careers in lucrative transfer deals. Critics say it deprives players of control over their careers and former UEFA president Michel Platini, now banned from football following a graft probe, called it a type of slavery.
Football authorities worry that involvement of third party owners with clubs creates conflicts of interest and favours clubs who can afford to form continuing relationships with agents or player owners.
Supporters claim it helps poorer clubs sign and develope young players and spreads the burden of transfer fees because they only buy part of the players registration. The current case was brought by Belgian third-division club Seraing which in January 2015 signed an agreement with investment fund Doyen Sports based on the potential returns from TPO. AFP

Hayleys to boost Grama Shakthi movement
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Flower Growers Association of the Uva province and Hayleys Company enabling the company to purchase flowers from growers at a steady price continuously.
Under the MoU, the company will provide farmers with modern technology and equipment to increase the quality of flowers. The farmer association of ornamental flowers produces high - quality flowers for local and international markets with the assistance of Hayleys Company in Welimada, Uva Paranagama and Haputhale Divisional Secretariats in the Badulla District.
The agreement was signed in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Provincial Steering Committee Meeting on the Grama Shakthi programme in Badulla on May 21. The first installment of the states share for the implementation of the Grama Shakthi movement in Badulla (Rs. 22.5 million) and Moneragala (Rs. 16.5 million) Districts was also handed over by the President to the respective District Secretaries at the progress review.
Grama Shakthi, which is a concept of President Sirisena, is one of the key initiatives implemented to eradicate poverty. Instead of being a programme that brings people and the state together in the attempt to eradicate poverty as in most programmes implemented hitherto, Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement brings together people, public and private sectors as essential stakeholders of poverty eradication. The aim is to ensure that the produce of farmers consistently gets a better price and access new markets while bringing in new technology. The movement helps people to get organised into peoples companies in order for them to negotiate with large private sector organisations on equal terms.
Grama Shakthi is implemented island-wide while districts with a higher incidence of poverty are prioritised.
The movement will cover 1,000 villages in its first phase and scale up to 5,000 villages by 2020.

HOMAGE TO A BEAUTIFULBOND

Premayanam
Raagayen thora 
Sanda Eliya sae Achinthyai
Paarishuddhai
Suramyai
(Love is Eternal 
It treks far beyond mere lust
It glows like a celestial being 
Its pure and soothing)

Nanda Malini renders her haunting voice to the above song to portray the pure meaning of love which is unselfish and compassionate.
This blue planet we inhabit is called Magul Sakwala (lustful world) because it has human beings and animals that constantly yearn for love and lust. Though lust or desire makes living beings drowned in Samsara, love has a deeper meaning as depicted in the above song.
There had been great lovers in this world from olden days. Rama/Seetha, Radha/Krishna, Saliya/Ashokamala, Shah Jahan/Mumtaz Mahal, Romeo/Juliet kept undying remembrances of love in our minds.
True love always associates with sacrifice. The great sacrifice made by Princess Yashodara towards her beloved Prince Siddharth in his path to Enlightenment stands tall in human history.
Lady portrayals
Prof Sunil Ariyaratne throughout his film career has endeavoured in shedding light on the plight of women. Anupama, Kusa Paba, Uthpalavanna and Paththini are good examples. Yashodhara being his newest cinematic creation too revolves around a womans true love and sacrifice towards her man. Yet Yashodara is different to his other cinematic creations in regard to many aspects.
Producer H D Premasiri of Sarasavi Bookshop fame is a resourceful film producer keen on promoting quality cinema. Association of H D Premasiri and Prof Ariyaratne has garlanded Sri Lankan cinema with a jewel of a film, which is Yashodara.
The characters of Siddharth, Yashodara, Devdath and Channa in the Buddhist history rest within our minds eternally.
Hence bringing these characters into life credibly via a cinematic creation is not an easy task. In fact, it is a task that leaves the filmmaker with great risks. Prof Ariyaratne has boldly faced this challenge. From the stage of casting for the cinema, he has brought serious thought towards the project. The cinema speaks for itself.
The director has made emphasis on the romance between Yashodara and Siddharth. This romance begins from the day Siddharth chooses Yashodara as his bride at the Svayanvaraya.
Beyond wide screen
Finding an actress for Yashodaras character would have been a tall order for the director since the whole cinema focuses on Yashodara and all other characters revolve around her. Indian actress Pallavi Subash Portraying Yashodara simply makes us forget that we live in a different epoch. She lives in the character so well that we forget we are watching a cinema.
Pallavi Subash magically takes us back to the era of Siddharth and Yashodara. The faint images of Yashodhara, Siddharth, Rahula and Channa filtering through a mesh of tears to the mind of the viewer become a rare visual experience. The cinema is awesomely emotional thus a sensitive person would feel like crying aloud.
Yashodhara chanting Narasimha Gaatha to prince Rahula while painting Buddhas picture is the climax of the whole cinema. The yearning of the audience to have a glimpse of the Lord Buddha becomes enormous here. When Rahula eagerly looks from the window his face gleams with happiness and at that instance, we paint our own visuals of the Buddha in our minds.
Prof Ariyaratne has brought his thoughts and philosophy into the cinema in a subtle manner.
The director makes Yashodara cry her heart out on hearing her son Rahulas conversion to a Samanera by the Buddha without her knowledge. She weeps here in the most helpless manner and communicates of an injustice.
Facial expressions
In another scene, an associate tells Yashodara that Janapada Kalyani is in deep sorrow after hearing Prince Nanda her fianc has been made a Buddhist priest by the Buddha. Facial expressions of Yashodara in this scene would be best understood by women.
Heeding to King Suddhodanas plea and as a respect towards it, Lord Buddha eventually imposed a Shikshapada forbidding converting any child to a Bhikkhu without the formers parents consent.
In the shores of Anoma River when Prince Siddharth removes his hair, we see the Himalayan Mountains in the backdrop. But Prof Ariyaratne has shot the whole film in Ranmihitenna, Hambantota. The Paathra (bowl) moving upstream as a result of the Sathya Kriya by Siddharth too is shown credibly. This is the magic in special effects and hats off to Chatra Weeraman for handling it well.
Maara Parajaya (defeating death and recreation) by Prince Siddharth is shown cinematically. However, not showing the failed temptations by Thanha, Rathi and Ranga on the verge of Siddharth attaining Nibbana is a drawback.
Evil existence
Some quarters including the clergy say that there are no such characters as Mara Doowaru (Daughters of Death) and these three depict the lustful feelings that haunt ones mind. Yet a respected Buddhist priest preached these characters really exist and they are with Maara Divya Puthra aka The God of Death. This priest also preached Devdath and Ajasat even at this moment of time dwelling in the ugly depths of hell suffering for their misdeeds towards the Lord Buddha.
We humans interpret Time factor in a relative manner and that was reiterated by Einstein centuries after the Buddha.
Prince Siddharth showcasing his prowess in combat amongst relatives and peers would have been shot in a colossal manner. What the cinema shows is a mere combat between the Prince and Devdath and it hampers credibility of this particular happening.
Also, it is questionable as to why the director avoided Kisagothami and her singing of Nibbutha Pada to Siddharth. Did Kisagothami have a crush towards Siddharth, was a question in my mind from schooling days
Character portrayals 
The character of Channa, the closest associate of Prince Siddharth has been given due attention in the cinema. The actor who portrays Channa (Shammu Kasun) has to show his emotion only with expressions most of the time and he does it really well.
Devdath (Dineth de Silva) seems too aggressive for a monk who possesses Loukika Dyana (worldly factor of absorption). Ajith Weerasinghe portrays King Suddhodanas character credibly. His controlled acting style and profound voice make him the real king.
The cinematography is superb. Enchanting looks of Yashodara (Pallavi Subash) has been captured extremely well by Channa Deshapriya with his camera.
Soothing music scores by Dr Rohana Weerasinghe add immense value to the whole cinema. Thumindu Dodantenna does the poets role so credibly. Dilan Karunaratnes singing of poems sinks with Thumindus performance so well.

Impact of adverse weather
The prevailing adverse weather in the island has claimed 11 lives and made thousands displaced in 12 districts. It is unavoidable for Sri Lanka to get affected by natural disasters especially by monsoonal rains due to its geographical location in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lankans have both wet and dry weather in line with climatic and monsoonal changes but the cost of these natural disasters are unbearable and indigestible because of our economic conditions of our country.
When our country faces massive disaster and destruction, we must stretch our helping hands to the victims of the disaster. It is our duty to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims regardless of their race, caste or creed.
Relief for flood victims
The President, as well as the Prime Minister has directed the representatives to provide swift relief with essential needs of the people.
The residents settled down on either side of the banks of Kelani, Kalu, Gin and Nilwala rivers and other disaster-prone areas should be vigilant. They must take precautionary measures to avoid any major effects and take prompt action to save their precious lives and property. In the meantime, the people in the temporary shelters should also take care of their basic hygiene and sanitary. There is a possibility to spread infectious diseases along with the inclement weather.
The disaster management authorities can provide the victims with instant dry rations or cooked meals instead of essential food items. The government can also identify the highly-risky areas in the upcountry which will potentially be affected by landslides and other disasters. The residents of such areas should be immediately evacuated and placed in the safe temporary shelters in order to avert major devastations. The philanthropists willing to extend their support and assistance can consider the infants and supply them with milk powder and drinking water.
Illegal constructions
The general public should not think that this is the responsibility confined to the government. We should also treat people with sympathy and empathy. We must treat others just the way we wish to be treated. Suppose if we have to face the current disaster ourselves what will happen to us Thus think about our fellow citizens who are suffering from many hardships with their children and extend your generous assistance to intricate from the natural disaster.
On the one hand, the people become a contributory factor to make major floods in the urban and main cities in the country. We block the spaces through which the rain waters drain by illegally erecting buildings and shops and then no place for water to drain by which the water gets stagnated at one place and ultimately the particular place will get inundated with major floods.
On the other hand, the government, municipality, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas should take immediate and severe actions against illegal builders and trespassers who illegally dominate and make their own shops and residents.
The Sri Lankans have the nature that we never prevent or take action against before something occurs, on the contrary, we worry and be harsh with people after something happened. This is not good for an ideal people or country, we should have a proper mechanism on which people can erect their buildings otherwise a proper action should be taken against the selfish and illegal intruders to avoid unwanted flooding in the major cities.
Moreover, we are formally an agriculture-based economic country. Our forefathers also came through this path. Our ancient kings and rulers have built massive tanks and reservoirs to save the rainwater that we obtain from the monsoonal rains every year for paddy cultivations.
Tanks and reservoirs
This concept has been forgotten by many people because we just allow a massive amount of water to flow into the sea today. We can just refresh our memory by recalling the verses of King Parakramabahu who said: I will not allow a drop of water to the sea that we gain from the sky.
This is indeed inspiring and thought-provoking verse that will encourage us to renovate or rebuild the tanks and reservoirs all over the island for the reason Sri Lanka does not get rain throughout the year. We have to save maximum water during the rainy seasons and use it for the rest of the period when we do not get much raining.
Of course, another sole purpose to generate electricity we need water and very often we dismay about potential power cut due to continuous dry climate. Hence taking this disaster situation as an example the political leaders should have pragmatic mission and vision to make a prosperous and potential country by which we should make a sustainable future for our offsprings.

INSEE Cements contribution enriches  Colombos B2B Projects
With high rise iconic buildings rapidly changing the skyline in the city of Colombo, INSEE Cement is focusing its attention on these Projects that benefit from the strength and durability that its product portfolio offers.
B2B projects springing up in the city primarily come under two main categories  one is high rise buildings such as apartment complexes and hotels and the other is infrastructure facilities such as dams, bridges or highways and other major developments.
High rise buildings on the other hand require high performance concrete combined with durability that brings a good return on investment (ROI) for the investor. This is achieved by ensuring more floor area by reducing column sizes with high strength concrete.
Explaining how INSEE Cement contributes to Sri Lankas rapidly developing construction industry, Sanka Seneviratne, Head of Industrial Sales at Siam City Cement (Lanka) said We have introduced performance monitoring tools to uplift industry standards and contribute to training, coaching and mentoring of engineers through knowledge sharing on the latest technology. This is achieved via knowledge sharing sessions initiated by the INSEE Innovation and Application centre.
Especially when it comes to large scale projects and high-rise buildings, we are closely working with government institutions, universities and organization as well as professional bodies to develop solutions. We work with three state universities - Moratuwa, Peradeniya and Ruhunu - to further develop solutions he added.
We developed a solution for Altair iconic project when they required early strength of 25 N/mm2 within 24 hours with INSEE Rapid Flow a high early strength cement and developed a solution for Lotus Tower project which required a durable concrete that can last almost 100 years. For that we have a developed concrete solution using INSEE Extra a certified low heat sulphate resistant cement. Hambantota and Colombo South harbours needed a solution for concrete that is exposed to sea water. For Colombo City Centre, another iconic project, we proposed high flow concrete to reduce the time needed to place the concrete and reduce overall costs, he explained, highlighting some of the recent projects that benefited from INSEE Cement. INSEE Cement contributes to strengthening the nation in other ways too. We conduct training programmes to uplift the industry by knowledge sharing and promoting green cement products or blended cement which is minus CO2. Reducing global warming and contributing to climate change endeavours is one of our key focus areas, he said.

Leo-Brad combination
For a film that hasnt even begun production, Quentin Tarantinos Once Upon a Time in Hollywood already has an immense amount of hype, and a lot of it is due to Tarantino himself.
Appearing at CinemaCon in Las Vegas on Monday night, the director likened his Charles Manson-inspired film as the closest to Pulp Fiction that I have done.
He also said the films lead actors, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, make for the most exciting star dynamic since Paul Newman and Robert Redford, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
DiCaprio, who appeared alongside Tarantino, echoed the directors sentiments.
Its hard to speak about a film that we havent done yet, but Im incredibly excited to work with Brad Pitt, and I think [Tarantinos] going to transport us. Im a huge fan of Singin in the Rain - movies about Hollywood. As an L.A. native, having read the script, its one of the most amazing screenplays hes ever written, which is saying a lot, because hes written some of the masterworks in cinema history. We are going to do our best job to make it fantastic.
Despite these sweeping proclamations, Tarantino opted to keep the films plot close to the vest, saying only: Its very hush-hush and top secret.
But I can tell you that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place in 1969, at the height of the counterculture hippie revolution and the height of new Hollywood. Street by street, block by block, well transform Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969.
DiCaprio has been cast to play a former western TV star named Rick Dalton who lives next door to Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. Pitt portrays Cliff Booth, Ricks longtime stunt double. Tates murder at the hands of the Manson Family cult serves as a backdrop to the main story. Margot Robbie was previously reported to be in final negotiations to play the role of Tate.The Independent

Milk- Champions drink
Children and hydration
Our bodies are made up of approximately 70 per cent water. Children are at a greater risk of dehydration than adults.
Quench your thirst
For children of all ages, water and milk are the best choices to quench their thirst. Besides having zero calories, water is a no-sugar thirst-quencher and one cup of milk has 300 milligrams of calcium, so its a big contributor to a childs daily needs.
Heres how much calcium children need each day:
toddlers (ages 1 to 3 years): 700 milligrams of calcium daily
children (ages 4 to 8 years): 1000 milligrams
older children (ages 9 to 18 years): 1,300 milligrams
The current dietary guidelines for milk or equivalent dairy products or fortified soy beverages are:
Children ages 2 to 3 should drink 2 cups (480 milliliters) every day.
Children 4 through 8 should have 2 cups (600 milliliters) per day.
Children 9 and older should have 3 cups (720 milliliters) per day.
Milk  a sports drink 
Athletes have good reason to focus on nutrition: replacing fluid and nutrients after an intense work out helps repair and replenish muscles and maintain strong bones. If nutrients are not replaced during and after exercise, athletes experience fatigue and may not be able to keep up the intensity of their workouts.
One beverage that is often overlooked as a recovery drink is milk. Milks nutrientsprotein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and waterare rapidly absorbed and metabolized by the body to produce energy during and replenish nutrient stores after activity.
Milk is also a good source of
carbohydrates. Carbohydrates consumed within thirty minutes after exercising will be transported to muscles for immediate use or stored as glycogen for the next activity. Failing to consume adequate carbohydrates after exercising can lead to fatigue and muscle soreness.
The vitamins and minerals in milk are important for maintaining good health and optimizing athletic performance. Most dairy foods contain vitamins A and D. Vitamin A maintains healthy tissue growth while vitamin D helps the body utilize minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. The minerals found in milkcalcium, potassium and magnesium5help maintain strong bones, proper muscle functioning and fluid balance.
Flavoured milk has become a favorite of athletes as a post-exercise rehydration beverage. While providing all of the nutritional benefits of plain milk, the additional carbohydrates from sugar in chocolate or strawberry milk are easily absorbed and metabolized.
Recent research has found that chocolate milk is not only an effective recovery aid after prolonged exercise, but that it can actually improve performance in subsequent exercise bouts.

Multiple endings to keep climax undercover
Apart from its high octane action sequences and gripping storylines, the Race franchise is known for its twisted climax scenes and its third installment will be no different. However, to keep the climax scene from being leaked out, the makers are apparently out with a brilliant strategy.
According to reports, the makers of Race 3 will be shooting multiple endings so that no one knows which scene will be incorporated in the film. Nobody from the entire film crew will reportedly be aware of the climax sequence.
Seems like us, they too will need to wait until June 15 to know the same!
Helmed by Remo DSouza, the film stars, Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor, Jacqueline Fernandez, Saqib Saleem, Daisy Shah and Bobby Deol in lead roles. The trailer of the film which was released recently has received mix reviews.

My favourite holiday destination
My favourite holiday destination is the beach. A holiday on the beach gives me the chance to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Like many others, I long to hear the sounds of the waves crashing on the beach and feel the soft golden yellow sand under my feet. I simply love the beach!
My favourite beach resort is Hikkaduwa. The scene on Hikkaduwa beach is something I would love to capture on paper one day. I can see many activities going on in the sea and on the white sandy beach. There are people taking walks, or having picnics under shady trees, children are collecting seashells on the beach and some are building sandcastles. Regardless of what they are doing, everyone looks relaxed and in high spirits.
For some of them, there is nothing more relaxing than to close their eyes and sunbathe. They just lie in a deckchair, read a book or listen to the radio. Some just want to do nothing. In the clear blue sea, many exciting activities take place. There are people rowing canoes, swimming and fishing. The more adventurous would sea-dive or surf. Along the shoreline, mothers play in the water with their little children.
The beach is the most crowded in the evening when the sun is setting. As one stands on the shoreline, one can see the horizon and sunset. It is really such a beautiful sight. At night, it is common to see beach parties or barbecues full of happy people. They are dancing, singing and eating, all at the same time.
The beach is one place I cant seem to get enough of. To me, it is the best place to retreat to after the hectic life in the city. It is there I get my piece of mind and rejuvenation.

Nail  necessities
With colour splashes and nail art crazes booming, hands are on display big time. A combination of features like a well-balanced diet, a thoughtful beauty regimen, and good personal hygiene can result in salon-worthy nails. Pamper your nails with a stylish makeover and you will never shy away from flaunting them.

Tight and ragged cuticles

Moisturize with an over-the counter cuticle oil or make your own just as easily. A combination of unpasteurized honey, aloe vera juice and olive oil keeps the cuticles moist and prevents painful cracks. Mix a small amount of each in a bowl or cup, then massage the mixture into the skin around your fingernails for about five minutes. Repeat two or three times per week. Alternatively, soak your fingers in a mixture of equal parts of olive oil and warm water. You can also massage a drop of olive oil or a dab of petroleum jelly into each cuticle after bathing,
Making your nails grow faster

Biotin helps in the growth of nails, hair, and skin. Biotin can be consumed either through foods or in the form of supplements. Biotin can be found in foods like bananas, avocado, and salmon.
Getting a manicure

If you prefer absolutely perfect polish and medium to long nails, you will need a professional manicure once a week. If you favour shorter nails for a more active lifestyle, and you can do polish touch-ups at home, you may need a professional manicure only every two weeks.

(Compiled byRuwini Jayawardana)
Nail polish separation

Putting nail polish in the refrigerator can actually cause it to thicken and separate faster. There are a few methods you can use when storing your nail polish that will keep it from becoming thick and separating. When nail polish has separated, it will have a layer of oil on the top.

To prevent nail polish from separating: 
* Store your nail polish in a cool, dry place. A medicine cabinet or makeup box is an excellent location. Placing your nail polish on a surface where heat or sunlight can reach it will cause separation.
* Store your bottles of nail polish upright. This may seem obvious, but if a nail polish bottle falls over, set it back up right away. It will keep the ingredients properly layered and prevent separation.
* Invest in quality nail polish. Cheap nail polish is more likely to separate and is harder to fix. More expensive nail polish will be a better investment in the long run, and it stores well.

To fix nail polish which has already separated: 
Step 1: Open the nail polish and check if it has separated. If the nail polish is stringy, it can't be salvaged and needs to be thrown away.
Step 2: Add two to three drops of nail polish thinner to the nail polish, and place the lid back on.
Step 3: Roll the bottle of nail polish between your hands to pick the thinner. When you open the bottle, the polish should have mixed back together. If not, add another drop or two of thinner and repeat this step.

10 steps to the perfect manicure




Step 1: Be equipped with essential tools.
Step 2: Remove any previously applied nail polish.
Step 3: Shape nails.
Step 4: Soak away in warm water.
Step 5: Apply callous/cuticle remover.
Step 6: Remove excess cuticle and callouses around the nail.
Step 7: Moisturize with a rich cream or silky oil.
Step 8: Prep for polish by applying nail polish remover over the nails surface to make sure that the nail has absolutely nothing oily or emollient left on it.
Step 9: Paint nails in layers.
Step 10: Reapply moisturizer.
Tips to make a manicure last




At the end of the day, polish isn't meant to last forever and that's probably for the best. However, you can save a good chunk of change and time by knowing how to maximize the life of your manicure with these tips:

* The alcohol in hand sanitizers eats away the topcoat and causes your colour to fade and become dull. Exfoliators in body and facial scrubs are also a no-no, as they remove both the top layer of your skin and your polish.
* Wash your hands with a mild antibacterial soap to avoid colds and germs and to preserve your mani. Reach for alcohol-free lotion. If it has a fragrance that means that it contains alcohol.
* Wearing rubber gloves while you do the dishes or clean the bathroom will definitely help your polish stick around longer.
* Reapply a layer of clear topcoat every two to three days to prevent chipping and enhance the shine.
* Apply nail oil daily to prevent your nails from drying out and splitting.
* Close up the nail edge, where its been clipped or filed down, with polish and topcoat. This keeps water out and provides a barrier against everyday bangs and dings that would cause a manicure to chip.

## Title: National policy on project evaluation
## Supertitle:

National policy on project evaluation
The government will soon bring in a national policy on evaluation.
The Chair of Parliamentary Forum on Development Evaluation, UNP MP Ananda Kumarasiri whose Forum had been lobbying for this, expected it to be approved by Cabinet in June.
Kumarasiri together with 16 other MPs (both from the government and opposition) have worked since 2015 to incorporate a system of evaluation to all government projects, big and small.
There is no evidence based decision making at present. Instead of looking at the success or failure of the project after implementation, it is important that we first evaluate its success before it is on the ground, he said addressing a media briefing at Parliament yesterday together with fellow MPs Mayantha Dissanayake, Buddhika Pathirana and NUW MP Mylvaganam Thilakarajah together with other partners in the programme.
In 2013, then Opposition MP, Kabir Hashim had proposed an evaluation process for all government projects to be introduced in Parliament.
This bill and the RTI were one of the two most important legislation that were first proposed by the UNP government in 2001, MP Pathirana said. In 2017, Pathirana once again brought it up through an adjournment motion.
The MPs stated that they are currently holding district wise consultations, from the Grama Niladhari level to the District Secretariat in 11 districts to sensitise the officers on the need to incorporate an evaluation process into project design and implementation.
Sri Lanka will also host the first meeting of parliamentarians from around the world, called Eval Colombo this year focused on promoting a culture of evaluation.
The goal of the event is to learn from global examples to establish a domestic Parliamentary evaluation process in Sri Lanka, they said.
It is very important that we must have our own evaluation process, not donor-centered evaluation, National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said. He said past attempts to set up evaluation schemes were not taken seriously because they were imposed from the outside.
Sivagnanasothy said that projects usually failed due to: improper design and planning; bad implementation (government agency not capable of handling it); issues in the operational stage (poor maintenance) or due to policy factors.
Evaluation can be done either in the planning stage, during implementation or post implementation to look at lessons learnt, he said stressing that this would incorporate accountability into the system.
At present the implementation of the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) which has been incorporated into the development framework of the country also needs an evaluation process from within the country and Sivagnanasothy noted that the presence of a policy on evaluation will help the country take account of its own progress.
We need certain fundamental policies- We need a national policy, sensitization of parliamentarians, evaluation system, capacity building of government officers, standards and ethics, dissemination of information to public and the incorporation of evaluation into the Budgeting and planning process so we get value for money.
Evaluation reports would also help Parliamentarians in Oversight Committees investigate into projects backed with evidence. At the moment, once we have any project plan, we dont have any evaluation method to see whether it is viable or not for the country, said MP Thilakarajah, But were using public funds.
He argued all projects carried out from the village to national level should have an evaluation report, as not to repeat mistakes like the water issues at Uma Oya.
If there is no proper planning and continuing evaluation, thats money wasted, he said.
Hundred countries are expected to participate in the global forum, which will be held from September 17 to 19 at the Hilton Colombo and the Parliament.
It is organised by the Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation, the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation, EvalPartners, and the Sri Lanka Evaluation Association.

National single window consultations  to resume today
The second round of public-private consultations on the establishment of a National Single Window (NSW) in Sri Lanka jointly organized by Geneva-based International Trade Centre (ITC),in close collaboration with Sri Lankas National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC), will be held on May 24, 2018 at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.
The objective of these public-private consultations is to stimulate discussions and seek recommendations from border regulatory representatives and the business community on the implementation modalities of the NSW.
This event is organised within the framework of the EU  Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance project funded by the European Union.
Forty high-level representatives will attend the event from business associations, government agencies, and trade operators. Dignitaries gracing the opening ceremony will include Dr. R.H.S Samaratunge, Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance, Chandanie Wijayawardhana, Secretary Ministry of Development Strategies & International Trade,. P.S.M. Charles, Chairperson NTFC, Director General of Customs, Sonali Wijeratne, co-chairperson NTFC, Director General Department of Commerce, Rajesh Aggarwal, Chief Trade Facilitation & Policy for Business, International Trade Centre and a Board Member, European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
As one of the fastest growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region, SriLanka has risen steadily to become a regional trade and logistics hub and is striving to make its economy more interconnected with regional and global markets. In this context, the Government of Sri Lanka has committed to create a National Single Window (NSW) as a national priority to reduce time and costs currently spent by traders in preparing and submitting information and documents to multiple border regulatory agencies. The National Single Window will allow parties involved in trade and transport to lodge information and documents with a single-entry point to fulfil all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements.
The objective of this second public-private consultation is to facilitate the exchange of views between trade stakeholders on the governance mechanism for the NSW. Participants will discuss how Sri Lanka can best protect the Governments policy interests and the genuine need of the private sector for increased competitiveness through appropriate decision-making and consultations bodies.
The recommendations from this consultation will be shared with the National Trade Facilitation Committee as well as the World Bank Group who are currently involved in the development of a Single Window Blueprint that will formulate recommendations for the consideration of the Government of Sri Lanka as the country proceeds towards implementation.

Nissanka Senadhipathis FR fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by Avant Garde Maritime Service (Pvt) Ltd Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi seeking an Interim Order preventing him from being arrested over a Magisterial inquiry, was yesterday fixed for support on June 8 by the Supreme Court.
Senadhipathi filed this petition challenging the magisterial inquiry on the alleged violation of the Firearms Ordinance and Explosive Act as set out in the B report submitted to the Galle Magistrates Court.
Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Murdu Fernando yesterday declined to sit on the Bench regarding this petition and the matter is to be heard in a different Bench.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Two-Judge-Bench headed by Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, Justice Murdu Fernando declined to sit on the Bench.
In his petition, Senadhipathi cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekara, the Attorney General and 15 others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the vessel MV Avant Garde was detained and taken control of by the Sri Lanka Navy in international waters. The weapons and ammunition on board MV Avant Garde belong to the government of Sri Lanka entrusted to Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited (RALL). It is also a fully state-owned entity which is under the purview of the Ministry of Defence.
The petitioner said there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that the operations carried out between Avant Garde and RALL were tainted with any form of illegality.
The petitioner believes that the police officers visited his residence with a view to ask him to come to the CID to record a statement. The petitioner believes that no sooner the said statement is recorded, he will be arrested and taken into custody for the alleged violations of the provisions in the Firearms Ordinance and Explosive Act based on the ex facie false and baseless allegations. This petition had been filed through Counsel Sanath Wijewardena.

North Korea preps nuclear site demolition
SOUTH KOREA: Invited foreign journalists gathered in North Korea on Wednesday to witness the slated destruction of the reclusive regimes nuclear test site, a high profile gesture on the road to a summit with the US that Donald Trump now says might not happen.
In a surprise announcement Pyongyang said earlier this month that it planned to completely destroy the Punggye-ri facility in the countrys northeast, a move welcomed by Washington and Seoul.
Punggye-ri has been the site of all six of the Norths nuclear tests, the latest and by far the most powerfulin September last year, which Pyongyang said was an H-bomb.
The demolition is due to take place sometime between Wednesday and Friday, depending on the weather.
The North has portrayed the destruction on the test site as a goodwill gesture ahead of planned June 12 summit between Kim and Trump in Singapore.
But doubts have since been cast by both sides on whether that potentially historic meeting will take place.
Last week Pyongyang threatened to pull out if Washington pressed for its unilateral nuclear disarmament. Trump also said the meeting could be delayed as he met with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in Washington on Tuesday. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think well get those conditions. And if we dont, we wont have the meeting, he told reporters, without elaborating on what those conditions might be.
Politically, Trump has invested heavily in the success of his meeting with Kim, and so privately most US officials, as well as outside observers, believe it will go ahead.
But as the date draws near, Trumps divergence from his top aides, the differences between the two sides and these high stakes are coming into sharp relief. Everything is on thin ice, Koo Kab-woo, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.
Experts are divided over whether the demolition will render the site useless. Sceptics say the site has already outlived its usefulness with six successful nuclear tests in the bag and can quickly be rebuilt if needed. Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said both sides were playing a game of chicken in the run up to the summit to gain an upper hand in negotiations.
He said the destruction of the Punggye-ri test site would win Pyongyang international sympathy even if the summit collapses. - AFP

The recent rise in crude oil prices, if sustained, increases the risk that the Centre will ask state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) to share the countrys fuel-subsidy burden, according to Moodys Investors Service.
Both firms have not contributed to fuel subsidies since June 2015, but have in previous years paid for more than 40% of Indias annual subsidy bill. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene supplies consume significant subsidies in the sector.
Because of the governments widening fiscal deficit, ONGC and OIL could be asked to bear part of the Indian governments fuel subsidy for oil, if prices stay above $60 per barrel for the fiscal year ending March 2019. The net impact of the subsidy sharing will be manageable for ONGC and OIL, even if the two companies are required to bear the entire shortfall between budgeted and actual amounts for the fiscal year ending March 2019, said Vikas Halan, senior vice president at Moodys in a report.
Moodys estimated that fuel subsidies could total Indian rupee34,000 crore- Indian rupee 53,000 crore in fiscal 2019, the highest since fiscal 2015, assuming Brent crude oil prices average $60-$80 per barrel.
The government had budgeted for Indian rupee 25,000 crore of fuel subsidies in fiscal 2019, leaving a shortfall of 9,000 crore to 28,000 crore, which could be met by ONGC and OIL entirely, or in part, if the government increases the budget allocation for these subsidies.
Pricing deregulation
Moodys pointed out that if ONGC and OIL were obligated to contribute the entire subsidised amount exceeding the governments budgeted figure for the fiscal year ending March 2019, such a requirement would constrain their net realised prices to $52-$56 per barrel, which is only marginally lower than or equal to the $56 for fiscal 2018.
The agency said it believed the government was unlikely to reverse fuel pricing deregulation because it remains committed to reforms. Most petroleum products are sold at market-linked prices in India, except LPG and kerosene. (The Hindu)

PM to consult SLFP on upcoming PC elections: Speaker
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would consult the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and arrive at a decision on the upcoming Provincial Council (PC) elections this week, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday.
Responding to Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma, the Speaker said the topic had been discussed several times at party leaders meetings and that the Prime Minister had requested time to discuss it with the SLFP.
MP Alahapperuma questioned over the delay in moving the Delimitation Committee Report on provincial councils for debate in Parliament. He noted that the elections to three PCs had already been delayed for eight months and that the period of another three PCs were to expire within the next few months. He expressed doubts as to whether the government was deliberately postponing the PC elections. The Speaker said he had paid special attention to the matter, adding that the PM would arrive at a decision this week. State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne said that the UNP too, disagreed to postpone the elections.
Blue Summit Capital Management to buy ETI Finance
Blue Summit Capital Management (Pte) Ltd was the new investor to buy ETI Finance, State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne said in Parliament, yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 27 (2). He said the new investor would be given time to muster a plan to settle deposit liabilities, and if they were to fail, the government would have to liquidate the company.
ETI Finance will sell its shareholding in subsidiaries and investment properties for a net amount of USD 75 million. USD 32 million out of that sum had been received and 10 percent of money of the deposit holders will be paid from June 5 onward. Another 10 percent will be repaid by the end of June when the remainder, USD 43 million, has been received. The Director Board members of ETI Finance have been ordered to pay Rs. 1 billion to the company before June 15. In case the company was liquidated, depositors will be repaid the money to a maximum of Rs. 600,000 by the Central Bank Depositors Insurance, he said.
The state minister admitted that the government would not be able to repay the money of the depositors in full, if the company had to be liquidated.
There is a shortage of 30 to 35 percent, and it is general opinion that it is unfair to repay the amount using taxpayers money. In that case, the depositors will have to go before courts against the owners, but it would be a lengthy process. The Central Bank (CB) has ordered the company to present an action plan before June 15. We would have to give the new investor some time to see how it could bail out the company, he added.
The state minister said Omar Siraj Qandeel and Rodrigo Don Cyril were the Director Board members of the Blue Summit Capital Management (Pte) Ltd to which several key ETI Group assets were to be sold.
He further said a tri-member committee comprised of former CB Assistant Governor S. S. Rathnayake, former Bank of Ceylon (BOC) DGM P. A. Lionel and former BOC AGM H. W. Thilakarathna, had been appointed to supervise the troubled ETI group. MP Dissanayake questioned the governments plan to repay the money of 35,300 depositors of ETI totalling to Rs. 36 billion. He further requested a full-day debate on the troubled financial institutions in the country. Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella agreed to the request.
Govt. has taken measures to assist flood victims
The government had taken all necessary measures to provide dry rations to those who were affected by the inclement weather conditions prevailing in the country, while Rs. 10,000 would also be paid to enable flood victims to have their homes cleaned once the flood waters had receded, Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said in Parliament, yesterday.
The government had taken measures to provide boats to all affected districts, while measures had also been taken to provide 66 rafts to Ratnapura, the state minister added. He said they had been involved in providing relief to flood victims in the Puttalam district yesterday, while rafts and mechanised boats had been provided to assist affected persons in the Kalutara, Galle, Badulla, Gampaha, Matara, Colombo, Kegalle, Puttalam and Kurunegala districts.
In addition to the 66 rafts already dispatched to Ratnapura, we have implemented a mechanism to provide an additional 26 rafts as well. We are issuing constant warnings and weather updates and have also taken measures to face any situation that may arise with the prevailing inclement weather over the next few days, he said. Further, the army is currently on standby with 20 motors, in order to assist people in affected areas to clean their wells, once the situation improves.
Minister raises concerns over coal power plants
Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne yesterday in Parliament, voiced his concerns against opting for more coal power plants in the country.
Commencing the debate on several orders under the National Environment Act relating to the banning of polythene items and a Gazette notification to declare Waratenna-Hakkinda as an Environmental Protection Area, Wickramaratne said the opposition to coal power plants was justifiable.
He underlined that the officials and engineers at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) should take the responsibility of attempting to push for more coal power.
What we have is a monopoly. If there had been other power suppliers, we could have resolved this issue more rationally. The CEB has a responsibility, and I urge them to take decisions while thinking of future generations. We need to give priority to generating power through clean energy, he said. He added that coal powers plants were being closed down elsewhere in the world, including the US, Europe and Japan, and that they were shifting to renewable energy such as solar, wind and Liquid Natural Gas (LNG).
People question the governments policy of opting for more coal power plants in this scenario. It is a valid question. The pollution at the coal power plant we currently possess is a fact that cannot be disregarded, despite what we in the government or the CEB say. Puttalam residents complain against Norochcholai. We in Colombo receive the benefits from the power plant, whereas the villagers in Puttalam suffer the pollution it causes, Wickramaratne said.
Weerawansa warned for misconduct
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday warned Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa not to disturb Parliament proceedings.
The Speakers warning came after MP Weerawansa demanded the microphone while the Speaker was making an announcement. MP Weerawansa was repeatedly demanding to raise a Point of Order.
Drought dwindled countrys crop yield by 30 percent
The recent drought was the most severe catastrophe to affect the country during recent times; it reduced the countrys agricultural production by 30 percent, forcing the government to spend a large sum to import rice and other essential commodities. Further, the government had spent Rs. 38 million in drought relief payments to farmers who were affected, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Commencing a debate on several orders under the National Environment Act relating to the banning of polythene items and a Gazette notification to declare Waratenna-Hakkinda as an Environmental Protection Area, Amaraweera said that despite the drought, the highest exports reported in the countrys history was achieved in 2017, earning an export revenue of over US$15 billion.
We also succeeded in increasing our foreign reserves. But it was a great achievement to have been able to keep the cost of living at a low level. We managed to lift the ban on fish exports and record the highest fish exports during 2017, he said.
The minister commended the media on the extent of flood reporting, adding that it was appreciated that the media had highlighted the areas that needed to be addressed, making it easier for the government to address the issues.
The highest number of deaths due to the current inclement weather was due to lightning strikes. This was also due to people not adhering to warnings by the government. But we were able to keep the number of victims to a minimal due to the readiness of the government and the security forces.
We have also increased compensations. During the time I served in the previous government, compensation for the loss of life was a mere Rs. 15,000, but now, we it has been increased to 100,000. Previously compensation for the loss of a house was only Rs. 100,000, but we have currently increased that to Rs. 2.5 million for some cases. We assess the extent of damage prior to determining compensation, Minister Amaraweera said.
Previously, the compensation paid to a fishermen who were lost at sea was only Rs. 100,000, but under the current government, it had been increased to Rs. 1 million. All those engaged in the fisheries sector had been protected by the said insurance scheme provided free-of-charge.
We have also increased the insurance paid to farmers to Rs. 40,000 per hectare. Next year, 5,000 tanks will be renovated not only to assist agriculture, but to hold flood waters as well, Amaraweera added.
Government project procedures, misguided: Bimal
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Bimal Rathnayake said orders had been issued under the National Environmental Act, but what was more important, was its implementation. Although the country had been experiencing floods during the past few years, the government had failed to provide basic disaster relief measures so far, he said.
Boats have not been provided to certain areas. There are certain areas that are prone to flooding even during a minor downpour, yet district secretaries of those areas do not possess boats to be used during such a situation. The government makes comments regarding landslides only when they occur. They are sending SMS alerts and warnings, but nothing is being done to evacuate the people at risk, he added.
Rathnayake made these comments during a debate on several orders and the Environmental Act relating to the ban on polythene and forest reserves in Parliament, yesterday.
Focussing on the Port City project, Rathnayake said 16 million cubes of stones were required for the project, adding that it had created environmental issues.
When this government came into power, they stopped the project, claiming that it lacked a proper environmental assessment report. But now, it is in progress and there are 12 quarries within a limited area that are supplying the stones required for the project, violating all permit specifications, he said.
The government is following a wrong formula and thinks that trees could be cut, forests destroyed and rains could be induced using modern technology. The blue-green economy is currently in the process of destroying the only mountain range in the Colombo district. According to the specifications stipulated on the permits issued to stone quarries, only 55 tipper loads can be issued per day, but currently, there are over 200 tipper loads of stones being obtained per day, the MP said.
Rathnayake added that the Wilpattu National Park should be protected from those who are destroying it while hiding behind racial claims.
We are against this. There are others who are ignoring the issues in their districts and raising issues about Wilpattu in an attempt to ignite racial tension. However, it is a fact that there is environmental damage being done to the Wilpattu National Park, he said.
Even those who had not lost their lands had been provided lands at Wilpattu; this was stated in the Audit Report. Around 650 hectares had been cleared within the Wilpattu National Park, where 169 houses had been constructed. However, less than 10 percent of the said persons are currently living there, Rathnayake added.
Parliament nod for polythene ban
Parliament yesterday approved orders under the National Environment Act relating to the ban on polythene items which came into force in January, this year.
Several Gazettes Extraordinary issued by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister on September 1, 2017, were approved in Parliament following a full-day debate.
Gazettes Extraordinary prohibit manufacture, sale, offer for sale, offer free-of-charge, exhibition or use of polythene or any polythene product that are 20 microns or below, lunch sheets, grocery bags, food containers (lunch boxes), plates, cups, and spoons from expanded polystyrene.
They also prohibit the use of all forms of polythene for decorative purposes at political, social, religious, national, cultural or any other event or occasion. Furthermore, open-burning of refuse and other combustible materials inclusive of plastics, had also been prohibited. Parliament also approved another Gazette Extraordinary to declare Warathenna-Hakkinda in Kandy containing 59.4 hectares, as an Environmental Protection Area.
Illegal forest-clearing continues unabated in North: Devananda
Illegal forest-clearing is being carried out at an alarming rate in the North, but authorities have failed to take action in order to prevent it, United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Douglas Devananda alleged in Parliament, yesterday.
Forwarding a question under the Standing Order 27 (2) to President Maithripala Sirisena, who was the subject Environment Minister, MP Devananda said forest lands in Vavuniya, Mannar and Mullaitivu were depleting because of the illegal felling of trees.
He said it had aggravated the water scarcity in the area, adding that residents had complained that public officials, who should have taken action against the offenders of such illegal activities, were supporting them. He urged to implement the law against such offenders and to take immediate measures to protest the clearing of forest lands in the North. Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilaka, replying to the question on behalf of the President and the government, said circulars had been issued to curtail illegal forest-clearing in the North and that orders had been given to not release any land without the approval of the National Committee.
Reading out the answer sent from the Environment Ministry, Karunathilaka further said the Forest Conservation Department and Air Force were jointly conducting aerial surveillance to monitor the activities taking place in forests in the North. He said a flying squad had also been set up for special raids. Referring to the statistics, the minister said 40 incidents of land-grabbing and 58 illegal felling of trees had been reported in forest lands in Vavuniya, while seven incidents of land-grabbing and 42 incidents of illegal felling of trees had been reported in forest lands in Mannar, last year.
Rajapaksas should reveal US citizenship renunciation documents
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former Minister Basil Rajapaksa should reveal as to whether they had applied to cancel their US citizenships, UNP backbench MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe said. Speaking at a debate in Parliament yesterday, the MP pointed out that the citizenship cancellation process was complex in the US, and that it could take about six months to two years.
Before giving hopes on contesting for future elections, they should notify the country as to whether they have applied to cancel their US citizenships, he said. He made these comments with reference to the Viyath Maga campaign of the former Defence Secretary. Dual citizens are disqualified from contesting the elections as per the prevailing law.

Presidential puzzle
In a unique first in Sri Lankas political history, the elections of 2020, still over one and a half years away, has already begun to take centre stage in Sri Lankas political debate. Never before has it been this way. We were not focused on the 1982 presidential election during mid-1980, nor focused on the 1988 presidential election in mid-1986, nor was there much talk in 1992 about the presidential polls of 1994 but since 2017 political actors seem focused on the presidential polls, still quite some distance away.
It was former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson who in 1964 famously coined the phrase, a week is a long time in politics. However, we have Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and the newly appointed General Secretary of the UNP stating that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe would be the UNP presidential candidate, while the SLFP and UPFA General Secretaries also state that President Sirisena will be the SLFP presidential candidate and very recently former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has emerged as the standard bearer of the Rajapaksa comeback project and essentially launched his public exploration of a presidential bid, if not the bid itself at a corporate fat cat white collar event at that most elitist of elite venues and newest five star hotel, the Shangri-La. No not the one in Hambanthota but in Colombo. However, this article is not about the relative prospects of these possible future candidates but the merits of the elected highest public office itself, to which they are probable candidates.
JVP introduces the 20th Amendment to the Constitution
The JVP, the fourth largest party in Parliament with six seats, behind the UNP, the UPFA and the TNA have introduced the 20th Amendment to the constitution, as a private members bill to abolish the office of executive president. Now abolishing the office of the executive president is not a new debate or idea in Sri Lanka. It was first proposed almost twenty-five years ago in 1994, by then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who famously referred to the 1978 second Republican Constitution as a bahubootha constitution. To her credit, the draft constitution of August 2000, (which was just eight votes short of the two-thirds majority of the then parliament), abolished the office of executive president.
Fast forward to 2014 and the Common Candidate and now President, Maithripala Sirisena, repeatedly pledged to be a one-term president by abolishing the office of executive president. Upon being elected in 2015, an interim measure to curtail its powers, occurred through the 19th Amendment to the constitution, was steered through Parliament by the President. So, the abolition of the executive presidency has been very much an SLFP driven, Presidents Kumaratunga and Sirisena led effort to abolish the elected dictatorship which is the office of Sri Lankas executive Head of State.
The UNP were late converts to the abolishing of the presidency school of thought, not least perhaps because the 1978 Constitution was the UNPs baby. However, the political heirs of both UNP presidents, JR Jayewardene and R. Premadasa, namely Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe and UNP Deputy Leader and Senior Cabinet Minister Sajith Premadasa have both endorsed the abolishing of the executive presidency on numerous occasions and the UNP specifically as a party did so, during its constitutional reforms public consultations process and proposed reforms in 2013/2014. So, the UNP as a party has also backed the abolition of the executive presidency.
Equally importantly during the 2015 presidential election campaign then President Rajapaksa, sensing that his opponent Maithripala Sirisena was gaining traction and momentum and attributing at least some of it, to the pledge to abolish the executive presidency, also joined the bandwagon by promising to abolish the same. So, all of Sri Lankas major political actors have in recent times, within this current electoral cycle and public mandate wowed to abolish the executive presidency and the people have backed this proposal through their popular mandate.
Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera and the constitutional reform process
Civil society played a catalytic and large role in the election of President Sirisena and none were more influential or catalytical than the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha thera, chief incumbent of the Kotte Naga Viharaya and his national movement for a just society (NMJS). In fact, the NMJS and other civil society organisations in 2015, were adamant that following the presidential elections of January 2015, the priority was not the dissolution of parliament and the holding of fresh elections was not the priority but that rather the constitutional reforms process was the real priority.
The result was the 19th Amendment to the constitution which basically overturned the horrendous Rajapakse era 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which sought to solidify Rajapaksa rule for life.
Since the General Elections of August 2015, Sri Lankas parliament unanimously voted to turn itself into a constitutional council and draft a constitution. While the interim report was presented and debated, the all-party steering committee of the constitutional council has not presented a final report in the form of a draft constitution, like the Peoples Alliance, under President Kumaratunga did in August 2000.
Instead, the focus of those working on constitutional reform has now become to explore the commonality and the political spaces for the consensus which does exist and seek to implement the same. Accordingly, it is believed that most if not all political leaders and opinion leaders are in agreement to abolish the said office.
For Mahinda Rajapaksa, it gets rid of the two-term limit imposed on him for the presidency, while for President Sirisena, it is fulfilment of a solemn election promise, while for Ranil Wickremesinghe it is bringing the political game to the arena in which he excels, that of Parliament and the premiership, in which now in his fourth term in that office, he has passed Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who served three terms as Prime Minister.
For the JVP, it demonstrates that they box above their weight class in influencing national policy and contributing to the reform agenda, while for the TNA it kick-starts the seemingly stalled constitutional reform process and makes Sri Lanka more democratic, a conducive environment for everybody, human rights and freedoms and not just only minority rights. Sections, but not all of the Joint Opposition (JO) have sounded their disagreement over the proposal, but there are sufficient consensuses without them and the JO is divided over the issue.
The Yahapalanaya national government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who was elected on a platform of bold political reforms, should use the reform space, gift wrapped and given on a platter by the JVP to bring about the abolishment of the executive presidency, which has been long promised but slow in coming. Now is the time to deliver.

Priyanka or Katrina for 'Krrish' 
Rakesh Roshan has already announced his plans to release his Indian superhero film Krrish 4 in December 2020. Sr Roshan and Hrithik Roshan have also selected a script for the same. Now, according to latest reports, the makers are considering Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif to play the female lead of the film. A source reveals that Priyankas character is already there in the film and there is no need to make any changes. However, if the makers bring any other actress on board, the script might need some modifications. Also, the makers can accommodate two actresses in the film, like in the last film of the franchise where both Priyanka and Kangana Ranaut were seen in pivotal roles.
Priyanka has worked with Jr Roshan in the superhero franchise while Katrina was paired opposite him in Zindagi Milegi Naa Dobara. Last year, Katrina had refuted the reports of being approached for Krrish 4 while suggesting that the franchise should also have a superheroine part in it. TNN

Prof. Ricardo Hausmann,Director of the Center for International Development and Professor of the Practice of Economic Development at the John F Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University visited BOI and addressed staff of the Board.
The Professor was accompanied by other staff members from Harvard University. Prof. Ricardo Hausmann was introduced to the staff by Duminda Ariyasinghe, Director General of BOI. The BOI Director General spoke about the introduction of new systems at the Board to facilitate Foreign Direct investments into the country. Ariyasinghe also briefed the visiting scholar on BOI setting up 10 new teams to research and promote investments in specific industries or sectors. He also spoke of a focus on promoting reinvestments by existing investors in Sri Lanka.
Prof. Ricardo Haussmann began by stating that he was excited to hear about new opportunities and challengesthat the BOI is undergoing.
He identified Sri Lankas main problem as the inability to move from the production of comparatively simple products such as apparel into technologically more advanced sectors.
The success of countries such as Vietnam was their capacity to move from apparel to sectors such as electronics and machinery production, even though they had stated with apparel production at the same time as Sri Lanka.
Consequently FDI did not contribute in a major way towards the growth of theSri Lankaneconomy since it amounts currently just 11/2% of the GDP whilst in countries such as Vietnam, Singapore, FDI had grown to represent as much as 5 to 6% of the GDP.
Prof. Haussmann spoke of a need to allocate more land for industrial development and noted that until very recently there had not been any significant effort to develop new industrial zones in Sri Lanka.
Another important aspect was that Prof. Hausmann linked immigration to economic development. He told the BOI staff that a restrictive immigration policy would not favour development since this would shut out many skilled persons from overseas from contributing to the countrys development.
Currently there were just 10,000 foreign workers in the country or approximately one person out of 540. This is in contract with Australia where 27% of the population is of foreign origin. However, Prof. Hausmann said that while there are lessons that can be learnt from examples overseas, each country was distinctive and like a skilledtailor it was necessary to develop for Sri Lanka a tailor made suit that would fitthe country perfectly.
BOI staff also conducted power point presentations for Prof. Hausmann. The first conducted by Mahinda Ramanayake, Executive Director (Investor Services) described the efforts undertaken to encourage existing investors to reinvest, andutilize the networks of existing investors.
Thereafter steps are taken to identify suppliers and partners of existing investors in Sri Lanka and encourage the latter to establish themselves in the country as new projects. Some results had been achieved with regard to companies from Europe already established in Sri Lanka.
BOI also conducted 3 presentations on target sectors including food processing, Mineral products and export services. Responding to the presentations Prof. Hausmann stated that it was very important to understand not just successes but also challengesor even failures that one faced. For example in Japan, Hausmann noted, managers who identified that a project faced challenges were highly regarded and concerted efforts were made to correct whatever shortcoming that may exist.
Hausmann also added that the nature of a Zones projected future industries would determine the best possible location for it. For example Logistics zones would be largely dependent on proximity to a port or airport, while certain types of industries would not require that. The Professor also said that the existence of deposits of mineral resources in a country does not necessarily mean that an advanced industry can be built around this resource. For exampleAustralia exports bauxite which is found in abundance in that countrybut has not gone into the production of Aluminium because of itsprohibitive energy cost.
Prof. Hausmann saw logistics as a sector that offers considerable opportunities however, to function effectively; the many approvals and problems that the industry may face ought to be also addressed to ensure that the sector operates in a smooth manner.
Prof. Hausmann also commented on the automobile industry and saw the proximity of Indias automobile industry in Chennai as a potential opportunity for Sri Lankas own objective to develop a home grown automotive industry.

Protecting the distressed
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara, it is reported, has issued instructions to the police to deal severely with looters who may take advantage of the prevailing situation brought about by the inclement weather where thousands have been displaced and taken refuge in make shift shelters in several parts of the country. He has noted while Sri Lankans are generally prepared to assist others in times of need there are also unscrupulous elements who target abandoned homes and wait for an opportunity to loot the valuable belongings of the victims. Although Sri Lankans are known for their generosity and helpfulness, there are also a few who disgrace the rest by taking advantage of perilous situations. He said he has instructed all police stations to entertain complaints about such thefts, round the clock.
The minister should be commended for taking cognizance of this aspect of the loss that will be suffered by the displaced flood victims which will be tantamount to the well worn Sinhala idiom gahen vetune minihata gona enna vagey, the man who fell from the tree being gored by the bull. As the minister noted, Sri Lankans, in general, are quick to respond to the distress calls of their brethren. This is notwithstanding the barriers of race and religion. This was amply on display during the sad episode of Black July where some Sinhalese even risked their own lives in giving protection to the fleeing Tamils. Even in the recent anti-Muslim flare up in Kandy many were the members of the majority community, and even the Sangha, who went out of their way to protect and grant solace to the victims. However, the shameful actions of a few, negated all the good work and cast a pall over all the Sinhalese. This was the case in the aftermath of the 83 anti-Tamil riots, which blackened the image of the entire nation.
The vultures were active even during the Tsunami catastrophe with stories circulating how gold rings were yanked out of the fingers of the dead victims. This, while thousands went to the rescue of the stricken, even placing their own lives in peril, as in the case of July 83.
Now that the minister has issued the necessary orders to the police he should go a step further and consider affording protection to the abandoned homes, wherever possible. This is because in the chaotic situation in the flood affected areas and the distressed states of mind of the victims, concerns about the fate of their possessions and belongings will be furthest from the minds of these hapless people. Besides, they will not be in a position to know if their homes were looted or not, being confined to temporary shelters.
True, the police are having their hands full in the disaster hit areas focusing their attention on the distressed .In such a situation they may not be able to summon the required manpower to provide security to the homes of the victims. They can overcome this by organising groups of vigilantes from the affected areas itself who may know all the suspicious characters.
The victims should not be allowed to suffer further distress, or a double blow, by failure to take adequate precautions to protect their belongings. Steps should also be taken to facilitate their speedy return to their homes once the flood waters subside. Here too the police could be of help.
Be that as it may, the authorities should prepare themselves adequately to deal with the aftermath of the latest flood disaster. Floods naturally bring in its wake diseases. There is already a red alert for dengue, with many districts badly affected. Adequate medical personnel should be deployed in the affected areas to prevent a spread of the epidemic. Sufficient medical stocks too should be dispatched without delay. All possible assistance should be obtained from whatever quarter to ensure the well being of the victims.
In this respect the JVP should be commended for cancelling a protest planned for last Monday in order to help out the flood victims. Hopefully the example of the rathu sahodharayas will be followed by some Trade Unions, planning strikes, at this hour of strife for thousands of their countrymen.
Waiting for Godot
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for a debate on the latter's statements pertaining to the country's debt burden, during a media conference on the occasion of his completing one year as FM, on Tuesday. Disputing the figures and arguments presented by MR in this regard, Samaraweera dared the former President to face him directly in a public debate instead of issuing statements prepared by others to the media.
This is not the first occasion that Rajapaksa is being challenged for a public debate. During the Presidential Election campaign in 2005 a similar challenge was made by his opponent Ranil Wickremesinghe, though not on the country's debt burden, but in the tradition of Presidential candidates in the more mature democracies.
Needless to say, Mahinda Rajapaksa chickened out.
Hence, Minister Samaraweera should not be holding his breath waiting for Rajapaksa to enter the ring.
It will be like waiting for Godot.

Renown SC launches high profile soccer academy
Renown SC, one of the leading football clubs in Sri Lanka will launch their second Academy on June 1 at the Race Course Ground.
Unlike their present free academy which is targeted towards the local community and player development for the club, the purpose of the new academy, a paid model is to raise the profile of Sri Lankan football and establish a new generation of players who are technically efficient and comfortable with the game from a young age.
Children of the 6 - 16 age group will be taught basic to advanced skills in the academy. The target is to improve the players technically, tactically, physically and psychologically with individual attention to each and every player.
Evaluation charts will be maintained to monitor the progress of every child. They will be coached by a team of AFC (Asian Football Confederation) licensed coaches. Some of them are former national players, while others have excelled in the club circle.
In future foreign coaches will be brought in to train the players in the academy. A spoksman from the academy further stated: This Academy was almost 2 years in the making as we had collaborated with several major academies and football clubs in Europe as well as in Asia to implement their coaching methods.
We have also taken feedback from several past coaches and players to identify the deficiencies of Sri Lankan players. We will be implementing European Academy coaching method and style of play customized to suit the physical attributes of Sri Lankan children.
The fees will be reasonable and we will give full or partial scholarships for exceptional players as well. We have also started training our coaches first before they teach the children so that they are familiar with the coaching methods. In the long term we have several plans for the Academy. Annual football festivals will be held to raise the profile of football so that more children will take up football in future. Select academy players and teams will be sent to participate in international training camps and competitions".
Renown SC established more than 40 years ago by the Peiris brothers have won the local Champions League and F.A. Cup competitions several times. They were the first Sri Lankan football team to win an international competition which they achieved by winning the President of Maldives Invitational Soccer Cup (POMIS Cup) in 1985.
They have represented Sri Lanka in several Asian club competitions and in the Asian Cup Winners Cup tournament they beat the premier team in India, East Bengal F.C. in the 2nd round and reached the pre-quarter final stage of the competition which was open to all club teams in Asia including clubs from Japan, South Korea and Middle East countries.

Saudis $500 billion mega-city NEOM is  attracting overwhelming investors
With ambitious plans to transform its economy as part of the crown princes Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is hoping to boost foreign direct investment (FDI).
It hopes ambitious mega projects like the futuristic city of NEOM will attract FDI.
With ambitious plans to transform its economy as part of the crown princes Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is hoping to boost foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country as it embarks on a post-oil era and ambitious mega projects like the futuristic city of NEOM.
Ibrahim Al-Omar, governor of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA), said foreign direct investment (FDI) was growing in Saudi Arabia.
Official figures from the World Bank show FDI net inflows were $7.453 billion in 2016 while net outflows were $8.936 in the same year.
Since then, however, Saudi Arabias Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has appeared to take the reigns on transforming the economy and society by introducing a raft of liberalizing reforms.
An anti-corruption purge led by the crown prince last year caused concern among some business leaders, but Al-Omar said foreign investment was now growing, but didnt give more detail.
We have seen a growth for foreign investment  about 50 percent comparing the first quarter this year to the same period last year. Also, the (FDI) inflows we have seen about 40 percent, Al-Omar told CNBCs Hadley Gamble as she hosted a session on the Saudi Arabian FDI landscape at the Gateway Gulf investment forum in Bahrain.
Saudi Arabia was ready to help businesses set up in the country and SAGIA was working with government entities to support and incentivize foreign investment, Al-Omar said.
The country also wanted to improve its business environment and ranking on the World Banks ease of doing business index  it is currently at number 92 in the index of 190 countries.
We have a target to be number 20 in the rankings of the ease of doing business by 2020. We are working with the World Bank and best practice across the world and we have identified over 400 reforms. Today, we have achieved about 40 percent of them, he said.
Al-Omars comments come at an inflection point for Saudi Arabia as it, and its neighbors, try to wean themselves off oil as a main driver of the economy.
Economic sustainability has become something of a mantra for countries trying to invest in other sectors and infrastructure, as well as attract foreign investment into those areas, as a bid to weather future declines in oil prices.
Saudi Arabias economic transformation strategy, the much-vaunted Vision 2030 thats being driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aims to increase FDI into Saudi Arabia from 3.8 percent to the international level of 5.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
Promoting the kingdom as a nation thats open for business, the strategy also aims for Saudi to rise from its current position of 25 to the top 10 countries on the Global Competitiveness Index. In addition, Vision 2030 aims to increase the private sectors contribution from 40 percent to 65 percent of GDP.
Overwhelming interest in NEOM
The $500 billion industrial zone of NEOM is one of Saudi Arabias mega-projects that it hopes will bring in billions from foreign investors. The ambitious 26,500 square kilometer business zone will link Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan and is envisaged as a futuristic hub for both industry and citizens. It aims to embrace digital technologies and services to make the city a major commercial location in the Middle East.
NEOMs Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld told the audience at the Gateway Gulf forum on Thursday that the project was attracting massive interest from foreign investors.
The investment case for NEOM is actually very easy to make, because weve got so many things going for us, he said during the FDI panel, adding that the interest in partnering with Saudi Arabia in the creation of NEOM was overwhelming.
Weve had a huge amount of interest and were talking to a lot of companies that are at the forefront of technologies wanting to partner with us and try out things in NEOM... On the technological side, a lot of people look at it as a place where they think they can try a lot of things out.
Officials hope a privatization program, including the sale of 5 percent of oil giant Saudi Aramco, will raise $300 billion to help fund the creation of NEOM, which is under construction, and that more money will be invested by the private sector.
In a bid to remove bureaucratic and legislative obstacles that could deter businesses, Kleinfeld said the crown prince had specifically instructed that regulations be written in the most business-friendly and future-orientated way as possible. The project is estimated to take between 30 to 50 years to complete, however, with the first phase due by 2025.
And the $500 billion, were not going to spend it all tomorrow and, quite frankly, a lot of it will come from private investments, Kleinfeld said. But what Im seeing today is that the interest in partnering is overwhelming.
Kleinfeld said that key concepts for NEOM, such as mobility around the city, were still being explored and there there are gazillions of players that are willing to help and willing to invest in that, he said.

Single Employment Law to be introduced
The Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry plans to introduce a Single Employment Law instead of Acts and Ordinances, which are presently put in practise, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
Under this plan, a new Employment Law will be implemented instead of several laws and ordinances, such as, the Wages Board Ordinance, Shop and Office Employees Act, Maternity Benefit Ordinance, Factories Ordinance and so on. A Cabinet paper will be submitted in this regard, he said.
When the Minister was asked whether the benefits and privileges utilised or enjoyed by employees by now will be curtailed by the new Single Employees Act, he said that the benefits enjoyed at present will not be reduced or curtailed with the implementation of new Act.
In order to address the condition of work, the new Employment Law will be introduced by the amalgamation of several laws such as the Shop and Office Employees Act, Wages Board Ordinance, Maternity Benefit Ordinance and Womens, Young Persons and Children Act. In the future there will be a single law to protect the working community. It is significant that a non-discriminatory provision will be included to the law. As a result of the non-discriminatory provision there wont be any discrimination such as gender, caste or religion in the future, the Minister said.
He further said they plan to introduce some flexible working arrangements without sacrificing the rights of the working class.
The Minister further added that there will be provisions in future to look into domestic workers, which are not covered by any law by now. At present, there is no provision of any law that covers domestic workers such as house maids.

SoftBank confirms selling entire stake in Flipkart to Walmart
Japans SoftBank has decided to sell its over 20 % stake in e-commerce major Flipkart to US retailer Walmart for an estimated $ 4 billion. SoftBank confirms the sale of its entire stake in Flipkart to Walmart, a SoftBank spokesperson said.
The company is estimated to rake in about $ 4 billion from the sale.
The move by SoftBank ends nearly two weeks of suspense over whether the Japanese telecom and Internet powerhouse would exit or stay invested in Flipkart post the deal with Walmart.
Walmart had, on May 9, announced that it will pay about $16 billion to buy about 77 % stake in Flipkart. While significant shareholders in the Bengaluru-based company d eBay had agreed to sell their shares, SoftBank had not taken a final call.
A statement issued by Walmart on May 9 had identified Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, Tencent Holdings Ltd, Tiger Global Management LLC and Microsoft Corp as those who would continue to be investors in Flipkart.
However, SoftBank took more time to arrive at its decision taking into account several factors including the tax that it would have to pay on profits it would earn from such share sale.
SoftBank had invested $ 2.5 billion in Flipkart last year.
On May 9, hours before Walmart was scheduled to announce the Flipkart acquisition, SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son told during an investor call on his companys earnings that Walmart had agreed to buy a controlling stake in the Indian e-commerce company.
He had gone on to state that the $ 2.5 billion investment made by the Japanese company through its Vision Fund into Flipkart was worth about $ 4 billion in the latest deal.

Emirates commenced its Ramadan service for customers during the holy month, on May 17. Emirates Ramadan service consists of specially crafted iftar meals on board, relevant programming on its ice inflight entertainment system, and the distribution of dates and water on the ground for those breaking their fast.
Emirates provides iftar boxes with a nutritional meal for customers breaking their fast on board. The boxes have been redesigned this year by local homeware specialists Silsal Design House.
The designs are inspired by the Middle East, its people, places and culture. Silsal has also created bespoke Emirates Arabic Coffee Cups available at the Emirates Official Stores.
The iftar boxes include couscous salad and grilled chicken or moudardara and roasted chicken, sandwiches, spinach fatayer or tomato and onion fatayer, assorted sweets, dates, laban and water.
These special meals will be available to passengers across all cabin classes on select Emirates flights that coincide with iftar times. This includes flights to and from the Gulf region as well as flights catering to Umrah groups travelling to Jeddah and Medina during the month of Ramadan. During the holy month, cold meals will be served in lieu of a hot one on all flights to Jeddah and Medina, including Umrah day flights.
Emirates utilises a unique tool to calculate the correct timings for imsak (the time to commence fasting) and iftar while in-flight. It calculates the exact Ramadan timings using the aircrafts longitude, latitude and altitude; ensuring the greatest level of accuracy possible while on board.
When the sun sets, passengers will be informed of the iftar time by the captain. This tool was developed to supplement the Ramadan timetable, available on every flight.
Date boxes, symbolic of Ramadan, and water will also be provided at boarding gates allowing customers to break their fast prior to boarding, or while boarding at Emirates hub in Dubai International Airport Terminal 3 and other selected Emirates destinations.
Emirates lounges in the airport provide dedicated prayer rooms and will also be serving Arabic coffee, dates and sweets.

No referees to be assigned until  spectator discipline is instilled
Sports Minister puts  a halt to schools rugby
Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha has taken a stern stand to eradicate spectator misbehaviour at schools rugby matches and given a directive to temporarily suspend the ongoing schools tournament until the issue is resolved and discipline instilled.
A media release from the Sports Ministry states:
Consequent to the recent incidents spectators have taken the law into their own hands which has resulted in threats to the safety of referees, spectators and players.
This is seen as a threat to the reputation of schools rugby. Consequent to the discussions I had with SLR & Referees Association it was decided no referee will be permitted at the ongoing school tournaments until a discussion is held with SLR, SLSRFR, Schools Association, Education Department and School Authorities to resolve this issue and instil discipline in rugby.
The Sports Ministers reaction comes following a spate of spectator-related unruly incidents that has taken place at school games involving Wesley College and Royal College, Maliyadeva College vs S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia and Science College vs D. S. Senanayake last week in the Singer schools league rugby tournament.
Thus the Inter-Schools Singer A and B Division league rugby Cup and Plate tournament matches along with the Bowl, Shield and Division II games will be postponed by a week with immediate effect.
Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) president Ranjith Chandarasekara told the Daily News: After the meeting that took place between the schools following the advice from the Minister, all matches for this week in the league will be postponed. We will once again meet with all 16 schools both A and B Division principals, masters in charges on Friday to discuss matters to educate all parties to move forward without any problems. Schools Rugby will most probably resume next week on June 2.

Sri Lanka at Hyundai Archery World Cup
Sri Lankas Nipun Sangeeth Seneviratne is clearly enjoying himself on the Antalya competition field  and would likely win the prize for most distinctive mane of hair at the competition.
Seeing Sri Lanka field a full recurve mens team is one of the more unexpected sights in an Antalya fixture that has seen all the big archery nations send a squad.
This is Sri Lankas first-ever trip with a team to a stage of the Hyundai Archery World Cup.
The last time a full, three-athlete squad from the island went to a major tournament was in 2011, for the World Archery Championships, although a handful of individuals have represented the nation on the circuit over the years. Like many other athletes in Antalya, the Sri Lankans are gearing up to represent their country at the Asian Games  but there are bigger plans, too.
Were working out how we are going to get to the Olympics, said Sajeev de Silva. And that includes more Hyundai Archery World Cup events.
Its not confirmed yet. Well see how we get on with this competition.
There are between 300 and 500 archers in Sri Lanka. About 10 of those shoot over 600 points for the 72-arrow 70-metre qualifying round regularly, and maybe five who can hit scores above 630.
The three-strong team in Antalya is coached by player-manager Indraneth Perera, an archer taking a break.
Sri Lanka is currently advertising for a full-time recurve coach; their best archers have also been out to Kim Hyung Taks training centre in Korea for a week-long camp.
De Silva was the only one of the three to make the cut in Antalya. The team finished 29th.
Not quite as well as we were hoping, said Seneviratne. But I suppose were not here often enough.
Thats not a good excuse, of course. Were well down on our personal bests, but theres room for improvement.
Its a long road to competing on the world stage, but one that Sri Lanka has started.
We arent worried. Because we know we can shoot three tens. Weve all done it.
And it looks like this team will enjoy the journey.
The second stage of the Hyundai Archery World Cup began in Antalya on May 20 and will continue till May 26.

Sri Lanka, key partner with China in Belt  and Road Initiative  Chinese envoy
China is willing to help support Sri Lankas economic development because of shared historical ties and suffering under foreign imperialism with the island an important partner in the Belt and Road Initiative which combines the aspirations of both countries, Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan said yesterday.
China supported Sri Lankas post-war reconstruction when others ignored her needs and Chinese companies have completed more than US$15 billion infrastructure projects in the island, he told a symposium hosted by the Chinese Embassy.
As one of the first countries to openly support the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Sri Lanka is an important partner with China in the Belt and Road Initiative joint construction, he said.
Sri Lanka has a superior geographical location and a broad development prospect, he said at the seminar which was on the theme From Millennium to the New Era: Jointly Build the Belt and Road and Embrace the Sri Lankan Dream.
The Sri Lankan dream of national progress, economic development, ethnic amity and religious harmony is consistent with the aims of BRI, Ambassador Cheng said.
In the past few years, whenever the island was hit by natural disasters, China would always provide emergency humanitarian aid such as rice, relief cash and housing for the affected, he said.
Besides, infrastructure such as roads, railways and ports have also been much improved with Chinese assistance in the last decade.
Why is China willing to help Sri Lanka Ambassador Cheng asked, giving three main reasons.
Firstly, China and Sri Lanka have a history of friendly exchanges for over a thousand years and China gave steady support to help Sri Lanka end its terrorism threat and also stepped in during the post-war years when support from elsewhere was lacking, he said.
When standing trembling on the war ruins, Sri Lanka called for urgent support from the international community to rebuild this beautiful country, but surprisingly found that most countries choose to remain silent and watch the situation with folded arms.
At this critical moment, it was China once again that stood up with open arms for sri Lanka and participated comprehensively and deeply in the post-war reconstruction of the country.
By end-2017, Chinese companies had completed more than US$15 billion infrastructure projects in Si Lanka in transportation, water, electricity, ports and other fields and made great contributions to the economic and social development of the country, Ambassador Cheng said.
These include the Norochcholai power station, which provides about 40% of the countrys electricity supply, the Katunayake Expressway, the Colombo International Container Terminal and the Moragahakanda reservoir, Sri Lankas biggest.
China is also helping build section 1 of the Southern Railway and the extension of the Southern Expressway which will give a strong impetus to the development of the south.
The construction of the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port and Industrial Park are expected to become new, powerful engines for Sri Lankas economic take-off, Ambassador Cheng said.
Our pragmatic co-operation has created more than 100,000 jobs for Sri Lanka, trained tens of thousands of technical and management personnel, he said.
Another reason for Chinese support for Sri Lanka was that both countries suffered under foreign imperialism and colonialism which enable both to empathise with each others fate and understand each other.
Therefore, whenever Sri Lanka is facing a major opportunity for national development, China is willing to do its utmost to help Sri Lanka, Ambassador Cheng said.
The third reason was that the Belt and Road Initiative combines the Chinese Dream and Sri Lankan dream together in the New Era, which makes us join hands and move forward with each other.

State minister gives evidence in fraud case

Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake yesterday gave evidence before Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in connection with a fraud in which he allegedly incurred a loss of Rs 1.69 million, in 2012.
The Fraud Investigation Bureau had filed the chargesheet against Mohamed Musahir Misroom for defrauding Senanayake of Rs 1.69 million in a transaction of scrap iron in a factory that belonged to the state minister.
The state minister, giving evidence during the trial before the Colombo Fort Magistrate, said that he purchased an old BOI-approved shoe factory at an auction by a private bank. He added that there was a bulk of scrap iron inside the factory and he instructed his secretary Hussain Mohamed Husadin to sell it. The minister also said that his secretary had assigned the matter to Mohamed Musahir Misroom.
State Minister Senanayake submitted further that the suspect Misroom had sold the scrap iron but did not pay his due  Rs. 1.69. Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne postponed the trial for August 28.

Toxic pesticide use reduced
The use of pesticides with high toxicity has been reduced in Sri Lanka in the past few years due to the awareness programmes conducted by the Agriculture Department, its sources said.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the Agriculture Department is currently conducting a programme to discourage the use of pesticides with high toxicity. As a result, the use of pesticides with very low toxicity has increased in the country.
According to the statistics of the Office of the Registrar of Pesticides, around 40 varieties of pesticides with high toxicity had been used in the country in 2002 and it had reduced by 98 percent. Only one such pesticide is currently being used in Sri Lanka.
Around 187 pesticides with a medium toxicity level had been registered in 2002. Only 133 such pesticides were registered in 2016. Around 88 pesticides with low toxicity had been registered in 2002 and it had increased to 168 this year. Around 115 pesticides with very low toxicity had been registered in 2002 and it had increased to 162 this year.

Trained Sri Lankan  workers leave for Japan
The first Sri Lankan batch of trained workers left for Japan yesterday after meeting with Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure minister Harin Fernando.
Accordingly, two trained Sri Lankans departed for Japan after receiving extensive residential training at Ratnapura. This programme is a joint collaboration with the IM Japan Company.
Minister Harin Fernando said this project is conducted by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment free of charge. There is a popular hoax that contractors and agents who ask for money in return for providing jobs in Japan and we urge the public not to be deceived. Only an N4 level proficiency of the Japanese language is needed, the Minister said.
We already face issues with untrained workers in the Middle East who undergo many hardships. However, this programme conducted with Japanese collaboration creates an opportunity for us to send trained workers. The basic monthly salary the workers would receive will be 146,000 Yen. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment has already established residential training centers at Ratnapura and Tangalle, Minister Fernando said.
Any citizen of the country between the ages of 18 to 30 with an N4 level or higher language proficiency of Japanese is eligible to work in Japan. The Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Foreign Employment Bureau of Japan and IM Japan Company offers unlimited job opportunities in Japan in the nursing sector. The applicants must spend 13 years in school while an Advanced Level examination qualification is not compulsory. The applicants should also not be less than 5 feet in height and should possess strong sight. If an applicant satisfies these requirements he/she will be provided four months residential training in Japanese language proficiency, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Deputy General Mnager Mangala Randeniya said.
He further stated that the trained workers will have to work for three years on contract basis with the possibility of extending the period for another two years. If a worker wishes to return to the country and start an investment of their own, the Japanese company would fund that investment up to 1 million yen.

Truth through Lies
When it comes to the belief writers are neurotic, shy individuals who have precious little to say except when they are writing their amazing masterpieces, Nobel laureate John Coetzee fits the bill perfectly. He is known to be a recluse who avoids publicity so much so that he did not even show up to collect either of his two Booker Awards. As South African writer Rian Malan says
Coetzee is a man of almost monkish self-discipline and dedication. He does not drink, smoke, or eat meat. He cycles vast distances to keep fit and spends at least an hour at his writing-desk each morning, seven days a week. A colleague who has worked with him for more than a decade claims to have seen him laugh just once. An acquaintance has attended several dinner parties where Coetzee has uttered not a single word.
He did turn up, though, to receive the Nobel Prize in 2003. Not to make a speech but to read out a short story, a strange, allusive tale called He and His Man, seemingly about Robinson Crusoe and Daniel Defoe, but really about doubles, about a character and his creator, a recluse and his busy, worldly reflection; how they were close, yet could never meet. Critics later observed Coetzees Nobel performance itself was a sort of doubling. Here you see J.M Coetzee, the silver-haired old fellow who joins you for dinner, it seemed to say. Yet that isnt the Coetzee you are giving a prize to; you are giving a prize to Coetzee the writer, who perforce cannot be here. I shall read you some of his work.
This revelation brings to mind Dostoyevskys short novel The Double, where a clerk finds himself edged out of society by another man identical to him in every aspect except that he is popular and clubbable. Heres the writer standing back and watching the grotesque spectacle of himself being successful in public, him and yet not him. In other words, heres Coetzee.
Quotable Quotesfrom J.M Coetzee 1. Live like a hero. Thats what the classics teach us. Be a main character. Otherwise what is life for 2. Pain is truth; all else is subject to doubt. 3. Our lies reveal as much about us as our truths 4. We must cultivate, all of us, a certain ignorance, a certain blindness, or society will not be tolerable. 5. I am not the we of anyone 
Coetzee the writer. Coetzee who decided to become an artist when he was 15. As he reveals in one of his essays in Stranger Shores, one afternoon when he was moping around his backyard in suburban Cape Town, he suddenly heard the sound of music coming from the next house. It was Bach, and he was transfixed. After this, he writes, everything changed: The revelation in the garden was a key event in my formation. This was the first time he had felt the impact of great art.
We next see him in Youth where he describes a young man desperately trying to become a writer, even though there is no evidence that he has any literary talent. In fact, the protagonist (Coetzee himself and no other) spends the entire volume, which ends when hes roughly 23, at a creative and psychological impasse. The book opens with Coetzee at a university in Cape Town, but within 40 pages he has decamped for England. The vision of life in the metropolis, of the romance and exaltation of art, pulls him to London. Needing a job, and having a degree in mathematics as well as English, he finds a position at I.B.M. The work is deadening, but he has other things on his mind: becoming a poet and finding his true love - two elusive goals. He fails in both, is tormented by self-loathing, and everywhere he looks sees the sophisticated beauties of London ignoring him, its bohemians disdaining him, the life he dreams of out of reach. He fantasizes about passing as English but knows he never will, yet is determined to sever all ties with South Africa, the homeland he disdains.
But he seems to realize art is born of suffering, even madness; the true artist must expect to endure exile, obscure labor and obloquy. And there is one consolation: Because they are creators, artists possess the secret of love, and women, wanting to be brushed by the sacred fire, instinctively recognize this. The young Coetzees models at this point are not writers whose work he wishes to learn from so much as artists whose life he hopes to emulate: above all, Pound, for his proud endurance of calumny and exile, and Picasso, for his legendary success with women.
Only three moments, in Youth, hint at his achievements to come. Lying in a London park, he is overcome by an ecstatic sense of unity with nature, foretelling the exquisite sensitivity to landscape that marks his novels. Procrastinating in the British Museum, he begins perusing books on South African history and is soon contemplating a pseudohistory of the early-19th-century frontier, clearly the genesis of the extraordinary second part of Dusklands, his first published work. Finally, in a used bookstore, he discovers Becketts fiction, undoubtedly the model for his own mercilessly spare style and characteristic focus on the consciousness of a single, isolated character - an influence most evident in his second work, In the Heart of the Country.
Coetzee built his literary reputation on the eight novels he published between 1974 and 1999. None was less than unusually good, say the critics, but three in particular have carried his work into the realm of lasting things. The first was Waiting for the Barbarians, a parable about the use of falsely imagined enemies for social control. Substitute terrorists for barbarians and you have a history of Britain and America since 2001. (Coetzees book came out in 1980.)It was for his fourth novel Life and Times of Michael K that he won the Booker. A third masterwork, Disgrace, won him the second Booker.
In a rare interview he gave David Attwell in 1994 Coetzee reveals that all writing is autobiography: everything that you write, including criticism and fiction, writes you as you write it. He continues by saying that when you tell the story of your life, you do so from a reservoir of memories, selecting those bits of narrative that get to a plausible truth. In his eyes, theres little difference between autobiography and fiction. Both forms press forward to achieve what he calls a higher truth by choosing facts that support an evolving purpose. More recently, in his current book, The Good Story (2015), he takes this view a step further by saying when two people tell each other in conversation their life stories, it is little more than an exchange of fiction, it is in fact, the truth, through lies.
This could be why, unlike other writers, Coetzee uses his work as scathing self-assessments. As critic Nick Romeo points out Coetzee has articulated so many harsh criticisms of himself and his fiction within his own novels that it sometimes seems the only thing left for critics to do is praise him. Hes already got the negatives covered.
Yet, what is surprising is that there is some sly humour too, in Coetzees work. Young John, in Summertime, for instance, meets a school friend, who he remembers as not being very bright, although now he appears to be a very big person in marketing. What does this suggest about the workings of the world John muses. What it seems most obviously to suggest is that the path that leads through Latin and algebra is not the path to material success. But it may suggest much more: that understanding things is a waste of time.
Who would dare disagree with that last line

UK government opens $640 million fund untouched  since 1928 to pay off national debt
An anonymous benefactor donated 500,000 in 1928 as part of a fund that must remain untouched until the U.K. raises enough money to pay off its entire national debt. The U.K. government will appeal to the High Court to gain access to the National Fund.
The U.K. government will go to the countrys highest court Tuesday in a bid to force open a 475 million ($640 million) charity fund set up 90 years ago with the intention of paying off the national debt.
The National Fund was opened in 1928 by an anonymous benefactor who donated 500,000, but on the condition that it must remain untouched until the U.K. raises enough money to pay off its entire national debt.
While the fund currently stands at 475 million, it represents just 0.06 percent of the U.Ks estimated 1.7 trillion debt.
Attorney General Jeremy Wright will urge High Court judges on Tuesday to change the terms of the trust fund and release the money to pay off some of the U.K.s debt.
Almost 90 years ago, an anonymous donor bequeathed money to the nation and yet we have not been able to put it to good use, Wright said. We have been working with the Treasury, trustees and the Charity Commission to find a solution consistent with the donors original objectives of extinguishing the national debt.
Barclays, which oversees the management of the fund, has for years tried to obtain permission to gain access to the money, to make it available for charitable grants or hand it over to the Treasury.
Any changes to the fund must be approved by the High Court. The original 500,000 donation was a cash sum of 338,909 and securities to the value of 160,969. Accounts for the fund show that gains on investments and exchange movements have amounted to an overall net gain of 46,606,147.
U.K. government borrowing shrunk to its lowest level in more than 10 years in April. Total U.K. public debt now stands at 1.798 trillion, about twice the level it was before the 2008 financial crisis.
That figure excludes public sector banks, but does include for temporary Bank of England lending that was introduced to revive the countrys economy. (CBNC)

UltraTech to acquire Century  Textiles cement business
Aditya Birla Group-owned UltraTech on Sunday approved the reorganisation of the cement business of Century TextilesNSE -2.82 % and Industries and its absorption into UltraTech, giving itself the leadership in all regional markets in a deal that has long been in the works involving Kumar Mangalam Birla and his grandfather BK Birla.
With the planned reorganisation, UltraTech will get ready ownership of 13.4 MT capacity spread across Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, helping the land-endowed Century to focus more on its real estate business and pare debt of about Rs 3,000 crore. UltraTech plans to take the entire debt on its books.
The demerger will involve issuance of equity shares to the existing shareholders of Century. For every eight equity shares of Century, the shareholders will get one equity share of UltraTech of a face value of Rs 10 per share.
UltraTech will issue 14 million new equity shares to the shareholders, increasing its equity capital to Rs 288.58 crore that will be divided into 288.6 million equity shares of Rs 10 each. The acquisition will contribute positively to the companys earnings, UltraTech said in a statement. Besides, with this planned scaling-up of capacities in the eastern and central markets, Indias largest cement maker will become the market leader in all possible regional markets in the country. It was already a market leader in the north, south and west. However, the company still has to secure the approval of the competition regulator. Other approvals from shareholders, creditors, stock exchanges and the NCLT are also pending. The transaction will take 6-9 months to complete and will be effective from January, 2019.
UltraTech is in a growth phase and the acquisition will give us ready capacities in markets in which we want to grow, managing director of UltraTech KK Maheshwari told ET. With the addition of Centurys cement plants, UltraTech will become the undisputed leader in all regions of the country, he said.
After taking on Centurys debt, UltraTech will have net debt of Rs 17,000 crore, with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.35x. Maheshwari said that with the company generating cash every year, the leverage is within its comfort limits. UltraTech has been on an acquisition spree. Last year, UltraTech acquired Jaypee Associates six integrated plants of 21.2 MT and has also put in a bid of Rs 7,840 crore for the debt-stricken 6.25 MT Binani Cement. (The Economic Times)

Unity best Unity best sooner
It is an understatement to say that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is in crisis. It is a peculiar predicament that the party finds itself in, given that it is in power and its leader, Maithripala Sirisena is Executive President and Head of State of the country. Ironically though, President Sirisena does not appear to have the same degree of control over the political party he heads.
The SLFP has seen and survived much political turmoil in its history, most notably in the 80s when there was a leadership squabble between Sirima Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake. However, most of these disputes have arisen when it was in the opposition. Indeed, even the United National Party (UNP) went through a series of internal power struggles when it was in the opposition between 1994 and 2014. What makes the current impasse in the SLFP unusual is that it is happening when it is in government.
Last week, it was reported that President Sirisena had instructed the sixteen parliamentarians who recently left the government and sat on the opposition benches in Parliament to decide when the SLFP would quit the national unity government it has forged with the UNP.
The reason for the current state of affairs in the SLFP could be attributed at least in part to the circumstances of President Sirisenas election to office. After being the longest serving General Secretary of the SLFP and having held that office for fourteen years, he quit the party to take on the seemingly invincible Mahinda Rajapaksa as the common candidate of a broad coalition that was headed by the SLFPs arch rivals, the UNP.
SLFP parliamentarians
Once in office, President Sirisena became leader of the SLFP. He then had a difficult balancing act to perform, managing his role as SLFP leader in a government which he headed but was dominated by the UNP. In doing so, he found that a significant proportion of SLFP parliamentarians still remained loyal to Rajapaksa.
That number has been steadily increasing. At the August 2015 general election, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) of which the major stake holder is the SLFP returned 95 MPs. Of them, 51 were loyal to Rajapaksa while 44 pledged allegiance to President Sirisena. Those 44 MPs, along with the 106 MPs from the UNP gave the government a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The tally now stands at only about 23 MPs supporting the President with about 72 UPFA MPs supporting Rajapaksa. That is after 16 MPs including ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers left the government in the aftermath of the unsuccessful motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. In the process, the government lost the two-thirds majority it enjoyed.
The SLFP has been at the centre of several politically significant events in recent months. In February, it came a distant third in the local government elections, arguably the partys worst ever showing in terms of the percentage of votes it polled. That was after a campaign personally spearheaded by President Sirisena where he criticised the Rajapaksa camp as much as he castigated the UNP.
Thereafter, President Sirisena has hinted that he may contest the next presidential elections. That came in the form of an announcement at this years May Day rally in Batticaloa where he said that he had no intention of retiring from politics after 2020, the year presidential elections are due. However, the President didnt specifically state that he would be running for office again.
Then, following in the footsteps of the UNP, President Sirisena has also announced that the SLFP would be restructured extensively and all official positions of the party would be reviewed. The restructuring is due to be finalised by early next month. This comes in the wake of demands from the group of sixteen who defected to the opposition to replace SLFP Generally Secretary Duminda Dissanayake and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, both staunch loyalists of President Sirisena.
This is where President Sirisena finds himself in a difficult situation. Both Dissanayake and Amaraweera supported the President at the cost of incurring the wrath of the Rajapaksas. Dissanayake in particular was one of those who quit the Rajapaksa government in support of the President when he resigned as Minister of Health in 2014 to contest the Presidency. Therefore, even if there is a reconciliation between the warring factions of the SLFP, the President must ensure the political futures of the likes of Dissanayake and Amaraweera.
At a meeting of the SLFPs highest decision-making body, the Central Committee last Thursday, President Sirisena is reported to have expressed his desire to see the remaining 23 SLFPers in the unity government leaving it sooner rather than later. This was conveyed to the media at a briefing by former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara. Jayasekaras comments have not been denied or disputed so far.
Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions
It appears that the SLFP now believes that remaining in government is political liability. That is because, with its currently depleted numbers in the Cabinet, it only has a few ministerial portfolios but will still be held accountable by the voting public for the actions of the UNP-led government. If anything, the outcome of the recent local government elections suggested that being in government had hurt the SLFP more than it had hurt the UNP.
The group of sixteen is reported to have formulated a strategy for the future direction of the SLFP. Jayasekara claimed that this strategy, which included a plan for both the Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions of the SLFP to contest as one entity was accepted by the President.
However, how this reconciles with President Sirisenas plan of not retiring from politics in 2020 and the Rajapaksas plan to promote a presidential candidate of their own- with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa the front runner at this stage- remains to be seen.
Indeed, it is accepted in SLFP circles that most of the group of sixteen left the government with the intention of joining the Rajapaksa faction of the party or the new political party formed by them, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. Some among this group, such as S. B. Dissanayake, who previously repeatedly proclaimed President Sirisena as the next presidential candidate, are not surprisingly silent on this issue now.
A compromise reconciliation between the two warring factions of the SLFP cannot be ruled out because, with the group of sixteen leaving the government, there has been more dialogue and discussion between the two groups. In fact, the group of sixteen was scheduled to meet Rajapaksa yesterday for formal talks.
Proposed party reforms
However, many details will need to be worked out. Chief among them would be the political futures of President Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa. Rajapaksa is constitutionally debarred from contesting the Presidency but President Sirisena is not. If he insists on running for that high office again, it could stall any agreement between the two factions before it gets off the ground.
As such, any potential consensus is only possible in a compromise where one faction of the SLFP agrees to support the other faction, which will then run for President. That is why reconciling the two camps remain such a daunting task.
The coming month- when the proposed party reforms in the SLFP will come to the fore- will be crucial in determining the partys future political direction. For better or for worse, it will also determine whether the next presidential election will be the traditional tussle between the UNP and the SLFP or whether it will, for the first time, be a three-way contest.

WHO best buys implemented at varying levels - Rajitha
Sri Lanka has implemented the WHO best buys at varying levels. If we are to succeed in achieving the recommendations of this report, I hope you would agree that its very important to have a strong political commitment at the highest level, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
We have achieved our 80 percent pictorial warnings on cigarette packets and 90 percent tax on cigarettes, mainly because of the political commitment to make Sri Lanka tackle alcohol and tobacco issues, Minister Senaratne said.
Addressing the Third High Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) now going on in Geneva during the 71st World Health Assembly, Minister Senaratne said that Sri Lanka is firmly committed to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development with the goal leave no one behind. This motto is is highly applicable to all countries if we are to achieve our SDG target of reducing the premature mortality from NCDs by one third through prevention and treatment and promotion of health and well- being with relevant focus on mental health as well.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that we need to take bold action to prevent the marketing of health harming products for children.
Establishing an international Code of Conduct and getting the private sector of all countries to adhere to this code would benefit all countries, he said.
I feel though attention has been given to salt and trans-fats. I am surprised to note that reducing sugar intake is not given any consideration. While recognising that the reduction of sugar is not considered in the best buys, I would like to recommend that we correct this deficit by adding reduction of sugar to recommendation, the Minister added.
