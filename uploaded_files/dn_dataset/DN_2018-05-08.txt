Fortune 500 companies non adherence to changes risk closure
Almost 40% worlds fortune 500 companies and family businesses mostly based in Asia have folded up in recent times since they have not adhered to change and adopted new technology.
More and more family businesses especially in Middle East, South Asia including Sri Lanka are facing this gloomy scenario since the companies have a lot of tradition which they want to maintain giving less emphasis to change.
Today its identified that both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IOT) are the key factors driving future business and all companies too have to fall in line, said Managing Director, Middle East, Africa and South Asia, (MEASA region) Industrial and Financial Systems (IFS), Sweden, Luis Ortega.
Luis Ortega
He said that some of the fortune 500 companies saw this coming and adopted to change while others who did not, perished and in the families businesses too this trend was observed.
However in recent times, due to most of the third generation involved in family businesses having their education overseas they are tech savvy and are looking at introducing AI and IOT to strengthen their family businesses. This is happening in both India and Sri Lanka with their children convincing their fathers to adopt to change.
He said that moving to both AI and IOT means sharing a lot of information and the Middle Eastern companies are very sensitive in sharing data. Hence we observe that in the Middle Eastern region there is very slow adaptation to embrace new technology.
Commenting on the African region he said that the companies are very keen to move with new technology and there is great commitment by them towards IOT and AI based solutions.
He however said that the Sri Lanka private sector specially involved in apparels, tea, retail sectors (Singer Sri Lanka) are moving with the worlds technological advances and reaping benefits by way of more efficiency and reduction in costs. Similar feedback is there from Bangladesh as well.
IFS Labs Autonomous Assistants
He however said that in contrast public sector enterprises commitment towards new technology is very slow. We had made many representations to then SriLankan Airline management and also the Ceylon Electricity Board four years ago but their response was very poor.
Only Minister of Mahaweli Development has adopted Industrial and Financial Systems to maintain and monitor nine of their reservoirs and this is continuing.
In Indian there is a vast difference with several State owned entities in railway. Highway and power generation sectors adopting new technical advances joining with Industrial and fnancial Systems.
He said that MEASA region has being growing steadily and they have maintained a double digit growth in the last few years. With more companies joining us we see this growth being maintained in the next three years as well. However political issues in some countries, elections put a check on our growth but Sri Lanka is an exception.
Commenting on their global operations he said that Scandinavia is one of their biggest markets.
He said that IFS has been in Sri Lanka for the past 20 years and it was the high skilled work force that attracted them to come to Sri Lanka and since then have employeed over 1,000. We have also invested and set up an IFS LAB and to date its one of the biggest for us.
He said that the talent pool from Sri Lanka is very impressive and the education level at Universities is of high standard.
Luis Ortega counts more than 20 years experience in the IT sector in the Middle East, Luis joined IFS in 2012 as regional sales manager. Luis has spent most of his professional career helping asset-intensive businesses in Europe, Middle East and Africa improve their asset lifecycle management.
He holds a Masters in Telecommunication Engineering, and brings extensive experience in the engineering, consulting and outsourcing services with a primary focus on the energy, utility and telecommunications industry.

Industrial zone in Millaniya soon
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said coordination between the divisional secretariats (pradeshiya lekam karyala) is necessary to launch the development programmes introduced by the government.
The government has already had talks with a Thai investor to establish an industrial zone in Millaniya in the Kalutara District on 450 acres of land, with 100 industrial establishments providing employment to 5,000. Construction will begin in July when the government signs the final agreement with the Thai investor. The Premier was addressing the ceremonial opening of the new Millaniya Divisional Secretariat building, which cost Rs. 5 million, recently.
He further stated if the divisional secretariat is involved in a tug-of-war with the government over development programmes, it would create an unhealthy situation where development would be stalled.
The Premier said Minister Vajira Abeywardena had launched a programme costing millions of rupees to construct new buildings with auditoriums for the divisional secretariats in the country as most of these offices were dilapidated. The previous government had neglected the services provided by the divisional secretariats.

More business potential under Indo Lanka FTA
The Sri Lanka High Commission in New Delhi organized a Roadshow followed by a business interactive session for the members of the BRICS Chamber of Commerce & Industry under the theme Sri Lanka Partnering with India for Prosperity, at the High Commission premises on 25th April 2018.
The main focus of the Roadshow was to promote the Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave 2018 scheduled to be held in June, at the Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
Speaking at the business interactive session last month, on behalf of the BRICS Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Secretary General Dr B.B.L. Madhukar reiterated the importance of exploring business potential in Sri Lanka due to its unparalleled strategic location underpinned with conducive business climate and the fast developing infrastructure.
He invited the Chamber members to explore the vast business potential under the Indo Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement.
High Commissioner to Sri Lanka in Inda, Chitranganee Wagiswara highlighted the recent economic developments in the country and outlined the initiatives of the Sri Lanka government to create an economy, firmly based on foreign and domestic private investment.
High Commissioner emphasized on the New Trade Policy which was approved by the Cabinet in July 2017, and made reference to the progressive steps taken by the government to facilitate, protect and promote the trade and liberal investment climate in Sri Lanka, by implementing the Inland Revenue Act, the Foreign Exchange Act and moving forward of the Anti-Dumping Bill.
While referring to the strategic location of the island as a gateway to the Indian sub-continent, she stated that through trading agreements Sri Lanka could integrate deeper with the regional and global economy, particularly through cross-regional global value chains and encouraged the Indian industry members to take advantage of these untapped trade and investment opportunities in the island.
It was pointed out that, against the backdrop of the long standing trade and economic relations between Sri Lanka and India, the direct engagement between the business partners of the two countries offers a significant opportunity of facilitating the long-term business collaboration.
The High Commissioner invited a delegation from the BRICS Chamber of Commerce & Industry to participate in the Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave in Colombo and to engage directly with future business or investment partner to explore opportunities in Sri Lanka.
Minster Commercial of the High Commission, Upekkha Samaratunga made a presentation on investment potential in the key target sectors, market access tools and factor cost. In addition she elaborated on the incentives offered by granting reduced tax rates (for specific sectors) and enhanced capital allowances based on capital investments made by the investors under the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017.
Over 50 participants representing the industry and media attended the business interactive session. Corporate leaders from prominent companies such as Gazprom bank, Impresario Entertainment & Hospitality (Pvt) Ltd, Fine Jewellery (Pvt) were among the participants.
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will organise this Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave 2018, from June 19 to 2 2018, in Colombo, in its continuing support to the government to attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) to Sri Lanka. This will mark the third consecutive year of this event.
In this endeavour, the Chamber will receive the cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Export Development Board and the Department of Commerce.

All-rounder Pandya keeps champions Mumbai afloat in IPL
MUMBAI, Sunday: Perennial slow starters Mumbai Indians are on course for a trademark late-season charge into the Indian Premier League (IPL) playoffs, thanks largely to some impressive performances by all-rounder Hardik Pandya.
The defending champions, owned by Indias richest man Mukesh Ambani, lost their first five matches but still reached the 2014 playoffs before completing a fairytale tournament victory a year later after losing their opening four fixtures.
The 2016 edition saw the Rohit Sharma-led side win one out of their first four matches before they appeared to shed the tardy-starter tag last season, going on to win their third IPL title after 10 wins in 14 group stage games. The lack of victories at the start of the campaign returned to haunt them again this season as Mumbai lost five of their opening six games, appearing doomed to miss out on the playoffs as their title defence faltered.
They have, however, managed to arrest the slide with three wins in four matches as Pandyas all-round abilities came to the fore in his sides turnaround.
Pandya stole the show in Mumbais 13-run win over the Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday with an unbeaten 35 off 20 balls and then dented the oppositions seemingly comfortable chase with figures of two for 19.
The double strike means the seamer has claimed 14 victims to become the leading wicket-taker in the tournament as Mumbai moved up to fifth in the eight-team standings, two points behind the fourth and final playoff spot. Really, really happy for him, Hardiks elder brother and team mate Krunal said after Sundays win over KKR.
He has been bowling really well and he has transformed himself as a bowler. He has improved over a period of time and thats a great sign for a cricketer.
The way hes batting also, hes in touch. And everybody knows he is a gun fielder. I am happy that everything is coming out good for him. The 24-year-old seamer and hard-hitting batsman cemented his spot in the Indian side last year in all three formats of the game and is considered the teams cleanest striker of the ball.
On Sunday, he kept the KKR batsmen in check with smart changes of pace during his four-over quota, including an 18th over that went for only six runs.
As a team, we believe we can do it. We have done it in the past though obviously its difficult, Pandya said at the post-match press conference when asked if his team can once again go all the way. I dont like anything which comes easy. I like difficult things. This is a challenge and I will love to take it. - Agencies

[APPRECIATIONS - (08-05-2018)]
Captain Eranga Ratnayake
He was courageous
A decade has passed since the passing of Captain Eranga Indika Ratnayake. Born on March 27, 1983, he would have been 35 this year had he not made the supreme sacrifice for his motherland on April 30, 2008, at the age of 25. I thought it would be fitting to pen a tribute to a dear friend from my schooldays at Wesley College, Colombo, whose short but eventful life, made a lasting impression on many.
Indika, who joined Wesley in 1994 entering Grade 6 (into the E class whose class teacher was Kanthi Nanayakkara), was my classmate from then up to Grade 11. Afterwards, we diverged into different A/L streams. He became a student of Commerce, while I pursued Arts. But the separation from classrooms had no real practical bearing in distancing our friendship.
Indika was best known by his batch mates in College as Podiman; a nickname that was indelibly affixed on him due to the stark resemblance he bore to a child character by that tag who appeared on a few episodes of the then popular teledrama Doodaruwo. Many in College at that time thought that Indika was actually that child actor. The tag Podiman later morphed into Podde. And so, Podde he was to be to his batch mates and other schoolmates who knew him well.
His college career saw him become secretary of the Junior Buddhist Society, a member of the Sinhala debating team, an office-bearer in the Sinhala literary union, a rugby player in the under-14 team, taking part in athletics, being appointed House Captain, and also a college prefect. He also won the college prize for Sinhala debating (The Ranabahu Memorial Prize) while in Grade 12.
There was a certain boyish boisterousness that defined him. It was an inimitably signature facet of his character and demeanour; anyone who knew Podde from college days would vouch to my statement. He was equipped with a motor mouth, a sharp (and somewhat untamed) tongue, a notable vocal prowess (that ensured its audibility reached all corners of the classroom), wittiness and an energetic spark of vivacity that seldom dimmed. He was a boy brimming with life and was capable of true and sincere caring.
Many are the incidents and stories that could be related to this colourful character and mischievous ways. Once, when he was short of money for a pair of shoes he had wanted to buy; he conspired with his bosom friend and classmate Udana Rahatungoda (at whose house on Stratford Avenue in Pamankada, Podde was a regular visitor), to cut down a comb of plantains from a tree that was in the garden of the latters aunts house that was a stones throw away and not, at that time, separated from the Rahatungoda residences compound by a boundary wall.The comb of plantains was cut down, but the two of them couldnt secure a sale for it from any of the nearby boutiques. The price they sought was Rs. 300, if memory serves me correct. It was a high price for that time, I believe. It was a madcap idea spurred out of the spontaneity for boyish fun. Due to the lack of success in making a sale, the bounty was abandoned somewhere to ensure no evidence was traced back to the two culprits. However, the missing comb of plantains that were near-ripe, was missed by its owners later that evening and was assumed to be the work of common plantain thieves.
A testimony to Poddes prowess to churn the classrooms climate from calmness to a more animated atmosphere with his boisterousness, was found in what was once said by one of the masters in the A/L Commerce section, Winsiri Fernando. Once when Poddes mother met Winsiri on the parents day, he had said that Indika, being of the stature that he was, still managed to turn the class upside down and added that if by chance he had been of Bothejus size, he would have turned the whole school upside down. The person who was the subject of comparison was our batch mate Lahiru Botheju, who is of colossal physique, standing over six feet and was a star school rugby player who captained Wesley and then pursued playing rugby at a club-level afterwards. As ironic as it may sound, it was a sight to see. The strapping Botheju was at times, the subject of Poddes classroom jests, jovial pranks and taunts. There was no doubt about it; Podde was the life of the party.
Poddes ambition was to join the Air Force, following the footsteps of his father and elder brother. But he fell two inches short (if I recall correctly) to meet the height requirement. Although the army was not his first choice, his sense of pride to be recruited into the army as an officer cadet, was true and genuine. Topping his batch at the Diyathalawa Military Academy, he won a training scholarship to the British Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and the following year, he passed out of Diyathalawa, being commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Sri Lanka Army Engineers Corps. The letters he wrote to me from Sandhurst are still in my possession, forming part of the tangible memory that remains of him.
In the army, Indika earned the respect of both rank and file for his hard work and conscientious valiance. He performed his duty when beckoned to serve in precarious operations such as the Silawathura Campaign and several others of note which posted him in the war front. And whenever possible, he made it a point to call his friends while in camp, facing the uncertainties of the war front.
He was by all standards, a remarkable officer and a gentleman who served with untiring effort and undiminished courage. He was committed to serving his motherland and kept true to the Wesley spirit which is evoked in our College song in the line; and for our dear land, wed be men of grit and industry.
On his visits home, off duty, he always made it a point to meet up with his close friends from college. He knew deep down that he had to make the most of the time he had to spend with those that mattered to him the most due to the uncertainty of war.
He was last stationed at Vauniya, where he spent his final birthday in active service, turning 25 and being promoted to the rank of (full) Lieutenant that very day. When I called him, he said he got the best birthday present ever and told me of the news of his long-awaited promotion.
On his last visit home in April, 2008, he made it a point, as per custom, to meet up with a group of us and do a night out in the town. That was indeed, a night to remember to those of us who were with him. That was the last time I saw my friend whom I had known since our days in blue shorts at Wesley. Four days later on the April 30, Podde passed away, falling victim to a high-pressure antitank mine while on a clearance operation in Vauniya.
I could not help but wonder when the war ended in 2009, what it would have been like if Podde had still been with us I have no doubt that thought would have reverberated in all who knew him.
As time passes and change sweeps the lives of his batch mates, how will Podde be remembered Words and memories will honour him, but nothing will replace him; that is the truth of the matter.
And to those of us who remember him, he will remain a vibrant youth who will not age. May remembrance of him bring gladness to the hearts of those who cherished him and were cherished by him.
The supreme sacrifice he selflessly made for his motherland was not in vain.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Asoka Palliyaguruge
Woman of many talents
On April 16, this year, our family lost one of its treasured members; Asoka Palliyaguruge was not only a warmhearted wife, mother and grandmother, but also a loyal and sincere friend.
She received her primary education at Ananda Sastralaya, Kotte and Carmel Convent, Kalmunai, prior to joining Vincent Girls High School, Batticaloa and later, Visaka Vidyalaya, Colombo 5. Asoka was a multi-talented student who was also fluent in all three official languages of the country.
Upon completion of her school education, Asoka proceeded to acquire a diploma in Management and subsequently, joined the Gal Oya Development Board as its first female receptionist. She was later promoted to translator; a post she retained for 17 years until she was appointed administrative officer.
Eventually, Asoka left the Gal Oya Development Board and joined the Mahaweli Authority in 1980 as its administrative officer/publication officer, before retiring eight years later.
Asoka Palliyaguruge also served as a senior counsellor at the Kandy General Hospital and the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital and was a volunteer counsellor at the Kandy Cancer Society branch as well. She later functioned as an English teacher at Gateway College, while writing poetry to newspapers.
Regardless of field or post, Asoka executed her duties with perseverance and integrity. Her remains were cremated on April 17 at the Mount Lavinia Cemetery, amongst a gathering of family, friends and colleagues. May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Chandra Karunadasa
A faithful friend
We met for the first time in the so-called heaven on earth
This was the impression of the majority to start with
It was the world-renowned University of Ceylon
Where you were, sincere group of friends were not alone
All those warm and cheerful undergrad days
We shared at Sangamitta, will never fade away
You had a long-lasting and enduring bond
With friends who still have undying memories so fond
Your departure haunts all loved ones many a day
Time passes soon; being unaware it is the fifth death anniversary
She was calm, soft-spoken and friendly
Warm, well-mannered, with a smart personality
She had a scholarly academic career
With a wealth of knowledge in Buddhism so rare
Her creativity and imagination was a reflection
Of the writings she undertook with devotion
Articles on numerous topics won international fame
Those are the souvenirs that we have in your name
Kalutara Bodhiya was a sacred destination
Where she helped the underprivileged in English education
Soon they enjoyed unlimited gains
Because for good voluntary, service she spared no pains
They should remember with gratitude
Her commitment and generous attitude
She was a remarkable being, wonderful
Which her loved ones experienced in full
She had a happy family life in possession
With a caring husband dedicated to his profession
She took pleasure in participating as a dutiful wife
After his demise, tried to fulfil obligations of life
An affectionate mother to her children
Domiciled down under, performing a worthy service
In their lives, she placed the most vital role
Helping them to reach the highest goal
During sunset years, she was safe and sound
Passed away peacefully with the family around
Your sincerity and affection to us was such
I do miss you; you whose company I treasured so much
Friendship and goodwill in her noble heart
Are all the precious memories now left
In view of the sweet fragrance of the days gone by
This is a tribute for a beautiful life spent with a wide eye
Both here and in Sri Lanka, offerings are made to the Triple Gem
To bestow merit; wishing you the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana

K. Joseph Perera
Lover of music
It is with sorrow that I write these few words of appreciation on my father, Kurukulasooriya Joseph Mervyn Perera, who passed away 30 years ago on April 24, 1987.
He was born on April 19, 1931 and hailed from a respectable Catholic family in Moratuwa.
His sudden heart attack at a comparatively young age of 56, was a blow to us all. He was the eldest in a family of three children.
My father, who received his education at St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, was qualified for the senior school certificate examination (English) in 1948. He attended St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, from 1937 to 1948. After his school career, he joined the Colombo Port Commission as a clerk in 1950 and became the time-keeping officer of the Public Health Inspectors division in 1970. He was the senior TKC at the time of his death in 1987 and completed 36 years of service at this at this institution, which he considered to be his second home.
He married my mother Rita on January 15, 1959. They lived a happily-wedded life. My mother was always behind my father and looked after him until his untimely demise.
He was a loving father to me and my three brothers; late Ranjan, late Andrew and Sharma, my only sister Anne and our spouses. My father was also a lover of music; every evening, he would play the mouth organ and enjoy singing his favorite songs. Music was his life and forte.
He was kind to all, hated none and was similar to a child, even in his old age. He had great faith in God with whose blessing, he led a happy life.
He always tended to family matters, up to his last day, and we can only be happy that his end was peaceful. He celebrated is 56th birthday on April 19, 1987 and just five days later, said goodbye to all of us to be with the Lord. My fathers passing away 30 years ago, was sudden and unexpected; it saddened our hearts. But we rejoice as we are certain that he is with our Lord Almighty. Even though he is no more, he will always remain in our hearts.
I thank Jesus for giving us such a kind and loving father. I thank him for all that he had done for the five of us and our families.
May the soul of my dear father rest in peace!

S. L. M. Shafie Marikar
An ardent educationist
Former Zahira College (Colombo) Principal S. L. M. Shafie Marikkar peacefully passed away after a brief illness at the age of 82 years. His contributions to the education of the Muslim community of the country, was noteworthy.
Marikkar assumed duties at Zahira College in 1967 and for 15 years, instiled Islamic awareness, thought and discipline in all his students.
He followed in the footsteps of Dr. T. B. Jayah and A. M. A. Azeez in order to maintain the Islamic Identity of Muslim students.
We still remember vividly, Marhoom Shafie Marikkar during his weekly Monday assembly at the Gaffoor Hall, stressed the importance of religion first, education second and thirdly, sports. Aside from religion and culture, discipline was also a subject he focused on; it shaped us into the model citizens of society we are today.
During his time as principal, he made it compulsory for students to offer Luhar Salat with the congregation at the Maradana Jumma Mosque and all the hostellers, to offer prayers five times a day. Marikkar also joined in the prayer sessions to set an example to his students.
He efficiently executed all school affairs with the assistance of the Maradana Mosque Committee and philanthropist Marhoom Naleem Hajiar. The All Ceylon Tablighi Jamaat owes its gratitude to Marhoom Shafie Marikkar and the Maradana Mosque Committee for paving the way for Zahira College to hold the World Tablighi Ijtema in 1967, 1973, 1976 and 1979.
Marhoom Hazarath Jee Inamul Hassan and other foreign dignitaries were accommodated at the Zahira College hostels at the time.
My father, Marhoom M. L. M. Farook, who was the college chief librarian when Marikkar assumed duties as its principal, was closely-associated with him in the All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and during all college activities. Marhoom Marikkar spearheaded the All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and took keen interest in the affairs of Muslim schools countrywide. He would discuss the shortcomings faced by Muslim schools and would take necessary action to solve such issues with the relevant authorities from time to time.
He also received assistance from former Foreign Affairs and Higher Education Minister late A. C. S. Hameed and former Speaker late M. A. Bakeer Markar, who was an old boy of Zahira College, Colombo.
S. L. M. Shafie Marikar has left behind his only son Abdul Ahad; an engineer by profession.
Just a few days prior to his death, the Zahira College Old Boys Association (OBA) felicitated Marikkar at its re-union dinner which was held under the patronage of OBA President Fowzul Hameed on January 27, 2007.
In recognition of late Shafi Marikkars contribution to Muslim education in Sri Lanka, the All Ceylon Muslim Education Conference had made preparations to launch a book called Muslim Education in Sri Lanka; Thoughts and Contributions of Shafie Marikar at the Zahira College Gaffoor Hall on May 12 at 3.45 p.m. by former Zahira College Vice Principal A. M. Nahiya.
We also pray that Allah may grant him Jannathul Firdhouse for his dedication to Muslim education.

Arsenal mark Wenger's final home game with 5-0 thrashing of Burnley
LONDON, Sunday - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed off in style as they thrashed Burnley 5-0 in his last Premier League home game on Sunday with the kind of dominant performance he would have wanted after 22 years in charge.
Wenger was given a guard of honour from both teams and the match officials before kickoff, and received roars of support throughout the match from the home fans, most of whom had donned their complimentary red Merci Arsene T-shirts.
Arsenals January record signing, Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, opened the scoring in the 14th minute at The Emirates, racing into the area to guide home Alexandre Lacazettes cross with the outside of his right foot.
France striker Lacazette then doubled the lead for the Gunners just before halftime, volleying in a low ball from Hector Bellerin on the right side of the goal. Second-half strikes from Sead Kolasinac, Aubameyang again and Alex Iwobi put the game well beyond Burnleys reach.  AFP

Asad Shafiq extends hundred before Northants keep Pakistan in the field
LONDON, Sunday - Asad Shafiq increased his overnight hundred before Pakistan were given a solid workout in the field by Northamptonshire on Sunday's third day of their final warm-up match ahead of next week's Test against Ireland.
Shafiq, who resumed on 135 not out, went on to compile an unbeaten 186 in a total of 428 at Northampton. Having passed 150 and with only the last man for company, he hit three legside sixes.
Pakistan achieved a first-innings lead of 169 but it was a moot point whether, having had two days of their tour opener against Kent washed out, would have wanted to win this four-day fixture inside three.
But the decision was taken out of their hands by some determined Northamptonshire batting that included an unbeaten century from captain Rob Newton.
At stumps, the hosts were 240 for five in their second innings, with Pakistan paceman Rahat Ali having taken two wickets for 38 runs in nine overs. Pakistan will provide the opposition when Ireland play their inaugural Test in a match starting in Malahide, near Dublin, on Friday before returning across the Irish Sea for a two-Test series against England.

ASIA SIYAKA, WORLDS FIRST GREEN CERTIFIED TEA LOGISTICS CENTER
Asia Siyaka which started 20 years ago has becomes the first LEED (Leader of Environmental & Energy Design) Certified Tea Logistics Center in the world having been conferred a silver certification from the USA Green Building Society for its 250,000 sq.ft warehousing facility.
The state of the art facility now holds the title as the largest tea logistics provider in the country. The investment of close to Rs 800 million into this facility also makes it the largest investment by a tea broking company in Sri Lankas 150 year history of tea.
Asia Siyaka CEO Anil Cooke
For one of the founders of Asia Siyaka CEO Anil Cooke and his team, these milestones are revolutionary not just for the Company but for the entirety of the industry. When we first mooted Asia Siyaka, it was not simply to be another tea broker in the country, but to intensify the industrys stature as a global benchmark for tea.
This means not just having the worlds best tea, but ensuring that the multi-faceted paradigms that come together from leaf to cup is a well coalesced seamlessly transitioning value chain. With this benchmark setting facility, we are presenting tea manufacturers and buyers that competitive edge in the value chain, providing real time technology driven solutions never before seen in the industry.
Delving into Asia Siyakas innovative history, he explains that in the year 2000, the Company constructed a 110,000 sq.ft warehousing facility with 13,000 pallet locations, at a cost of Rs. 200 million, which was a trailblazer in its time.
This installation revolutionised the entire landscape of tea logistics given that we were the first to introduce palletised racking, eliminating the conventional manual storage system of stacking 14 packages at a time, he said. This well affirms the Companys mission of, Driving the commodity broking business with state of the art practices through continual value addition by setting competitive standards in the industry to satisfy our customers
In 2016, Asia Siyaka invested a further Rs 600 Mn and added 16,000 pallet locations with a narrow isle facility. Thus, both units together form a 250,000 sq.ft pioneering facility which today stands as the worlds first green tea logistics center.
With the facility already well utilised showing an above 90% average occupancy, it is pertinent to note that Asia Siyaka Warehousing (Pvt) Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of Asia Siyaka Commodities PLC is an ISO 22000 certified facility.
The majority stake of Asia Siyaka is owned by Lanka Commodity Brokers which was incorporated in 2003 by a consortium of investors. The young energetic team which continues to trailblaze innovations in the tea broking space is Asia Siyakas backbone, making it the market leader in the low country tea segment. The Company ranks second among the eight tea brokers in Sri Lanka.

Oor Enappirachaniyum Oor Oppanthamum (An ethnic conflict and an accord), a book by T. Ramakrishnan, an Associate Editor with The Hindu, a leading English daily published in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, was published recently.
The author served in Colombo as The Hindus Sri Lanka and Maldives Correspondent for a little over a year during 2015-2016.
Published in 2017 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of signing of the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord, the book seeks to find out why the accord remains relevant in any discourse on finding a political settlement to the Sri Lankan Tamil question.
Analysing factors that led to the signing of the accord and the events thereafter, including the 13th Constitutional Amendment, the author has also attempted to find out if the agreement had been implemented in letter and spirit, the destruction that Sri Lanka witnessed during the last phase of the civil war in 2009 could have been avoided.

Californias economy passes UKs to becomes worlds fifth biggest
Californias economy has surpassed that of the United Kingdom to become the worlds fifth largest, according to new federal data made public on Friday.
Despite having a population of only 40 million compared with the UKs 65 million people, Californias gross domestic product of $2.7tn has overtaken the UKs $2.6tn.
The so-called Golden States GDP rose by $127bn in the period from 2016 to 2017, while the UKs economic output fell slightly over that time when measured in US dollars, due in part to exchange rate fluctuations. British GDP has fallen steadily from $3tn in 2014, according to World Bank figures.
The release of Fridays data demonstrated the sheer immensity of Californias economy, home to a thriving technology sector in Silicon Valley, the worlds entertainment capital in Hollywood and Americas salad bowl in its agricultural heartland. It also reflects a substantial turnaround since the recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008.
Californias economic output is now surpassed only by the total GDP of the United States, China, Japan and Germany.
All economic sectors except agriculture contributed to Californias higher GDP, said Irena Asmundson, chief economist at the California department of finance. Financial services and real estate led the way, with $26bn in growth, followed by the information sector, which includes many technology companies, at $20bn. Manufacturing was up $10bn.

Cardiff back in the Premier League as Warnock promoted again
LONDON, Sunday - Cardiff City returned to the Premier League on Sunday when a goalless draw at home to Reading was enough to give veteran manager Neil Warnock a record eighth promotion.
Only the top two at the end of the regular season were guaranteed a place in English football's lucrative top flight and second-tier title-winners Wolves had already secured one of those spots heading into Sunday's final round of regular-season Championship matches.
A draw left Cardiff waiting on Fulham's result at Birmingham, but the Cottagers 3-1 loss left the London club facing the lottery of the play-offs, where the teams finishing third-sixth compete for the lone remaining promotion place.
The draw saw Cardiff return to the Premier League after a single season in the competition in 2013/14.
When Warnock took over some 18 months ago, Cardiff were at the other end of the table but Malaysian owner Vincent Tan's decision to bring the experienced manager to the Welsh capital paid dividends.
I'm just so proud of them that they listened what I had to say, said Warnock. It seems such a long time ago (when he arrived at Cardiff), the state the club was in. I've seen the fans today on the pitch, a full house, the owners and everyone together, it's got to be the best ever job I've done in my life.
We're going to get one or two things than thrown at us next season. But hey ho, it's better than playing in the Championship, he added.
Asked how this promotion compared to his previous seven, Warnock replied: It's the best one by a mile. If you knew what I've had to do off the field as well as on the field. I think it's an incredible feat.
Warnock previously enjoyed promotion with Scarborough, Notts County twice, Huddesrsfield, Plymouth, Sheffield United and most recently QPR in 2011.
I said to the lads on Thursday, if things don't go right and we go into the play-offs, we've still had a great season.
They're proud of being Bluebirds again, the fans. Everyone wants to support the club now and that's lovely. Birmingham were still facing relegation when they kicked off but first-half goals from Lukas Jutkiewicz (15) and Harlee Dean (43) settled their nerves.
Tom Cairney scored for Fulham with six minutes left but Che Adams's 89th-minute goal put the result beyond doubt. Barnsley's 4-1 loss at Derby ended their brief stay in the Championship, with Burton -- managed by Nigel Clough -- also relegated after a 2-1 loss at Preston.
Meanwhile Bolton beat the drop in remarkable fashion after beating Nottingham Forest 3-2.
Bolton were going down with three minutes left when Forest led 2-1 after goals from Ben Osborn (70) and Jack Colback (79) overturning Adam Le Fondre's early volley.
But David Wheater (87) and Aaron Wilbraham (88) scored to keep the Wanderers in the division to the delight of their delirious home crowd.  AFP

state-owned enterprises
Challenges for reform
World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives, Dr. Idah PswarayiRidihough said recently that a staggering loss amounting to Rs. 460 billion was suffered by the 400 State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in 2016. She added that the government is contributing more to its public-sector enterprise than receiving from it.
These losses continue to have high negative impact on our fiscal costs. Over the years, most of these establishments have reported significant persistent operating losses. As the World Bank Country Director says bailing out these public enterprises by the Government will be an unimaginable task.
The SOEs represent a major role of Sri Lankas public-sector institutions. Therefore, the Governments urgent attention to the issue is of paramount importance.
The World Bank also sought a citizens perspective on SOEs. The results showed 38 per cent were disapproving the performance of public enterprises and 36 per cent commented on their poor service quality.
According to the World Bank Country Director, some of the key factors attributed to the poor performance of these government-run institutions were political interference, the need for better corporate governance, lack of transparency and improving performance monitoring and evaluation.
Professional management
Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya is in agreement with the comments made by the World Bank Country Director. Addressing a forum on good governance recently, he said, There continues to be a lack in the professional management of state-owned-public enterprises. There have been many political appointments at top levels. We have always maintained that the boards of directors and chairmen should be dynamic professionals who are well-versed on the enterprise, industry and its market, and not friends and family members.
Speaker of Parliament also highlighted that the recent COPE Committee reported a number of serious concerns of SOEs, which require immediate action. The concerns include lack of transparency and accountability, lack of professional management of public enterprises, financial indiscipline, irregularities, manipulations and malpractices, including large-scale frauds and corporate failures, ineffective progress review and performance monitoring, ineffective internal controls, risk management practices and audit and inadequate disclosures in financial reporting, among others.
There are four words which come to this writers mind when he thinks of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Sri Lanka. These are efficiency, competitiveness, innovation and integrity. Unfortunately, when you go through reports of our SOEs, most of them do not have these qualities embedded in their management strategies.
SOEs are commercial enterprises owned by the Government, in full or in part. Many SOEs provide essential public goods and services like water, electricity, and transportation. With great variation in SOE models across nations and industries, what can we learn from others to improve our SOE governance
When we study countries like China, UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Brazil, Norway and Thailand, we realise that many SOEs are already applying best practices to improve delivery of services that societies need, as pressures like market globalization, technological advances, and deregulation require them to enhance competitiveness.
Four challenges
In 2004, the OECD published Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises. In July 2015, a revised version was released. These guidelines provided the international benchmarks, serving to strengthen any SOE management.
When we consider SOEs in Sri Lankan context, we come across four key challenges needing urgent reform.
(1) Clarification of the roles and responsibilities of the Government as an SOE owner (not a manager). This goal requires a tricky balance, between the Governments active ownership responsibilities (like appointing boards and providing oversight), and the need to maintain a level-playing field for market competition. To make it a reality, two key conditions are needed: (a) clear legal and regulatory framework, including corporate codes, and (b) a strong coordinating entity for oversight.
(2) Appointment of qualified and independent persons to SOE boards. All board appointments be based on merit (not political affiliation). This points to the need for a unified minimum standard for SOE boards. And, Board members must be allowed to take independent decisions within the parameters of Government policies.
(3) Instillation of an organisational culture of efficiency, integrity, competitiveness and innovation in SOEs. This goal requires integrating Corporate Governance as part of SOE DNA. To do this, higher management should apply stringent internal controls and risk management systems. More broadly, this also means ensuring, that principles of transparency, accountability, and ethics are widely respected and upheld. Integrity includes issues of gender equality and social inclusion and being more responsive to demands of local communities.
(4) Secure political commitment for reforms. In order for SOEs to implement best practices, formal Government agreements should be available. Without those, efforts to make and maintain reforms when administrations change are likely to fail.
The globally accepted duty of the Board is to protect the assets of the shareholders and ensure that they receive a good return on their investment. Boards are also the highest governing authority. Additional duties of the board include the appointment of CEO and in some cases executive management. The Board of directors also are expected to protect the environment, society and employees.
Energising economy
Throughout the world, successful countries have leveraged their SOEs to improve the economic well-being of its citizens. China, for example, has seen a tremendous growth in its SOEs, since its economic boom era. India and Brazil are also examples of nations whose failing SOEs have turned around and now contribute to the well-being of its citizens as well as contribute to the overall economic success of the nation. Surprisingly even Gulf monarchies (like UAE) have successfully leveraged their SOEs, which are well managed and highly profitable.
There is a change in the thinking of capitalist economists about SOEs. They have taken a shift away from liberal orthodoxy. Now they acknowledge that SOEs have a role to play in nation building, particularly, in developing economies. They recommend active, targeted industrial policies to enable long term growth.
SOEs in Sri Lanka were established and tasked with delivering quality service while energising the economy to drive economic growth. The citizens of this country had great expectations but most of SOE shave fallen far short of potential and expectations.
There is also growing concern that the failure of SOEs will lead to the further decline of the Sri Lankan economy. The time is ripe for the Government to step in. This writer suggests that we take a lesson from South African experience.
South African experience
In May 2010, the President of South Africa commissioned a Presidential State-Owned Enterprises Review Committee to recommend proposals to strengthen the role of state-owned enterprises.
A key recommendation of the Committee had been that the government should enact a single over-arching law  the State-Owned Entities Act  which would govern all SOEs, as South African legislation on SOES at that time was fragmented and was often conflicting. They also recommended a SOE Council of Ministers from the relevant ministries, Treasury and other relevant stakeholders, should be established to oversee implementation of the Act and to enable collaboration between SOEs and government departments at all levels.
Sri Lanka faces the same situation. A research paper published in May 2016 on the state of state-owned-enterprises in Sri Lanka says: Most comprehensive information we could get was in the Treasury Annual report, which summarised financial information of only 55SOEs; those which the General Treasury classifies as strategically important
According to the Treasury, Sri Lanka has only 245 State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), yet there is no single document from which information on their size or performance can be extracted.
South African experience is worth getting Governments consideration!

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) will submit a report to court tomorrow (9) on the investigation nto the recent arrest of a senior official of the Presidential Secretariat and the chairman of a state corporation on charges of bribery.
CIABOC Commissioner Neville Guruge told the Daily News that the report will include the Commissions findings on the above incident.
Earlier, the two officials were remanded till May 9 after being produced in court. The Presidents Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation Chairman P Dissanayake were arrested while they were allegedly accepting a Rs. 20 million bribe from an Indian businessman last Thursday.
It is said that the bribe was a part payment from the total payment (bribe) of Rs.100 million. Although the bribe was allegedly originally decided to be Rs. 540 million, it was decreased to Rs.100 million after negotiations. The bribe was alleged to be about speeding up the process of obtaining approval for shares in the Kantale Sugar Factory. President Maithripala Sirisena issued an order on Thursday to interdict the two officials with immediate effect.

Provide soft loans for solar power panels
I thank Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyabalapitiya for his great enthusiasm and efforts in providing solar power panel to all schools in Sri Lanka.
I greatly appreciate his sincere gratitude of reciprocating the people of the Kegalle District for electing him to parliament for 18 years by providing solar panels to each and every house. His first initiative is very much laudable to give the solar panels to schools where rural and remote schools would be greatly benefitted.
Getting solar power panels to households costs immensely for the consumers. They will not think of getting it unless the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy finds a method of assisting them through providing soft interest-free loans.
I agree that Sri Lanka may be the only country, providing power round the clock, but there are defects and shortcomings of the CEB employees who fail to provide electricity for 24 hours. In my area, Aranayaka, Dippitiya, Mawatahagoda, the supply is interrupted at least for a day every week for more than seven hours. We have to inform the hotline to restore the supply but getting them online is a Herculean task.
While appreciating the minister for his commitment to providing electricity cheaper to the consumers by fixing solar power panels, I request him to look into the above matter too.

Colombo will be free of slums by 2023 - Patali
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said there will be revolutionary changes in urban development in the next five years and Colombo will be free of slums by 2023.
He said the government is bringing all existing slums within the formal system and enabling them to avail the basic amenities that are available for the rest of the city. The Minister was speaking at the Jathika Hela Urumaya May Day rally at New Town hall in Colombo yesterday.
The Minister said that 70 per cent of the population in Colombo were living in slums and efforts of successive governments to find a viable solution had not yielded desired results.
Minister Ranawaka said the government plans to build five secondary cities within Colombo. We will build a new city for the Colombo North people. We will also build 10,000 new houses at the Henamulla new town. The Urban Development Authority will provide 20,000 new houses to people by 2020. In addition, secondary cities will come up in Dematagoda, Kolonnawa, Maligawatte and Colombo East, the minister said noting that this will ensure adequate proper housing for slum dwellers. "Under the Megapolis programme, the entire Western Province will be developed as a mega city ensuring equal opportunities for every citizen," Minister Ranawaka said.
"Modernizing the transport system, enhancing livelihood of underserved families and waste management will be given priority in the drive for establishing a Megapolis," the Minister said.
We were able to give a permanent solution to the citys garbage problem he added.
Then Minister charged that during the previous regime, slums were demolished and those lands were given to confidantes by those responsible.
"The entire Western Province will be a Megapolis area by 2030, which ensures equal opportunities for all," the Minister said.

Dion joins forces with Deadpool for new song
Superstar Celine Dion has formed an unlikely duo with Ryan Reynolds' movie alter ego Deadpool for her new music video.
The My Heart Will Go On hitmaker has been recruited for Ashes, an original song for the soundtrack to the upcoming Deadpool 2 release, and she is joined in the accompanying promo by Reynolds, dressed as his cheeky Marvel anti-hero.
The video features Celine belting out the tune at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, where she stages her Las Vegas residency, as the mutant mercenary performs an interpretive dance - all while wearing high heels to top off his full-body red and black costume. The odd pair also shares a warm embrace towards the end of the track.

Myanmars Rohingya crisis
A failure of democracy
In a recent lecture on Myanmar: The Rohingya Refugee Crisis, Roots of the Conflict and Possibilities for the Future at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI), Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy discussed her role as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar.
Highlighting Myanmar specifically, she observed the failures of South Asian democracy in general to accommodate ethnic pluralism.
Following is an excerpt from her lecture:
People of Myanmar
Except for Rakhine state and the Rohingyas, much of Myanmarese history is uncontested. Unless we discuss it, we will not be able to understand the ideology and the fervour that guides modern Myanmar. The parallels with Sri Lankan history are remarkably similar.
Myanmar was first populated by a Tibeto Burmanspeaking people who adopted Buddhism and who were called the Pyu. The Burmans of today find their origins in this historical development. Throughout history there were many other migrations from lower Thailand, China, Bangladesh and India. The plural reality of Myanmar cannot be negated.
While the porousness of borders and the migrations and invasions of tribes and groups are part of the peopling of modern Myanmar, the ideology of the state that prevails even today was solidified in King Anawrahtas rule in the 11th century. Elements of the ideology were always there, but he brought them together in a concerted way.
The government of Myanmar officially recognises 135 ethnic groups. These groups are then amalgamated into eight major national ethnic races. They are the Bamar or Burmans, who comprise 66% of the population, the Chin, the Kachin, the Kayin, or Karen, the Kayar or Karenni, the Mon, the Rakhine and the Shan.
All seven groups other than the Bamar or Burmans, who are the majority, have waged war against the Burmese and later, the Myanmarese state. There are also groups that are not recognised by the Constitution, for example, Burmese Chinese, Burmese Indians, Burmese Gurkhas, Burmese Pakistanis, Anglo Burmese and the Rohingyas. The Rohingyas are adamant that they should not be in this category, because they see themselves as an ethnic, indigenous minority. However, successive Burmese and Myanmarese governments have referred to them as Bengalis.
In contrast to the plural reality, the ideology of the Burmese, put together by King Anawrahta, remains the dominant discourse in Myanmar. The ideology is very strong and anyone who does not share it is often looked upon as an outsider.
Colonialism also marked Myanmar in a brutal way, as did World War II. After negotiations with the British, General Aung San secured independence for Burma in January 1947. Then came the challenge that would dog Myanmar for the rest of its post-independence history: the problem of ethnic minorities.
radicalism
Buddhism has been a constant factor in Myanmars history. But democracy in 2015 brought about unforeseen trajectories. There is also a great deal that has been written about Buddhist radicalism and its role in raising anti-Muslim furor during the Rohingya crisis, including using Facebook to mobilise hate speech. At the recent Senate hearings, Mark Zuckerberg was questioned specifically about the use of Facebook as a platform for hate in Myanmar. He has made it clear that Facebook will soon have a policy and practice on hate speech and Myanmar was the initial eye-opener.
In Myanmar, the Association for the Protection of Race and Religion (MaBhaTha) in particular has received a great deal of negative publicity. The extremist views of the organisation are well known and have been publicised the world over. They were responsible for the Population Control Law of 2015 primarily aimed at the Rohingyas and the Buddhist Womens Special Marriage Law which requires a special registration process and which punishes the man if he attempts to convert his wife, the Religious Conversion Law that requires a special process for conversion from Buddhism - not the other way around - including an interview with a special Board set up for this purpose, and the adoption of the Monogamy Law. Most of these laws reflect a fear that some Buddhists have of the Muslim presence in Myanmar.
Because of their influence, it would be wrong to caricature and dismiss the MaBaTha. It is a parallel phenomenon occurring in many of our societies all over South Asia and globally. These radical religious organisations belonging to different faiths have widespread grassroot support. MaBaTha feels that Buddhism is under threat in Myanmar, and despite its heated and unconscionable rhetoric, many Buddhists see it as providing protection and social services. Its intolerance of Muslims is particularly worrisome if we are seeking long-term solutions to the Rohingya problem.
Starting in September 2007, economic and political protests for democracy rocked the country. The monks of the Shwedagon Pagoda led the way. The protests were suppressed and thousands arrested and detained. And yet they paved the way for the roadmap that eventually brought democracy to Myanmar. But for most Burmese - and I will deal with this later - democracy meant majority rule. It did not include pluralism.
Misery for the Rohingyas
Since democracy came to Rakhine State, the civilian conflict between the ethnic Buddhist Rakhine, who have strong state and military patronage, and the Muslim Rohingyas, who are stateless, has led to the Rohingyas being called one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.
Independence then brought a type of misery for the Rohingyas. General Aung San initially recognised them as an indigenous nationality. Rohingya leaders were part of the independence movement. But under Army rule from 1962 they have faced an accelerated deprivation of rights. The 1982 Citizenship Law only gave citizenship to those ethnic groups that were in Myanmar before the British came. The Rohingyas, according to the military, did not qualify. The Citizenship Law of 1982 denied Rohingyas citizenship and therefore they became stateless.
Since democracy came to Myanmar, human rights groups have chronicled restrictions placed on Rohingya freedom of movement, access to state hospitals, access to state education, and appointment to civil service jobs. Under the watch of the democracy government, the four laws I mentioned earlier - on population control, the marriage of Buddhist women, conversions, and the Monogamy Law - came into effect. Amnesty International has condemned this network of laws and practices as a system of apartheid.
Events of August 25, 2017
Now let us move to the events of August 25, 2017, that have brought such international outrage and anger. There have been previous military operations in Rakhine state, in 1978 and 1992 to be specific, during the time of the military junta that sent parts of the Rohingya population across the border to Bangladesh. About 200,000 fled in 1978 and a similar number in 1992. After both these events, repatriation agreements were signed with Bangladesh and most of the Rohingyas returned. As I said, strangely, it was the rise of democracy that brought terrible insecurity to the Rohingyas, as the government attempted to meet the grievances of the majority local Buddhist Rakhine population that had developed a terrible intolerance toward the Muslim Rohingyas.
In 2012, there were a series of conflicts, some called them riots, others called them pogroms, between the ethnic Rakhine and the Rohingyas. The situation occurred after the rape of a Rakhine Buddhist girl and a reprisal for that rape. The government removed the Rohingyas from the census, classifying them as stateless Bengali Muslims, and declared a state of emergency. Under a state of emergency, the Rohingyas feared for their lives and we have, since 2012, the boat people phenomenon, where Rohingyas would hire boats and head for the high seas to seek asylum in neighbouring countries that were, initially, not very hospitable. Many also died at sea. Our Navy rescued Rohingyas in 2008, 2013 and 2017. I will not dwell on what happened to the very few who were saved by our Navy in 2017 when they were put up in safe houses. It was truly a dark moment in our history.
In October 2016, a new actor emerged on the scene in the Rakhine - a group called ARSA - the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. Their appearance took the crisis to another level.
After the October events, the Myanmar armed forces began what they called clearance operations, moving some of their seasoned soldiers into the region. They also armed and trained Rakhine Buddhist civilians, according to military experts and media sources. On August 25, ARSA struck again, asking its cells over WhatsApp to attack police stations.
Unlike in October 2016, this time the security forces were in a clearance operations mode, supported by some ethnic Rakhine civilians. Within months, nearly 700,000 Rohingyas had fled to Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh. Since 2015, it is estimated that around 900,000 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh. When we met them, they were tired, bloodied and traumatized. I was given the task of interviewing the victims of sexual assault. It was one of the worst experiences of my life.
First, the government of Myanmar put the blame on ARSA, which it called a terrorist organisation. It claimed there may have been some incidents where their soldiers were responsible, but they were a very few. They insist that the burning of villages and mass exodus was forced by ARSA to put the Myanmarese government in a bad light. They also argue that ARSA attacked ethnic Buddhists and Hindus living in the region.
Second, in contrast to the government, the Rohingya leaders in Coxs Bazar claimed that this violence was a result of so called clearance operations. They do not mention ARSA. The purpose of the military, according to them, was to kill or drive out all the Rohingyas and in this they were hand in glove with some local ethnic Rakhine leaders and youth who accompanied the military in these clearance operations. They allege that whole villages were burnt down, which a BBC journalist actually witnessed when he broke away from his government minders, and there was murder, rape of the worst kind, torture, and forced deportation.
Third, human rights groups, working extensively in Coxs Bazar, generally confirm the Rohingya version of events. Though they accept that the ARSA attacks took place, they argue that the disproportionate response to shotguns, knives, machetes and slingshots is an outrage. Some civil society groups have called what happened in August 2017, genocide. The key to genocide as a crime is what is termed genocidal intent, the intent to commit genocide, i.e., to destroy a people in whole or part for national, ethnic, racial or religious reasons. Because of this intent factor, genocide is a very hard crime to prosecute in a court of law.
Fourth, the UN system has also responded to the August 2017 events. The Secretary General and the High Commissioner for Refugees have called what happened ethnic cleansing and the High Commissioner for Human Rights in his recent statement said that genocide could not be ruled out and asked for an accountability mechanism to follow the Fact Finding Mission.
The Fact Finding Mission, of which I am a part, was set up by a resolution passed in the Human Rights Council in March 2017. We began work in August 2017 just when the attacks were being launched in Northern Rakhine. We were asked to establish the facts and circumstances of alleged recent human rights violations by military, and security forces and abuses in Myanmar, in particular in Rakhine state. We cannot prosecute, we can only gather facts. We ourselves visited Coxs Bazar, Thailand and Malaysia to listen to the evidence they had gathered.
Myanmar denied us access. In the beginning we thought this would be huge problem, but in an information-savvy world it has not been so difficult to gather evidence. We have the testimony of eyewitnesses and our teams as well as ourselves were out there just after the events when the evidence was raw. I, for one, met victims of sexual violence who not only recounted horrific tales, but showed me their mind-boggling scars. Anyone who has interviewed victims over a long period of time can tell when one is genuine and traumatised and when someone is making it up. These women we met, screened by our team, were very genuine.
What we found
Let me say what we presented to the Human Rights Council in March this year. We collected a concrete and overwhelming body of information and materials that point to the most serious kind of human rights violations, in all likelihood leading to crimes under international law.
The questions now are, what is the nature of the crime committed, does the evidence point to genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or just large-scale human rights violations Was the response of the government proportionate If indeed there was an attack, who were the perpetrators What are the relevant facts that need to be verified If there were perpetrators, how should they be held accountable and finally, have domestic remedies been exhausted
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has suggested an independent investigative mechanism to prepare for prosecutions by the General Assembly where there is widespread anger on the Rohingya issue and no Chinese veto. The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has filed a submission that because Bangladesh has signed the ICC, the issue of forced deportation, which is a crime against humanity, can be looked at by the Court in The Hague. There is still no ruling on jurisdiction. We will examine and evaluate all these options and recommend what we feel is most appropriate. If such a mechanism is set up, our report and its archives will be part of the investigation.
Future possibilities
The nature and scale of violence was unprecedented and the use of the civilian population in the campaign meant that your neighbours were against you. Secondly, all the villages have been bulldozed, including the trees and vegetation, so returnees will find it difficult to identify their homes and villages. This has been a very difficult situation for them, which was not the case earlier. Still, some may return as evident from those clutching to their heart the ID and verification cards that give them some connection to Myanmar. Only a generous repatriation package with citizenship guarantees can truly entice them to return.
With regard to those who remain, we hope some will be resettled by Bangladesh, while those who have given so much political support to their cause will open their door and take a quota each. If about 15 countries agree, this may occur. If not, there will be a permanent refugee population in Coxs Bazar like Gaza, Lebanon or Eastern Congo. Deprived of a state and access to higher education and jobs, it will become a breeding ground for disaffection and radicalization, something that has to be avoided. At the moment non-Myanmarese military experts say that ARSA is a homegrown movement with few international connections. But, as you know, this can change overnight.
As for Myanmar in general, as long as the military does not cooperate, remains hardline and suspicious of reforms, nothing will happen in Myanmar. First, the military remains popular and secondly, any uprising against them will result in unacceptable levels of violence. We must remember that democracys reappearance was because reformists within the military helped broker a breakthrough. In the future too, reformers from the military must be able to give up power and transform Myanmar into a fully-fledged democracy.
I will, finally, come back to the question that has been a hard lesson for me to swallow. In the late 20th century and the first part of the 21st century, we have understood democracy to mean inclusiveness and the participation of everyone on equal terms. However, for most of its history from Greek times, democracy has meant majority rule, sometimes seeing some minorities, ethnic or political, as toxic and anti-national.
Mukul Kesavan has written extensively on majorities in Asia, especially South Asia, including Myanmar.
He finds that majoritarian democracies that openly reject universal values and minorities, both ethnic and political, are becoming a terrifying new norm in place of cultures that used to be so tolerant of diversity. He actually calls them murderous majorities. We also have murderous minorities. A few of us in the womens movement just wrote a letter to the Indian Ambassador expressing concern over the brutal gang rape of an eight-year-old girl by Hindu custodians in a temple to terrorise a nomadic Muslim community. So, Myanmar for all the media hype, is not an exception in the Asian region.
We are all being shouted at by voices that expect our silence. How do we then augment ideas of democracy with notions of diversity, pluralism and power-sharing There is so much fear and insecurity and a sense that ones survival is at stake that it is sometimes difficult to even open the dialogue. It is the elephant in all our rooms.
We must deal with it, we have to have those conversations and express our solidarity across ethnic, religious and political lines - solidarity not in detailed political programmes, though that will also be useful, but solidarity with regard to our values and the faith we have in each others humanity.

Five habits that are making your lips dark
Healthy pink lips are an appealing feature of one's face. A feature no one misses to spot, pink lips add charm to every woman and man's face. But several factors like ageing, sun damage can actually take a toll on the lips and turn them dark with time. There are several ways you can actually make your lips luscious and pink again. But, have you ever wondered what causes dark lips Here are five habits that are making your lips darker slowly.
Not moisturising your lips
Dry and chapped lips can cause the discolouration of lips.To keep your lips healthy, it is important to hydrate. Apply a good lip balm to nourish your lips. Look for ingredients like cocoa butter, shea butter, etc
Not removing the dead skin
Out lips tend to lose moisture easily as it is the skinniest layer of the skin on our face. To get rid of chapped and dry lips, you must exfoliate on a regular basis to remove the dead skin and keep your lips healthy.
Skipping the sunblock
Just like your skin, your lips can get a sunburn too. Hence, you must protect your lips from the harsh UV rays. Apply a lip balm which has SPF 30 before you head out of the house.
Smoking
Dark lips can also be caused by regular smoking. Once you inhale a cigarette smoke, the nicotine and tar transfers on the lips, which causes the discolouration eventually.
Lack of lip care
When it comes to skincare, we tend to ignore the lip care. From moisturising to exfoliation, you must include the lips in your skincare routine too! To improve the appearance of your lips, you can massage almond oil every night. Regular massaging will help to regulate the blood flow, making them luscious. Times of India

A gift called love..!
They sat together on the rocks and watched the waves come in. She felt his arms around her and she felt safe and secure. Thank you, God, she whispered, for giving me somebody who loves me so much and who I love so very much she heard the sound of the soothing waters and she nuzzled closer into his strong muscular arms.
She must have dosed for a few minutes, but she suddenly was all alert. She felt his arms, they were not around her. His hands had left her shoulders and were slowly tracing a circle around her neck. She felt herself stirring with desire and turned to him. His hands were now like roaming tentacles and she felt his passion, his movements. He tried to lay her down on the rocks. No, she whispered, No
Why not he asked, a little too roughly. We are going to be married. Its okay.
When we are married itll be okay, she said with a smile.
I thought you loved me, he said gruffly, his passion unabated.
Very much, she said. I had a dream just now when I dozed off. I dreamt I was outside my body and that I was walking towards it. My body was like a temple, like the house of God. And there were lights inside my body and the lights shone out for all to see!
See what he asked with a smile.
See that God was dwelling inside the temple.
Inside your body he asked incredulously.
Strange, isnt it she asked looking at him with a smile. But I saw my body was the house of God and he was living in me.
The waves from the sea gently splashed against the rocks and there was a silence between the two young lovers.
If God dwells in your body, he said slowly, it is a holy place.
If God dwells in my body, she said, I need to keep myself holy for him.
He looked at her and slowly put his arms around her again. She felt his strength and sureness and also the fact he had understood.
He dwells in you too, she said with a smile.
I know, he said and looked at her with eyes of love.
We need to keep ourselves pure and holy for God to continue abiding in us, she whispered. I wonder why I dreamt there were lights inside my body
Lights for others to see God in you, he said simply.
They watched the sea as it gently kissed the rocks and they felt their eyes on each other. They turned to each other and their faces drew close in love as their lips touched each other. Do you know something he whispered. I love you so much now that I do not lust for your body.
Our bodies are Gods holy temple, she whispered, as she held him close and thanked God for a gift called love..!

A global accolade
The internal conflict in Sri Lanka ended exactly nine years ago, but it is always very difficult to heal the wounds of war. Sri Lanka is not alone in this respect - more than 70 years after the Second World War, some survivors are still suffering from pain and anguish. That is the nature of war. But after any war comes an even harder part. How do you come to terms with those terrible events and still work towards peace
President Mahinda Rajapaksas Government had a golden opportunity to bring the country together and work towards lasting peace in the immediate aftermath of the war, but the primal urge of triumphalism and communalism took over. They squandered every opportunity to achieve peace and reconciliation, but the world took notice. Under intense international pressure, the Government appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) which later suggested a series of measures to achieve reconciliation.
However, it fell upon the National Unity Government elected in 2015 to implement its recommendations. Along with the LLRC recommendations, the Government also launched a series of other measures aimed at reconciling the various communities and religious groups, from releasing civilian lands held by the military to starting work on a new Constitution. One outstanding feature of the Governments reconciliation campaign was the active participation and contribution of the wider civil society.
These efforts have been noticed internationally. UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Miroslav Lajck has cited Sri Lanka as a successful example of how civil society could collaborate with the Government on peace building. He has made references to Sri Lankas peace building efforts during both the opening and closing remarks of the High Level Meeting on Peace Building and Sustaining Peace which was held at the UN Headquarters in New York from April 24-26. He also cited an example of how Sri Lankas civil society made a contribution to the Governments efforts on drafting a reconciliation and peace building programme for the country.
Speaking at the High Level Meeting, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York Ambassador Rohan Perera also highlighted the initiatives undertaken by the Government on reconciliation and peace building. Ambassador Perera emphasized the importance of prevention of conflicts, as reflected in the Secretary Generals Report on Peace Building and Sustaining Peace, as a factor that would save countless lives and resources that could be used for a countrys development. Sri Lankas efforts of engaging the Diaspora in peace building initiatives was also highlighted. Earlier, the Government successfully articulated the progress made in accountability and human rights spheres at the sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, which was praised by the International Community.
This international recognition is a vindication of the Governments efforts at reconciliation and nation building. It is also an indication that the Government is going in the right direction with regard to reconciliation. In President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka has two leaders who are genuinely committed to reconciliation. They envision a Sri Lanka where people belonging to all communities and religions live in harmony.
In fact, this was the norm in Sri Lanka until the war tore various communities apart. Post-conflict, there are extremist groups in various communities who do not want to see racial harmony. Such elements were behind the recent troubles in Ampara, Digana and Ginthota, which dented the countrys image internationally. The Government acted swiftly to quell the disturbances, but even more importantly, is taking steps to prevent any repetition of such ugly incidents. Social media sites such as Facebook, where most of the hate campaigns are conducted, have promised to work with the Government to take down such content and expel the uploaders from the respective platforms. They also plan to recruit people conversant with the countrys two vernacular languages to monitor offensive content.
Having suffered for 30 long years from a disastrous conflict, Sri Lankans should be determined not to slide again to ethnic or religious discord. Reconciliation should thus begin from our neighbourhoods, schools and places of worship. There are plans to teach reconciliation as a formal subject, but the onus should be on parents and teachers to inculcate the value of racial harmony in children from a very young age. As the remarks made at the UN show, the civil society has a major role to play in achieving true reconciliation.
Sri Lankans need to stop thinking along ethnic lines at all times. If we meet someone or the first time here or abroad, the first question we ask is are you Sinhala Tamil or Muslim. The key to ethnic harmony is developing a truly Sri Lankan identity, where we think simply as Sri Lankans. Countries such as Singapore have achieved this  if you ask a Chinese-origin resident of Singapore, he or she will say I am a Singaporean without ever mentioning the ethnicity. We need to elevate our attitudes to think as Sri Lankans. Peace and prosperity will elude us as long as we stick to petty ethnic divisions.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said the present government is so incompetent that it cannot even govern a Grama Niladari division.
He said the country has become a police state under the UNP rule and the police has degenerated to such a low level that it now provides security to the weddings of underworld gangsters.
The former President was addressing the Sri Lanka PoduJana Peramuna (SLPP) May Day rally at the Samanagala grounds in Galle yesterday. A large crowd representing the SLPP and its allied parties participated in the rally.
Not a single investor is interested in Sri Lanka today. Investors are leaving the country. Many are eagerly awaiting till the end of this government to make their investment in the country, he said.

Happy world of the scrappy Miss Pippi!
Some names, both fictional and real are unforgettable. Why do female literary characters stay with readers long after theyve finished the books these personalities are featured in Often, its due to the intimacy with which readers have come to know a character.
Take Jane Eyre , for example, who becomes so real to readers that they feel as if theyve met and understood this amazing female personality. Also, Scarlett O'Hara the central character in Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind, Mary Poppins, the magical British nanny and George Bernard Shaws Eliza Doolittle are all fictional protagonists unlikely to be forgotten.
My kid sister Ann must have been around 14 when I was a young adult journalist. As all nangas usually do she made some telling demands on both my time and my rather impoverished financial portfolio at the time. She once insisted on my buying her favourite books for leisure reading. Being in an altruistic mood I queried whether she would fancy a set of Enid Blyton paperbacks.
She spun around eyes blazing and fired: Enid Blyton! Enid Blyton! Thats just kids-stuff! What do you take me for! A baby  Taken aback I apologised and said in my most appeasing tone that she could choose her own literature. You see, my diminutive baby sis, growing up under the shadow of three rough-and-tumble older brothers was as the Yanks would describe quite a tough cookie.
She said that her mind was set on books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. I conceded that I had never heard of her and inquired what the books were about. She eyed me with what seemed a pitying look reserved for a moron and exclaimed: The books are a rage all over the world. Everyone knows the name of the famous character Lindgren writes about. She is more famous than your wicked James Bond!
Feeling a total ignoramus, I sought enlightenment . And what is the name of this renowned character The answer sounded like a thunderclap in my ear. Why, Pippi! Pippi Longstocking! Stunned, I asked her to repeat the name and she did with a tuneful rendition of her fictional heroines theme song: I am Pip-pi Longgggstocking, how I love my funny na-ame-o!
That did it! The name sounded so darned suggestive, particularly from a Sri Lankan perspective and I believe in the French lingo as well. I inquired whether the books contained some sort of coarse toilet humour. I imagined the contents would include gross jokes replete with repugnant allusions to bathroom fittings. I mean those unmentionable fixtures such as urinals and arsenals. The latter description is credited to a former Kandy municipal councillor while referring to commodes.
Towering over my pint-sized sibling I drawled in my most menacing manner: Sorry, but I am not going to buy you crude reading material. And thats the end of it! She looked at me in a compound of astonishment and anger and remonstrated: Crude! You must be off your flipping nut! Pippi is an angel compared to your dirty James Bond with his farmyard morals and his killer instinct. Just glance through one of Pippis adventures and see for yourself what a heroine she is.
So I strode into a leading Colombo bookshop. The young female sales assistant sported a trainee tag pinned to her blouse. I casually inquired where we could find Pippi Longstocking books. She looked at me in bewilderment and approached two young colleagues chuckling nervously all the way. I repeated my request clearly enunciating the words P-i-p-p-i Longstocking. The trio began tittering fit to die.
An elderly woman supervisor wondering what the amusement was about appeared from the aisle with a no-nonsense glower. One of the trainees, her composure totally out of control, tried to explain between hysterical giggles: He wants ... Pip ... Pip ...Pippi! I repeated my request to the glaring presence as she eyed the giggly gaggle. She smiled benignly saying: Childrens section, Sir. And sorry for the inconvenience. Inconvenience indeed! Relieved I told her that I was not, decidedly not, seeking any sort of other convenience.
I later learned to my utter embarrassment that my initial suspicions about the character Pippi Longstocking did not hold water. She was in truth an unusual young girl. She is financially independent since she owns a sackful of gold pieces. She can shoot a revolver with the skill of a Calamity Jane and sail the seven seas with piratical intent. She is both defiant and kind and can out-lift the strongest man in the world. .
How the heck was I to know that Pippi Longstocking was indeed a girl rebel, who supposedly helped liberate children all over the globe In her storybook world, she has stood up for the weak and oppressed. So it is not strange that the anti-authoritarian Pippi is censored in dictatorships and conservative states and that she has aroused the fury of many tyrannical adults.
I also learned from my chatty sibling that Pippi was the strongest girl in the world. She also dispenses with a burglar by simply lifting him up onto the top of the wardrobe. Naturally, many young readers, especially girls, envy her jolly life and secretly wish they could behave as she does. How the devil was I to know that Pippi girl had for years become a source of inspiration in the struggle for gender equality As far as little sis was concerned Pippi was still the hero of the day.
Subsequently I did read one of the books to be enlightened that she frequently pokes fun at and hoodwinks adults she encounters, and her stance is likely to appeal to young readers. However, Pippi usually reserves her worst behaviour for the most pompous and condescending adults.
One might be constrained to believe that she is a direct descendent of the ageless Peter Pan. And in similarity to that captivating mythological character her life has been an outstanding and wondrous adventure in an escapist Never Never Land of child-like imagination. Throughout the world, girls have been encouraged to have fun, to be a bit more daring and to have faith in their own ability. Pippi Longstocking has performed wonders.
Walking into the pantry I found my sister helping the maid make pancakes. Ann asked me whether I had read the adventures of her heroine. I said I did and enjoyed it thoroughly. If you question why I ran for my life it is because she pursued me with the hot saucepan. And just because I added the amendment: But a girl named Pippi! Surely, it sounds like a brand name more suitable for a sprinkle-tinkle fountain!
So until next week let me bid you farewell in true Brit-style. Cheerio and pip-pip hooray!

I will not retire in 2020 - President

I will not retire in 2020, the President emphasised, addressing a mammoth May Day rally organised by the SLFP led UPFA at Chenkaladi in the Batticaloa district.
The President qualifying his statement said that there are so many other issues to be addressed and solutions to be found.
Certain people posed the question as to whether I would retire in 2020 and social media is flooded with posts suggesting that I would be retiring in 2020. The simple answer is that I would not retire in 2020 as there are many things to be done, the President said.
The country needs honest politicians and the immediate need is for them to come together to serve the country, the President said.
There are so many issues to be resolved and I am not going to retire before solving them. The President posing a question at the audience, queried as to how many of our political leaders are free from murder, corruption and fraud. We need political leaders with an unblemished character.
Some people are day dreaming of establishing a new government in 2020. We shall be with the poor, the down trodden and the intelligentsia.
People can talk of fairy tales but they cannot understand the problems facing the communities, the President said.

Some people say that the party has weakened,but, we have not weakned.There was a time when the SLFP had been reduced to seven seats in Parliament and the party had been divided into several factions, the President said.
We shall make the SLFP a truly Democratic party. I request the people of Mother Lanka to join me in my new programme of work, the President said.
He said that the party will undergo a comprehensive reform drive and he is committed in transforming it to be more people-centric..
To establish peace and harmony in the country, all political leaders must speak the truth and work for a united and undivided Sri Lanka. The need of our is the honest conduct of the politicians, President Sirisena said.
It is to obtain the rights and privileges of the workers that May Day is being observed and the SLFP has won several rights and privileges for the working class, the President added.
To establish peace and harmony in the country,political leaders of all parties must speak the truth and pave the way for a united and undivided Sri Lanka. The need of the hour is the honest conduct of politicians, the President said.

Indian Auto industry begins fiscal year with robust sales
Indias automobile companies started the new financial year on a strong note, with companies posting robust sales in April and predicting continuation of the trend. However, some industry executives said increasing fuel prices could pose challenges to growth.
Maruti Suzuki, which reported a 13.4 per cent increase in sales at 163,434 vehicles in April, continued to drive the market. Though sales of mini cars Alto and WagonR declined 2.8 per cent and those of the utility vehicle portfolio comprising Ertiga, Brezza and S-Cross expanded just 0.8%, the compact section  Swift, Ignis, DZire, Tour S, Baleno and Celerio  posted a strong 31.8 per cent increase in sales.
Maruti SuzukiNSE 0.58 % Chairman RC Bhargava said the market sentiment looked strong, but also flagged the fuel price risk.
The forecast for monsoons is good. People have got used to GST and whatever effect demonetisation had. The only adverse factor is rising fuel costs. Petrol and diesel prices are at an all-time high, which may affect demand to some extent, he said.
Maruti Suzuki expects its sales to grow in double digits this fiscal year. It plans to undertake measures to improve productivity at its manufacturing facilities in Haryana to meet demand. Parent Suzukis Gujarat facility will chip in with an additional 90,000 units in the year through March 2019.
Korean rival Hyundai Motor posted 4.4 per cent growth in local sales at 46,735 units in April. Director for sales and marketing Rakesh Srivastava attributed the growth to the strong performance of the Grand i10, Elite i20, Verna and Creta. These vehicles comprised 79 per cent of the total sales volume for the company in India.
Home-grown Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata MotorsNSE 0.30 % registered 13 per cent (selling 21,927 units) and over 34 per cent (17,235 units) expansion, respectively, in the past month.
The new fiscal for our passenger vehicle business has started on a positive note, said Mayank Pareek, Tata Motors president for the passenger vehicle business unit.
While there were challenges in the market, strong demand for new generation products like Tiago, Tigor, Nexon and Hexa led the growth in April 2018, he said.
Several industry insiders expect passenger vehicle sales to grow in strong single-digits this financial year.
But Anurag Mehrotra, Ford Indias president and managing director, was cautious. Increasing inflation trajectory which might weigh on customers access and cost to credit, coupled with increasing crude prices could lead to passenger vehicle industry growing at low single digits, he said. The American automakers sales in the Indian market dropped 2.5 per cent in April to 7,428 units.

INSEE Cement makes Vesak Pandal from cement
A large number of Vesak sightseers thronged Ranmuthugala, Kadawatha this year and witnessed a unique Vesak pandal built by INSEE Sanstha Cement from cement.
It was illuminated with the customary flickering coloured lights, but what was most unusual was that perhaps for the first time in the world the Vesak Pandal was artistically moulded out of cement. Pradeep Kumara created the pandal along with his friend W. Siripala who designed the murals depicting inspiring Jataka tales etched out and crafted out of cement.
Pradeep, a mason, has been creative and innovative even as a child. This Vesak, he was inspired to make a long lasting pandal out of cement and commenced the task in February. At the end of three months of painstaking work, he had completed a 45 foot tall pandal.
Pradeep used around 50 bags of INSEE Sanstha Cement bags because, as a mason he appreciated the unique features and high quality of the Sanstha Blended Cement he worked with on a daily basis.
Sujeewa Perera, Head of Retail Sales at Siam City Cement , the company that manufactures and markets INSEE branded cement said,  As a blended cement, Sanstha offers Sri Lankan builders the advantage of a cement blended with Calcium Carbonate (CaC03) particles which closes all the pores in the concrete, making it strong.
While most Vesak decorations would perish soon after the festival and would barely last until the following full moon day of Poson, our cement pandal would be a lasting decoration that can be used over many years, making it a cost-effective investment in the long term as it will withstand rain or shine without any protection or cover, commented Pradeep Kumara.

International Thalassaemia Day events in Kandy today
International Thalassaemia Day falls today. This years theme is Thalassaemia, past, present and future: Documenting progress and patients needs worldwide. The national celebration will take place in Kandy, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, the Thalassaemia Walk will commence from Kandy Teaching Hospital premises at 8.30 am today. During the walk, various types of demonstrations will raise awareness of the disease. The thalassaemia screening pilot project for schoolchildren will commence tomorrow in Kandy. Under this screening programme, schoolchildren of the ages 13 and above will be screened free of charge and they will be issued a card mentioning their thalassaemia status. The programme will be extended to the entire Kandy district soon. Thalassaemia is an incurable disease which requires life-long medical treatment and blood transfusions. It is a congenital hereditary disease, when either parent is a thalassaemia gene carrier. The only way of preventing thalassaemia is avoiding the marriage (or at least childbirths) of two thalassaemia gene carriers.
A simple free blood test can reveal whether a person is a thalassaemia gene carrier or not, the sources said.
At present, there are about 2,000 thalassaemia patients in Sri Lanka and annually around 100 new thalassaemia infants born in the country. It costs Rs. 10 million for the government to look after one thalassaemia patient in one year with required medical treatment, blood transfusions etc, the sources added.

Jet Airways to buy 75 Boeing jets
Indian airline Jet Airways has entered an agreement to buy 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in a deal that could be worth more than $7 billion.The countrys second-largest airline made the announcement to the Mumbai stock exchange.
The company did not specify which model of the narrow-body jet it planned to purchase, or whether it had placed a firm order rather than a memorandum of understanding.
The deal could be worth anywhere between $7.2 billion and $9.7 billion, depending on the type of jet acquired and based on list prices. Airlines often negotiate discounts on major orders.
India is witnessing a boom in air travel as its growing middle class takes to the skies. Airlines are rapidly expanding their fleets to capture a slice of this market.
There has been a six-fold increase in passenger numbers over the past decade as Indians take advantage of better connectivity and cheaper fares thanks to a host of low-cost airlines.
The Centre for Aviation based in Australia predicts India will overtake Britain as the worlds third largest market by 2025 and will have 478 million fliers by 2036.
Indias largest airline IndiGo last year announced a deal to buy 50 small planes from French manufacturer ATR.
The majority of Jet Airways fleet is Boeing aircraft. Boeing says the 737 MAX is the fastest-selling airplane in its history, with more than 4,300 orders received.
Vinay Dube, Chief Executive Officer, Jet Airway. This additional order re-emphasises our trust and confidence in Boeing and also reaffirms our commitment to operate extremely modern, reliable and fuel efficient aircraft as part of our fleet.
Jet Airways partnership with Boeing goes back 25 years ever since the airline was conceived and took to the skies. This order underscores Jet Airways commitment to the growth and sustainability of the Indian aviation market

Total foreign purchases decreased by 35.18% W-o-W to LKR 0.78Bn from last weeks value of LKR 1.20Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 0.43Bn relative to LKR 0.86Bn recorded last week (-50.33% W-o-W).
In terms of volume RIL Property & Softlogic Holdings led foreign purchases while Teejay Lanka & Chevron Lubricants led foreign sales. In terms of value RIL Property & JKH led foreign purchases while Chevron Lubricants & Teejay Lanka led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets continued to slide this week, with the broad-share Index losing ~24 points over the week as Wednesdays cabinet reshuffle failed to revive sentiment. Activity levels on the Colombo Bourse remained tepid, as HNI and Institutional investors remained notably absent, pushing average weekly turnover levels down to Rs. 0.50Bn (cf. Rs. 0.62Bn last week and the YTD average of Rs. 1.04Bn). Crossings consequently accounted for just 23% of total market turnover (cf. 32% last week and YTD average of 46%) with large parcels in just three stocks (RIL, JKH and CTC) amounting to Rs.0.46Bn of market turnover.
Despite the dull activity levels and the Index making W-o-W losses, the ASPI remained stubbornly about the 6500-mark to close ~7 points above this key level. Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to buy local stocks for the 3rd consecutive week; although the pace of net inflows have slowed relative to the start of the year, net inflows to the CSE have resumed since late-April.
With the exception of 3-weeks, one of which included the strategic sale of LOLC, foreign flows to the CSE in 2018 have been consistently positive. Equities in April recovered marginally from the losses made over March, gaining 0.8% over the month to trim down some of Marchs 1.1% loss.
The YTD return on the ASPI consequently rose to 1.9% but remains notably lower than the 6.7% return recorded in the comparable period last year. Heightened political uncertainty since March has increased return volatility, with the ASPIs positive returns over January (+1.7%) and February (+1.2%) reversing to a negative 1.1% in March. Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain their current dull momentum.
Foreign Flows to SL Move Contrary to Global Norm
Investor appetite for EM/FM assets appear to be losing some of its luster amid i) signs that the US Fed may increase its pace of rate increases and, ii) global growth appearing to be desynchronizing and shifting toward U.S. outperformance. The IIF estimates that foreign portfolio flows to Emerging markets halted in April, resulting in an outflow of $200 million.
Although this isnt substantial when compared to the average monthly inflows of $10Bn these markets have habitually attracted, it remains the 1st outflow since Nov16. Risk appetite has waned across asset classes, with the MSCI EM Index (ie: equities) falling for 3 consecutive months to record its longest slump since end-2015 and beginning of 2016, and Debt indices recording its worst monthly loss (since Nov16) while the MSCI index tracking EM currencies has declined 1.65%1.
Sri Lankan debt & equity market performance however, bucked this general trend to recover somewhat in Apr18. Foreign holdings of domestic T-bill/bonds recovered over April after two consecutive months of declines (holdings fell 2.37% M-o-M in Feb18 & 0.51% M-o-M in Mar18), to increase 1.4% M-o-M.
The Colombo Bourses net outflow position as at end-March (Rs.2.7Bn) meanwhile, reverted to a net buying position over April, helping trim the YTD equity sell-off down to Rs. 0.94Bn.
Indeed, when excluding the Rs. 12.8 Bn strategic sale in LOLC (by Japans Orix Holdings), the YTD net position on the Colombo Bourse changes to a net inflow of Rs. 11.9Bn, in line with the Rs. 15.8Bn inflow recorded in the same period last year and relative to the Rs. 17.7Bn recorded for the full year of 2017 which proved to be an exceptionally strong year for EM/FM assets.

Lester's award stolen by professional thieves
Five persons arrested in connection with the theft of the Golden Peacock Award belonging to late veteran Sri Lankan film maker Dr. Lester James Peries were professional thieves, the Police said yesterday.
In addition to the Golden Peacock Award, the Police had found a very expensive phone which was stolen by the same group of suspects from the late film makers house and arrested a sixth suspect who had bought the phone.
They were later remanded until May 21 after being produced in Courts.
Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera told the media yesterday that the group had been stealing valuable items from places where large crowds were present, like funerals.
They had been targeting such gatherings especially held at residences of affluent people.
The Police had also arrested the person who had purchased the stolen mobile phone from the suspects, a resident of Nawalapitiya.
The Police said the camera footage taken on the funeral day by both journalists and others had helped them to identify the suspects.
The suspects had been apprehended during a raid conducted by a special police team in the Kaduwela, Mathugama and Nawalapitiya areas.
The Police said the gang had used a three wheeler to get away after stealing the award.
The suspects were identified as residents of Kandy, Kaduwela, Nawalapitiya, Gampola, Hiniduma.
The Golden Peacock Award was thought to have gone missing last Wednesday (May 2) at the time religious obsevances were been performed prior to the remains of Dr.Lester James Peries were taken to the Independence Square for the last rights.
The suspects under interrogation had told Police that they feared due to the extensive publicity given by all media organisations related to the theft of the Golden Peacock Award.
Therefore, the suspects had said they had abandoned the idea of selling it as it would be easily identified and later decided to abandon the award by placing it on the head rack of a private bus which plies the Kaduwela to Kollupitiya.
Dr.Lester James Peries received the Golden Peacock Award in 1965 at the Delhi Film Festival for directing the movie "Gamperaliya."

In Lionel Wendts orbit
Lionel Wendt. That name is now chiselled into a theatre. Even those who have not heard of him  or heard him play the piano - know his name. They come across some of his works without being aware of his entitlement to the authorship.
In the biography of Lionel Wendt, Sampath Bandara takes stock of his versatility in one paragraph.
Lionel Wendt was an internationally reputed photographer; a consummate pianist; a lover of the cinema; a forerunner in the art of criticism; a collector of art; a sponsor of fledgeling artists; a sponsor and advisor of art. At the same time, he was the founder of the first ever collective effort of modern artists and art lovers in Sri Lanka, the 43 Group. More than even all this, it was Lionel Wendt who channelled national art into a new venue. There are many practitioners of the art in the country. It is those who bring about change and veer art into new directions, who gift society something precious and new, who are treasured and valued in the world, constantly remembered and always honoured.
With that paragraph installed in the preface, the biographical text ambles along the pages with rare photographs of Wendt himself and the ones he had captured. Plus, Wendt was a barrister by profession. He earned the reputation of an international photographer owing to his work exhibited in London under the sponsorship of Leica Cameras, a rare honour. Flipping through the book  rather than reading  one may feel that the legendary artist deserves far more than a printed biography. He deserves a museum.
Thats where the LWMF fits in. Established as a charitable trust in 1946, the Fund came to be under the patronage of Harold Peiris later on. Peiris, a close associate of Lionel Wendt, was genuinely interested in preserving his friends legacy for posterity.
The preservation has one major objective: development of the arts by stimulating an interest in it, as a press release from the Lionel Wendt Art Centre indicates.
Consequently, Lionel Wendts residence, Alborodo, was offered to set up the Lionel Wendt Art Centre. That was 1953  nine years after Wendt passed away - and Sri Lankan art has come a long way since then. The Art Centre, where his legendary work is showcased, will not suffice. The LWMF wants to go a step beyond.
As the only official organisation dedicated to preserving the Lionel Wendt legacy, the LWMF is now engaged in establishing an archive in memory of the iconic artiste.
The Archive accommodates an exclusive collection of photographs, audio-visual material such as filmed oral history interviews, publications and other memorabilia related to the artistes life. Work on a digital archive of the LWMF collection of photographs has already commenced, according to the Lionel Wendt Art Centre.
Art historian Sharmini Pereira has been entrusted with the job of the LWMF Archive Chief Curator. Pereiras role includes cataloguing the photographs and overseeing an extensive conservation and training project. Johann Peiris, a musician and sociologist, is also under the LWMF employ to collaborate with the Chief Curator in the capacity of Research Assistant. He will be in charge of sourcing and documenting material for the Archive. Peiris will also research on Wendts contribution to and the interests of music.
Space will be reserved for the purpose of a permanent gallery. The same space will offer research facility to shelter the archival material. This facility will be open to the researchers and Wendt enthusiasts.
The LWMF is dedicated to making this Archive the most comprehensive record of the work of a truly great photographer and is making an appeal for any relevant material such as Lionel Wendts photographic work, books, music scores, press cuttings, articles, magazines and other publications and documents with his work or references to him as well as exhibition and theatre performance catalogues, reviews and any memorabilia. Any references to Harold Peiris and others who were closely associated with Lionel Wendt and the Centre will also be of great use, notes the Lionel Wendt Art Centre release.
A register with details of the donor and the material donated will be maintained. Interested parties can email [emailprotected].

Lopez sings about ring request in new track
Jennifer Lopez appears to be urging boyfriend Alex Rodriguez to 'put a ring on it' if the lyrics to her new song are to be believed.
The three-times wed singer and actress debuted her new track El Anillo (The Ring) during a performance at the Billboard Latin Music Awards on Thursday night (26Apr18), and it seems she's keen to add another fiance to her collection. Lopez, who has been dating retired baseball superstar A-Rod since March, 2017, sings "Nunca habia sentido algo tan grande/Y me vuelve loca tu lado salvaje/Tu me has dado tanto que he estado pensando/Ya lo tengo todo, pero/Y el anillo pa' cuando" which translates to, "I have never felt anything this grand/And your wild side drives me crazy/Youve given me so much that Ive been thinking/I already have it all, but/When will I get the ring"
But offstage, Lopez insists she's in no rush to become a wife again, four years after she divorced husband number three Marc Anthony in 2014.
In a new interview with Ebro Darden on Beats 1, she opened up about the lyrics and stated she's in no hurry to wed Rodriguez.
"I've done that before," she said. "Im a little bit more grown up now, and I like to let things take their natural course.
"Right now, the songs that I have coming out, everything thats going on with women - its a very empowering time for us... We're like, 'Yo, this is not OK, this is OK, I want to be treated with respect, I want my place in your life, I want to be paid equally'. And my next two songs kind of deal with that: 'Wheres my ring, and wheres my money'"
"I thought about changing (the lyrics to El Anillo) and making it more generic, and then I was like, 'You know, all my music has always been super personal'."
And she told Darden that her man didn't initially realise the song was about them, adding, "He goes, 'Grand slam, home run, three on base!' Hes like, 'This almost sounds like its us!' I said, 'Baby, it is about us. They wrote it for me to sing!'
"(He said), 'Yeah, baby, do it - thatll be fun."

Mask and movement
Laurie Steven the founder and Artistic Director of Odyssey Theatre, Ottawa, Canada, has been involved in Canadian theatre for the past 33 years. Like many young artists she originally entered the stage when she studied theatre at high school and university. She has been involved in the theatre ever since.
Today she directs productions like Molires Sacpin,Giraudouxs Ondine, Marivauxs False Confessions, Gozzis The Raven.For her adaptation of an Indonesian shadow puppet play, The Wedding she won the Capital Critics Circle Award for Best Director. Her work at Odyssey Theatre focuses on masks, dance-theatre and the arts of the fairground. Laurie is currently in Sri Lanka and shared with the Daily News her passion for theatre and the unique impact mask theatre has on its audience.
Q: For the uninitiated can you describe this form of theatre, dealing with fantasy, reality and puppetry
Odyssey Theatre, a company in Ottawa Canada, specializes in plays inspired by Commedia dellArte, an Italian form of comic masked theatre. Actors wear masks and play stock characters like the old miser and the mischievous servant. When actors wear masks their performance style becomes larger than life, they use physical theatre and comedy in their work.
At Odyssey we are also interested in international myth and folklore. We find ways of mixing Commedia characters into mythical stories, so we often have two styles of performance: one for mythic characters and one for the Commedia characters who sometimes become commentators on the greater events of the mythic story, giving it a human dimension. We also use masks for mythical characters and we sometimes use puppets in the mythical world if there are magical beasts or ghosts or other supernatural creatures.
Q: Is it true that in this kind of theatre that the audience is invited to imagine more than they can see
Yes. We take audiences on a journey to distant lands and times, but use simple theatrical means and performance rituals to evoke the spirit of the people and places. Two chairs and a table can be two chairs and a table, but they might become a mountain or a prison cell. If a prince is transformed into a demon, it might happen by a chorus of dancers making the change happen on stage using choreography to create the feeling of magic.
Q: Do you see the influence of Greek Theatre as well as Japanese Theatre (Noh, Kabuki) in Odyssey Theatre
We have been more strongly influenced by Asian forms of theatre including Peking Opera, Indonesian Wayang Wong, Indian Kathakali and now Sri Lankan Kolam. These influences have come about because we have had the good fortune to meet and collaborate with artists from different traditions to create new work.
Q: How did the Odyssey Theatre where you arethe artistic director come about
I started Odyssey theatre 33 years ago when I moved to Ottawa. There was very little theatre in Ottawa at that time. When I discovered how much work it would be to start a company, I decided to focus our company on a theatre form using masks, because it was something I was fascinated by and I hoped we would make a unique contribution to theatre in Canada.
Q: Tell us about your early experienceswith theatre.
I studied theatre at high school and university and I started my career directing comedy and farce. I shifted directions when I began Odyssey. We do a major production each summer in a beautiful park in Ottawa. My memories of my early shows are of many long days and sleepless nights, then astonishment that we drew audiences and somehow survived to start another year.
Q: Having worked on a variety of successful shows over the course of your career, can you tell us who taught you the most valuable lessons along the way
I studied Commedia dellArte with Alberto Fortuzzi from Italy and clown with Philippe Gaulier in France and more Commedia with Ariane Mnouchkine, also in France. These 3 artists had a profound effect on the way I work. One of the principle things I learned fas a director is how to watch actors improvising and see the things they almost express and help them to have confidence in those physical ideas.
Q: What are your impressions ofSri Lankan theatre
On this trip I will see my first Sri Lankan theatre this weekend, but I have been meeting with artists who are so passionate about theatre, dance and music and they have been so warm, enthusiastic and welcoming. I came to visit Sri Lanka 20 years ago, and at that time saw Kolam theatre in a village near Ambalangoda. I was so impressed with the spectacular masked dance performances and I realized how much drumming contributed to the performance. That experience inspired me to collaborate with artists who work with percussion, dance and theatre.
There will be a presentation and discussion with Laurie Steven, on Commedia dellArte on Tuesday, May 8 at 4 pm at Namel Malini Punchi Theatre, Borella. The event is open to all and free of charge.

Much ado about nothing
The JVP seems to have stoned a hornets nest in bringing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to abolish the Executive Presidency. The Maha Sangha or the communities of Buddhist monks from the Maha Nayakes to the Samaneras have taken to the streets to decry the proposal. Much of the criticism is focused not on the contents or the substance of the proposal but on the conduct of the proposer.
To this alliance of holy men the proposer the JVP- is a foreign agent. It is not in the distant past or in the last Century that these Maha Nayakes gave gracious audiences and photo opportunities to the leaders of the same JVP. Perhaps they would not have known them to be foreign agents by then. However, if they were enlightened on the matter later they should have made it known earlier. It was their duty by the country which they vow to defend to their last breadth.
What more they must provide tangible proof of the foreign connection for otherwise the allegation reduces to nothing but political slander or calumny. The same allegation has been made against several other parties and groups as well as certain individuals, again with no proof. We would like to take a leaf from the JO repertoire. Prove it, if you can!
Constitutional reform
The unholy alliance of the laity and the Sangha has displayed paranoia about constitutional reform. They want to keep the executive presidency forever. It is not that they were its forefathers. In fact, it was brought in almost stealthily in a swift manner by late President J R Jayewardene. Many who now cry foul when its abolition is proposed did oppose it from the very beginning. Perhaps 40 years is too much a period for them to retain in their memories cramped with matters spiritual.
The constitution is not a sacred scripture, given for all time. It has to change with the times. In fact it has been amended 19 times. At the rate amendments keep on adding it looks almost like a periodical rather than the Fundamental Law of the land.
On the other hand, it is a mere scrap of paper, if the mass of the people do not recognize it as proper. It cannot guarantee anything for certain. It cannot prevent armed rebellion or conspiracy. How many rebellions and armed struggles have been experienced under the unitary State They arise not from the constitution but from socio-economic distress and discrimination, from poverty and hunger. Of course they may carry the banners of race or religion.
Modern democracy
These opponents of Constitutional reform have been calling for piece by piece amendments when a new Constitution was proposed. When amendments are proposed they oppose it saying that there should not be any patchwork but only a full comprehensive change at a future date. Whatever the proposal they oppose it.
We do not deny their right to oppose anything and everything, if they so desire. But they should allow others to express their opinion, bring in their proposals for discussion. That is the spirit of modern democracy or civilized culture.
They have threatened to issue a Sangha Anagna or some type of Buddhist fatwa in case the Amendment is not prevented from being adopted. This is a high-handed act unbecoming of the Maha Sangha disciples of the Buddha who preached Maha Karuna or Great Compassion. It is unfortunate that the noble men who have renounced worldly pleasures and vowed to develop spiritual powers to attain enlightenment deemed it fit to ignore loving kindness which should be shown to all beings.
The whole opposition to Constitutional change has been built more on myths, lies and slanderous rhetoric rather on substantive argumentation which is few in number. It is only a rational discourse that would be fruitful. There is nothing sacrosanct in unitary or federal nature. Besides, there are no purely unitary or purely federal constitutions anymore. Modern products are more heterogeneous.
Kandyan Convention
None should entertain any fear that Buddhism would be destroyed by constitutional reform, for two reasons. One, ultimately such reforms need approval at a referendum and people will decide and they are supreme. Two, Buddhism cannot be safeguarded or destroyed by an article in the Constitution. Four and half centuries of foreign domination and repression could not destroy it for the faithful defended and preserved it. Nor could the Kandyan Convention prevent the British ill-treating Buddhists and suppressing it.
It would be regressive to have a theocratic State instead of a secular one. Matters of state are best handled by secular forces. This is especially so in a multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-racial society such as ours.
Offering advice of making representations is one thing but taking the law into ones hands even by the Maha Sangha will lead to anarchy and breakdown of law and order.
The 20th Amendment is a private members motion which needs Cabinet approval. Judging by the conduct of those in the Cabinet it is unlikely to get it. Hence, it is much ado about nothing.

Nigerian army frees 1,000 Boko Haram captives

The Nigerian army said Monday it had rescued more than 1,000 Boko Haram captives in Borno state, northeastern Nigeria.
The hostages consisted mainly of women and children, as well as some young men who had been forced to become Boko Haram fighters, military spokeman Texas Chukwu said in a statement.
This follows the release ofover 100 schoolgirlskidnapped by Boko Haram from Dapchi, a town in Nigeria's Yobe State in March.
The operation, which was conducted in conjunction with Cameroonian and Nigerian troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), rescued the hostages from Malamkari, Amchaka, Walasa and Gora villages of the Bama Local Government Area.
Boko Haram terror group militants mainly inhabit areas in the northern states of Nigeria, specifically Yobe, Kano, Bauchi, Borno and Kaduna.
"Those rescued are receiving treatment at a military facility," the statement said.
Boko Haram has kidnapped more than 1,000 children in Nigeria since 2013according to a new report. The group sparked global outrage after its militants seized 276 girls from a boarding school in Chibok town in Borno state in 2014.
Some of those girls were freed last year following negotiations between the Nigerian government andBoko Haram.
Last month, the Nigerian government said a disagreement between members of the terror group had caused a breakdown innegotiation talksfor the release of the remaining schoolgirls.

Panasian Power commissions first solar power project
Panasian Power PLC, one of Sri Lankas leading green energy solutions providers, recently completed three rooftop solar power plants with a combined capacity of 1.2MW.
The plants are located in Kolonna, Borelasgamuwa and Kohuwala with capacities of 300kW, 400kW and 500kW, respectively. This takes Panasian Power a step closer towards its goal of generating 12MW from solar by 2019. This is in keeping with the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) plan to Increase its renewable energy contribution dramatically in line with Sri Lankas commitment to the Paris agreement.
Panasian Power, which had previously been solely involved in hydropower, began exploring opportunities in solar in 2017 following the launch of the governments Soorya Bala Sangramaya programme to enhance the renewable energy portfolio of the country.
Under this programme Panasian pursued projects in the Net Plus scheme that allowed the company to sell all the electricity generated from the solar rooftop plants to the CEB.
The company has thus far invested over Rs. 200 million in solar and in addition to the three completed projects Panasian Power has four other solar projects in the pipeline in various stages of completion. The plants which are due to complete construction by September this year are located in Kelaniya, Mawathagama, Uhumeeya, and Homagama.
Once on grid these plants will have a total capacity of 5.1MW constructed at a cost of Rs 550 Million.
General Manager/Executive Director, Pathmanatha Poddiwala, said: We have looked at opportunities in solar for some time now and once the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy launched their Soorya Bala Sangramaya programme, as part of their plan to make Sri Lanka an energy self-sufficient nation by 2030, we decided the time was right to diversify into solar.
We were able to build on our extensive knowledge of renewable energy and leverage existing partnerships to act quickly in this space. In addition, our strong financial position has allowed us to invest heavily in the latest technology, equipment and personnel needed to ensure the success of this venture.
Panasian Power, which was incorporated in 2002 owns and operates Mini Hydropower Plants and supplies electricity directly to the Ceylon Electricity Board. In 2017 the company diversified into solar energy to meet its revised target of having an energy portfolio of 30MW by 2020.

A Quiet Place: When words are hushed
Contrary to tranquillity and calmness apparently evoked in the title, A Quiet Place is placed under horror genre. The movie does not entertain a ghostly figure in a white robe. Instead, it transports you to the Jurassic Park plane of fright. The difference unfolds as the creature is scarier and uglier than the colossal reptiles of the Steven Spielberg adventure movie.
You have to come to terms with this alien. It is so colossal. It is so strong. But it is blind. Beware though, for the blind alien can strike you at the slightest hint of a sound. The blind alien rests somewhere close to your living quarters. You are free from danger as long as you do not make any noise.
What could such a world be like If you happen to picture a world without sound for a second, John Krasinski is there to show you how one whole family managed to beat the odds for one and half hour on the wide screen without sound.
A family of five communicates with each other in sign language almost throughout the film. A soundless phenomenon enhances the visual effect of the cinema medium. Doing without the sounds, however, comes with a tough challenge for the director and the scriptwriter.
They both overcome this hurdle with a carefully crafted script. The script walks the viewer through a powerful imagery of a timer, a pregnant mother struggling to hush down her labour pains and her fight to keep herself silent amid the pain caused from an exposed nail on the stairs. This imagery comes in handy especially when the sequence reaches a state of boredom occasionally.
The sound is a dangerous phenomenon especially when blindness lurks behind. With that recurring element, the movie moves on to another premise: disability. The alien is blind, that is open to view. But a little later, we are introduced to another with a disability. Regan, the daughter of the family, is deaf. While the people with no disabilities struggle to survive, the two disabled creatures roam carefreely. When one faculty is impaired the other faculties tend to improve. That is so in the case of the blind alien who reacts to the slightest noise albeit with an exception. It cannot bear blaring noises.
As the family moves about silently flanked by the sign-language communication, the viewer enters a rich plateau of mindfulness. You need to be extraordinarily careful about your own movements when you are in a vulnerable zone. Make a trivial sound come out, and the danger is right behind you! That awareness installs you in a deeper plain of concentration.
Necessity is the mother of invention, according to an English proverb. The character of Lee, the father of the family played by the director, brings it home. The trauma of a blind alien on one hand and a family to protect on the other hand compels Lee to sacrifice his free time for research. His findings hung on the wall  if not for the trivial spelling errors  turn out to be remarkable. Over time, he manages to explore the Achilles heel of the mighty alien.
As the battle between sound and sight embroils, the movie plot meanders to other themes. Therein roams a protective and affectionate family man. Despite his fully bearded face, Lee is not short of subtle expression. That expression epitomises the parental love which goes unnoticed and misunderstood in most cases. For instance, Regan misunderstands her father following several incidents.
But that misunderstanding has never been reciprocal. Even at his final moment, Lee expresses his love to the daughter in the sign language and later makes use of the rarely used sound to sacrifice himself for the sake of his family.
The first to sacrifice was the littlest member of the family. Ironically he invents the remedy to escape the catastrophe.
Whether A Quiet Place can be considered a masterpiece remains a puzzle. Nevertheless, the themes and elements stand out subtly. The simple, yet profound, script and direction together elevates the movie to a plane philosophically higher than most Hollywood movies.

REMINISCING DOWN SOUTH
Many cricketers have emerged from the South who have done Sri Lanka cricket proud but today I am confining myself to two famous schools in the Galle district Mahinda and Richmond. The Richmond Mahinda match dates from about 1894 and has but two interruptions, been continued up to date. It was called the Lovers Quarrel. I am thankful to the Managing Editor and Publisher of the book Hundred Years of Richmond-Mahinda Cricket.G.M.Sumanathilaka De Silva for providing me the following information.
As far as the Mahindians were concerned there was Tall and lanky Athula Samarasekera a big hitting right hand opening batsman who played 39 ODIS and 4 Tests for Sri Lanka, Athula captained Mahinda in 1981.In the not so recent past Athula was one of the pillars who emerged from Mahinda and this book gave a vivid description of the 76 th battle between Richmond and Mahinda where Athula Samarasekera captained Mahinda and Ruwan P. Korala captained Richmond
. Mahindians were the hot favourites in this encounter. Athula a centurion that season took fifty wickets and scored over 700 runs, he led the side from the front. Mihira Egodage who opened the batting for Richmond was a Sri Lanka schools cricket member who also had notched over 700 runs. Mahinda looked the stronger side on paper the Richmondites who were led by that stylish all-rounder Ruwan Korale one of the finest cricketers produced by Richmond in its cricketing history the book stated. Korale matched his counterpart and had scored over 700 runs whilst he took over 50 wickets that season as well.
Richmond started well, and after a good partnership by Nihal Fonseka and S.Nanayakkara Chandana Amarasinghe top scored with 66runs,however wickets fell at regular intervals and Richmond laboured for 80 overs and scored 203 runs.H. Munasinghe was the pick of the Mahinda bowlers with 4 wickets for 62
.Mahinda in their turn, were disappointing and struggled against dangerous speedster W. Udayasiri who proved to be more than a handful.One of his lethal deliveries struck Munasinghe smack on the head. He was quickly taken to the hospital with blood pouring from his forehead a scene one dreads to see in any form of a cricket match. He was later brought back to the ground with a plastered forehead and did not come out to bat. Mahinda managed to get only 141 for 8 with Munasinghe retiring. Athula Samarasekera stood out with a well compiled 56 runs and Saman Warnaweera(not Jayananda Warnaweera) chipped in with 27 runs.
When Richmond came out to bat in the second innings it was a surprise to see Munasinghe walking out with a plaster and credited with a hairline fracture and looking like an alien from outer space. Although Richmond started cautiously the rot set in with the top order caving in. Munasinghe in spite of the pain he was having due to his injury showed true grit by bagging 3 for 11.B Warnaweera also shone with the ball by taking 4 for 19 runs.
Mahinda left with the daunting task to score 136 runs for a memorable win, started positively despite losing two early wickets that of Egodage,Samarasekera ,and then Saman Warnaweera brought Mahinda within sight of victory.Mahindians at this point was cock a hoop.
How uncertain the game of cricket could be Mahindians got into a tangle with run outs of Mihira and then two suicidal run outs of the Warnweera brothers, all hopes were buried in the sand, it was rather unfortunate for Mahinda run outs as the case may be being the bane of big matches.
Skipping backwards I had the good fortune of playing against Mahinda from 1963 to 1966 and ragging existed even in those by gone days. During my time I was fortunate to face the amiable Mahindians twice at the Galle Esplanade. Its a common practice then to get the freshers subjected to ragging but I managed to escape ragging due to two factors one was when I applied black boot polish liberally along my inner flanks so that when it came to the inspection of inner flanks by the seniors (one was a late DIG) I was summarily sent away accusing me of not having a bath (thanks to the boot polish) for ages!!
The other factor was having fairer complexioned ones with good flanks, the fairer ones were subjected to horseplay.
Back on track I had great pleasure in playing against the dozen or so Amendra brothers, big hitting Palitha Wijeratne, the Wiley off spinner U.L.S De Silva who could spin the ball a country mile and had us in all sorts of trouble at the Galle Esplanade in 1964 where Nimal Edussuriya( no mug with the bat) and Prasanna de Silva who is better known as a crafty left arm swing bowler saved the match for us. I can remember vividly that all of us were on pins and plastered to our respective places and to cap it all our captain Duminda Siriwardene was so nervous that he was reading the Readers Digest up side down!! Later the nerves were soothed by the cup that cheers till the wee hours of the morning.
Richmond also had two fantastic cricketers namely R.B.Jayasuriya and Lasantha Kaggodachchi both represented Ceylon Schools in 1964 against the visiting Indians.

Responsible investments drive sustainable success stories
On March 5, Tundra Fonder - in cooperation with the Colombo Stock Exchange  hosted the CSE Tundra Sustainability Forum in Colombo.
You might ask why an asset manager from the North would travel across the world to arrange an event on responsible investments in Sri Lanka This article, the first in a series on responsible investing, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and international sustainability trends, hopefully will answer this question.
We will gather our thoughts on environment, social aspects and governance (ESG) in business and highlight requirements from institutional investors. There is an urgent need for action and we want to share our experiences in order for Sri Lankan companies to plan for the long game.
Tundra Fonder is an asset manager that focuses on listed equities in what is refered to as The next generation of Emerging Markets. Today we manage USD 600 mn in listed equities across our core markets: Vietnam, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt and Sri Lanka.
These markets are selected for being key potential growth markets in the decades to come. In the wake of globalisation, new markets are expected to repeat the growth from earlier success stories such as China and South Korea.
Initiatives like the One Belt, One Road will transform the next generation of emerging markets, creating the means to achieve high and sustained growth for the next 20 years.
We currently hold an equity portfolio of USD 25m in Sri Lanka, which we expect to grow significantlyin theyears to come.
Sri Lanka is included in our core markets, despite being significantly smaller in terms of population as compared to the other countries in the portfolio.
 When we refer to Sri Lanka we often describe it as the next Singapore, meaning that Sri Lanka, in our view, has the potential to become an important trade and services hub. Its strategic location next to India and the potential availability for developing significant deep-sea ports are tremendous advantages; a young and literate population is another.
Sri Lankas services sector has performed extremely well, IT services and tourism, in particular, deserves a special mention. Tourism revenue is already 4% of GDP and the prospects for future growth appear very strong. Today Sri Lanka welcomes about 2.2 mn tourists per year.
Mauritius, in comparison, welcomes 1.3m tourists to an area corresponding to only 1/30th of Sri Lankas size. With its well-developed leisure sector, coupled with continued improvements to infrastructure, Sri Lanka has the potential to see revenue from tourism grow at a double-digit growth rate for the next decade.
If handled well, tourism and associated services can enable Sri Lanka to avoid youth unemployment, and balance the eventual decline in remittances and increases in the import of raw materials.
The development of Sri Lanka and Tundras other core markets will not go unnoticed from foreign institutional investors who will gain increased interest for this new generation of promising markets.
Significant foreign portfolio inflows constitute a major possibility, something that can further strengthen the growth case.
Parallel to these likely success factors, global trends show an increased awareness among investors on the unsustainable path adopted by developed countries to achieve wealth during the past century. Aspects of ESG, Sustainability, Responsible Investments, CSR and a vast body of related terminology are rapidly becoming a top priority to investors. It all comes down to the same core features on how to adopt more responsible ways of conducting business.
New standards and demands for sustainable business models are unfolding. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) socially responsible investments made up 26% of all financial investments in the world by end of 2016, growing at twice the pace of conventional investments during years 2012-2016. In our view this trend is accelerating, especially among younger investors and women. Going forward, successfully attracting foreign institutional investments will require demonstrating the existence of a robust ESG framework from companies.
There are several examples of initiatives that can provide solid guidelines and frameworks in support of a global ambition to reach sustainable, long-term growth. At Tundra we have chosen to support and align our work with global initiatives that encourage organisations to integrate ESG factors into their investment processes and strategies.
These include the UN Global Compact (UNGC), a UN initiative that encourages SMEs, large corporations and entire cities to adopt socially responsible policies under ten principles in four broad categories: human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.
Tundra is an active participant to the UN Global Compact and a member of the recently launched UNGC Network Sweden. With participating companies in over 160 countries, the UN Global Compact is the worlds largest corporate sustainability initiative.
At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, more than 150 world leaders adopted the new 2030 Agenda including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aiming to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. We consider the work on the SDGs a fundamental pillar in the efforts for any business. This will be described more in detail in a later article.
Tundra also stands as a signatory to the PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment), an independent body that promotes responsible investments through its six principles, supported by the United Nations.
Developed by investors for investors, the aim of the PRI is to develop a more sustainable global financial system and encourage the incorporation of ESG concerns into everyday investment practices. The PRI has over 1,800 signatories across 50 countries.
We also encourage companies, especially larger organisations to report through the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). GRI - an independent international organisation providing a platform for businesses and governments worldwide to communicate their impact on critical sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights, governance and social well-being - celebrated 20 years last year and can be described as one of the pioneers in sustainability reporting.
We recommend all businesses to join and disclose through at least one international initiative for increased transparency and engagement.
To us, responsible investing is an important part of our day-to-day business.
We believe that incorporating ESG into the core of the organisation will improve the long-term performance and increase foreign investor interest for companies in emerging and frontier markets.
With an increased understanding of the accelerating requirements and a sincere commitment to sustainable growth, we believe that Sri Lanka has a unique opportunity to write a new chapter in the Asian success story.
This feature was written to Daily News Business by Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Tundra Fonder AB, Mattias Martinsson and Head of ESG, Dr Jennie Ahrn.

Rock it for a cause
Rock and Metal are genres that have appealed to Shehara Batti Napoleon, the first female rock vocalist in Sri Lanka since she was a teenager. Prodigiously talented in this area of music, Napoleon says rock and metal music just comes from within her. Melodies meets up with this rock and metal musician who is authentic and wants to make a difference in peoples lives.
Napoleon feels that the power of music lies in it being able to change a melancholic mood into that of positivity and makes one feel good. It can elevate you from a mood of depression to one of ecstasy.
I have always been interested in music since childhood because music has this power to instantly change the mood. That is the first thing I realized. Whenever I was going through situations in my life music made a huge difference. Music has made a huge impact on my life and has helped me get rid of a lot of negative feelings, said Napoleon.
Gifted in writing lyrics from her teenage years she listened to all kinds of music till she found her forte. Rock and Metal just resonated with her.
I started writing music in my rebellious teens. Most of my friends listened to pop. Because of different stuff happening in my life I started to venture into different kinds of music - mostly rap, metal and Golden Oldies, basically anything I could listen to. Metal made a huge impact on me, because I realized compared to mainstream music, they had guitars, violins, key boards, heavy drums, different vocal styles and so many versatile instruments. I realized it was very different compared to everything else, stated Napoleon.
The power of Rock and Metal is intense and it helped Napoleon to blossom as an individual.
And Compared to all the lovey - dovey songs, it spoke about different subjects and different concepts. Challenging experiences eventually pushed me to start writing lyrics and that helped me get rid of all the hurt and hate. My message to anyone who wants to do rock and metal, is just be authentic and open minded, explained Napoleon.
Being a soloist and a female came with its own challenges, but now Napoleon has settled in very well with her choice of music.
One challenge for me is being a soloist. I guess, if you have a band, there is always someone to motivate and help you. Being a soloist, I have found that it is a bit hard to do everything from the artwork, finances and promotions alone. Being a woman in the rock and metal industry is pretty awesome. Most people feel that metal is a male oriented genre. But there are female singers and musicians in the rock and metal industry as well.
To be the first female Metal Soloist in Sri Lanka is actually a huge honor. I am currently putting together my debut album called Fountain of Memory, which is nearing completion. Its got 8 originals, some of which Im growling on as well and will be released on CD and digital downloads soon. Irrespective of which one is purchased, everyone will get the 8 tracks, along with the album artwork. It has taken a bit of time because of various reasons and the craziest of challenges but, all of it has made the album way more awesome than I initially intended for it to be. Time it has taken but, Ive gained so much which has helped. Im singing and growling on this album as well. In the process, Ive been able to reach out to others and make a positive impact on people, which is something Im really glad and honored to have been able to do. explained Napoleon.
Napoleons dreams are as big as her heart.
Through releasing it, I want to create a platform for future rock and metal female musicians. Id like it to be an album that does something positive for people. One of my biggest dreams is to help others and make this world a better place than encouraging the negativity. It seems naive and maybe even overly optimistic but, I believe we all can either be a positive or negative influence through the way we treat ourselves and those around us. And I choose to make it positive as much as I can, whenever I can, pointed out Napoleon.
Napoleons main goal is to release her long awaited album. From the singles released so far, Broken Wings was released via the TNL Onstage compilation album in 2011, Love for Eternity as an acoustic track and Fidelity as a rough teaser but, have all been rerecorded for the album FOM. The title track Fountain of Memory was released exclusively in Bangladesh as well.
My main goal right now is to release the album and keep on making music. I am also expecting my second child at the moment and will do everything I can to bring my two kids up well. TNL Onstage was a very good experience. I got to perform live with a band and sing my own songs for the first time which was nerve wrecking but, exciting at the same time, said Napoleon.
Fueled by her personal experiences in life, she does a lot of reading that makes her put out meaningful lyrics.
I think making music is one of my callings in life. Metal is my preference and my passion. I draw my inspiration to write lyrics from past experiences, challenges and how I overcame them. But all of it is also influenced by everything I read, watch and learn from. I love digging into a lot of literature, documentaries, myths, legends, Wikipedia pages and religions. A lot of people, Musicians and even fictional characters have made a huge impact on me said Napoleon.
Among her favorites in Sri Lanka is Stigmata. Abroad it would be Metallica, Devildriver, Death and Pantera just to name a few. She stated that she loves Devin Townsend who explores different genres as well and is very versatile in terms of music and vocals.
I feel that the rock and metal industry in Sri Lanka compared to long ago, is a lot open minded now. With the advancement of technology it is so much easier to get your songs out. In terms of Sri Lankan Metal there is a lot happening now. It is very versatile with young bands doings some crazy stuff out there. The older bands are all working hard and very motivated. Everyones exploring new ideas and pushing the benchmark further up all the time. So it is a good industry in Sri Lanka right now. I did have a band back then but we disbanded due to studies and other responsibilities. I am working to put together a band again. I will be releasing the first track off my album called Drown in the next month or two. And then a few others after that as well, followed by a few videos and gigs if all goes well, summed up Napoleon.

Rubber growers, exporters should share technology - Navin
Countries that grow and export rubber should share their knowledge and technology and learn from each other to promote the industry, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Speaking at the Global Rubber convention (IRSG ) at the Taj Hotel yesterday, he said the rubber growing countries should not look at each with suspicion.
Raw rubber feeds a huge value added industry and some experts say that by 2025, the world would need 17 million tons of natural rubber. The IRSG prediction may be different but the world needs more rubber from a renewable source and this creates a huge opportunity, Minister Dissnayake said.
As a public leader and a policy maker, I have some concerns with the economic prospects and future of rubber production. I have no issue at all with natural rubber, a wonderful versatile material, he said.
Commenting on Sri Lanka, he said that one issue that he identifies is the long time duration for a rubber tree to produce latex in profitable volumes, he added.
A small fanner cannot wait for 7 to 10 years after converting his small farm, the only asset he owns, to get adequate returns. Even large investors with other options may think twice, the Minister said.
Arable lands are in high demand in Sri Lanka now. Especially in the wet rubber growing regions where other agricultural crops can be planted with better returns. One example is Oil Palm, he said.
There are other plants and crops that can produce natural rubber in commercial quantities and millions of dollars are being invested in R&D to promote commercial applications, the Minster added. Minister Dissanayake said that in theory, rubber can be made profitable. In practice, most of our producers are unable to do so unless the prices are high.
Global rubber industry players collectively manage an expanding industry with an estimated sales value of over 400 billion, spread all over the world from the South Pole to the North Pole.

Ruling parties in past seventy years ruined economy: Anura Kumara
The political parties that ruled the country for 70 years failed to ensure the economic stability of the country, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the gathering at the JVP May Day rally held yesterday at the BRC Grounds in Havelock Town.
The JVP May Day procession commenced from the Campbell Ground with the participation of the JVP leaders and activists.
The JVP leader addressing the gathering said that only a political force led by the JVP can make a strong economy and create a country free from fraud and corruption.
The JVP Leader said the political parties that ruled the country during past 70 years have ensnared the country in a debt trap.
He said the annual income of the treasury is not sufficient to pay the loan installments.
The present rulers failed to produce essential products, rice, sugar, big onion, potatoes and others, he said.
Dissanayake said the present and former rulers failed to control the fall of the Rupee and it can be done only through a proper economic plan with important aims and objectives.
The poverty rate and the malnutrition of the country is increasing. Around 250,000 families do not have even an inch of land. The gap between rich and poor has been widened, the JVP Leader pointed out.
The crisis situation of the county signals the urgent need of changing the government. So the general public should unite to form a JVP government to fulfill their objectives, he said.

Siddle on the losing side as Yorkshire bounce back against Essex
LONDON, Sunday - Australia paceman Peter Siddle took eight wickets in the match yet still found himself on the losing side as Yorkshire completed a remarkable comeback to beat Essex with more than a day to spare in their County Championship clash at Chelmsford on Sunday. Yorkshire were skittled out for 50 in their first innings, with Siddle taking four wickets for seven runs.
But having dismissed Essex for 142 in reply, Yorkshire made 329 in their second innings, a total that included Harry Brook's maiden first-class hundred.
That left reigning county champions Essex needing to make 238 to win, but with Steve Patterson taking a career-best six for 40 and Ben Coad three wickets they were dismissed for 146 as Yorkshire won by 91 runs.
In the Second Division, South Africa's Aiden Markram fell just short of a Championship century as he led Durham's recovery against Leicestershire at Chester-le-Street.
Markram, one of the most promising young batsmen in world cricket, had started his Durham career in dreadful fashion with a pair of noughts against Kent, and another duck in the first innings of this match.
But having made a brilliant 152 for South Africa in their series-clinching fourth Test win over Australia in Johannesburg in March, the 23-year-old showed something closer to his best form on Sunday. He came in with hosts Durham following on after being dismissed for 184 in reply to Leicestershire's 440 but went on to make 94. Durham ended the day on 233 for one, still behind but with a draw in their sights. County Championship (third day of four):

Sri Lankas economy demonstrates time tested resilience - Mangala
Sri Lankas economy demonstrated time tested resilience last year despite the brunt of extreme weather conditions and other adverse external factors, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The minister, taking the floor during the Business Session of 51st Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Governors Annual Meeting 2018 at the ADB Headquarters in Mandaluyong City in Manila on Saturday, briefed the assembly on the countrys performance in the economic front.
The Minister, who is also the ADB Governor for Sri Lanka, said Sri Lanka has been working hand in hand with the ADB for over half a century maintaining a robust partnership in empowering the people to achieve sustainable development.
We recorded our highest ever FDI flows and highest ever export performance in 2017. These led to meaningful job creation and the unemployment rate also declined to 4.2 percent, a 13-year low. We also expect the economy to accelerate growth driven by private enterprise and exports, he said.
Minister Samaraweera also briefed the assembly on the key financial legislative reforms the Government undertook last year.
We introduced the new Inland Revenue Act which came into force April 1, which could be called one of the progressive tax reforms in our part of the world. This is part of a broader agenda of introducing transparent rules-based legislative and governance framework, the Minister said.
Our Active Liability Management Act was made effective with a view to improve domestic and foreign debt management. The rules-based and transparent auction mechanism for government securities was also introduced in the same wave, Minister Samaraweera added.
We are at the doorstep of becoming an upper middle income country and your continued support to accommodate the desired transition without any hindrance to our national development agenda would be immensely appreciated, he added.
Sri Lankas ADB portfolio remains robust and active with an ever-active ADB resident mission established in 1997 and with over USD 8.5 billion projects and policy-based active loans, grants and technical assistance received to over 500 projects. Our interactions have been mainly on the transport sector, energy, agriculture, natural resources and rural development. As a founding member and a strong partner, let me reiterate Sri Lankas steadfast commitment for a long lasting engagement with this entity in time to come for the immense benefit of our own countrymen and millions of others in the Asia Pacific region, he concluded.
ADB President Takehiko Nakao formerly opening the Board of Governors Annual Meeting on Saturday said Strategy 2030, the new long-term strategy of the ADB will be released this year. It will renew ADBs strong commitment to eradicate extreme poverty in Asia and the Pacific and expand the banks vision to achieve a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable region, he said.
The ADB President wrapping up the four-day Annual Meeting themed Linking People and Economies for Inclusive Growth underlined that the world economic center of gravity is shifting towards Asia and the Pacific, and the countries in this region should take these opportunities in a positive way while recognizing the challenges remaining.
A significant factor driving future growth is advancements in technology such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and internet of things. This will require proactive and comprehensive actions from governments and ADB to adapt and capitalize on opportunities, while minimizing the risks, he noted.
The multilateral lenders with Annual Meeting was attended by over 4,000 participants from across Asia, North America, and Europe including Finance and Economic Planning Ministers, senior government officials, representatives of the multilateral development bank community, investment bankers, representatives of non-government organisations and media personnel.

Tourism industry welcomes Presidents directive
The tourism industry has welcomed the directive issued by President Maithripala Sirisena to demolish unauthorized structures in Mirissa and other areas.
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga said the Presidents unwavering stance on the matter has sent a clear signal to those flouting the law to fall in line. I salute the President for taking this bold decision. It is no secret that powerful personalities were trying to pressurize the President who is the Minister of Environment to suspend the demolition work that was to be carried out by the Coast Conservation Department. However the Presidents unwavering stance has sent a strong message to the illegitimate establishments that flout the law that their days are numbered, The Minister said.
We are not against anyone doing business. In fact we encourage that. We are only against the law breakers who are also a nuisance to tourists and the local public alike. They are the ones bringing a bad name to the industry and the country, Minister Amaratunga said.
According to the Coast Conservation Department demolition of unauthorized structures in Mirissa, Negombo, Dehiwala and Mount Lavinia will be carried out during the course of this month. The decision to demolish all unauthorized structures was taken during a meeting held at the Ministry of Tourism last month between Minister Amaratunga and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara with the participation of IGP Pujitha Jayasundera and the Director General of Coast Conservation, Prabath Chandrakeerthi.
In the first phase, 18 identified illegal structures are to be demolished in Mirissa.

Transparency International commends Bribery Commission

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) commended the Bribery Commission for taking swift action against the two top government officials who solicited and accepted a bribe.
The TISL in a statement said it applauds the steps taken by the Bribery Commission to arrest President's Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and former Chairman of the State Timber Corporation P. Dissanayaka, on charges of soliciting a bribe and accepting a sum of Rs. 20 million as an advance payment.
TISL said it believes this sets an excellent example of collaboration between the private sector and CIABOC to counter public sector corruption.
Whilst welcoming President Maithripala Sirisena's approval to immediately interdict the officials concerned and instructions to authorities to enforce the law without obstruction, TISL said it wishes to highlight the importance of transitioning to a system of accountability that functions independently of political power, without requiring 'political clearance' to proceed.
TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said the need for political approval before proceeding highlights the potential for political interference. When political approval is no longer sought, that is when anti-corruption will move from having ad hoc success to gaining true public trust in upholding the rule of law'.
TISL also called on CIABOC to actively pursue investigations into other stalled investment projects which may uncover further instances of grand corruption.

uaes LULU Group to invest Rs. 3 bn in leisure project
For the first time in Sri Lanka one of the worlds fastest growing retailer chains, LULU Group International of UAE, will invest Rs. 3 billion to build a five-star hotel in Colombo and enter the leisure business.
LULU group Sri Lanka Consultant W. P. Perera said that they hope to start construction end of this year and it would be totally foreign funded project.
He said that their main target is to attract up-market clientele and they also would try to get a large share of the expatriate population living in UAE to visit Sri Lanka.
The Colombo project will come under Twenty14 Holdings which is the hospitality investment arm of LULU. Founded in 2014, Twenty14 Holdings has invested over US$ 650 million in assets across the Middle East, U.K. and India.
We are happy with the progress we are making in Sri Lanka and this is why we are investing in the leisure sector as well. We see huge growth potential in Sri Lanka, he said.

This is sourcing high quality products from Sri Lanka and re exports them to LULUs large chain of hypermarkets in the Middle East and in other countries.
The company hopes to purchase fruits vegetables and fish products from Sri Lanka to the value of US$ 25 million each year. Annually this order would increase by around 20%.

## Title: The upcoming Trump-Kim Summit
## Supertitle:

The upcoming Trump-Kim Summit
These days, the news out of Korea moves at a dizzying pace. From Kim Jong-uns New Years olive branch to the recent inter-Korean summit and potential upcoming (and unprecedented) meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, there is an endless array of new developments. Thus far, the most tangible outcome has been a rapid reduction in tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the setting of historic goals of peace and denuclearization. The latter, of course, remain just that, goals; goals that have been set several times before. Still, observing the optimism from Seoul (and elsewhere) one is led to believe we are on the verge of truly transformative agreements.
Lost, or at least obscured by the flow of events, are clear signs that the Trump administrations hardline stance has not changed. One such development was the April 24 appointment of Admiral Harry Harris to become the new U.S. Ambassador to Seoul, a position vacant for the last 15 months.
Harris, currently the head of the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), had previously been appointed as ambassador to Australia, but was redirected one day before his confirmation hearing for the Canberra post. Harris nomination was one of Secretary of State Mike Pompeos first acts upon entering office. It should be noted, though, that Harris appointment must still be confirmed in the Senate. As shown by the back-and-forth over Victor Cha, nothing should be considered final until Harris is sitting in Habib House in Seoul. Nevertheless, it does look likely.
Admiral Harris was an attractive pick for Pompeo. He has taken an outspoken hardline stance toward Pyongyang. Last May, in a strongly worded address in Tokyo, he called North Koreas nuclear and missile programmes a threat not only to U.S. allies and the region but the entire world, and advocated for far stronger sanctions, in line with the White Houses own policy. Moreover, he does not shy away from discussing so-called kinetic action against North Korea, the militarys anesthetized bureaucratic language for violent military strikes.
Trumps rhetoric on North Korea
The Washington Posts David Nakamura and John Hudson observe that while Trumps rhetoric on North Korea may have softened, he has surrounded himself with hawks. Like Secretary Pompeo and Trumps National Security Advisor John Bolton, Harris is aggressive toward Pyongyang.
To be fair, though, he does possess a more nuanced understanding of regional and peninsular dynamics, and the limits of what is possible. Unlike Pompeo, he does not publicly ruminate about regime change in Pyongyang. Nor does he share Boltons readiness for preemptive strikes on the North. Still, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Harris claimed Trumps maximum pressure policy is what brought Pyongyang to the negotiating table. In short, for Harris, as for Pompeo and Bolton, skepticism towards North Korea is a must and the stick is more attractive (and effective) than the carrot.
This raises some important questions. What does this say about the limits of what can be achieved at the upcoming Kim-Trump summit And what happens if the summit fails to achieve anything and things once again turn sour
Nakamura and Hudson write: Foreign-policy analysts who know Harris predicted that he, Bolton and Pompeo would aim to set guardrails to protect the unpredictable Trump from being hoodwinked by empty promises from Kim. With Trump, anything seems possible. The president might make some sudden grand gesture and impetuously agree to a wide-reaching settlement (potentially including the reduction or removal of U.S. forces). Nonetheless, as always, the devil is in the details of implementation, and these same advisors, even if they cannot stop Trump in the moment of the summit, could certainly serve as obstructionist bureaucratic operators after the fact.
However, Trump might not sign away longstanding U.S. policy and instead adhere to his administrations official line. Pompeo spelled out as much during his official swearing in ceremony at the State Department on May 2. Standing next to the president, Pompeo said, A bad deal is no deal. He continued: Were committed to the permanent, verifiable, irreversible dismantling of North Koreas weapons of mass destruction programme and to do so without delay.
Time and again, Trump and administration officials have said they will not follow the example of past administrations. That, combined with moving without delay, implies Trump is not willing to countenance a phased process as previously attempted (twice) and will demand sweeping concessions upfront from Pyongyang; concessions Kim Jong-un may very well not be willing to accept. Moreover, even if Kim does the unexpected and accepts a frontloaded, one-sided bargain, the process itself will be fraught with the doubts and possible backsliding pressure of Trumps own advisors. During the Senate testimony mentioned above, Harris said any process with Pyongyang on denuclearization must follow the dictum: Distrust but verify. Bolton himself views Pyongyangs trustworthiness as essentially nonexistent.
Bloody nose strike
Obviously, until the summit itself, we simply do not know what will transpire. Yet there are legitimate reasons to believe things could unravel and turn south, quickly. The prospect for another whipsaw back toward increased tensions and the threat of war is unwelcome, but worth considering.
Harris has openly shared his thoughts about such a prospect. Many people have talked about military options being unimaginable regarding North Korea Folks, I must imagine the unimaginable, he told a Chamber of Commerce group in Hawaii earlier this year. Again, during Senate testimony, Harris denied media reports and said the military was not developing plans for a so-called bloody nose strike. Harris, like Victor Cha, understands the impracticality, counterproductive nature, and dangerous escalatory potential of such a limited action.
However, Harris went on to remark: I believe if we do anything along the kinetic region of the spectrum of conflict, we have to be ready to do the whole thing And were ready to do the whole thing if ordered by the president. The whole thing means a full-on confrontation with North Koreas million-plus man army, with the ultimate aim of (as U.S. war plans have it) invading North Korea, destroying the Kim regime, and settling the unification question under U.S. and South Korean auspices.
