Progress in US-Russia talks over Syria air safety
US: The US and Russia made progress in discussions Saturday designed to avoid accidents between them in the increasingly crowded air space over war-torn Syria, the Pentagon and Moscow said, and more talks are planned.
Washington expressed alarm this week after Moscow failed to quickly answer proposals made during previous talks, even as Russia launched cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea and repeatedly violated Turkish air space.
The discussions were professional and focused narrowly on the implementation of specific safety procedures, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement after the 90-minute video conference.
Progress was made during the talks and the US agreed to another discussion with Russia in the near future.
Cook disclosed few details, except to say that the discussions took place between US defense officials and their counterparts in Moscow and focused on steps that can be taken by Russian and US-led coalition aircraft to promote safe flight operations over Syria.
The Russian defense ministry in a statement described the talks as professional and constructive, confirming that more talks were planned in future.
Progress has been made towards a possible accord between the two countries defence ministries with regard to the security of the airspace that is being used... to strike international terrorists in Syria, the ministry said.
US officials were furious after Russia only gave them a vague, verbal heads-up about an hour before Moscow launched its bombing campaign over Syria on September 30.
The two countries held deconfliction talks the next day via video conference, aimed at ensuring Russian warplanes didnt cross paths with drones and US-led coalition jets targeting the Islamic State extremist group in Syria.
Russian planes have flown near a US drone, officials say, and the US military has had to reroute some flights to avoid any close calls.

Scope for India, Sri Lanka collaboration enormous
There is a huge scope for collaboration between India and Sri Lanka in real estate, town planning and infrastructure development.
Sri Lanka already has Indian companies like Ansal Housing, SMS property developer who have invested in housing and civil construction projects.
There is demand for construction services, especially town planning.
Sri Lanka will be building housing units (65,000) in five districts and India can capitalise on this, Sri Lankas Deputy High Commissioner in Southern India Vadivel Krishnamoorthy said.
The 65,000 housing units will be built in Jaffna, Killinochchi, Mannar, Mullaithivu and Vavuniya in the Northern Province and in Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara in the Eastern province.
These houses are built to resettle the families who were displaced, due to internal conflict, Vadivel said. Apart from real estate, India and Sri Lanka would be inking a deal on the IT front.
More details on this would be revealed post the budget session in Sri Lanka.Vadivel said that there are talks between both countries in the IT space but refused to divulge further details.
The Deputy High Commissioner said promoting trade between the two countries would be his priority during his second innings here.
Although the two countries have encountered certain impediments or irritants in regard to the maintenance of smooth commercial engagements, we should not let these impediments become major issues, which may hamper the concerted efforts towards the more consolidation of commercial and economic relations. Both countries should not lose their sight of the overall and the mutual benefits that will accrue to our countries, simply because these peripheral irritants, he added.

Skin-Tight
If flawless skin is everybodys dream, wide and large pores are surely the worst nightmare! Fortunately there are certain remedies that can help reduce the size of your pores and make your skin look healthy and flawless. Hasini Gunasekera talks to T nC on how to get rid of enlarged pores and maintain healthy skin.
Q: Can the size of open pores on your skin be permanently tightened through natural remedies
A: Open or large pores on the skin are a concern for many and can also contribute to problems like acne and blackheads, especially for people with oily skin.
Two effective natural remedies for tightening open pores are;
Ice
Ice works as a simple and effective home remedy to help shrink large pores due to its skin tightening effect. It is often used to minimize enlarged pores before applying makeup. It will also stimulate circulation and promote healthier skin.
Wrap a few ice cubes in a clean cloth and hold it on your skin for 15 to 30 seconds. Do this a few times daily. You can reduce the frequency of use when you see improvement.
Alternatively, you can simply wash your face with ice cold water once daily.
Egg Whites
Egg whites are also widely used to shrink enlarged pores because they tone and tighten the skin. Egg white masks are also great for drawing excess oil out of greasy skin.
Simply whisk an egg white and spread it evenly on your face. Allow it to dry completely, and then rinse it off.
Hasini Gunasekera
Q: What cosmetic treatments are available to shrink open pores
A: High frequency current
High frequency is a type of current that is used on acne skin to speed the healing of active breakouts and on very oily skin to dry out the skin. It has a germicidal and healing effect on skin. It also supports the shrinking of enlarged pores.
Microdermabrasion
Microdermabrasion is generally used to get flawless, acne free and youthful skin. However; this cosmetic procedure is also extremely beneficial for getting rid of the problems of enlarged skin pores.
Q: Can facials play a role in shrinking pores permanently Or how long will the effect last
A: Yes definitely, facials play an important role in maintaining beautiful skin by many ways. Cleansing, toning and manipulation increased blood circulation greatly helps the tightening of the skin pores.
Facials help deep cleanse the skin, removing toxins caused by pollution, grease and dirt found in your everyday environment. Also facials help to reduce an overabundance of sebum, which is a natural substance moisturize and lubricate the skin. Overproduction of sebum can cause skin problems, including blackheads and acne. Cleansing in facials open the pores of the skin, remove dead skin and toxins from the face, and clean the surface of the skin through exfoliation that tightens and firms the skin.
Added to those toners are effective at deep pore cleansing and making pores appear smaller.
Now many are into modern treatments such as laser and peeling. Does such treatment cause harmful effects in the long run
Benefits
Undergoing a laser skin procedure can benefit the youthfulness and beauty of your skin. A laser peel can be performed to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, acne scarring, age spots, birthmarks, and blotchy patches on the skin. It can also improve the skins overall texture which can become rough and coarse as a result of accumulated sun damage. Deep laser skin rejuvenations can stimulate the production of new collagen in the lower dermis.
Risks
Laser skin procedures are generally safe when performed by a board-certified dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon. A patient should, however, keep in mind that laser skin complications such as infection or abnormal healing, though infrequent, do occur. Patients who are prone to scarring after a minor injury should not undergo laser skin treatments because of the risk of cosmetic damage.
Hyper pigmentation or permanent darkening of the skin is a prominent risk for darker skinned individuals seeking to undergo the procedure.
You should discuss your medical history at length with your dermatologist before undergoing laser skin treatments. Drug allergies, medical conditions, especially connective tissue and immune disorders, previous surgeries, medications youre currently taking, and any prior skin treatments can cause complications.
Q: What is the best homemade remedy to get rid of chicken-pox scars
A: Neem is a very unique tree and neem leaves are the most complex leaves on the planet. The neem tree has over 130 different biologically active compounds, and the neem leaf is one of the most complex leaves you can find on the planet.
With its medicinal qualities especially its antibacterial qualities helps heel skin fast. A great remedy to get rid of chicken pox scars is to boil neem leaves and use the water to wash the face twice a day.
Q: What is the best make up tip to make large pores appear small
A: Never underestimate the power of cosmetics to minimize even the most prominent of facial flaws. Try reducing the appearance of large pores by using a primer applied before the foundation. This will help even out your skin tone and keep foundation from soaking into your pores. With the final touches of a loose translucent powder large pores will be less visible.
Q: What is your beauty tip for this week
A: Tomato  Honey  Lemon Juice
Applying the juice of a crushed tomato over the skin can tone the skin nicely and shrink open pores effectively.
A face mask can also be made with tomato juice and honey. Apply the paste on the face and leave it on for about 15 minutes. Wash it off with cold water afterwards. You can also substitute honey with lemon juice which would have the same shrinking effect on the pores.

All domestic airports to be made operational - Transport Minister
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday the countrys domestic airports will be made operational, to transport tourists and for public transport purposes.
Minister de Silva was speaking during a tour to inspect the renovation work at the Batticaloa domestic airport yesterday.
He said there are 14 domestic airports across the country and all of them were not opened to the public due to the conflict situation. They were managed by the Sri Lanka Air Force. But, thanks to the peaceful situation prevailing in the country after 2009, we have the opportunity to make use of the domestic airports for local and foreign transport purposes and to promote tourism.
We hope that with the opening of the domestic airport in Batticaloa, more tourists would visit scenic places such as Arugam Bay. From Colombo to Batticaloa, it takes eight hours by train, six hours by bus, but, only 45 minutes by air. Therefore, measures have already been taken to develop the Batticaloa domestic airport under the new programme.
The minister has instructed Civil Aviation Authority authorities to construct a Aircraft repairing center, a yard to park light aircraft and pilot training academy at the Batticaloa domestic airport.
The Road Development Authority with the assistance of Sri Lanka Air Force is renovating the Batticaloa Internal Airport at a cost of Rs. 1,400 million under the supervision of the Transport Ministry. All construction activities are expected to be completed by December and arrangements have been made to commence flight services to and from Batticaloa with effect from January next year.

Australia resist Welsh storm
Bernard Foley's boot and brilliant defence under siege saw Australia beat Wales 15-6 on Saturday to top the World Cup Pool of Death.
Australia scored their eleventh straight victory over Wales despite being two men down at one stage and under a relentless red onslaught.
Wales back row forward Ross Moriarty (R) tackles Australias fly half Bernard Foley during a Pool A match of the 2015 Rugby World Cup between Wales and Australia at Twickenham Stadium, southwest London, on October 10, 2015. AFP
Foley kicked five penalties to get all the Australia points in front of 80,863 people at Twickenham. Dan Biggar kicked two penalties for Wales.
First place in Pool A gave the Wallabies a quarter final against Scotland. Wales get a tougher clash facing South Africa.
The Wallabies crucially remain undefeated in a tournament where every World Cup winner has reached the final without losing a game.
Australian captain Stephen Moore praised the Wallaby resistance.
"We had to defend there with 13 for long periods and I'm real proud about how we stuck in for each other," he said.
Australia "just kept getting up off the ground and making tackles. It's nothing too complicated, we just kept working hard for each other," he added.
Wales captain Sam Warburton paid tribute to the fortress put along the Wallaby touchline.
"We threw absolutely everything at Australia and you have got to give them a heck of a lot of credit in defence -- they were outstanding," he said.
"We backed ourselves to go for the try but we couldn't get it," he told ITV television.
"I am so proud of the guys, we threw everything at them. I could not ask any more of our players."
Wallabies lose two
Australia, leading 12-6, were reduced to 13 men heading into the final quarter when Will Genia and Dean Mumm were sin-binned within minutes of each other.
But Wales could not take advantage of their two extra men to add to their score.
Australia made three changes to the side that knocked England out of the World Cup with an impressive 33-3 win.
Wales boss Warren Gatland changed six of his starting XV. Wales came close to an early try when they turned over ball at an Australia scrum but North was held up. Wales dominated the opening quarter but all they had to show for it was Biggar's fourth-minute penalty.
Meanwhile Sean McMahon, in for suspended Michael Hooper, proved his worth with a thumping tackle on the Wales No 10.
Australia prop Scott Sio forced a penalty wide on the right and Foley, the 28-point hero of the win over England, made no mistake to level the match.
Foley and Biggar then exchanged penalties, with Wales competing fiercely at the breakdown, before the Australian nudged his side in front.
Biggar missed his first goal-kick in 16 attempts this World Cup before veteran centre Matt Giteau's long-range effort on the stroke of half-time fell short to leave the Wallabies 9-6 in front.
Both sides pressed hard in the second half, with Australia's David Pocock winning an important turnover after a charging run by opposing No 8 Taulupe Faletau.
Faletau carelessly gave away a penalty in front of his own posts when neck-rolling Scott Fardy out of a ruck. Foley duly made it 12-6 in the 50th minute.
Wales centre Jamie Roberts tried to make ground on the crash ball, but another immense effort by the Welsh pack ended in a turnover. Wales came again and it needed a fine tackle by Foley on North to snuff out a try.
Australia found themselves a man down in the 57th minute when scrum-half Genia was sin-binned for obstructing Wales' quick tap penalty.
Wales laid siege to the Wallaby line from a couple of scrums and drives.
Faletau went over the try-line but referee Craig Joubert called for replay assistance and it was ruled the back-row had knocked on.
Australia were down to 13 men when lock Dean Mumm was yellow-carded for taking a man out at the line-out. North should have scored a try when put through in space but was hauled down by replacement Ben McCalman in sight of the line.

Black Americans gather on 20th anniversary of Million Man March
US: Thousands of African Americans gathered in Washington on Saturday to mark the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March, renewing their demands for justice reform and greater civil rights.
The demonstration on the National Mall -- the grassy, mile-long promenade between the US Capitol building and the Washington Monument -- follows a series of high-profile incidents of police violence against black Americans over the past year.
The anniversary event gathered people from across the United States hoping to push elected officials to do more to combat social and economic inequalities, as well as violence that disproportionately affects communities of color.
Louis Farrakhan, head of the National of Islam black Muslim group, organized both the original 1995 march and this years Justice or Else gathering.
Unlike the march 20 years ago, Saturdays protest included a call for justice that encompassed a broad range of overlooked ethnic groups, whereas most participants in the first march were black males.
Protesters included entire families and people of various races who heard Farrakhan praise what he described as a new groundswell of African American activism.
This is not a moment, this is a movement, Farrakhan said during his lengthy, televised address.
He singled out the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown after an apparent altercation with a white police officer, as one sign that African Americans were fed up with the status quo.
When the brothers and sisters arose in Ferguson, you didnt have any money, you had a principle, a principle you were willing to suffer for, that you felt was bigger than yourself and life, Farrakhan told the crowd, which looked to be in the tens of thousands.
If we are denied what is rightfully due to us, then there has to be unified action that we take that will force the justice that we seek, he said from a podium near the steps of the US Capitol building.
There must come a time when we say, enough is enough. It must change, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to bring about that change.
His message found resonance with speakers and many protesters at the rally, who invoked recent acts of alleged excessive use of police force, including some that proved deadly.
Twenty years ago, the death of Tamir Rice would have fallen on deaf ears, left for the police to write a false report, and not broadcast for the world to know, organizer Tamika Mallory said, referring to last years police shooting of a 12-year-old boy in Cleveland, Ohio.
She also recalled the now infamous deaths at police hands of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York that inspired the Black Lives Matter movement, whose slogan was omnipresent on the Mall.
Beyond the growing media attention and accountability, though, there are mixed signs of progress over the two decades since the original march.
The unemployment rate for black men in the US has stubbornly hovered around eight percent since 1995, twice that of white men.
The rate at which African-Americans are arrested has declined slightly, but they remain six times more likely than whites to be detained and often face harsher sentences for comparable crimes, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
Barack Obama attended the original Million Man March, prior to being elected Americas first black president, but the US leader was in California during the latest protest.

[Health Watch] Essential newborn care and breastfeeding
Breast is best!
Dr. Dhammica Rowel (MBBS, MA (Health Promotion), MSc. MD (Com. Med), Consultant Community Physician and the National Programme Manager of the Intra-natal and Newborn Care Unit of the Family Health Bureau (FHB) of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry talks to T n'C Health Watch on newborn care and importance of breastfeeding.
Q - What is essential newborn care
A - Essential Care for the newborn is the care that should be received by every newborn from the time of birth and it includes breastfeeding, keeping the baby warm, preventing infections, identifying any risk conditions and attending to it and giving routine care for the baby. As soon as the baby is born, the baby should be dried up, covered with a dry towel a cap and cloths. The baby should be covered (if necessary) with another towel and should be kept in skin- to- skin contact between the mother's breasts. While doing this the baby is assessed for breathing, colour and activity.
Q - Why is breastfeeding important
A - Early initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour is very important to the baby as it provides many benefits. It has been found that about 25 percent of newborn deaths can be averted by early initiation of breastfeeding. The baby will get much needed colostrum when fed early and colostrum provides perfect nutrition, immunity that protects from infections and factors that help in maturation of the gut. For the gut maturation, the growth factors secreted with breast milk is essential. For early initiation of breastfeeding the mother and the baby has to be in close proximity, as when the baby gets hunger cues, on its own it will get attached to the breast and be breastfed.
Q - Why is it important to keep an infant warm
A - Keeping the baby warm is also very important at this early period of life. Much attention is still not paid for this care. This is especially important for the babies who are born with a low birth weight or born prematurely. Covering the head of the baby with a cap in the initial period in addition to other garments that the baby would usually wear, helps prevent the baby from getting cold. If a baby gets cold, it can lead to many other complications that can eventually lead to death. Therefore much attention needs to be paid to keep a newborn warm.
Keeping the baby in Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is another method of providing essential care for the newborn especially the small babies. In addition to keeping the baby warm, KMC also helps prevent infections in the newborn, supports in breastfeeding, and improves mother child - bonding.
Preventing infections is another key aspect of essential care. Hand washing or using a hand rub before handling the newborn is a useful practice to prevent infections in the newborn. Also, we have a good cultural practice of visiting a new mother and a baby with gifts which we should preserve. However in these visits, the visitors better not handle the newborn babies as it can lead to infections in the newborn. This is especially so for newborn babies with a low birth weight or born prematurely.
Q - Please explain why breastfeeding is essential and what are the complications associated with breastfeeding when done for the first time and during the initial stage of the life of an infant.
A - Breastfeeding is a natural phenomenon and many mothers very successfully breastfeed their babies without any problems. Some mothers get problems in breastfeeding and need extra support. Mainly first- time mothers and mothers with small babies commonly need more support to breastfeed.
The best time for a mother to learn how to breastfeed is during pregnancy. Classes are conducted by the Medical Officers of Health for pregnant mothers where all the aspects of breastfeeding are taught to the mother.
Q - Please explain the importance of breast milk.
A - Benefits of breastfeeding for the baby are many. Breastfeeding is the most important intervention to keep the newborn healthy and prevent newborn morbidity and mortality. For the newborn it provides not only short term benefits, but also many long term benefits..
It has to be understood that breastfeeding is a process and it entails receiving much needed breast milk as well as receiving benefits from the process of breastfeeding such as preventing infections in the newborn, preventing the baby getting cold and improving mother child bonding.
For the first year or so of life a baby's immune system is not fully developed and cannot fight infections as well as an older child's or adult's. So a baby needs to be protected by his mother. Breast milk contains white blood cells and a number of anti-infective factors which help to protect a baby against infection. Breast milk also contains antibodies against infections which the mother has had in the past. Therefore breastfeeding protects the baby from many infections especially ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea. Some childhood malignancies and leukemia are also known to be less in breastfed infants. Breastfeeding is known to protect the baby from non-communicable diseases such as Diabetes, hypercholesterolemia in adult life. And not only physical health, breastfeeding helps improve cognitive development as well.
Q - How does breastfeeding help young mothers
A - Breastfeeding benefits the mother as well. Breastfeeding mothers are bound to have better health as the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer is less in breastfed mothers. Longer you breastfeed your risk of breast cancer will be less. And moreover breastfeeding mothers are happy, productive mothers. This fact is important for the working mothers as well.
Q - Can a mother returning to work after 84 days stick to exclusive breastfeeding
A - It is best for the working mother to continue breastfeeding even if she has to return to work before completion of six months and even thereafter with complementary feeding.
The mother has to get working on a routine to express and cup feed baby and get herself organized at least one week before she starts working. Breast milk can be easily expressed and fed with a cup to the infant. The correct technique of hand expression has to be learned by the mother at the antenatal class, from her midwife or at a Lactation Management Center. Expressed breast milk can be kept in the outside environment up to 6 hours and in the lower compartment of the fridge for 24 hours and in the freezer compartment about a month.
Express your breast milk before you go to work and leave it for the carer to give to your baby. Leave yourself enough time to express your breast milk in a relaxed way. Express as much breast milk as you can into several clean cups and store. Leave about half cupful (100ml) for each feed. Cover the cup of expressed milk and keep it in the coolest place.

Can you have friends at work
The people you work with are people you were just thrown together with, observed Martin Freemans character in The Office more than a decade ago, as elderly readers may recall. You spend more time with them than your friends and family, butprobably all youve got in common isthe factthat you walk around on the same bit of carpet for eight hours a day.
Different story
That assessment may be even more accurate today: according to the psychologist Adam Grant, fewer and fewer of us have any close friends at work. Its worst in America where, between the 1980s and 2000s, the proportion of people who said they had a good work friend slid from half to less than a third. But the situations hardly wonderful in Britain, where 42% of us dont. Its easy to guess why. Once, we had jobs for life, which meant colleagues for life, plus company events for the family.
Transactional place
Now, writes Grant, work is a more transactional place. We go to the office to be efficient, not to form bonds. Transience  along with telecommuting and extreme busy-ness  is poison to friendship. The guy at the desk next to yours might be gone in two months. Or you might be gone. Or, if youre a victim of the sinister cult of hot-desking, you might not even have a desk. Why bother asking him to the pub
This might not matter if we were also spending fewer hours at work, with time to forge friendships outside, but the opposites true, of course, which means the worst of both worlds: more work, withless social nourishment to show for it. Andfriendships sown in office soil were fragile shoots to begin with, as Mark Vernon explains in his lovely book, The Meaning Of Friendship, because the logic of the workplace is opposed to that of making friends.
Commitment
Work is about getting things done, so your values inevitably linked to what you contribute. A close friendship, by contrast, is valuable precisely because its not transactional, in any measurable way. Its acommitment to be there regardless. This tension leads to awkwardness, as when an office friends shoddy work makes your work harder, orwhen he or she is suddenly your boss.
Can you shop your way to happiness
Assuming you cant  or dont want to  just quit office culture altogether, its worth resisting the urge to isolate yourself socially there. All the research suggests that more work friendships means better health and a sense of fulfilment. True, this means staying open to interaction with annoying people, too: the colleague who takes a single party invite as a cue to unburden his deepest woes, daily, or the nosy one whos desperate to hear yours.
Yet even annoying people can be enriching, as I discovered when Ileft a newsroom job to work from home. I used to get cross with the loud phone-talkers, but Imissed their absence even more; even fractious social connections are connections. (I now rent a desk in a shared workspace, a compromise I adore.) Sure, were all treading the same bit of carpet for eight hours a day, but even thats preferable to each treading our own, alone.

The carrot cure
Your parents were right - carrots really can help your eyesight.
Pigments called carotenoids - which give vegetables like carrots, peppers and spinach their colours - can slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), researchers have found.
The condition is one of the most common causes of vision loss in older people - and is also on the rise.
A recent study published in Lancet Global Health estimated there will be 196 million sufferers by 2020 and 288 million by 2040.
The Harvard University-led study used data from a population survey that tracked more than 100,000 over-50s over a period of 25 years.
It found that those who consumed the highest levels of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin had a 40 per cent lower risk of developing the advanced form of the condition than those who ate the least.
Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in high concentrations in the macula of the eye, where they are known as the macular pigment.
The macular pigment protects the macula by interacting with free radicals to prevent cell damage and by filtering out damaging blue light.
Good sources of lutein and zeaxanthin are dark leafy vegetables and eggs.
The study also found those who consumed the highest levels of some of the other forms of carotenoids - alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin - had a 25 per cent to 35 per cent lower risk of advanced AMD.
Carrots and sweet potato are sources of alpha and beta-carotene, while beta-cryptoxanthin is found in fruits like oranges and peaches.
The researchers did not find any link between carotenoids and the intermediate form of AMD, however.
This study suggests that carotenoids may slow worsening of AMD once it occurs, the researchers concluded in the journal JAMA Opthalmology.
AMD, although painless, causes the loss of central vision, usually in both eyes.
According to experts at NHS Choices, the sight loss usually happens gradually over time, although it can sometimes be rapid.
With the condition, reading becomes difficult, colours appear less vibrant and people's faces are difficult to recognise, they said.
There is currently no cure. However, AMD does not affect peripheral, or side, vision, which means it will not cause complete blindness.

Pararajasinghams murder
CID arrests Pilleyan
The CID arrested former Chief Minister of the Eastern Province Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan over former parliamentarian Joseph Pararajasinghams murder.
The former Chief Minister who was summoned, arrived at the CID at 5.25 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by his lawyer.
Meanwhile, a group of CID officers left for Batticaloa on Saturday night to question Pilleyan over Pararajasinghams murder.
However, the family members of the former Chief Minister informed the CID officers he was not home.
But the CID officers suspicions grew as they spotted Chandrakanthans vehicle at his personal residence in Batticaloa.
As a result, the CID deployed a phalanx of officers around the house of the former Chief Minister, an ex-stalwart of the LTTE.
The CID had also visited Chandrakanthans brothers house in Batticaloa on Saturday night, in search of the ex-Chief Minister.
As the initial attempt to question Chandrakanthan failed, the CID told his family members to inform the former Chief Minister to be present at the CID yesterday at 5.00 p.m.
The CID on Thursday arrested two suspects in connection with the murder of former TNA Parliamentarian who was shot dead at St. Marys Cathedral Church in Batticaloa, while attending Christmas prayers on December 25, 2005 morning.
It has now been established that two suspects were members of the TMVP, with one even serving as an Urban Council member of the party, at one point.
The two suspects are former Battcicaloa Municipal Council member Edwin Silva Krishnanandaraja alias Pradeep Master and Rangasami kanaganayagam alias Gajan Mama.
The TMVP, formed by former Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan alias Karuna, was taken over by Chandrakanthan in 2008.

Climate change clips wings of migratory birds: ornithologist
POLAND: It takes the dexterity of a lacemaker to remove the tiny bird caught in nets strung between pine trees on Polands Baltic coast, a veritable paradise for dozens of migratory species.
Polish ornithologist Jaroslaw Nowakowski delicately unravels the Goldcrest, among Europes smallest bird species, placing it inside a muslin bag before moving it to a make-shift laboratory in a tent for measuring and tagging with rings.
The hulking professor says studies by the University of Gdansk over the last 55 years show a disturbing trend in the wings of certain species.
Pointed wings better adapted to travelling long distances are giving way to more rounded ones that work better on shorter trips, Nowakowski told AFP, blaming global warming, urbanisation and deforestation for the change.
Thanks to our extensive records, we have solid proof of the change and have raised the alarm, but generally to no avail.
Climate change is nothing new, but today humans are triggering very rapid changes and certain species arent able to adapt -- thats the greatest risk.
Migratory birds face a myriad of other man-made threats. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, end up on dinner plates around the Mediterranean basin.
Snipes, with their long, slender bill, are considered a delicacy from Cyprus to France, even though they provide precious little meat.
Sometimes our bird rings return to us, as its a rule to return them to the country of origin. Im sure more than one Frenchman has cracked a tooth eating pate made using our birds, he told AFP.
He explains that rings often return with documents marked pate as the location they were found.
The colourful Goldcrest that Nowakowski has just removed from the net is tiny, yet mighty. Weighing in at just 4.5 grams (0.16 ounces), it can easily fly cross the Baltic.
It can weigh up to six grammes, but then wed say its a bit obese, he chuckles.
After weighing it and measuring its wings and tail, Nowakowski fastens a numbered ring around one of its legs that will help track its winter migration south or west.
Fifteen volunteers including pensioners, engineers and bank employees, help Nowakowski and fellow ornithologist Michal Redlisiak check 50 nets for new birds around the clock. Any delay in removing them could prove fatal. Volunteers on the night shift wear head-lamps as they wander the forests like ghosts checking the nets for freshly snared birds.
Some days our nets catch just 30 birds, while on others there are 1,000 to 2,000. We dont really sleep much. Without the volunteers, our research would be impossible, says Nowakowski.
Ornithologists have been studying birds annually on Polands Vistula Spit using the same methods and measurements for the last 55 years, creating an unparallelled treasure trove of data.

A cuddly reason to live
She could read I was in pain': Breast cancer survivor says pet CHEETAH who cuddles up with her in bed helped her battle disease
Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013
South Africanwas comforted by cheetah who licked her newly bald head
The 53-year-old beat the illness saying she wanted to live for pet Fiela
A brave cancer survivor has told how she overcame the illness - with the help of her fully-grown pet cheetah.
Big cat lover Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen, from South Africa, was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2013, undergoing a double mastectomy and chemotherapy as part of her treatment.
The 53-year-old describes how Fiela - who she bought in 2006 - would sleep on her bed, suck her finger and lick her newly bald head to comfort her.
Riana's unique bond with the animal means she can safely cuddle up with her and eat from the same dinner table.
The cancer survivor has now opened up about how the cheetah would comfort her during the frightening ordeal.
She said: I was so afraid our relationship would change - I lost all my hair and the first time she saw me she just licked my head to say, You are okay, I still love you.
When I came back from hospital I was so afraid that she should jump on me and hurt me, but she had a certain way to get on the bed.
She did not get on top of me, she was always getting on the other side, as if to say - I know you're hurt and I know there's changes.
She could read that I was in pain. It's amazing how they can sense things in humans.
She looked after me somehow and that purring of hers, being with me - you don't think of yourself, you just want to live for them.'
Riana has had a passion for the world's fastest land animal since she saw one in a magazine when she was 13.
In 2006 she resigned after 22 years at the Department of Justice to pursue her dream of breeding cheetahs to release back into a protected wild'.
The big-hearted survivor now runs the Cheetah Experience in Bloemfontein, South Africa, with her home based on the site.
The centre is open to the public and is home to 19 cheetahs, as well as a plethora of other animals including lions, tigers, leopards, wolves and meerkats.
However it is nine-year-old Fiela who Riana holds dearest.
She explained: Fiela was my first cheetah - we have a very special bond. We all call her the Queen, she does whatever she wants to do.
She doesn't like people touching her.
When she's with me it's just different - she likes to sleep on the bed, she sucks my finger, she sees me as her companion.
I'm her mummy and I love her a lot.'
She has documented their time together in photographs which illustrate their unique relationship.
Riana is seen cuddling up to Fiela in bed and eating a bowl of food as she lovingly pets the animal.
Riana opened the Cheetah Experience in 2006 and now has five full-time staff, alongside a regular influx of volunteers and animal lovers who come from all over the world
Cheetahs are endangered animals and Riana said her main mission in life is to help them.Riana plays with her animals, helping them to maintain their hunting skills using stuffed toys.
She continued: If humans don't look after them, we will lose them. The fastest land animal is running out of time.
We want to breed them in captivity, so one day I hope we can get a sponsor for a piece of land.
We will be able to release them, where we can watch them and monitor them without predators.'

Dayasiri keen to improve standard of sport
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that he will be working to find strengths and weaknesses of the sports field and to bring amendments to the sports act and make a revival of sports in Sri Lanka.
There is a decline in sports as the sports personnel and the coaches face difficulties due to the internal crisis in the local sports governing bodies.
The Minister also stated that he is proud about the National Paralympic Committee being an exemplary to other sports governing bodies where the officials are in a tug of war to get posts.
He expressed his views at the media briefing for the sponsoring of National Paralympic Committee and Sri Lanka Army Para Games festival by Dialog Axiata PLC.
Also he pointed out the need of a programme to recognize the differently abled youth with sports talent.
Dialog Axiata PLC will provide the financial assistance for the National Paralympics contingent and Army Para Games for a period of two years from 2015 to 2017. Dialog's first international commitment will be the upcoming International Paralympics Championship World Meet in Doha, Qatar where Sri Lanka will field seven athletes.

Dont like to be tagged as glamorous - Aishwarya
INDIA: Regarded widely as the epitome of beauty and glamour, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan says she wanted to be known more for her performance than looks.
The former Miss World, 41, who is making a comeback to the big screen after five years with Jazbaa, said there was a perception in peoples mind that she will opt for glamorous role but she preferred otherwise.
When I chose to start my career with Iruvar, I genuinely believed I was liberating myself as an actor. I came to the industry after Miss World, modelling... There was obvious perception that Aishwarya Rai means glamour.
So when I chose to work with Mani Ratnam in a south Indian film like Iruvar, which had Mohanlal, Revathi, Tabu, I wanted to be free as an artist. I didnt want to be in the mould of perception... I wanted to be free from this perception, she told reporters here during the promotion of the film in the capital.
In the Sanjay Gupta-directed film, which releases this Friday, Aishwarya plays a doting mother of a girl child.
The mother of one took insights from her real life to portray the character of Anuradha Verma.
There was no apprehension of playing a mother. I would have chosen this film five years ago too but the difference is today I am a mother. So, I am playing Anuradha Verma in a given situation, I do know what a mother is experiencing. I have brought the truth towards acting through this film.
Asked whether it was a challenge to strike a balance between motherhood and professional commitments, the Guzaarish actress said, Every working woman, every mother has her own challenge to multitask. It brings a certain joy which is difficult to put to words but if you think I am looking content, it means I have found my balance. The actress said she did not have any inhibition of taking a long break from films to raise her three-year-old daughter Aaradhya.
I am a very committed mother, and professional. So only when I knew that I can balance both, I took up Jazbaa. However, the actress does not like to label the film as her comeback project.
Honestly, I dont feel like I was gone anywhere. I became a mother and during that time, through advertisements, endorsements and social work, I was always in touch with fans.

EIA report out before October 15
The crucial Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report of the Colombo Port City Development Project will be released on or before October 15, Coastal Conservation Department (CCD) Director General Prabath Chandrakeerthi said.
He said the department has been informed that the EIA was nearing completion.
When we get the report, we will refer it to a Technical Committee of the Department, and with their recommendations will forward it to the Special Committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister appointed to review the project, he said.
Chandrakeerthi observed the Terms of Reference (ToR) that laid the guidelines as to what should be included in the EIA was compiled by the CCD jointly with the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).
He pointed out they would specifically look for areas which were not covered by the previous EIA report, adding that the CCD is the authorised agency to issue the permit for the project.
The previous EIA had only covered an area of 200 hectares, whereas the entire project site extends to 270 hectares. A separate environmental assessment should be carried out for the area where they will obtain sand for the project. We have been informed that sea sand would be used for the purpose. The impact of the breakwater to be constructed near the port city will also be analyzed, he said.
Chandrakeerthi said the CCD has given instructions to the Urban Development Ministry as to how the EIA should be carried out, adding that the ministry has forwarded it to the Chinese company undertaking the project.
As we know the EIA was carried out by the company with the consultation of Moratuwa University, he added.
Chandrakeerthi said the high level review committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister also includes the Secretaries to the Environment and Mahaweli Development Ministry and Urban Development Ministry, Urban Development Authority Chairman and Director General, and representatives of the Attorney General Department and CEA.
Meanwhile, the Chinese governments Special Envoy and Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Liu Zhenmin called on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe among others during an official visit to Sri Lanka last week.
The agreement for the Colombo Port City Development Project signed between the Sri Lankan government and the relevant project company was extended by another six months from September 15 with the approval of the Cabinet.

England end on winning note
Veteran Nick Easter and World Cup debutant Jack Nowell scored a hat-trick of tries each in England's 60-3 consolation hammering of Uruguay on Saturday.
However, the team were far from forgiven for their disastrous tournament which saw them become the first hosts to fail to reach the knockout stages.
There were more than 4,000 empty seats for their final Pool A game at the Manchester City ground and major doubts remain about the future of coach Stuart Lancaster after their calamitous exit.
Lancaster gave no indication about whether he has made up his mind to resign or wait to be pushed by the Rugby Football Union (RFU).
It has been a tough week. I just wanted to get through the week and put in a good performance. We have done that so we will see what next week holds, Lancaster said after the game.
Anyone in my position who has worked since December 2011 to this point would say it would be hard to walk away from, Lancaster told a press conference. But equally I understand it is a results business.
Those who went to the match saw a reassuring performance with 10 tries and a chance for some of England's new generation to stake a claim for places.
The 37-year-old Easter got the man-of-the match award for his three tries, most of which resulted from England's total domination of the set pieces.
But Nowell's classy runs and a try also on his debut for his Exeter teammate Henry Slade will have given hope for the future.
The game started ominously for the English. They conceded a penalty after just 90 seconds for offside which Felipe Berchesi slotted over.
But Nowell got the ball from a lineout in the seventh minute and kicked forward for Anthony Watson to gather and touch down before a chasing pack of Uruguyan players.
Watson could have been offside but referee Chris Pollock awarded England's 1,500th Test match try. Easter got his first touchdown in the 18th minute.
England won a lineout and the pack drove to the line where Easter forced his way over. His second try came five minutes later in similar circumstances and England started to motor ahead.
Watson got an easy try just after the break and Slade charged down a Uruguayan kick and rushed in to get his name on the sheet.
Nowell got his first from a smart Danny Care pass which put him free on the right wing. Care also pushed the England pack forward for Easter's third try.
Nowell then got two tries in two minutes -- the 10th score was a penalty try.
Uruguay took a bit of breaking down but I thought we got there in the second half and scored some good tries, said Lancaster.
Overall I thought we put some good shapes together and our attack was creative, there were some good skills out there and there were some good tries.
If Easter's Test career is unlikely to last much longer, captain Chris Robshaw predicted great things for the young backs.
There is a huge amount of talent out there. They are not afraid to take people on and you always see something special.
There is so much potential in the side and there are going to be great times to come, said Robshaw, whose own position will come under scrutiny after the campaign of defeat.
We knew we had to finish off on a high, said Care, one of the established generation.
Obviously people are very disappointed that we didn't get through to the quarter-finals - no more so than the players in that dressing room.
But all we could was go out there and throw the ball around and try and enjoy it. I thought we did that tonight.

Feng shui Tips
The ancient Chinese philosophy of feng shui advocates the use of plants to create harmony in the home. Experts translate good feng shui into the ideal balance of energies in a home.
Plants represent wood, the only one of the five elements (the others being earth, water, air and metal) that contains chi, energy or the life force. How does that translate into plants and their placement across the home Feng shui recommends plants with more yin than yang in the bedroom (ferns and feathery herbs), along with hanging baskets and plants on windowsills.
Plants with broad, full leaves are ideal for the kitchen, while a small water body surrounded by a variety of plants creates the best balance of calm and energy in the living room. Lastly, never keep a cactus on your night table  it will lead to fitful sleep and bad dreams.

More attention needed to improve schoolchildren's health
Fight against NCDs takes multi-sectoral approach
Children of school going age are another group who are at a higher risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) needing urgent preventive measures to be taken.
Out of school going children, 15 to 30 percent are obese or overweight, while 10 percent of the children are at pre-diabetic stage while one percent of schoolchildren already suffer from diabetes, said Director, Non Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Thilak Siriwardhana.
However, despite the Health Ministry recommending focus on physical training and education as a part of mitigation plan, implementation is still not at 100 percent. Next year, the Health Ministry is recommending even more preventive action.
"We recommend Health science to be reintroduced as a compulsory subject to the curricular, with practical lessons and tests as well. Right now it is in the basket of optional subjects and many children opt for other subjects,"he said.
The situation is reflective of the increasing trend of NCDs in the in the country. In Sri Lanka, 75 percent of deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes.
The probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 from one of the four main NCDs, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mallitus or chronic respiratory disease was 17.6 percent.
In an attempt to arrest the trend (NCDs) reaching epidemic, now at epidemic levels in the country, the Health Ministry s launching a multi-sectoral plan from next year.
A number of key ministries including education, agriculture, youth and sports will be implementing a joint strategy with the Health Ministry taking the lead.
The National Multi- sectoral Action Plan for NCD prevention and 2013-2020 is being finalised by the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry.
Changing the focus from treatment of NCDs, representative, WHO Sri Lanka Dr Jacob Kumaresan, said the focus is now on prevention to save future generations from health socio-economic harm of such diseases.
Dr Jacob Kumaresan
"It is the basically lifestyle of the people that effect their health. In the 1970s, Sri Lanka was highly affected by infectious diseases such as Malaria, Diarrohea and Tuberculosis. The government controlled the diseases and today we rarely witness people dying due to infectious diseases. Non Communicable Diseases are not similar diseases. The issues pertaining to the NCD are involved with our life style," said Dr. Kumaresan. He said that the risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases.
Speaking about the measures, he said that there is a set of cost effective and affordable evidence based policies for tackling NCDs that was endorsed by the World Health Assembly.
As part of the strategy, the Sports Ministry will train over 2,000 physical training instructors from the Education Ministry on NCD prevention measures next year. The ministry will also launch a project to build open gyms in every divisional secretariat areas.
"They are planning to complete this project within the next year itself. The ministry will also work with local authorities to set up walkways in each division to encourage public to engage in physical activity," Dr. Siriwardhena explained.
Besides this, the Agriculture Ministry will also set up a plan to change farming patterns with the aim of increasing vegetable and fruit consumption among Sri Lankans.
The Health Ministry intends to focus on improving health through reducing the usage of alcohol and tobacco. At present Sri Lanka has a high tobacco and alcohol usage, with one third male population using tobacco.
"The Health Ministry has stopped all advertisements related to alcohol and tobacco. The government already implemented the plan of using pictorial warning on cigarette packets and measures are being taken to make the packets non attractive," he said.
The measures, the ministry intends to implement with the support of many government and non-government sectors for the tobacco demand reduction are taxation, smoke free policies and health warnings.
Harmful use of alcohol reduction measures are availability regulations, advertising, promotion bans and pricing policies.
The Health Ministry also plans to train youth to carry out preventive and awareness programmes partnering with the Youth Affairs Ministry. Members of over 2,000 youth clubs are to be trained through the programme.
The multi-secotoral programme, to be launched early next year is funded through a US$ 200 million soft loan with 11 UN agencies providing support services and technical assistance to state agencies.

Deputy Solicitor General Sobhitha Rajakaruna said that certain officers conducting investigations into several malpractices, seek the advice of the Attorney General's Department without forwarding the relevant documents to the Attorney General's Department.
"Therefore, it is not fair for people to level allegations against the Attorney General's Department that certain reports relating to cases are delayed, since such a delay occurs due to the producing of false details to courts," he said.
The Attorney General's Department cannot intervene in various other sectors and fields, which are not under its purview. Without knowing the real situation, certain persons level allegations against the Attorney General's Department in this regard.
Deputy Solicitor General Rajakaruna was addressing the media when Attorney General Y. J. W. Wijayatilaka called on the Asgiriya and Malwatte Mhanayake Theras to receive their blessings yesterday.
He added that the Attorney General has not instructed to stop inquiries into the Avant Garde case.

Sri Lanka: talking about a resolution
Govts constructive approach towards accountability process
For those of you who dont know Sri Lanka, its a beautiful country  with world-class national parks, world heritage sites and pristine tropical beaches. But it is also haunted by a traumatic past, a devastating twenty-six year civil war between the Tamil Tigers and the government that ended in 2009.
Some of the stories from this war  many documented in painstaking detail by the media  are horrifying: rape, disappearances, torture, executions.
To be clear, there were atrocities on both sides. And they cast a long shadow in communities right across Sri Lanka today.
Until very recently, Sri Lanka has been unwilling to address the legacy of this war. We know from our own experience that opening up old wounds can be painful; but experience also shows that allowing them to fester is even worse. And it is my firm belief  from the many discussions Ive had with Sri Lankans since becoming a Minister in 2012  that for the country to fulfil its enormous potential, it needs the catharsis that can only come from a proper process of accountability and reconciliation.
That is why, back in 2013, our Prime Minister was so determined that the United Nations should take action to kick-start this work, when it was clear that the Sri Lankan government of the day was unwilling to do so.
Human Rights Council
I remember travelling to Geneva to lobby for the resolution at the Human Rights Council: it was hard work, with a good degree of opposition from countries close to President Rajapaksa and his administration. But we got there in the end. This mandated the UN to produce a report on the conflict, which they have now done. It makes for sobering reading.
Hugo Swire
Happily, a new government in Colombo has now taken an altogether more constructive approach to this process. When I went back to Geneva last month, to start to put together a new resolution setting out what should now happen to address the crimes laid out in the report, I was working with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, rather than against him. Sri Lanka ended up co-sponsoring the resolution, and firmly committed to implementing its recommendations. This is good for those who seek truth and justice, good for the rule of law, and good for the future of the people of Sri Lanka.
There will of course be those on the extremes of both sides who will be concerned either that this is not enough, or that it goes too far. It is only right that they are able to express their opinions and it is important that the government listens to all points of view as part of the wider consultations to which it has agreed. But now, as the country is beginning to take brave and important steps forward, it is above all vital that progress is not derailed.
Release of political prisoners
Im hopeful that the next stage of this process will be accompanied by further progress on some of the other commitments President Sirisena has made  from demilitarisation, to anti-corruption work, to the release of political prisoners, to reducing tensions between communities and disengaging the military from commercial activities. There is much to be done, and we in the UK are keen to offer support wherever we can. Well be discussing this with the Sri Lankan government in the coming weeks.
I remember one particular moment from my first trip to Sri Lanka, back in 2013. I met a number of families who had not seen relatives, in some cases, for years, and who had no idea whether they were dead or alive. The impact on their lives was of course tremendous. In some cases they wanted justice, but above all they wanted answers.
A two thousand word document negotiated five thousand miles away in Geneva can seem a long way from peoples lives on the ground. But every practical step the Sri Lankan government takes to implement the recommendations in this document will help to answer questions that have been left unanswered for too long.

Govt determined to increase country's forest density
The government is determined to increase the country's forest density from its existing 29 per cent to 32 per cent in the next three years, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
The President was speaking at a national ceremony to mark "Wana Ropa" a tree planting programme at Kotmale. The President said he firmly believed the tree planting programme will enhance the country's forest cover.
Drawing attention to the rampant destruction of the country's forests, President Sirisena said this was done by some businessmen and racketeers who only think of financial gains without an iota of thought to the environmental degradation they are causing and its damaging repercussions to the country's future.
The President said it is essential to strictly implement laws to protect the environment and take action against persons who violate such laws irrespective of their status.
The President noted that despite the conflict in the Northern and Eastern provinces a large portion of the forest cover is still found intact. The forests were protected in those areas but forests in other areas faced immense danger.
President Sirisena stressed that he will take all measures, including legal action against wrongdoers to protect forests and wildlife.
"As children of nature, we have a duty and responsibility to protect the environment that we inherited and prevent any human activity harmful to the atmosphere and the ecosystem," he added.
The President planted a "Na" sapling to mark the occasion.
Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Navin Dissanayake, Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Parliamentarian Mayantha Dissanayake, Senior Advisor to the President former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne, politicians, state officials and public attended.

Greece vows first migrant hotspot on Lesbos within 10 days
GREECE: Greece pledged Saturday during talks with its EU partners to open its first so-called hotspot reception centre on the island of Lesbos within 10 days under EU efforts to better deal with the massive influx of migrants.
We are going to keep to our commitments, Yiannis Mouzalas, Greeces junior interior minister for migration, told reporters, adding Athens had also begun talks with Turkey on trying to better control the flow of refugees and migrants.
The reception centre on Lesbos will be among five eventual hotspots on Greek islands that provide the first point of arrival for migrants fleeing to Europe after leaving the Turkish coast.
EU nations endorsed a dedicated programme this week to send back those they described as economic migrants -- who are largely from poor African nations -- and not refugees from conflict zones.
After months of tensions over the more than 600,000 people who have flooded into Europe this year, Brussels is now taking a tougher stance by focusing on tightening border controls and reducing the incentive for people to come to the continent.
The hotspots in Greece and Italy, agreed by EU leaders at a summit last month, are aimed at separating the new arrivals between bona fide refugees and economic migrants at their first entry point into the bloc.
Those deemed to warrant refugee status can then be relocated to other EU countries to ease the burden on Greece and Italy and to prevent the migrants from continuing northwards in an uncontrolled manner.
Greeces pledge on the Lesbos reception centre was made during talks with Europes migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country holds the EU presidency.

Hashans entry takes new turn
Sri Lanka's search for a new cricket coach took a new turn when former Sri Lanka captain Hashan Tillakaratne sent his application to become the batting coach of national team which has been been in wilderness without a proper professional coach. A veteran of 83 Tests and 200 One Day Internationals, 48-year-old Tillakaratne seems to be an ideal choice to resurrect the batting department of the Sri Lanka national team, if he gets the blessings of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee.
Sri Lanka team's batting was in a total mess during the recent home series against India and Pakistan as the home team lost the back to back series with the identical margin 1-2, one of their worst defeats on home soil since gaining the Test status way back in 1982.
The recent retirements of veteran Test batsmen and former captains, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara as well as that of Tillakaratne Dilshan from Tests have broken the backbone of Sri Lanka batting. Following the conclusion of Jayawardene's 149-match Test career during the last home series against Pakistan, Sangakkara retired from Tests after the first two Tests in the last home series against India. Now that both Jayawardene and Sangakkara, who had done bulk of the scoring in recent times, have retired it would be a heavy burden on skipper Angelo Mathews in marshalling his brigade during the team-building process.
Tillakaratne's patience at the middle as a dependable Test batsman has been a shining example, scoring 4,545 runs with an attractive average of 42.87 in 83 matches with 11 centuries and 20 fifties. At a time Sri Lanka is struggling to groom a good set of top and middle order batsman, an experienced campaigner such as Tillakaratne could play a vital role.
But it all depends on how transparent the SLC Interim Committee would be when picking the right people for the right job'! Petty club politics should be a thing of the past, giving the highest priority to build a strong national team to fill the vacuum. It would not be an easy task to find a middle order pair which could emulate Mahela and Sanga and their absence would be badly felt. Yet, Sri Lanka must make every effort to find batsmen who could somewhere get closer to their exemplary careers.
Going by the recent performance records, Sri Lanka may once again opt for a professional foreign coach. Yet, past Sri Lanka cricketers with proven track records could be used to development specialized areas such as batting, fast bowling, spin bowling and fielding. It was unfortunate that Sri Lanka has not continued with its fast bowling coach Chaminda Vaas who had captured 355 Test wickets and 400 ODI wickets with his left-arm fast bowling'.
Vaas instant results
During the rare break he got to coach seamers of New Zealand team, Vaas produced instant results that prompted local cricket authorities to sign him. But the manner in which he was unceremoniously dumped with various excuses should not be approved and Tillakaratne too should not be treated in similar fashion.
The services of the most outstanding former Sri Lanka cricketers such as Vaas and Tillkaratne should be used in the most profitable manner to sharpen the skills of the national team. This could be done under the overall supervision of a foreign head coach. Had Marvan Atapattu teamed up well with Vaas, Sri Lanka would never have lost successive home series which eventually compelled the former Sri Lanka opening batsman to step down from his position as the head coach.
The West Indies have just begun their full tour of Sri Lanka although the hosts are still in search of a permanent coach. SLC's head of coaching Jerome Jayaratne, who does not have any intentional experience as a player, is now functioning as the interim head coach appointed by the interim committee. His interim appointment came merely four days after Atapattu had tendered his resignation as the national team coach after Pakistanis and Indians had beaten us on home soil.
Although Jayaratne was appointed the head of coaching in 2008, his role was not extended to the national team which was then coached by Trevor Bayliss. Despite Atapattu becoming the first local to become the head coach of the national team after many years, he did not last long.
Stylish opening bat turned coach Atapattu had officially held the position since September last year, but had effectively been head coach since April 2014, after Paul Farbrace's departure. Atapattu had worked as batting coach of the team since 2011 and it is this post which has been kept open that Hashan had applied for.
The SLC's hunt for a head coach gained momentum last year with over 12 high-profile persons, including Mickey Arthur, Ray Jennings and Eric Simons from South Africa and Chris Adams of England showing their desire to coach Sri Lanka national team. But the SLC finally settled for Atapattu, a decision which had been criticized by certain quarters.The premature exits of Farbrace and his successor Atapattu have forced Sri Lanka cricket administrators to do coach shopping once again.
Whilst accepting that Sri Lanka has fallen behind in Test cricket, the interim head coach Jayaratne has said the team is working hard to correct that during the upcoming home series against West Indies. Sri Lanka have lost their last three Test series, against New Zealand away and then to Pakistan and India at home, winning two and losing six out of eight games and Jayaratne will face a gigantic task in putting the house back in order. Although Jayaratne expects an improved performance against West Indies, it would not be an easy task for Angelo's lads to come on top.
Windies own worries
Batting and ground fielding are two areas that cost Sri Lanka its last two series against Pakistan and India. In the absence of a batting coach, a role that was fulfilled by Atapattu, Jayaratne has taken on the task for the time being. Jayaratne has said he is also keen on keeping the team atmosphere good, and has instructed the players to come to him if they are not comfortable.
The West Indies too have their own worries to address. West Indies captain Jason Holder has said that the fate of suspended head coach Phil Simmons lay in the hands of West Indian board but added that he had been a wonderful inspiration during his brief time in charge.
Simmons position was put in limbo when he expressed discontent over West Indies ODI squad for the tour of Sri Lanka. However, Holder hopes for a swift resolution that would allow Simmons to return to the squad in Sri Lanka. Though Simmons has apologized for his controversial remarks, he was asked to answer for breaches of confidentiality by the WICB and is currently awaiting an HR hearing.
The untimely suspension of Simmons has posed a significant problem for West Indies, coming as it did only days before the squad was scheduled to assemble in Sri Lanka. Simmons was appointed West Indies coach in March and the Sri Lanka tour would have been his first international foray with the outfit. Interestingly, the two-Test series against Sri Lanka will be Holder's first assignment as captain. Undoubtedly, Simmons suspension is a setback for the West Indies.
Skipper Holder would make every effort to create history on debut to add salt to Sri Lanka's wounds after hat-trick of Test series defeats at the hands of New Zealand, Pakistan and India. But the West Indies have never won a Test series in Sri Lanka.

Heavy hitters back Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
PHILIPPINES: Backed by powerful but graft-tainted politicians, the son of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos vowed to fight corruption Saturday as he launched his election bid for the vice presidency.
About 2,000 red-clad supporters cheered and chanted his name as Ferdinand Marcos Jr, took to the stage in the mid-afternoon Manila heat on his first campaign rally ahead of the May 2016 vote.
"There are corrupt Filipinos... within and outside the government who are killing our economy and keeping us poor," Senator Marcos, 58, said.
"With your help, I will lead a revolution of the heart, of ideas and of action toward real and meaningful change."
The younger Marcos announced his plan to contest the Asian nation's second-highest post on Tuesday, nearly three decades after a bloodless popular revolt chased his family into US exile. Marcos Snr was accused of large-scale corruption and massive human rights abuses during his 20 years in power, but his son, popularly known as "Bongbong", has said voters would not be swayed by these allegations.
Poverty, joblessness, a high crime rate and abysmal public transport and other basic infrastructure are what preoccupy the electorate now, he said Saturday.
People from the family's northern powerbase, members of the urban poor, some of whom benefited from state help during the Marcos years, as well as first-time voters, showed up for the Manila rally.
James Penuliar, a 19-year-old who will be voting for the first time next year, said he has heard of the corruption allegations against the elder Marcos but was unfamiliar with the allegations of human rights abuses against the ex-president. "They're mere hearsay, you should not believe everything you hear," the university student told AFP as he sat on the grass with friends.
Luvizminda Alvarez, a jobless 56-year-old widow from Manila's Parola seaside slum, defended Senator Marcos. "He is a helpful person, while his father was a great president," she told AFP.
Though running as an independent, Marcos Jr made an early statement of his intent by getting some of the opposition's most influential power brokers to his camp.
Former president Joseph Estrada, Senate minority leader Juan Ponce Enrile and the dictator's flamboyant widow Imelda Marcos all showed up for the hour-long political rally in a leafy garden in Manila's old walled city, known as Intramuros.
Estrada was convicted of large-scale corruption and sent to prison six years after a bloodless military revolt unseated him in 2001, halfway into his presidency.
But he was pardoned by President Benigno Aquino's predecessor Gloria Arroyo just 44 days later and in 2013 was elected mayor of Manila.
"Many other candidates have sought my endorsement, but when Senator Bongbong called I did not hesitate," Estrada told the crowd Saturday, citing the 37,000 units of housing built for the urban poor ordered by Imelda Marcos in Manila in the 1970s.
"Manila residents owe them a debt of gratitude. They will make sure you (Marcos Jr) will be number one," Estrada added.
Enrile, the elder Marcos's long-time defence minister, led the 1986 revolt, but the two families have since reconciled. Enrile is out on bail pending trial for allegedly plundering the equivalent of about $3.7 million in state funds. Marcos' heirs returned to the Philippines in the 1990s and rebuilt their political base. Imelda Marcos now represents the northern province of Ilocos Norte in the House of Representatives, while her eldest daughter Imee Marcos is the provincial governor. - AFP

Helpage Sri Lanka shows Elders' strength
Helpage Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Polonnaruwa District Secretariat and the Elahara Divisional Secretariat in Bakamuna, celebrated 'International Elders Day' on a grand scale.
The main feature of the day's programme was the 'Elders walk.' Around 500 Elders participated in the 'walk' which commenced from the Bakamuna Divisional Secretariat premises. The elders who were between the age of 60 - 84, had arrived from surrounding villages of Elahara and Bakamuna. They displayed their strength and raised an awareness among the slumbering general public, who took note of their presence in retirement after contributing their share for a better morrow for the 'new generation.' The walk was a sure means of sending their message to the larger society, highlighting the multi-faceted issues faced by the elders and encouraging the younger generation to take care of the elders in their homes, instead of dumping them in elders' homes. They displayed eye catching banners and posters with messages to capture the hearts and minds of those that mattered.
Sunimal Perera, a 71- year- old retired principal, said that it was the first time the elders in Bakamuna and Elahara villages participated in a 'Walk.' The elders were treated with refreshments and lunch by HelpAge Sri Lanka and the Pradeshiya Saba, when they reached the Bakamuna Mahaweli grounds at the end of the walk.
The elders who were felicitated at a ceremony at the Bakamuna Mahaweli Stadium, entertained the crowd with song, dance and drama. HASL, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said the 'Walk' had reflected the strength of the elderly population.
He said people in the Polonnaruwa District were happy to see elders showing interest by participating in the 'Elders Walk' to raise awareness among the public towards caring and respecting the elders. Liyanawaduge said that 98 per cent of elders in the country lived with their families and also highlighted the increasing 'abuses to elders' which could not be tolerated.
Helpage Mobile Unit was present with free spectacles and medications.
Polonnaruwa District Secretary S. Senaratna, former Bakamuna Pradeshiya Saba Chairman Amarawansa Mohottige and NCP Chief Secretary W.T.J. Manel were present on the occasion.

Housemaid in Kuwait assaulted by Lankan women
A Sri Lankan housemaid in Kuwait who was brutally assaulted by a group of Sri Lankan women working at a job recruitment branch will be brought back to the country within the next three days, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) media spokesman Upul Deshapriya told the Daily News.
SLBFE officials who investigated the incident following a video which went viral on social media websites, said the woman had been assaulted at the Kuwait branch of a job agency located at Kurunegala.
Investigations also revealed that the victim is a resident of Polpithigama.
This is the third time she had gone to Kuwait as a house maid.
It is also reported that the woman had been admitted to hospital after falling ill while she was working at a house.
The victim is a sick woman who received treatment at the same hospital during her previous two visits. Job agency officials who were aware about her illness had sent her to Kuwait not revealing her ailment.
The SLBFE cancelled the license of the job agency and also launched a special investigation into the incident, Deshapriya said.
The woman is now in the custody of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Kuwait.

How to choose RIGHT LIP COLOUR
Picking the right lip colour that complements your skin tone, especially during festivities, is no ordinary task.
Matte purple - matte mauve
Women with olive skin tone should avoid purple/mauve tones as this will accentuate the yellow in your skin tone a bit too much. Fair tones for a bold lip look and warmer tones can experiment with purples.
Deep mauve - semi matte (Gothic)
Deep burgundy and deep mauve shades for those who play their game strong with make-up. It was very popularly called on the runway as the black magic look. These shades of lipsticks also play well with characters and festivities; they portray a strong personality.
Pink mauve in frost
Fleshy pink lips give a softer and prettier feel to the look, so ditch the bold colours for the day and wear pretty pinks. Frosty texture adds some shine to the face compared to matte or cream. At the same time you also have to ensure to keep your skin and eyes matte while wearing a frosty lipstick.
Fine wine
Ombre or fine wine lips go well on nude skin with maybe a soft blush. This colour has been in trend for long and continues to stay this festive season as well. Endorse this colour, you need not necessarily match it with your outfit, it is just to lift the radiance of your face. This tone of lip colour can be worn by women with fair to medium skin tone with not too much of yellow in their skin colour. It plays a good contrast against slightly fairer tones.
Blood red - true red
Red lips always come in a range of colours but the classic blood red or true red is the one to go this time. These extremely bright cherry tones on lips suddenly lift up the look. A good way is to match them with the same nail colour tone. If you are fair or pale, try this cherry or blood red tone lipstick for a major impact.

Hush! Its Kumbi Talk
Chitrasena School of Dance is ready to present a ballet called Kumbi Kathawa, that may appear to be simple and childlike, but is tremendously meaningful in the sense that it not only captures the state of the world we live in and its politics but it also brings out values and ethics taught through religion and philosophy through personification. The Daily News recently visited Chitrasena School of Dance to rediscover the simple lessons in life such as the power of unity and family and the virtue of courage, compassion and perseverance.
Kumbi Kathawa tells the story of an ant colony that faces immense hardship as they are chased away by an evil force (a mosquito.) The main ant family perseveres and rebuilds their home and it becomes a place of joy, where many different insects gather to celebrate. When all the insects are threatened by a flood, the ants stand strong and rescue all those who are struggling, including their former enemy the mosquito.
The ballet is choreographed by Anjalika Melvani and directed by Heshma Wignaraja and the ballet is based on the Russian Childrens story The Brave Ant by Tatiana Makarova When this dance drama premiered in 2007 and restaged in 2009, audiences were captivated by the simple yet powerful story that was conveyed through incredible dance and choreography, costumes, music and lighting. The ballet had been honed to perfection over a period of five years.
Most of what Seeya and Achchi (Chitrasena and Vajira) have done have had longevity and have been produced many times. Karadiya has been performed 200 times with many different generations. We have a repository of Adult Ballets and Childrens ballets. We can pick these productions whenever we want and reproduce it with the current students we have. Hopefully if they are with us as seniors, they would probably get the chance to participate in adult ballets.
Heshma
We put in so much effort and every ballet is groundbreaking every time it was produced. Every time we have done a production we have tried to do something unique in a way not done before. And it has worked so far, said Heshma
Heshma feels that unlike the past, things are more challenging these days as these days children are much busier than adults. It is very taxing for a private organization to ask them to come her and work the way we do. But we never give up because what we offer is three generations of teachers, who work at the same time. They are my grandmother Vajira, my aunt, my mom, Thaji and me. I dont think there is another dance school in this country with three generations of teaching under one roof. It is beyond just generations of teaching. We find our dance language to be very unique and we are proud of it. Training young ones to become ambassadors of this language is a great joy to us.
There was a time when they were like gypsies going from one place to another without a permanent place. But then former President Chandrika Kumaratunga gave them the land where they are now and they have been there for nine years. They moved in January 2007. We have many Ballets in our repository and when we have talented students and depending on the body of students we will decide what we want to reproduce.
This is amongst working on new things in between. Kumbi is a very special ballet because it was the first one we did after coming to these premises after it was built. At that time my mother had been working on this Ballet for five years. I was abroad for most of the time. Every time I came I saw her working with these kids. The cast changed like twice over because kids were outgrowing their parts. As soon as we moved here, we decided that we had to put this together and make it happen. So it holds a very special place in our hearts.
The restaging of Kumbi Kathawa in October provides an opportunity for those who missed it the previous times and those who want to see it again, a chance to enjoy this wonderful production.
Tickets are priced at Rs. 2500, Rs. 2000, Rs. 1500, Rs. 1000, Rs. 750 and Rs. 500 (balcony). Tickets can be purchased from the Chitrasena Kalayathanaya, 590 Elvitigala Mawatha Colombo 5 and through ticketslk.com from September 28.
Kumbi Kathawa will go on boards from October 21  24 at the Bishops College Auditorium from 7.15pm  8.15pm.

Jayalalithaa urges Modi to take up fishermen arrests issue
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa yesterday urged Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the arrest of the states fishermen at a high political level with Sri Lanka and sought immediate release of 54 fishermen and their 34 boats, including 19 who were apprehended yesterday.
Nineteen fishermen along with their two boats from Tamil Nadu from Nagapattinam were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy yesterday, she said, adding this was the fifth instance of such recent arrests of Tamil Nadu fishermen in a span of a few weeks.
She noted that currently the number of fishermen in Sri Lankan custody is 54, besides 34 boats.
It is time the issue is taken up not only through the normal diplomatic channels, but at an appropriately high political level and the release of the fishermen and the boats secured without further delay. May I request an urgent response in the matter she asked.
Despite her repeated requests to take up the matter with Sri Lanka and ensure the early release of the fishermen and their boats, there has been little response and the fishermen have suffered prolonged detention.
Reiterating that the States fishermen were being denied their right to fishing in their traditional waters of Palk Bay, she said the denial of right and prolonged incarceration caused misery and frustration among the fishermen.
We are still awaiting the much anticipated strong and sustained diplomatic initiative to resolve the vexatious issue, she said.

Pet Sounds: the animal noises sampled in song
To music lovers with love!
The last week has seen the release of two albums sampling cats  most notably Meow the Jewels and internet star Lil Bubs musically gifted debut. But which other artists have embraced their wild side
Lil Bub, one of the best loved internet cats, will release her debut album Science & Magic on 4 December. According to Andrew WK, who helped create the record with Bub, not only is she the softest creature he has ever encountered, but also the most musically and compassionately gifted.
The songs on this album are her vision.
They are by her, about her, and are her. Whether you consider it a callous effort to capitalise on one mutant cats craze for, or a pioneering step into the outer limits of musical experimentation, the cat album is currently having its moment: take rap duo Run the Jewels, who have released Meow the Jewels, a cat-sound remix of their last album. Or  actually thats it.
Just two albums. But two albums sampling cats in one week is two more than the previous 2015 years have offered up, so worth marking none the less (for the purpose of journalistic integrity, lets include Mr Mitch and his meow-based track Catford. Which came out in 2013. Threes a trend).
Campaign
While the Lil Bub album smacks slightly of a traffic chasing marketing campaign, and Meow the Jewels is a gesture of goodwill (donations to its Kickstarter go to victims of police brutality and neglected animals), previously samples of animals in song have been used for their atmospheric, musical value. The sound of an animal can be symbolic, more evocative or expressive than that of a humans voice. Take the distant murmurs on Kate Bushs Moving  15 seconds of whale song sampled from Songs of the Humpback Whale. In an interview with Sounds, Bush said: Whales say everything about moving. Its huge and beautiful, intelligent, soft inside a tough body.
It can also be a handy scene-setting device: the nostalgic sound of seagulls squarking through Gruff Rhys Shark Ridden Waters, Minnie Ripertons Lovin You  its tweeting birds replicating a bucolic idyll and the first flutters of fancy, or the clip clop and whinny of reindeer on Sleigh Ride by the Ronnettes. No mention of animal sampling symbolism would be complete without the salacious honk of an elephant on Missy Elliotts Work It. Its not always used as a pleasant reminder of mother natures creations. Matthew Herberts One Pig  an album that documents a pigs 20-week life, from birth to brutal slaughter  used the samples for a stark look at the meat industry. Its a terrifying tool for musics more malevolent, too  the sound of a predator snarling at the start and end of Butthole Surfers Mark Says Alright or HateBeaks Feral Parrot.
Textural qualities
The world of EDM offers some savage sampling, too  such as Deadmau5s use of rattlesnakes, or Raff Riley borrowing the sounds of febrile barking dogs.
The sampling of animals can even have its textural qualities, adding layers that an instrument may not  the cooing pigeons on Panda Bears Bros, or the quiet chatter of birds flitting throughout Radioheads The King of Limbs  during the introduction to Give Up the Ghost, the fade out of Codex, and layered under the flugelhorn (yes, flugelhorn) on Bloom.

Olcott vision shows us path to rebuild world through common compassion, common
The Olcott vision shows us the path to rebuild the world through common compassion, common will and common living, former Minister Imthiaz Bakeer Markar said.
He made these comments delivering the annual Olcott Oration named under the late Henry Steel Olcott, who was a pioneer in initiating several leading Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka, in Dubai under the theme A Prosperous and Cognizant life in a Multicultural Society.
Many Sri Lankans living in Dubai participated. It was organised by the Alumni of Olcott schools in the United Arab Emirates.
Markar said Olcott clearly indicated that it is due to ignorance that attempts are made to divide us.
This is very clear from his request to learn all religions in an impartial manner. A person who does not respect another religion is not a true Buddhist states a stone inscription made by King Dharmasoke. All this highlights the fact that we have reached a moment where the Olcott vision should be deeply embedded in society, Markar said. Asia has been either the birthplace or the centre of major religions of the world. Main religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam which nurture our society had their origins in the Middle East and India. Our origins are also connected to these countries, he said.
There are many similarities in the guidance offered to us by all these religions. I recall a stanza in the Dhammapada - Nathang Kammang Kathan Sadhu, Yamg Kathwa Anuthappati, Yassa Assu Mucko Rodang, Vipakan Pati Sevathi. If some action makes you happy in retrospect, it is advisable to repeat such actions. If some action makes you repentant in retrospect it is advisable not to repeat such actions, Markar said.
Common path
Similarly, I am reminded of a paragraph of the Holy Quran displayed at the entrance of the famous Harvard University. Be fair and just. Rise up for justice even if it goes against your parents, relatives or friends. God will protect you. We ought to follow a common path based on these values which enrich our society. We should consider our diversity as a resource. We should not consider it as a burden. Historically, no society in the world has progressed by following super communal beliefs. Both the First World War and the Second World War symbolise this truth to us. It is proved by what we witness in the Middle East today, he said.
We see accusing fingers being leveled at political leaders, religious dignitaries and corporate leaders for these situations. We hear that various conspiracies and hidden agendas are responsible for these things. But all parties in a society have to bear responsibility regarding this. Keeping alert and deep inquiry about what is said and done is very important, Markar added.
Markar said: Col. Olcott who lived in the USA traversed thousands of miles and arrived in Sri Lanka because he heard the echo of the performance of a similar duty. The five great debates held to counter the efforts made by colonialism to spiritually defeat Sri Lanka which was a colony spurred Col. Olcott to arrive in Sri Lanka.
The echo of the 1865 Baddegama debate, 1866 Udammita debate, 1971 Gampola debate and the stiff and decisive 1873 Panadura debate which resonated were the historical story which prompted Col. Olcotts advent to Sri Lanka. Reports published in all newspapers including the Times of Ceylon about the Panadura debate paved the way for it. Mr. John Cooper who was the then Chief Editor of the Times of Ceylon got the entire debate in Sinhala translated into English by lawyer Edward Perera of Kotte and splashed it in the newspaper. A copy of this report fell into the hands of an American scholar named J.M. Feeble living in Galle at that time.
He took it along with him to England and took steps to reprint thousands of copies and distribute it. One of the copies fell into the hands of Col. Olcott in 1878 almost five years after the debate laying the foundation for the educational revival which accompanied the Buddhist revival in Sri Lanka.
Col. Olcotts objective through the main project he launched by contributing towards the Buddhist revival movement in Sri Lanka was to provide meaningful education to children of under developed regions in the country. It is very important to identify the Olcott vision regarding the objectives of education. I wish to emphasise that it would be a source of guidance towards the national unity and co-existence which has presently engaged our attention. I consider it pertinent to briefly mention the objectives of the Buddhist Theosophical society launched in USA on November 17, 1875.
Three main objectives were evident in this society he launched as a movement dedicated to search the truth devoid of differences as to colour, community, caste or religion. The first objective was bind the entire humanity together in brotherhood devoid of differences as to colour, community caste or creed. The second was to encourage the perpetuation of all religious and ideologies in an impartial manner.
The third was to explore data about nature and mans internal powers. Finding solutions to the main problems we have currently encountered will not be difficult if we properly identify these objectives. Many crises which have presently erupted the world wide have communal and religious origins and tendencies. We can see one nation trying to subjugate another nation or one religious belief trying to subvert another religious belief. How logical is the path shown by late Steele Olcott to a world of this nature. I trust that we as children of Olcott schools to highlight this vision once again.
True terrorism is Communalism states philosopher Von Tepler. V.I. Lenin has described Communalists as criminals killing human society. When one nation is subjugated to another nation, giving leadership to the subjugated nation is called nation liberation struggle. If has lost his homeland the fight to regain it is called patriotism. A struggle does not end through rumour mongering. A national struggle will end only after obtaining natural liberation. A person who does not see the freedom of another nation or community does not see ones own communal freedom. It is only for a short period that a community or nation can be suppressed by arms. This is a truth we evidence throughout the world.
It was the motto of Brahmadatta kings of Benares India which said There is no religion superior than the truth which Olcott accepted as the motto of his Buddhist Theosophical Society. The emergence of untruth over truth is the biggest challenge we face today. There are less opportunities within society for the truthful man. We should try to find our main reason for this. All this is became we talk about the result rather than the cause for the result. Our system of education is very important in this regard. The most outstanding among the services rendered by Col. Olcott often arriving in Sri Lanka are the steps taken by him to improve and upgrade education. We describe it as an attempt to uplift people suffering under colonial rule and a challenge against the attempt made by colonial rulers to first their vision and will over the people by force through education.
Memorial lecture
On this occasion I am reminded of a statement made by Islamic scholar Prof. Tarik Ramadan who arrived in Sri Lanka to deliver a memorial lecture in honour of my late father. He said, I quote :- Our own religion or way of life, is a partial reflection of the truth. The true meaning, can come only, when appreciating the truth. You belong to the truth but truth does not belong to you. The meaning can emerge only by experiencing prularity. To be fully human, you should share the truth of others and other religions. Meet the human being, accepting the truth, in their religion, tradition and philosophies.
All sorts of religious exploration lead to the same destination. Nations of equality freedom and humanity belong to all religious traditions and philosophies. The speech made by Henry Steele Olcott at Bombay on March 23, 1879 can be shown as a moment which clearly explained his vision about education. He said It is regrettable to see Bombays youth acting with the only objective of gaining a University degree. There are any amount of doctors and barristers in this country. But the country does not possess an adequate number of technicians. There are any amounts of graduates. But a skilled carpenter, miller, sugar maker or a paper manufacturer cannot be found anywhere. What India needs today are technological centers afflicted to study centers as in America.
This statement meant that vocational units are needed within the education system. When one investigated the depth of national crises which have emerged in most countries one factor which becomes evident is the economic inequalities existing in those countries. The main aspiration of the youth generation is to seek a good job. The frustration caused by the obstruction of avenues to obtain the ability to seek a job and the proliferation of that frustration to rebellion against the administration of a country can be seen ending up as violent terrorism.
Communalism and religionism are the best agents fuelling such acts of violence. The best way to damage national unity and reconciliation and sovereignty of a country is to arm society with narrow visions of distrust, suspicion and alienation.
When we explain Olcotts vision for education we can see an education system with a wide vision opposing it. It can be seen as an education system offering vocational guidance which developed knowledge and skills. We in Sri Lanka have suffered from two decades of war. We suffered from two youth rebellions which occurred since independence. There can be various opinions and descriptions about it. Sri Lankas failure to look at problems with an open mind by wearing various masks and hanging on to frigid viewpoints may have been one cause which aggravated problems. I believe that it is one reason Olcotts vision and policy should be subjected to dialogue once again as school children and within Olcott schools.
It is not a difficult task because his belief and vision is based in a Buddhist foundation. What is our main challenge today It is creating unity harmony and reconciliation in a multi national, multi religious, multi communal and multi linguist society.
Creating unity amidst diversity is the biggest challenge before the country. We can receive guidance from Buddhism which is one of the major religions in the world as well as Islam, Hindu and Catholic religions.
As Henry Olcott said we show offer guidance to our country to study the essence of all these religions. Guidance should be offered to liberate peoples minds from extremist feelings.
Guidance could be received for it by acting according to the Sathara Brahma Viharanaya (Metta, Karuna, Muditha and Upekkha) found in Buddhism the majority religion. It means overcoming hatred, eliminating, sorrow and promoting compassion and equanimity. If anyone is induced to treat every one in an impartial manner it amounts to equanimity. This is a quality strongly used in Olcotts vision throughout his service. This is symbolized by the four bo leaves found in the four corners of our national flag.
In a country where people nurtured by such thoughts are living there is room for any opinion or a viewpoint. Such a society does not discriminate against each other on grounds of community, religion caste or any other petty differences.
Although a multicultural social environment is seen in such a country it is not a harmful society. It will create a society rich in world accepted human values providing opportunities for a decent living protecting democratic principles. True democracy can be ushered only by realizing factors such as guaranteeing human rights, religious freedom and harmony among various religions groups, living in peace and harmony among minorities, ushering opportunities for all to gain quality education and sound employment and ensuring human dignity. We can obtain meaningful guidance for a decent living we expect in a multi-cultural society from the Olcott vision. The activities of an individual should be valued and appreciated on the basis of his vision. Philosophers and epochal men act with a special vision endemic to them.
Although Olcott was a foreign national he became sensitive towards people in Sri Lanka by transgressing narrow limitations. A person will act with such an idea when his or her vision is clear and conscience is strong. Understanding the vision which strengthened Olcotts conscience and self confidence and vitality will undoubtedly help stabilize the existence of a multi faceted society at present.
Aristotle once said it is more opportune for a country to be governed by good men rather than good haws and regulations. I wish to bring it to your notice at this moment. In order to cleanse and correct our society we should first identify our own shortcomings and overcome and correct them. We should learn to offer pardon and beg pardon. It is very essential to be flexible and act with an open and unbiased mind.
It is very important to get induced to change what ought to be changed and stabilize what has been changed.
We should also take care to protect the sown cultivation without allowing get overgrown with weeds. It will stabilize the sustenance of a multi cultural society. We can identify the way to become true and equal Sri Lankans through a multi cultural policy based on social equality.
We can describe Col. Henry Steele Olcott as an exemplary character to develop an environment where everyone whether they be Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or any other community to feel that this is their country of residence where they have a sense of belonging.

Pakistan pose new spin threat for England
England face the daunting prospect of overcoming Pakistan's new-look spinning line-up as the Ashes winners try to reverse their 3-0 Test whitewash last time around on the dry pitches of the United Arab Emirates.
When they met in the United Arab Emirates in 2012, Pakistan annihilated the then world number one Test team 3-0, thanks to spinners Saeed Ajmal (24 wickets) and Abdul Rehman (19 wickets).
As they begin a three-match Test series in Abu Dhabi from Tuesday, Pakistan will rely on the same weapon but in the hands of leg-spinners Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar who have taken over from Ajmal and Rehman, who were not selected for the series.
England captain Alastair Cook admits the enormity of his team's task.
"I think they have played six or seven series and haven't lost a series. That shows what is in front of us. The great thing in Test cricket is trying to win away from home. It's getting harder and harder," said Cook, one of four survivors of the 2012 Tests.
Ajmal, whose controversial bowling action was questioned back in 2012, was suspended last year but after being cleared with a new style seems to have lost his wicket-taking ability, leaving his career in the balance.
"I don't think (Ajmal's absence) weakens or strengthens them anyway. It's always when you play Pakistan, India or Sri Lanka spin plays a role," Cook said.
Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq is confident Shah will fill the void, having led the country to series wins over Australia in Abu Dhabi last year and in Sri Lanka three months ago.
"The way Yasir is bowling he is a threat to any team," said Misbah, who could retire at the end of the series. "But it's not only about our spinners. It's also about our fast bowlers and the way we bat against their spinners."
Cook admitted Shah poses a variety of challenges. "He has an outstanding start to his Test career," said Cook. "Sixty wickets in ten games is a great effort and obviously Saeed was a great bowler as well."
Pakistan's batting will revolve around Younis Khan, Misbah, Azhar Ali and Sarfraz Ahmed who have been in great form in the last 12 months. Younis amassed 468 runs against Australia and hit a match-winning 171 not out in Pakistan's last Test in Sri Lanka, leaving him just 19 behind to overtake Pakistan's highest tally of 8832 set by the great Javed Miandad.
Pakistan have never lost a series in seven attempts (winning four and drawing three) in the UAE where they have been forced to play due to security fears back home.
England's answer to Pakistan's spin will be feeble as leggie Adil Rashid is set to make his Test debut, six years after playing his first one-day international.
Moeen Ali is favourite to play as opener in a makeshift arrangement with additional duties of bowling off-spin, having never opened the innings even in a first-class match.
If that happens, Moeen will be Cook's seventh partner since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012.
Joe Root and Ben Stokes -- England's leading performers with the bat -- will be tested against the quality spin. AFP

HOW DO THE PLANTS COMMUNICATE
Plants use a newly discovered language to speak to each other.
A parasitic plant called dodder which uses a root-like appendage called a haustorium to penetrate host plant.
When this happens RNA passes between the two species and sends messages within cells telling them which actions to take, such as which proteins to code.
Through this exchange, the parasitic plants may be dictating what the host plant should do, such as lowering its defences so that the parasitic plant can more easily attack it.
Plants use a newly discovered language to speak to each other, research has revealed.
The finding opens the door to a new area of science that explores how plants communicate with each other on a molecular level.
It could also give scientists new insights into how to fight parasitic weeds that devastate food crops in some of the poorest parts of the world.
Professor Westwood, an expert in plant pathology, physiology and weed science at Virginia Tech, said: The discovery of this novel form of inter-organism communication shows that this is happening a lot more than any one has previously realised.
Plants use a newly discovered language to speak to each other, research has revealed. They studied the molecular communication between a parasitic plant called dodder, and two host plants, Arabidopsis (pictured left) and tomatoes (pictured right)
Now that we have found that they are sharing all this information, the next question is, What exactly are they telling each other
Professor Westwood examined the relationship between a parasitic plant called dodder, and two host plants, Arabidopsis and tomatoes.
In order to suck the moisture and nutrients out of the host plants, dodder uses a root-like appendage called a haustorium to penetrate the plant.
Professor Westwood has previously discovered that during this parasitic interaction, there is a transport of RNA between the two species.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a family of large biological molecules that code and decode information passed down from its DNA.
His new work expands the scope of this exchange and examines the mRNA, or messenger RNA, which sends messages within cells telling them which actions to take, such as which proteins to code.
It was thought that mRNA was very fragile and short-lived, so transferring it between species was impossible.
But Professor Westwood found that during this parasitic relationship, thousands upon thousands of mRNA molecules were being exchanged between both plants, creating an open dialogue between the species that allows them to freely communicate.
Through this exchange, the parasitic plants may be instructing the host plant to lower its defences so that they can more easily attack it.
Professor Westwoods hopes to discover precisely what the mRNA are saying.
His findings, published in the journal, Science, will be able to examine if other organisms such as bacteria and fungi also exchange information in a similar fashion. They could also help solve issues of food scarcity.
Commenting on the research, in which she was not involved, Julie Scholes, a professor at Sheffield University, said: Parasitic plants such as witchweed and broomrape are serious problems for legumes and other crops that help feed some of the poorest regions in Africa and elsewhere.
In addition to shedding new light on genetic interactions, Professor Westwoods findings have exciting implications for the design of novel control strategies. For example, armed with this new knowledge, scientists could engineer plants that could combat against the mRNA information that the parasite uses to disrupt its host.
Professor Westwood added: The beauty of this discovery is that this mRNA could be the Achilles heel for parasites.
This is all really exciting because there are so many potential implications surrounding this new information.

Professionals strike ends. Karapitiya Cardiothoracic unit back to normal
Prolonged trade union action launched by a group of consultants of Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital ended yesterday following Health Ministry mediation, Director General of the ministry Dr. Palitha Mahipala told media.
This was following the settlement of the professional dispute among the consultant surgeons of Cardiothoracic Unit subsequent to a review mediation of Health Ministry officials led by Director General of the ministry.
The Director General was addressing the media at a press briefing held at the hospital directors office yesterday.
Since September 30, a group of consultants launched a strike in protest of an alleged misuse of surgical operation theaters and supplementary facilities by a cardiothoracic consultant attached to the unit denying the other consultant surgeons of equal opportunities in utilizing them.
However, as the dispute among the medical professionals continued causing immense hardship for the public, Health Ministry Director General Dr. Palitha Maheepala yesterday paid an official visit at which he had discussions with all parties concerned to reach an agreeable solution.
I together with a group of officials of the ministry discussed with the respective consultant cardiologists of the hospital who were in a dispute over equal opportunities of the use of operating theatres, Surgical Intensive Care Units, wards and other related medical and surgical facilities of the Cardiothoracic unit. We could arrive at an agreeable decision justifiable to all. Hence the strike action was ended with effect from today and functions of all sections of the unit recommenced as usual, Dr. Palitha Maheepala said.
As disclosed by the Health Director General, Consultant Surgeon Namal Gamage will be allowed to utilize 50 percent of the theatre and other surgery facilities at the Cardiothoracic Unit of KTH while the remaining 50 percent of theatre amenities will be equally shared between other two Cardiologists Trolusha Harischandra and Dhammika Rassnayake respectively.
Accordingly the existing operation theatres of the unit, on two days and all morning sessions of the week will be assigned to Consultant Namal Gamage to carry out his cardiothoracic surgeries while on all other days the theaters and related facilities will be allocated for the other two consultants.
Karapitiya Hospital is much popular among people for cardiac and thoracic operations.We have observed that there is an urgent need of expansion in cardiothoracic unit. The ministry has planned to establish a new cardiothoracic unit with modern facilities and equipment at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Dr. Palitha Maheepala said.
The ministry is constantly making maximum effort and contribution for the uplift of the health and medical services of the country. In 2015 the National Budget allocated Rs. 192 billion for the health ministry. It is only 1.8 percent of the GDP. It is envisaged that during the 2016 budget the health allocation will be increased up to 3 percent. So next year we will have a colossal monetary allocation for our development projects, Dr. Maheepala said.

Rangana Herath likely to retire after the 2016 World T20
Rangana Herath, the current Sri Lankan left-arm spinner is likely to call time on his career after the 2016 World T20 in India. Herath, who is nearing 38 years of age, admitted that his retirement call would be sooner than later.
Heraths knee injury is said to be a key factor behind his decision to retire from international cricket. Herath recently spun Sri Lanka to a famous victory in Galle against India while defending a low total in the fourth innings.
He said that his ongoing knee injury was hampering his bowling.
I did an operation on both knees in 2011 for damaged cartilage, Herath said.
I had a clean-up and I had no problem playing after that. But of late I have been getting pains. It is four years since the operation and the effect of it must have worn off over the years due to the wear and tear while playing.

Rugby referees should keep themselves fit, says Priyantha
Rugby Referees should keep themselves fit as they will have to do a lot of running at times more than the players as they will have to have an eye on the ball as well as the players if they are to do a good job of work, said the newly elected President of the Central Province Rugby Referees Union (CPRRU) Priyantha Gunaratne.
Priyantha Gunaratne
Rugby referees have a tough task to perform as rugby has a huge spectator following and most of them are versed in the laws of the game which are complex. But this does not mean that you should play to the gallery. You are the sole judge and you must take the decisions in accordance to the rules. Do not take notice of the spectator remarks as you cannot please all people. What is so important is to play to the rules and do not yield to pressures. Their may be complaints but do not take any notice. Above all you must be satisfied that you had done a good job. You cannot please all people.
Rugby referees should attend seminars and refresher courses regularly and keep oneself versed in the latest changes of the laws. Unlike in the good old days, at present most of the examinations are conducted in Sri Lanka by the Rugby Coach Education Department of the Sri Lanka Rugby Union. In the past this was done either in England or Australia and now we can do it locally and is recognised by the International Rugby Board (IRB). Last year we did a level 3 course in Kandy.
Both the schools and club rugby season may commence in a few months time and we must get ready from now onwards.
Priyantha Gunaratne who took over the post of President from Aruna Rankothge is a top rugby referees with experience in refereeing matches both in Sri Lanka and abroad. He has also refereed the prestigious Bradby Shield encounter and at all levels of club matches except the Clifford Cup finals in which his home town club Kandy Sports Club is always figured.
Gerald Rasiah was elected General Secretary.
The following were elected officials for the ensuing year.

S. Africa to discuss Truth and Reconciliation Commission experience with Lanka
While there are deliberations taking place between the governments of Sri Lanka and South Africa to share the latter's experience in working for national reconciliation in the country, the Foreign Affairs Ministry is on the path to deepening their understanding of the range of the South African-style Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Foreign Affairs Ministry sources said yesterday .
Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said they have had many deliberations, consultations and programmes with the South African government for sharing their experience in working out an effective truth and reconciliation mechanism in Sri Lanka.
Asked if a Sri Lankan delegation is set to leave for South Africa to further study the latter's Truth and Reconciliation process, Colonne said, " Since the end of the Geneva sessions, there has not been any such delegation approved by the ministry for the purpose of conducting deliberations with regard to the subject."
Colonne said, "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet approved any delegation to leave for South Africa."
"If there was such decision, it had to be taken by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera," she said.
"There was no decision taken yet with regard to a visit to South Africa. The dates have not been finalized yet," she said.
"However," she said, " there will be deliberations with the government of South Africa for sharing their experience in the aspect of reconciliation in the future as it stands to offer invaluable guidance."
Meanwhile, measures are being planned to restructure the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
Colonne said, "the plans are being discussed, but nothing has been finalized."

Secret Service agent who saved Reagan dies
US: The true hero Secret Service agent who helped save the life of US President Ronald Reagan during a 1981 assassination attempt has died aged 85.
Jerry Parr sprang into action to shove the President into a waiting limousine in the frantic moments after gunshots were fired outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981.
As they sped away, Special Agent Parr discovered Reagan had been injured and redirected the bullet-proof car to a nearby hospital.
Recounting the incident later, Parr said he thought he had injured one of Reagans ribs when he fell on top of the president in the race to get him into the limousine, only learning at the hospital that the president had been shot.
First lady Nancy Reagan credited those quick decisions with saving the presidents life.
Reacting to Parrs death late Friday, Nancy Reagan said he was one of my true heroes.
Without Jerry looking out for Ronnie on March 30, 1981, I would have certainly lost my best friend and roommate to an assassins bullet, she said in a statement widely cited in US media on Saturday.
Jerry was not only one of the finest Secret Service agents to ever serve this country, but one of the most decent human beings Ive ever known. He was humble but strong, reserved but confident, and blessed with a great sense of humour. It is no wonder that he and my husband got along so well.
Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy called Parr a remarkable leader and true friend.
Those of us who were blessed to know Jerry Parr will forever be able to lean on the lessons of integrity, character and compassion that Jerry displayed at all times, he said in a statement. He was a gentleman to everyone he met and yet had the courage to act decisively when president Reagan and this country needed him most.
Parrs quick thinking on that dramatic day in 1981 not only saved the life of president Reagan, but Jerrys actions preserved the institution of the office of the presidency, Clancy added.
Parr died of congestive heart failure at a hospice near Washington where he lived, according to The Washington Post. Parr became a minister after he retired from the Secret Service in 1985, the newspaper said.

Seed Magic
On this warm, beautiful day, theres a tiny plant waiting to pierce the soil and raise its head
Remember how Jack exchanged his cow for some magic seeds His mum was furious with him and threw the seeds out of the window. But hey presto, the next morning there was a giant beanstalk in their garden. Not just any beanstalk too, but one that reached the sky.
Jack was luckier than most of us. His seeds sprouted overnight. He was certainly, more lucky than poor Winnie-the-Pooh, who planted a pumpkin seed and stayed near it throughout the spring, eating honey to kill time. By the time the pumpkin grew, Poohs tummy too, had grown almost as big as the pumpkin.
I know, these are make-believe stories. But the funny thing is, you will find there is a magical, enchanting aura surrounding seeds, in real life too. After all, they lie dormant, under a shroud of soil, for ages and ages, then, suddenly burst forth with enchanting vigour to end up as a stunning collection of eye-catching flowers, the kind that attracts fairies, or a mouth-watering bunch of mangoes, the kind that attracts cheeky squirrels. To state the obvious, seeds let you start at the beginning. It is a satisfying, personal involvement that starts with your decision of which seeds to grow.
Choosing the best seeds
Experts say there are several factors that need to be taken into account when it comes to choosing the best seeds for your garden. If you are planning to grow vegetables you need to first decide what vegetables and then what varieties. A review of your personal and your familys likes and dislikes will probably narrow the list quickly.
Choosing flowers on the other hand, requires a lot of decisions - but you can mix and match and choose to fit a wide range of options. Basically, you need to decide if the flower will ultimately be planted in full-sun, partial-sun or a shady location. Seed packets and catalog descriptions will tell you the light requirements for a particular class and variety.
Deciding what to plant was easy. It was the next step that turned out to be the hardest of them all. Buying seeds. When I called the Department of Agriculture and asked if they had vegetable seeds for me to buy for my backyard vegetable garden, the person at the other end of the line said, I should talk to some other person about it. I was given another number to call. When I dialed this number every few seconds for about thirty minutes I kept hearing the engaged tone. Finally when the phone rang I was told the person I was supposed to talk to was on another call. But thankfully, before the person-I-was-not-supposed-to-talk-to hung up, I managed to blurt my question to her. Which was so very simple. Can I buy vegetable seeds from their department And, as I expected, the answer too, was pretty simple. Yes, she said. You can buy vegetable seeds and fruit plants from our centers, Then she cut the line.
Ruwan on seeds
I didnt know where these centers existed, and I didnt want to talk to her again. So, I turned elsewhere and came across Hayleys Quality Seeds & Flowers Division on the net. Instead of calling, I sent an email to Ruwan Rajapakse, Director / CEO and found myself on cloud nine when he sent a comprehensive answer. The seeds we have are mainly hybrids for the export market. They are protected by IP. The Sri Lankan market is not ready to have planting materiel from seeds due to two reasons; It takes a long time to reach the flowering stage, and it needs a lot of care at the nursery stage. Hence, we sell young plants in Sri Lanka, that give flowers in a few weeks. This means they are 6 to 8 weeks from seed stage when we sell them, wrote Rajapakse.
Yet, what he said, did nothing to solve my problem. I still didnt know where I could find vegetable seeds for my backyard and a few flower seeds for the front garden, seeds like marigolds to ward off insects, and petunias, for their petite beauty, even though I wasnt sure if they will grow in Colombo.
The best containers
Meanwhile, I started to read all I can about what I should do, if and when I found some seeds. Expert gardeners on the net, unanimously agreed on one fact, which is something even Mr. Watson would have figured on his own. After the seeds, the first thing you will need is a container to grow them in. What followed though, was pretty useful. The best containers are those made for the purpose. There are seed starting containers made of plastic or pressed fiber, peat strips and pots, and peat pellets of different types, as well as growing cubes and even complete seed-starter kits available. You can base your choice on price, convenience and even curiosity to decide which to use.

They also said, drainage is the important factor to watch out for when the seeds are sown in containers. If you use recyclables such as egg cartons or cans, which is what I was planning to do, be sure to punch drainage holes in the bottom.
The start!
For seed starting, the best choice is a sterile, soilless germinating mixture which is available in stores. Which stores They did not say. So, I decided, I would fill the containers with ordinary garden soil and keep my fingers crossed. For, no matter what, its a universal truth that nothing is perfect, and, not every seed will germinate, anyway.
It was useful to know though, that large seeds that can be easily handled could be placed individually in the mix. Smaller seeds can be sown by snipping off a corner of the seed packet and tapping them gently out of the packet as you sow them. If too many seeds fall out at once, you should gently spread them with the tip of a pencil. Seeds need room to grow, so, be careful not to plant them too thickly. Place two large seeds and two to three small seeds in each container where you want at least one plant to grow.
Check the directions
Check the directions to see if the seeds need light or dark to germinate, said the experts. Those that need light should not be covered with the soil mix, but should be pressed down (not buried) so that they make contact with the moist medium. Those that need dark should be lightly covered with the mix (about 1 to 2 times the seed thickness) and can be placed in a dark place or covered with black plastic or something else that will keep the light out.
I confess at this point, I gave up reading. I renewed my search for seeds, instead, and, eureka! Three days ago, I finally found a few precious vegetable seeds. They were hanging in tiny polyethene bags at the entrance of a hardware store, competing with a dozen broomsticks to draw my attention. A packet cost Rs. 10.
Right now, the brinjal seeds and tomatoe seeds are in two egg containers under the Kathurumurunga tree in my backyard. I dug holes in a sunny spot and inserted two seeds each of ladies fingers and beans into them. None of the packets had instructions, which thankfully gave me the freedom to do everything my way.
Three days later, I am still waiting for the seeds to sprout. Who knows, if my bean seeds are as magical as Jacks, next week I might be writing to you from the giants house in the clouds.
Hope the giant has wifi up there.

Temporary speed limit on E01 Expressway
Motorists should travel at a temporary speed limit of 40kmph on the E01 Expressway until further notice to allow landslide mitigation work, Road Development Authority Maintenance Unit Expressway Operations Director S. Opanayake said.
He said the notice affects a stretch of the road from Imaduwa and Kokmaduwa on the Southern Expressway which faces a risk of landslides.
The notice came into force from last Friday. It is expected to be in place until maintenance is complete.
The two lanes from Matara to Colombo in the 113km post and 114km post near Kokmaduwa and Imaduwa area were temporarily closed due to landslide mitigation activities such as horizontal drilling and chemical blasting being carried out by the National Building Research Organisation due to landslide threats.
The risk of landslide arose on the slope of Nalawana Kanda on October 1 and vehicular movement was temporarily suspended for five days.
A lane of the expressway was open for vehicular movement since Friday evening and two lanes that are prone to landslides have been shut down while two lanes on the opposite direction have been opened for bi-way vehicular movement.

Isnt it devastating to see yourself getting old each and every day OR much worse is that you look older than your age! A lot of women today are worried about themselves not aging gracefully. Well, the answer to these dilemmas is just easy. Eat the right food!
Tomato, known to be abundant with a very important component known as LYCOPENE, which is a very powerful antioxidant, which is more or less 20 percent powerful that Vitamin C is indeed a must have in peoples daily diet. Lycopene, which is also responsible for the color of the tomato itself is also a very good cancer weapon!
Aside from all the benefits mentioned above, tomato can also protect the skin from sunburn, according to the experts. Eating tomatoes will not make you invincible in the sun, but it may be a useful addition to sun protection along with sunscreens, shade and clothing, says professor Mark Birch-Machin, lead author of the study, in a statement.
Having a diet rich in tomatoes is, likely to contribute to improved skin health, which in turn may have an anti-ageing effect, concludes Birch-Machin.
What is in tomato that makes it very healthy to human skin
Aside from Lycopene, tomato is very rich with different vitamins that may help in preventing unwanted wrinkles and soggy looking skin. In fact it can be used to whiten your skin. Just follow this simple instruction.
1. Slice tomato into half and segregate the seeds.
2. Wash your face in circular motion and use your usual soap.
3. Rinse and pat dry.
4. Apply tomato in your face circular motion.
5. Leave it into 15 mins. To 30 mins. And if you want to fast whiten you skin you should leave in over night. You can see the result in the first day. Your face will become shine and whiten. You apply everyday as a good result.
Or why not use it as its main function This fruit can really be made as a perfect thirst quencher. Why not try it as a tomato juice or shake  The more natural it is the yummier and healthier it gets! No need to use preservatives, its all good. You can even make a pasta sauce from raw tomatoes that will surely be loved by your taste buds and will be adored by your body! You can even make a salad using a lot of tomatoes!

Resolving chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) problem
Too much talk too little action
We have had over two decades of research, many talk shops - symposia, seminars, public awareness campaigns and several publications in scientific journals and newspaper articles on CKDu; we have also had several Presidential Task Forces; the Organisation of Professionals Association(OPA) has discussed the issue of CKDu on several occasions; this writer has personally addressed several rotary clubs seeking their assistance in providing potable water to CKDu affected villages through rainwater harvesting, but precious little concrete action appears to have been initiated to alleviate the suffering of CKDu patients and their families. The end result of all these efforts has been: No Action, Talk Only (NATO). Meanwhile, people in the diseased affected areas are becoming increasingly cynical of do gooders who come to their villages to collect water samples from their wells, draw blood from their veins, and collect urine samples, only to depart and fail to provide any feedback thereafter. Clearly, it is high time to kick start some effective action in CKDu endemic villages. This article suggests some concrete actions designed to assist CKDu patients and their families, as well as suitable preventive measures aimed at controlling the disease based on available knowledge.
Counseling and psycho-social support
Professional counsellors could help villagers to establish community- based support groups aimed at interacting with CKDu patients and their families who are in urgent need of caring. People willing to listen to their problems and guide them in coping with the disease and its attendant problems.
Financial support
Patients needing dialysis require financial assistance to meet travelling expenses to clinics, essential laboratory tests (which may not be available at the nearest government hospital). At present, the government has approved payment of Rs. 3000/- per month to these patients, but this does not seem to be easily accessible in all districts.
Screening to detect early onset of the disease
Nephrologists (kidney specialists) believe in the need for mass screening of all adults (over 20 yrs) in a bid to detect early onset of the disease. Such screening is accomplished through testing urine samples for Albumin and Creatinine. Early detection through such testing can help arrest further kidney damage through effective medication.
Social workers
In many other countries, social workers are employed by health authorities to assist in the follow-up of patients after receiving a kidney transplant, or those receiving dialysis. These personnel visit patients in their homes and help in sorting out their medical problems. Clinicians attached to the Center for Education, Research and Training on Kidney Diseases, University of Peradeniya, have been requesting the Ministry of Health to establish a cadre of social workers to assist in after care of CKD patients, but the response from the Ministry appears to have been lukewarm thus far.
CKDu prevention
Available evidence indicates that increasing access to potable water is perhaps the best way of preventing/mitigating CKDu. No less a person than the President has appealed to the International community and the corporate sector to assist in providing potable water, but they lack guidance in terms of best options.
U.S.AID has been the only international aid agency to have addressed this water issue through a very pragmatic programme of promoting rainwater harvesting (collecting water running off the roofs of houses and school buildings). They have successfully demonstrated the viability of rainwater harvesting in the Vavunia area where 750 households depend entirely on rainwater for drinking and cooking throughout the year. Several schools in the Kilinochchi and Batticaloa districts have been provided 30,000 liter capacity rainwater storage tanks. Despite such living proof of the viability of this simple, common sense, low tech home-grown, solution which provides rural households with potable water at their door step, government agencies and vested interests are promoting high cost imported filters (R.O. systems) which cost the beneficiaries (poor villagers) four times more per liter of purified water, besides requiring them to collect their daily water requirements from a central location. Farmers too are busy people with little time to waste in making daily expeditions to water distribution points.
Improving health education
An effective community health education programme designed to inform rural households on the importance of drinking adequate quantities of water (at least 3 liters/adult/day); refraining from smoking, intake of illicit brews (Kassippu), avoiding self medication by rushing to the nearest pharmacy or village Kade to purchase strong analgesics (pain killers) for relief of common body aches and pains, and overall improved nutrition is a vital need for residents in CKDu endemic areas. Educating schoolchildren on the above issues may help in getting the message across to their parents.
Safe handling of fertilizers and pesticides
Misuse of pesticides (fertilizers, insecticides, weedicides and fungicides) is currently a major problem among small farmers in Sri Lanka. Main reason for this is the ineffectiveness and impotency of the Agriculture Departments extension services. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for improving agricultural extension at village level through an innovative approach such as deploying community-based farmer extensionists.
Effective education of rural communities
The writers long experience in rural development programmes has shown that multi-pronged action involving government agencies (Departments), Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Community Based Organisations (CBOs) are essential for successful implementation of community education programmes described above.
An appeal to Banks, Corporate Sector and affluent urban elites
Awake! All you privileged people. Spare a thought for the suffering farmers affected by Chronic Kidney Disease. They toil through blazing sun and monsoon rains braving marauding herds of wild elephants at night to help feed us all with our staple food-rice. Join us in our effort to control CKDu. Lets get involved in some meaningful action in the villages. When politicians stumble and bureaucrats fail to deliver, we, civil society must act and make a difference. We have specific projects that you could contribute to. Contact the author via e-mail ([emailprotected]) or telephone (0772657541) for more information.

Turncoats redefined
Lanka is going through a revolutionary change. One could say that it is a political revolution without any social change. Yes, that is correct; it is a political revolution within the capitalist mode of production. Such changes have occurred in the history and some times they have become earth shaking events.
When Hitler took over Germany, many expected a mild political change with Hitler playing a role similar to Bismarck. But things became more serious than that. Overthrow of Hitler became a world-wide problem. Here in Lanka we had to make a serious struggle to overthrow Mahindas fascistic regime. Now, after the political change country is facing the problem of turncoats.
Yes, even in Lanka, in a modern historical context turncoat is synonymous to, some extent at least, with the term renegade, a term of Christian origins having connection to deny God. In this democratic revolution too historical currents of great magnitude have caught masses of people, along with their leaders, in an impulse. In such a dire situation, new perspectives on past actions are laid bare and the question of personal loyalty becomes muddled. Almost unconsciously, one changes sides to play a new role cheating every body around. To the revolutionary who has passed the explosion very consciously, such people appear as clowns at first and then as harmful cheats. But a renegade is one who changes his principles or party; an apostate. We have to be careful; he may be very serious and sincere.
Political upheaval
We have to consider different situations; a defeat and subjugation or counter revolution were ruling ideology changes. A mass-shift in allegiance by a population may take place during military occupation, after a nation has been defeated in war or after a major political upheaval, such as military conspiracy.
Following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the domain in question, will quickly embrace the cause of the victors to benefit from the new system. This shift of allegiance is often done without much knowledge about the new order that is replacing the former one. In the face of fear and insecurity, the prime motive for a turncoat to draw away from former allegiances may be mere survival or to avoid harassment and ill-treatment. Often the leaders are the first to change loyalties, for they have had access to privileged information and are more aware of the hopelessness of the situation for their former cause. This is especially apparent in dictatorships and authoritarian states when most of the population has been fed propaganda and triumphalism and has been kept in the dark about important turns of events.
Historical events
In any case turncoat is a person who shifts allegiance from one loyalty or ideal to another, betraying or deserting an original cause by switching to the opposing side or party. In political and social history, this is distinct from being a traitor, as the switch mostly takes place under benefits and promotions from the new political order.

Lanka is going through such a situation. A mass-shift in allegiance by the population took place during the last period, after the national democratic upheaval; it was such a revolution. Following the initial traumatic times many of the citizens of the country embraced the programme of the victors to benefit from the new system. As time goes by, along with the embracing of life under the new circumstances comes a need of burying and rewriting the past by concealing evidence. The fear of the past coming to upset the newly found stability is always present in the mind of the turncoat. The past is rewritten and whitewashed to cover former deeds. When successful, this activity results in the distortion and falsification of historical events.
Unfortunately we could see such sad events around us. In particular new elements, turncoats join the entourage of main leaders displacing and pushing out those who assisted the leaders in the difficult times. Those new comers had to resort to revision, in order to cover their negative history.
Historical negationism is a form of historical revisionism that distorts the historical record for political, ideological, and cultural purposes. The English term negationism derives from the French phrase Le negationism, which identifies Holocaust denial as claims that the Holocaust did not occur, as understood by the public mind; hence, the term negationism identifies the distortion of history meant to deny the factual, documented reality. When Namal Rajapaksa told me what he experienced I had to think deeply about what could happen. We have to struggle to defend the revolution from frauds and opportunists.

WB, IMF assure support for Lankas socio-economic initiatives
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund heads have assured fullest support to bring about genuine changes in the sphere of socioeconomic development in the country concurrent to the changes in the political arena.
This assurance was given at the ongoing annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Lima, Peru.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is leading Sri Lankas delegation at the meeting. The sessions which commenced on October 9 were ended yesterday.
In the sidelines of the meeting, the Finance Minister attended a number of discussions in addition to the main conference. He had discussions with World Banks Senior Vice President (Operations), Kyle Peters and World Bank Vice President for South Asia Region Annette Dixon on financing future development programmes of Sri Lanka.
Minister Karunanayake attended Group of 24 (G-24) Ministers and Governors Meeting on October 8 and he was elected as the Vice Chair of the Group. The governing body of the G24 - Intergovernmental Group of 24 countries on International Monetary Affairs and Development meets twice a year, preceding the spring and annual meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and the Joint Development Committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. At this occasion, Karunanayake assured that Sri Lanka will also contribute for strengthening of G 24.
On the margins of the annual meeting in Lima, the minister had a bilateral meeting with South African Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitly and will have discussions with senior US Treasury Officials and ADB officials Senior IMF officials. The minister also had a meeting with the Commonwealth Secretary General Kamalesh Sharma on matters of mutual interest.
Karunanayake met a number of worlds leading investors/fund managers who showed interest in supporting Sri Lankas development initiatives under the new government.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Karunanayake will brief the delegates on the future development programme of Sri Lanka at the plenary session of the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The minister said during the meeting the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had already agreed to extend unconditional support for Sri Lankas development initiatives.
This is a golden opportunity for Sri Lanka. They have been closely watching the success achieved in the political front. Hence the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund stand ready to extend finance assistance to revive the countrys economy. We are ready with our set of proposals. I have no doubt that they will respond positively to them. I must reiterate that we are not subject to any conditions imposed by the World Bank and the IMF. In fact, they support us on our conditions and no on theirs. The financial support will mainly be channeled for education, health infrastructure, women empowerment and ensuring better prospects for youth. In addition, the two lending agencies too have assured support for enhancing economic productivity, developing export sector, developing enterprises, improving business environment and promoting investment. It is difficult to predict exactly how much we are getting. Because they have to study our programme first. In the past, we pledged support based on various conditions. But now they support us by looking at our programme, the minister noted.
Finance Ministers representing 188 countries have attended the Annual Meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Lima, the Peruvian Capital. The Sri Lankan delegation headed by the minister consists of Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga, Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Deputy Governor, K. Mahinda Siriwardena, Director Economic Research of Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ajith Abeysekera, Additional Director General of External Resources Department , and Bandula Somasiri, Minister, Commercial attached to the Embassy of Sri Lanka in USA.
