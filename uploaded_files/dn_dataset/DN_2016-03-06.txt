Indian censors more worried about Sri Lankan film than Lankas own!
Can a docu-drama that was aired in Sri Lanka be banned in India on the grounds that it may sour relations with the island nation The censor board thinks yes, but the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) says: Of course not.

And so, Muttrupulliyaa the first indigenously made Tamil feature film on the lives of Tamils in Sri Lanka after the civil war ended in 2009 was given the green light by FCAT, which overturned the censor boards refusal to give the movie a certificate for Indian screenings.

In case the film would...affected the relationship with a neighbouring country, the Public Performance Board of Sri Lanka would have not approved the film for screening during the Jaffna International Cinema Festival, said FCAT members Bina Gupta and Shekhar Iyer.
The film is based on the plight of Sri Lankan Tamils in a 1979 post-war era. Several scenes are graphic and contain visceral imagery of alleged atrocities committed by the Sri Lankan Army.

It was, however, premiered at Sri Lankas Jaffna International Film Festival in Colombo in September 2015.
This is not only the first feature film on the plight of the Tamils to be made indigenously, but is also the first on the post-war situation. And the screening in Jaffna is the films world premier, Sherine Xavier, the films Lankan Tamil director, screenplay and dialogue writer had told had media at the time.

But when time came to air the movie in India, Xavier was surprised to hear it was too contentious.
The film, said the censor board, was glorifying the bad effects of war in Sri Lanka.
The picture will affect the neighbouring country relations. It also refers to real political leaders of Sri Lanka, said the censor board.

The only reference to India in the order is: It also refers to LTTE, which is a banned organisation in India.
Appealing before the FCAT through her lawyer Satyajit Sarna, Xavier and the films producer TS Subramaniam have now received relief.
But the FCAT has imposed heavy conditions of its own.
The appellants have been asked to consider morphing LTTE flags and photographs of the banned organisations leaders.

The FCAT also asked and the films producers have agreed to reduce certain scenes depicting girls using drugs. Also, the producers have to issue a disclaimer that the film is only a fictional representation of real events and a health disclaimer against use of narcotics.
Nevertheless, the makers have agreed to these conditions.

Legal experts agree that this could be part of a larger problem.
We are no doubt the land of yoga. But this is an incredulous stretch! Not enough that weve fostered a culture of intolerance to free speech from within, weve now internationalized our fragile fair skin! To take offence at foreign movies found to be kosher by their own home governments! said Shamnad Basheer, owner of SpicyIP and a visiting professor at the National<U+2009>Law School, Bangalore.

All of this raises the issue of how independent the film certification board really is. It is meant to be an independent statutory agency and yet reflects the prevalent petty mindset of the ruling Raj in more ways than one, he said.

Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy agreed, saying the boards decision to ban the film pointed to a larger problem within the film certification body itself.
That the CBFC wanted to keep this film from screening throws up a problem with CBFC guidelines: They are way too broad; They disallow vulgarity for instance, or speaking of particular communities in contemptuous ways- so, there go most Johnny Lever films, Nundy said.

She also pointed out excessive or stringent reading of guidelines lead to financial difficulties for creatives, in particular for independent filmmakers who are already scrounging for capital to tell their stories.

They (the CBFC) also force filmmakers into a slow judicial process that can cost big money in delays, also legal costs. These guidelines need to be limited, made more precise and in accordance with the right to freedom of expression, on which jurisprudence to protect creative expression exists -- the CBFC must be guided by that, she said.

The censor board has become infamous for banning films for various reasons including nudity, crude language, and incitement. Between 1959 to 2015, it banned nearly 40 national level films on these grounds, and 36 regional movies. (hindustantimes)

Indian envoy takes on Sri Lankan Opposition over economy pact
Indias High Commissioner Y.K. Sinha has taken on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition, an informal coalition of pro-Rajapaksa parties and groups, over the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) between India and Sri Lanka.

Referring to reported observations of the former President and members of the Joint Opposition against the ETCA, Mr. Sinha, who did not mention the name of any Sri Lankan leader opposing the pact, told members of the Sri Lanka-India Society on Friday that he was surprised to come across Mr. Rajapaksas statements in sections of the local press on the issue.

Recalls CEPA talks

It was Mr. Rajapaksas government that held negotiations with India over the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which had included trade in services.  He described as quite amusing the statements of members of the Joint Opposition, some of whom were Ministers during the Rajapaksa regime, when the CEPA, he said, was negotiated.

Mr Sinhas response was in the context of views expressed in certain quarters that the proposed ETCA would deprive job opportunities for Sri Lankans in a host of fields including information technology and the Free Trade Agreement, effective since March 2000, had not been beneficial to Sri Lanka.

Constrained to join the debate

Qualifying his rebuttal, the diplomat said I hesitate to get into the political controversy but he felt constrained to join the debate because I do not think we should let naysayers take all the public space on this issue without anyone else trying to put the facts.

Emphasising that he had not seen any draft text of the ETCA, he said what he received two days ago was a draft text of the framework agreement, which might form the basis for further negotiations. He hastened to add that the draft framework agreement is not necessarily an indication of the nature and coverage of the discussions to be held in future.

Says 2005-2008 talks almost concluded

Giving an account of the CEPA negotiations during 2005-2008 (when Mr. Rajapaksa was President), he said the CEPA, which is [now] a dirty word here, was almost concluded. Sixteen rounds of negotiations were held, many of which were detailed.

Even the two countries had tentatively agreed on a draft. At the last minute, the Government of Sri Lanka indicated its inability to sign that agreement, which was subsequently shelved.

Opening two sectors against Indias 80

As part of the now-aborted agreement, under Mode 4 [of the General Agreement on Trade in Services] which pertained to movement of natural persons, Sri Lanka had agreed to open up two sectors -- marine ship building and information technology (IT)/ IT-Enabled Services, both of which were very limited fields, while India would throw open nearly 80 sectors.

Even in the respect of the two fields of the services sector, it was sought to be done at the request of the government of Sri Lanka, which felt that India could help it immensely. We do not know what the ETCA will do because serious negotiations have not begun, Mr. Sinha pointed out.

How the pact began

Tracing the genesis of the proposed pact, the High Commissioner said Sri Lankas Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, during his visit to New Delhi in September, had set very ambitious timelines, according to which the framework agreement should be concluded by 2015 end or 2016 early and the final agreement by June 2016.

The diplomat expressed the hope that there would be an understanding over the framework of the ETCA soon.

Indian investment since 2003

On the rationale behind the fresh pact, he said there was no formal agreement in place to regularise investment and services even though India invested $one billion since 2003 and another $1.5 billion to 2 billion was in the pipeline, apart from the existence of three modes of trade in services and the issue of 350-400 employment visas by Indian High Commission to Sri Lankan nationals last year.

Terming absurd the argument that the 16-year-old FTA had not been beneficial to Sri Lanka, he said that in 1999, the value of Sri Lankan exports to India was $49 million and this went up to $645 million in 2015. Noting that there had not been much increase in the value of Sri Lankan exports since 2005, he raised the question whether this was due to limited base of the exports. He added that that the regulatory framework in India was non-discriminatory.

Ambulance service not linked to ETCA

The Emergency Ambulance Health Protection Service, modelled on the lines of the 108 Emergency Response Services of India and being implemented with Indian governments grant of $ 7.55 million, has nothing to do with the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), Mr. Sinha has said.

Expressing dismay over the controversy on the launch of the scheme, Mr. Sinha said the service was in response to a specific request made by Sri Lankas Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to his counterpart Narendra Modi during the latters visit here last year.

We were not that keen

Admitting that originally, the Indian side was not that keen when the request was made, the High Commissioner said this was because India had already extended its portfolio and it was providing assistance of over $2.6 billion (grants and loans combined). But, the service eventually came through as Mr. Wickremesinghe had followed up the matter with a formal letter and some Sri Lankan Ministers had visited India to study how the service was working.

He clarified that ambulances would be registered in the name of the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine in the government of Sri Lanka and not that of GVKEMRI of India, the implementing agency in the initial phase. The service would be offered free of charge as long as the Indian government was funding it, he added. (TheHindu)
