Bio students unable to enter state universities must be given place at SAITM
The Socialist Alliance yesterday urged the Government to allocate 30 percent of the student admissions at the Malabe medical college (SAITM) to those who have obtained three A passes in the biology stream but failed to gain admissions under a full scholarship scheme.
If the Government intends to run the SAITM on a public-private partnership basis, they should consider offering 30 percent of student admissions to those who have passed the Advanced Level from the biology stream with three As' but still failed to gain admittance to the state medical college Prof.Tissa Vitharana said addressing the media in Colombo.
While admitting Sri Lanka lacks medical specialists and measures needed to address the issue, Prof. Vitharana said if the government thinks partnering with the private sector is the way forward, it should also be mindful to ensure the quality of medical education offered by all institutions remains in accordance with the highest stipulated standards.
Prof. Vitharana said it appears that the two major parties in the country which has formed a consensus government seems to thinks PPP is the way forward to further medical education in the country.
He said the concept has no wrong if government can assure the quality of education remains high.
Ptrof, Vitharana said the Government could follow what is practised in the US where the government and private sector have joined to establish medical colleges run on a non-profit basis.

At an Investor Forum in Hong Kong, and in Colombo Stock Exchange / Securities Exchange roadshows in Sydney and Melbourne, Indocean Developers Director, Pradeep Moraes focused on the combination of factors that are uniquely offered by Sri Lanka to international investors in the high end real estate market.
Revealing little known or not often recognized market features, Moraes convincingly presented a case for International investment in a market that is robust, has high upside, is 90% equity funded, locally fuelled by 60% of purchases, as attracted large investment from multinationals, and has all demand drivers on the rise.
All three events were very well attended both in terms of numbers and profile, and interest was keen and serious.
Moraes also stressed that hi end apartments are well poised to play a significant role as high value contributors to FDI in Sri Lanka, with the added advantage that the asset is as tangible as it gets and remains anchored in Sri Lanka.

Inactive SLFP electorate organisers must be replaced
New electorate SLFP organisers should be appointed instead of present organisers who do not work for the betterment of the party and disobey its leadership, National Youth Front (NYF) Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
Bandara was addressing a NYF media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
He said all SLFP organisers who do not attend the Mayday rally in Kandy and those who are not assisting the rally will be removed.
If one does not assist the Mayday rally or does not attend the rally it indicates that he or she is not a real SLFP organizer.
They should be removed from their positions and new persons who dedicate to the party should be appointed. The party cannot be moved forward unless they are removed he said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena had been waiting patiently for two years without taking any tough decision against the organisers who behave in hatred manner with the party while representing the Joint Opposition.
If it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he would not wait more than two years to remove these persons he said.
He said the SLFP NYF urges all political parties to stand for increasing the youth quota at Local Government Elections by 50 percent. Every political party should give more opportunities to youths to contest at the LG elections, he said.
Presenting the Local Government Act Number 15 in 1981 in Parliament, the late President R. Premadasa suggested that the youth rate at LG elections be increased by 40 per cent. But it is a timely need to increase the rate by 50 per cent.
When the LG Act is amended in future, a proposal to increase the youth quota to 50 percent can be mooted, Bandara said. Bandara said the NYF will bring over 100,000 youths representing the entire country to the Mayday rally scheduled to be held in Kandy.
Bandara said the NYF will make people and the political party aware about systematic approach launched under the theme 'Visaduma' (Solution) at the National Youth Front Convention recently.
Under the Visaduma programme, an institution called Institute of Career Guidance (ICG) will be established countrywide. Each ICG will guide youths for job-oriented vocational training.
Youths at the ICG will be guided and instructed for vocational training after their hidden talents and capabilities are identified.
Then these youths will be guided to specific fields in accordance with their talents. A youth who visits the ICG will be converted to a capable person who can obtain a job easily, he said.

## Title: National Natural Disaster insurance schemes for Sri Lankans

National Natural Disaster insurance schemes for Sri Lankans
Maiden National Insurance Schemes rolled out by the Government recently, including a first of its kind in the world, The National Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme for all uninsured Sri Lankans, were all facilitated by Crescent Global's top rated insurance covers, and support. Since all these insurance schemes were for the uplift of all Sri Lankans, they have been termed a 'miraculous blessing for the country.'
The NNDIS initial estimated claim of upto Rs 5.4 bn for the flood and disaster in May last year is being settled, in particular in Kegalle, which was the worst effected district, where all claims were settled in full earlier this year.
Crescent Global South Asia, has the most diverse and the most spectacular reinsurance portfolio in the country in terms of National Insured Schemes launched, insured properties, and reinsured projects, and a quick glance would make this fact abundantly clear.
Examples are the Cooperative Insurance policy for the Fisherman, ITF National Natural Disaster cover for upto 10 billion, SRCC and Terrorism Cover top up cover upto 10 B, Combined Retrocession Cessation XOL cover for 30% compulsory ceding of for all general insurance, and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, by far the largest specialized risk in SL, as reinsured with A rated securities in the international markets by Crescent Group.
The NITF has been in the forefront in launching the National Schemes during the last year. The best example, Minister Niroshan Perera says, is the pro active cover, the insurance provided to all uninsured for natural disasters including a cover for fishermen, and more recently the scheme for paddy farmers. The most recent is the island wide insurance for natural disasters for agricultural farmers for Rs 25,000 per hectare, topped up by a national cover for natural calamities such as flood, inundation, drought and wild elephant attacks, which were all insurance initiatives reinsured in 'A' rated securities.
'Crescent Global's single strength has been that organizations that have been reinsured through its good offices have helped entities such as NITF, Cooperative Insurance and the Petroleum Corp be pro active about disasters, or accidents and losses, and not reactive.
"It's also significant that what Crescent Global has insured is either on the mammoth scale -- the entire country, for natural disasters -- or of mammoth size, such as the biggest properties, of which Petroleum is obviously huge, in terms of the volatility of the commodity insured, and the sheer enormity of the property value indemnified', said Indrajith Fernando, Director, Crescent Global South Asia.
'The natural disaster insurance scheme (NNDIS), a first of its kind in the world, applauded by Breton Woods institutes including the World Bank, also insures all fishermen, uninsured households, small and medium-size businesses and industries, and all persons while fishing for personal accident, during natural disasters, with a cover of 10 B.
It is a cover to beat all these covers, so to speak,' adds Fernando. This cover includes an Emergency Relief Fund for food and shelter, for up to Rs. 200 million.

AB de Villiers reveals the inspiration behind his magic knock
Few expected AB de Villiers to come and make an impact like he did in his first game of IPL season 10, even he was surprised himself. But then again there is a reason he is called the Superman of cricket. As the saying goes, behind every successful man there is a woman and De Villiers case seems to be no different.
After making Kings XI Punjab bowlers lives a living hell, the South African credited his wife Danielle for helping him overcome self-doubt and for being his inspiration.
De Villiers had missed Royal Challengers Bangalores first two games owing to a back injury and there was still doubt over his inclusion in the side ahead of the match against Kings XI Punjab on Monday night.
During Punjabs chase, the South African, who was miked up, was asked by Sanjay Manjrekar how he overcame rustiness and was able to get going from his very first game.
I did surprise myself. It is a more mental thing than anything else, its not like you become a bad player overnight, the rustiness you refer to is more self-doubt, which was there over the last few days.
I phoned my wife just before the game telling her that I am doubting myself a bit but I surprised myself and played a few good shots, said De Villiers.
She was actually lying next to my boy, sleeping, when I asked for her advice and she had to call back a few minutes later. She told me that she backs me and to stay calm and that she was on her way, arriving tomorrow, so I think that was the inspiration.
De Villiers smashed an unbeaten 89 off just 46 balls to help RCB post a respectable total of 148 for four. The South African came to bat in the start of the second over after captain Shane Watson was sent packing by Axar Patel on the last ball of the first over.
De Villiers first shot was a defensive push that beat the point fielder as well as third man to give him his first boundary. He then had to curb his attacking instincts as wickets tumbled around him.
RCB were 72 for four in 15.2 overs and not going anywhere really while De Villiers was batting on 31 off 28 balls. Thats when the South African decided he had enough of pushing it around and flexed his muscles.
The result was a sixes storm that hit Indore!
In his next 18 balls, De Villiers smashed 58 runs with two deliveries being sent out of the ground. The fearsome attack left everyone, including Punjab captain Glenn Maxwell stunned and sent Twitter into frenzy. - NDTV

AMID PLENTY, BILLIONS STILL FACE FOOD INSECURITY
As wealth and well-being continue their inexorable course towards increasing concentration in the hands of fewer and fewer, an estimated 795 million people still suffer from hunger, and global food security is threatened by climate change and mounting pressure on natural resources.
With the worlds population expected to rise to almost 10 billion people by 2050, global demand for agricultural products will increase by 50% over present levels, posing a serious question mark over the capacity of the world's agriculture and food systems to sustainably meet the needs of this mushrooming global population.
This, in a nutshell, is the thrust of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report on The Future of Food and Agriculture released in Rome on February 22, which warns that mankind's future ability to feed itself is in jeopardy due to intensifying pressures on natural resources, mounting inequality and the fallout from a changing climate.
The report optimistically believes that the planet's food systems are capable of producing enough food to satisfy the needs of its inhabitants but only on condition that food systems undergo major transformations. Otherwise far too many people will still be hungry in 2030  the year which the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda has targeted for the eradication of chronic food insecurity and malnutrition.
Without additional efforts to promote pro-poor development, reduce inequalities and protect vulnerable people, more than 600 million people would still be undernourished in 2030, says the report. In fact, the current rate of progress would not even be enough to eradicate hunger by 2050.
Rural economies
According to FAO, there is little scope for expanding agriculture's use of more land and water resources, meaning that the production increases needed to meet rising food demand will have to come mainly from improvements in productivity and efficiency in the use of resources. Ruling out any business-as-usual option, the report argues that major transformations in agricultural systems, rural economies and natural resource management will be needed if we are to meet the multiple challenges before us and realise the full potential of food and agriculture to ensure a secure and healthy future for all people and the entire planet.
It warns that high-input, resource-intensive farming systems, which have caused massive deforestation, water scarcities, soil depletion and high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, cannot deliver sustainable food and agricultural production. The core challenge, says FAO, is to produce more with less, while preserving and enhancing the livelihoods of small-scale and family farmers, and ensuring access to food for the most vulnerable.
For this, a twin-track approach is needed which combines investment in social protection, to immediately tackle undernourishment, and pro-poor investments in productive activities  especially agriculture and in rural economies  to sustainably increase income-earning opportunities of the poor.
The report calls for a shift to more sustainable food systems that make more efficient use of land, water and other inputs and sharply reduce use of fossil fuels, leading to a drastic cut of agricultural green-house gas emissions, greater conservation of biodiversity and a reduction of waste.
This, it says, will require more investment in agriculture and agri-food systems, as well as greater spending on research and development to promote innovation, support sustainable production increases and find better ways to cope with issues like water scarcity and climate change.
Along with boosting production and resilience, equally critical will be creating food supply chains that better connect farmers in low- and middle-income countries to urban markets  along with measures which ensure access for consumers to nutritious and safe food at affordable prices, such as pricing policies and social protection programmes.
Lack of investment in production
FAO points the finger at losses and waste as significant factors in current inability to meet peoples food needs. Globally, it reports, around one-third of all food produced is either lost or wasted somewhere along the food chain.
In low-income countries, significant levels of food losses are said to occur at harvest and during post-harvest handling, owing to poor infrastructure, low levels of technology, a limited knowledge base and lack of investment in production. Food losses also tend to be caused by managerial and technical constraints in harvesting, storing, transporting, processing, packaging and marketing. - Third World Network Features

The AYDA Regional Learning Programme also provides various platforms for all participating winners such as coaching sessions, study tours as well as sharing sessions with some of Asias leading design practitioners & architects. This year, various industry experts ranging from architects to urban planners and entrepreneur joined forces to speak at the 9th instalment of AYDA 2016 Regional Learning Programme, comprising Dato Dr Arch. Ken Yeang (Malaysia), Arch. Colin Seah (Singapore), Arch. Sibarani Sofian (Indonesia) and Malaysian entrepreneur Mr. Ee Soon Wei, all of whom shared their experiences and interpretation of AYDA 2016s theme of Be Bold. Be Free. Be You..
Sri Lanka was able to participate for the first time at AYDA 2016, as a result of the initiative taken by Nippon Paint Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. The Sri Lankan phase of AYDA 2016 commenced on the 13th of June 2016 and the competition took place under the total supervision of Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA), the countrys apex body on Architecture who took the leading role of selecting the winners under different categories. Whilst the competition was open to all 3rd and 4th year students of architecture, 2nd and 3rd year students in Interior Designing were also given the chance to participate. Two Gold Winners from Sri Lanka  one from the Architecture discipline and one from Interior-Designing discipline, were selected to participate in the 3-day Learning Programme & the Award Competition in Yogyakarta.
The keynote speaker of the day, Dato Dr Arch. Ken Yeang who is the Principal of Hamzah & Yeang, spoke on the importance of seamless integration of 4 key elements in a design concept  nature, human, water and built environment.
Other speakers during the AYDA Learning Programme include Arch. Colin Seah, Founder and Director of Ministry of Design, and recipient of Singapores highest design accolade, the Presidents Design award.
Arch. Sibarani Sofian, Director of Urban+ and part of the design planning team executing national scale projects such as the Soekarno Hatta International Airport spoke on his passion on creating sustainable townships based on an amalgamated multi-disciplinary approach between urban development and architecture.
Twenty-three year old Malaysian, Chai Min Li, was crowned the Platinum Winner for the Interior Design Category of the regional instalment of AYDA 2016, beating 14 other countries in Asia, with her concept of The Common Place: Regeneration of Pudu Market, taking home the USD 1,000 prize.
The Platinum Winner of the Architecture Category is twenty-five year old, Ueda Mitsumori from japan, whose concept idea of The Old Matsuo River School looks at a seamless integration of the old town with the new town, through building schools on the site replicating the path where the river used to flow.
Chandima Gawarammana from University of Moratuwa and Pratheepan Kalaieesan from City School of Architecture (CSA) from Sri Lanka nevertheless delivered strong and unique concepts at AYDA. Design statement of Chandima Gawarammana from the Faculty of architecture of University of Moratuwa was on an Interior of an urban house in Colombo for a Wife-and- husband duo who is an artist and a wildlife photographer respectively in which the colour scheme of the built environment would evoke a sense of calmness and tranquilly whilst being appealing the husband & the two teenage children.
In the case of Pratheepan Kalaieesan from City School of Architecture (CSA), it was a design of a Water Purification Plant inspired by the filtration and cleansing characteristics of Sri Lankan wetland. Water was used as an architectural element as well as a functional element. The design fused the architecture of the water purification plant with the landscape to a public park.
AYDA was first introduced in Malaysia in 2008 and has witnessed increased popularity year after year. In its first year, AYDA received 87 entries, and in 2016 alone has received more than 4,500 entries.

Avurudu aroma around the corner!
The Sinhala and Tamil New Year is upon us. This is the time of family togetherness, the tempting aroma of the fragrant sweets, whole variety of traditional games - and the unique celebrations made up of a complex motley that includes facets of indigenous, Sinhala, Hindu and astrology-based customs and rituals.
Astrologically, when the sun moves from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) in the celestial sphere, Sinhala Buddhists and Hindu Tamils will begin celebrating their Aluth Avurudda and Puththandu respectively. According to Hindu mythology, once in every year, Indradeva, the prince of Peace descends upon the earth to ensure peace and happiness among individuals. The colour during of dress he wears varies each year and the astrologers advise us to wear that particular colour during the festival season.
The timing of the Sinhala and Tamil New year coincides with the New Year celebrations of many traditional calendars of South and Southeast Asia. The festival has close semblance to the Thai New year, Bengali New Year, Cambodian New Year, Lao New Year, and Thingyan in Myanmar. In India, we find Vaisakhi in North and central India, Rongali Bihu in Assam, Puthandu in Tamil Nadu, Vishu in Kerala, Bishuva Sankranti in Odisha and PoilaBoishakh in Bengal.
Origin
The Aluth Avuruddahas been one of the most significant annual festival for Sinhala Buddhists, but its exact beginning is lost in the history. Robert Knox recalls that Aluth Avurudda was a major annual festival of the Sinhalese which was grandly celebrated in late March with royal patronage. This was during the period 1659 to 1678 when Knox was a prisoner in Kandy.
The historians believe that the Nayakkar Kings of Southern India who ruled during the latter part of the Kandyan Kingdom would have
shifted the festival to April to fall in line with the Tamil New Year, thus
preventing Sinhalese and Tamils having two separate festivals in successive months. Historical records indicate that the British rulers declared Sinhala and Tamil New Year as a holiday in 1885.
Customs and rituals
The Sinhala Buddhists and the Tamil Hindus get ready for this traditional and cultural festival from March itself. Homes are cleaned and all unwanted items are disposed, making the setting clean and tidy to mark a new beginning. Sweetmeats are prepared and new clothes purchased. The traditional oil lamp is lit at the auspicious time.
The sound of firecrackers and the rhythm of rabana signal the dawn of the Aluth Avurudda. As the Aluth Avurudda sets in, the hearth is lit by the lady of the house and the traditional pot of milk is boiled. Traditional Aluth Avurudda dish kiribath follows. At the table, kiribath, bananas and many other delicacies become the centerpiece. Families sit around the table and share the kiribath, as the head of the family offers it to all members. After this the oil lamp is lit and the feast commences.
Every ritual is performed at an auspicious time. After meals, children show respect to their elders by offering sheaves of betel and elders bless them. Plates of sweets and other delicacies are exchanged between neighbours. After main rituals including oil-anointing are over, the celebrations move out into available open spaces where various traditional games and other activities begin.
Tamil Hindu celebration
The Tamil Hindus also celebrate the same Aluth Avurudda, commonly known as Puththandu, by observing the customs and rituals practised by ancestors over the years. However, they are slightly different to those of the Sinhalese. The auspicious occasion of Puththandu is also popularly known as Varusha Pirappu or the birth of Aluth Avurudda.
People celebrate Puththandu by following specific customs and rituals. On the day of the Avurudda, during the auspicious time, Maruthu Neer - clean water boiled with various herbs, selected flowers and leaves, milk, saffron and other ingredients are made by the priests in temples. They take bath with this maruthuneer by placing some water on the head.
After this event, new clothes are worn and once the Aluth Avurudda is born families assemble for prayer at their home. The worshipping begins with lighting the traditional lamp (KuthuVilakku). Then the whole family heads to the temple for puja and prayers. The elders in the family bless the children, who worship them and seek their blessings and good wishes.
Critical piece in our culture
During the New Year festival, the respect for ancestral ways, backed by rites and rituals, customs and traditions has opened our vision to understand that it is important to adhere to basic principles of morality. It is a festival which conveys to us the simple way of life possessed with good sentiments including the maintenance of social order. It is also a festival which communicates to us the value in all matters needed to maintain peace and prosperity among the community.
Customs and rituals followed in the Aluth Avurudda represent a critical piece of our culture. They help form the structure and foundation of our families and our society. They remind us that we are part of a history that defines our past, shapes who we are today and who we are likely to become. Once we ignore the meaning of our traditions, were in danger of damaging the underpinning of our identity.
 Customs and rituals contribute a sense of comfort and belonging. It brings families together and enables people to reconnect with friends.
 Customs and rituals reinforce values such as freedom, faith, integrity, personal responsibility, a strong work ethic, and the value of being selfless.
 Customs and rituals provide a forum to showcase role models and celebrate the things that really matter in life.
 Customs and rituals offer a chance to say thank you for the contribution that someone has made.
 Customs and rituals enable us to showcase the principles of our past generations, celebrate diversity, and unite as a country.
 Customs and rituals serve as an avenue for creating lasting memories for our families and friends.
 Customs and rituals offer an excellent context for meaningful pause and reflection.
During this festive period, as leaders, role models, and parents, we must strive to utilize every opportunity available to us to reinforce the values and beliefs that we hold dear. The alternative to action is taking these values for granted. The result is that our beliefs will get so diluted, over time, that our way of life will become foreign to us.
Its like good health. You may take it for granted until you lose it. If we disregard our values, well open our eyes one day and wont be able to recognize our world anymore. The values that support the backbone of our country, our family, and our faith will have drifted for so long that the fabric of our society will be torn.
Premier festivalWe must remember that
these customs and rituals have come down to us through the ages because they are ingrained in our history and culture. For thousands of years our ancestors, the inhabitants of this island built up a highly organised agrarian civilization based on the principles of harmonious co-existence with nature, non-violence, tolerance and peace.
The Aluth Avurudda demonstrates our national ethos with its characteristic emphasis of the renewal and reaffirmation of goodwill within families and among neighbours and in the series of ritualistic customs, practices and observances that are meant to revitalize an essential link between man and nature.
Sinhala and Tamil New Year, is a festival that has stood the test of time. It has enriched our culture, emotionally aroused our society and blessed our nation so much so that today the Aluth Avuruddha has emerged as the countrys premier National Festival.

Avurudu celebrations 60 years ago
When the sun moves from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) in the celestial sphere, the Aluth Avurudda dawns for both, Sinhala and Tamils in Sri Lanka. It is a time for rejoicing, family reunions and engaging in traditions and rituals carried out through generations.
The Aluth Avurudda demonstrates our national ethos with its characteristic emphasis of the renewal and reaffirmation of goodwill within families and among all other citizens of the country.
In the good old days, no one went to a supermarket to buy Asmi, kevum, kokis, and other sweets specially made for the season. Then, Avurudu was essentially a family affair. Everyone in the family, young and old alike, gave a helping hand for the Avurudu celebrations.
Have things changed now Avurudu sweets are readily available in supermarkets, and some take the easy way out without dirtying their hands with oil and flour. Practicing the traditional rituals too, has taken a beating over the years.
We desperately need to preserve our Avurudu traditions as these are based on the principles of the value of family, harmonious co-existence, tolerance, and peace.
With these articles and pictures published in the Daily News in the 1950s, we go back down the memory lane to look at how Avurudu was celebrated in the good old days.

Bolt inspired me to break world record: Van Niekerk
LONDON, Tuesday  Training with Jamaican athletics legend Usain Bolt gave Wayde van Niekerk the self-belief he could break Michael Johnsons 400 metres world record, he told The Times on Tuesday.
The 24-year-old South African duly delivered in perhaps the performance of last years athletics at the Olympics in Rio posting a time of 43.03 in the final to smash Johnsons 17 year old mark of 43.18.
Van Niekerk conceded with Bolt due to bow out after the World Athletics Championships in London in August he is not the man to replace him as the poster boy or showman of the sport.
A lot of people say, Wayde, you need to be more of an entertainer, said the athlete coached by 74-year-old grandmother Anna Botha.
I am not that type but I see qualities I share with Usain Bolt, and that brings a form of comfort even if it wont sell T-shirts.
However, he acknowledges the role the 30-year-old sprinter played in instilling the belief in him he could threaten Johnsons world record and once he had done that to take it under the 43sec mark.
I got to realise we are all human beings and that whats possible for him (Bolt) is possible for me, said Van Niekerk referring to the three weeks he spent training with Bolt last year.
His environment is no different to ours. That was a massive confidence-booster.
A window opened. Why not achieve what they can When the clock stopped at 43.03 I had no choice but to think of going under 43.
To dream of 43.02 would make no sense.
Van Niekerk, though, is hoping he can emulate Johnsons feat at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg and achieve the 200m/400m double in London.
However, he has to hope the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) agree to his request at their Council meeting on Wednesday and Thursday in London to amend the schedule.
I am a 100, 200 and 400 athlete so will dream for every record there is, said Van Niekerk, who revealed he took his mind off a painful hamstring prior to the 400m final by watching his beloved Liverpool beat Arsenal in the Premier League.
What sort of athlete would I be if I didnt added Van Niekerk, who furthering his relationship with Liverpool got engaged to his longtime South African girlfriend Chesney Campbell in the city last Christmas. - AFP

Borussia Dortmund football team bus hit by explosions

Three explosions have hit a bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund football team to their home Champions League quarter-final match against Monaco.
In a news conference, the head of Dortmund police said it was a targeted attack on the team.
Player Marc Bartra underwent an operation after breaking a bone in his wrist. No other players were hurt.
The state prosecutor said a letter found near the scene was being examined as part of the investigation.
The match was postponed until 18:45 local time (16:45 GMT) on Wednesday.
Pictures from the scene showed the bus's windows broken and tyres burst in the blasts.
Dortmund police said that "three explosive charges had detonated" at Hoechsten outside the city at about 19:00 local time.
The first indications were that this was an "attack with serious explosives", they said.
Fans at the 80,000-capacity Signal Iduna Park were told to stay there until it was safe to leave.
The stadium was later evacuated safely and police thanked the fans for their co-operation.
"As many officers as possible" would be deployed for tomorrow's rescheduled game, they said.
Borussia Dortmund said in a statement: "Shortly after the departure of the Borussia Dortmund team bus from the hotel to the stadium there was an incident. The bus has been damaged in two places."
Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said: "The whole team is in a state of shock, you can't get pictures like that out of your head.
"I hope the team will be in a position to be able to compete tomorrow on the pitch. In a crisis situation like this, Borussia pulls together."
One of the Dortmund players, Mathias Ginter, was involved in the Germany-France match that was targeted in the terror attacks in Paris on 13 November, 2015. Another present in Paris, Andre Schurrle, was injured for the Monaco match.
FC Barcelona, Bartra's former club,tweeted: "All of our support to @MarcBartra, @BVB and their fans."
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoyalso tweeted his support, wishing Bartra a quick recovery.
Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football organising body condemned the incident and wished Bartra a "speedy recovery".
Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said he was "deeply disturbed by the explosions".
"The decision taken to postpone the UEFA Champions League match between Borussia Dortmund and AS Monaco was the correct one since we must always prioritise the safety and security of all fans, team officials and players," he said.
"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the representatives of the two clubs, the local authorities, and the supporters for their cooperation on the ground."
Dortmund is currently fourth in the German Bundesliga table.

Brandix wins third Gold at National HCM Awards
Brandix won Gold and two special awards for Human Resource Management at the 2015-16National Human Capital Management (HCM)Awards galaat the Cinnamon Grand hotel on 31 March 2017, once again demonstrating the Groups commitment to its people.
Presented bi-annually by the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) and the Association of Human Resource Professionals (AHRP), the awards (formerly known as the National HRM Awards) are Sri Lankas pinnacle accolades in the field of HR, and recognise public and private sector organisations that have demonstrated innovative and inspiring HR practices. SHRM is the largest professional HR Association in the world and has a membership in 174 countries.
Besides being one of four overall Gold winners, Brandix was also awarded the Special Awards for excellence inTalent Management and Learning & Development among the nine category awards that recognise the best standards and HR practices in Sri Lanka.
This was the third consecutive occasion that the Group won the Gold award. Brandix was the only apparel sector organisation among the top four corporate entities honoured and was also the only enterprise that won Gold as a Group.
Our people are the lifeblood of the enterprise, and inspiring them to reach their full potential for their personal development and the achievement of the companys goals as One Brandix is a top priority for all of us, the Groups Chief People Officer Ishan Dantanarayana said: We are therefore delighted to be judged according to the stringent audits specified by SHRM for these awards and to have continuously won Gold awards over the years.
He said Brandix had chosen, as in past years, to be evaluated as a Group, requiring the HR practices of all the companies in the Group to be audited for the award, making it more challenging than having just the holding companys HR practices assessed.
In September last year, the Brandix Group was declared the sole winner for HR Excellence in South Asia (excluding India), at the 2016 HR Awards of SHRM held in New Delhi.
Brandix HR practices were also highlighted in the pastwith a cover storyin the SHRM global magazine which is read by nearly 250,000 HR professionals in 174 countries -a first for any Asian company.

Call of the season
Dawn of the Sinhala Hindu New Year is the most welcome news to both Buddhists and Hindus in Sri Lanka. It is a delightful event of historic and cultural significance. It has been given pride of place in the annual calendar. In short it is the most significant of the annual events organized and celebrated by the two communities. The role played by the New Year has come down the annals of history reviving the islands cultural heritage. History records that this national event was celebrated with much grandeur Sinhala race. Hindus too share the same views. It is a bond which continues to blossom over a long period bringing joy, cheer and entertainment to the participants. This traditional event has different meanings to different persons, according to their religious beliefs, it has made a great contribution to national unity  a good example to the present day society.
Traditional games
Now back to the memories of the Sinhala Hindu New Year amidst warmth, the love of the family, relatives and friends. The sound of Koha reminds you of the Avurudu season bringing joy to the children who in their innocence await their funfilled day with traditional New Year games. This is the most wonderful time of the year for children in village areas. Kadju trees are in full bloom with dry nuts for traditional games, as well as raw ones for the table as the traditional curry on the New Year day. Exotic flora  flame colo used red flowers on Erabadu trees are another signal of the dawn of the New Year. The sound of raban played to the tune of traditional folk songs and melodies are a striking feature of the arrival of the New Year. Prior to the New Year a series of activities take place in both Buddhist and Hindu abodes, mostly in rural areas. Entire premises are cleaned. Colour washing, polishing the floors, varnishing the household furniture are the main tasks carried out prior to the eventful day. Shops are overcrowded with customers buying new clothing for the entire family. Streets are filled with shoppers, along pavement and also in shopping complexes. City shops are illumined in the night with all kinds of gifts for the New Year.
The house becomes a live of activity with the preparation of traditional sweets with kevun, kokis, aasmi etc being given prominence. The indigenous varieties of food like pickle, brinjal palm and fish ambulthial truly resemble the traditional atmosphere. Hindu specialities are mostly mouth-watering cuisine like crispy murukku, vadai, dosai and munguli etc and mung rice in banana leaf. Cooking for the New Year is done in newly bought pots and pans. Customs traditions and rituals play a vital role in the entire event, they are all observed with utmost ease and devotion. Auspicious times are observed to the very letter with the belief that any mishap will bring bad luck to the house or the family.
Electronic media
The Avurudu table, laid with the traditional oil lamp to be lit at the auspicious time by the chief of the family  the father before partaking of Avurudu meal reflects the love and faith, unity and culture. The sound of crackers act as the time keeper. At present the electronic media too facilitate the event. Paying obeisance to elders and parents will be the next item. Money transactions also take place as a part of the procedure. The leaf of betel figures prominently on all these occasions. Even those outside Lankan shores sometimes return for the sake of the family unity creating an exceedingly happy moment for their near and dear ones. Religious aspects  places of religious worship too create a proud land mark in the activities of the day.
Religious rites
The temple for the Buddhists and kovil for the Hindus are vital link and they perform their religious rites with high confidence for a bountiful New Year. They visit the temple during the non-auspicious time called Nonagatha meaning no-nekatha and spend time venerating the Triple Gem for a blissful new year. Still later another celebrated traditional event is bathing for the first time after the new year anointing the head with medicinal oil (Na-anu). Another custom adhered to is the setting out for work at an auspicious time.
Further the New Year binds you together with precious bonds, bringing homely pleasures and the delight of sharing with all the relatives, friends, and neighbours irrespective of race or religion. Mention should be made here of my immediate neighbour and friend, an exception, a non Buddhist, yet who celebrates both New Year and Christmas entertaining the entire lane.
Sincerity is what makes the occasion special. Jealousy, enmity, hatred and anger disappear when visiting one another for the new year. This is an age old practice for the younger generation to get accustomed to. Still another remarkable feature of the new year is celebrating the event with traditional games, bearing competitions and various other related activities, organized, participated and enjoyed by the youth islandwide termed as Bak Maha Ulela. Hence the New Year should be hailed for its mammoth contribution for national unity.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (12-04-2017)]
The difference between NCMC and SAITM
I have read many articles comparing the NCMC and SAITM. Therefore we have to consider whether these two institutes are comparable. Regarding the NCMC the following facts are important.
a). NCMC was established as a nonprofit organisation by a medical association.
b). NCMC followed the medical curriculum of the Medical Faculty of the University of Colombo.
c). Lectures from the Colombo Medical Faculty provided supplementary lectures.
d). Clinical training was provided in government hospitals.
e). NCMC students sat for the same examinations conducted by the Colombo Medical Faculty for the students of the Colombo Medical Faculty.
f). SLMC accepted that the training provided was adequate for practice of medicine in Sri Lanka
None of these facts are applicable to SAITM. The trouble started when the NCMC with the support of the then government demanded the MBBS certificate from the Colombo Medical Faculty. This was not acceptable as these students have not registered as students in the University of Colombo. This resulted in protests from students. The protests were ignored by the Government. The student protests then evolved into an armed struggle to overthrow the Government. This resulted in thousands of deaths and caused severe damage to the economy and the reputation of the country. President Premadasa as soon as he was elected nationalized the NCMC and solved this problem.
MBBS program of the KDU was established to provide Doctors for the armed forces. This was necessary as the Government Doctors were not willing to serve in the frontline field hospitals during the civil war. The KDU medical students are provided clinical training in Government hospitals. SLMC has accepted that the training of KDU students is acceptable for practice of medicine in Sri Lanka.
SLMC is the regulatory body for regulating medical education. It is similar to the Supreme Court regulating legal education by regulating the Law College. Nobody in Sri Lanka can practice as an Attorney at Law without passing out from the Law College. The sensible people in Sri Lanka hope that the Government will not repeat the past mistakes and provide a solution to this problem immediately. Any delay intentionally or not will cut a pathway for a disaster.

Constitutional reforms : Courts to be allowed to decide on referendum
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly has decided to let the countrys courts of law decide whether the Constitutional reforms require a referendum or not.
A member of the Steering Committee speaking to the Daily News yesterday stated the priority has been given to agree on the substance of the Constitutional reforms and present the draft report before the Constitutional Assembly. Whether it would be a new Constitution or an Amendment will be decided later, he said. However, it is learnt that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a meeting with the Steering Committee members recently had expressed that this was not the right time for a referendum.The meeting had been attended by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, TNA MP M A Sumanthiran, Ministers Malik Samarawickrama, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Rauf Hakeem, Mano Ganesan, Rishad Bathiudeen and State Minister Dilan Perera.
All were allowed to speak their minds out at the meeting. Opposition Leader Sampanthan very strongly urged for a new Constitution with a referendum, but both the President and Prime Minister were of the view that this was not the right time for it. They asked to concentrate on completing the draft document and place it before the House, a member who attended the meeting said.
The interim report of the Steering Committee giving the contours of the Constitutional reforms was initially expected in December last year and its debate was to be taken up in early January, but was postponed indefinitely as there was no consensus. Steering Committee sources said the SLFP represented by Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, Susil Premajayantha and State Minister Dilan Perera last week expressively maintained the position that their party prefers Amendments rather than a new Constitution. However, the UNP, TNA and other minority parties were demanding a new Constitution followed by a referendum.
The SLFP had also expressed that it wants to continue the Executive Presidency and maintain the unitary character of the State. Minister de Silva had said a strong Presidency is needed if power devolution is to become a reality.
Considering these developments, the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) and Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) have now agreed to continue the Executive Presidency with minimum powers, if that is what prevents meaningful power devolution.
However, President Sirisena during the meeting chaired by him had stated that he stands by his original position on the Executive Presidency. I have told the country my position clearly, but my party holds a different view, the President has stated.
The SLFP had also stated that its prime concern was on electoral reforms. However, minority parties have opposed the move to single out the electoral reforms, adding that any Constitutional reform process must accommodate three main aspects, electoral reforms, Executive Presidency and power sharing.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had also expressed the view at the Steering Committee that the Executive Presidency should be retained. Sources said he was also skeptical about power-sharing proposals. However, sources said the Steering Committee has reached a broad agreement on power devolution after lengthy discussions.

Doctors advise public : Avoid dehydration
Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne advised the public to drink more water and take more liquids (without alcohol or sugary drinks) during physical exercise to avoid dehydration due to the current heat wave.
Liquid intake should be over the usual amount and adding salt to food would provide adequate minerals, he said. He advised the public against being exposed to the heat or the hot sun.
Dr. Jayaratne pointed out that sunscreens can be used to prevent sun burns and blisters. The public, especially children, should limit physical activities to early mornings and evenings, he added.
The vulnerable groups are children less than four years, elders over 60 years, overweight individuals, those who engage in heavy physical activities and the sick. Skin rashes can be prevented by staying in cool places and keeping the skin cool. If children get sunburns, parents are advised to consult a doctor. Cramps can be eased by drinking minerals and resting. Some get heat strokes but it is rare in Sri Lanka, Dr. Jayaratne said.
Eye Surgeons Association President Maduwanthi Dissanayake said those with low immunity, including children, are at high risk of contracting eye infections.
Peadiatrician Dr. Deepal Perera said elderly people and children are the most vulnerable for dehydration and more attention should be paid to their health during this period.
Health professionals say that with the increase in temperature, the spread of viral infections and consequently eye infections, have also increased in the past few days.

The European Union (EU) will step up its assistance to Sri Lanka, by providing Euro 42 million (LKR 6791.4 million) for the implementation of two programmes, Support to the Modernisation of the Agricultural Sector in Sri Lanka (EUR 30 million) and Strengthening Reconciliation Processes in Sri Lanka (EUR 12 million).
The Foreign Office of the Federal Republic of Germany and the British Council will also contribute EUR 2.4 million and EUR 0.1 million respectively to the programme on reconciliation.
The programme aimed at Strengthening Reconciliation Processes in Sri Lanka is a direct result of the EUs Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) conclusions on Sri Lanka in October 2015, which envisaged new opportunities for the EU to engage with the Government of Sri Lanka in making further progress on reconciliation and support priorities of good governance including tackling corruption, promoting respect for human rights and the rule of law.
The programme will strengthen the governance of reconciliation processes by seeking institutional consensus across various government entities and civil society in addition to contributing towards strengthening the linkages between the government and the grassroots population.
The programme will also facilitate initiatives that link reconciliation and non-recurrence by addressing language barriers and psycho-social needs, as well as using arts and culture to break down barriers between communities.
The EU aims to help modernise the agriculture sector by improving the Governments institutional capacities and by introducing innovative packages and associated market and production infrastructure in areas in need.

A feast in every sense
With the Sinhala and Tamil New Year around the corner it is time to put on your apron and bring out your Kokis cutters and oil pans and try your hand at making some good old festive goodies. From the traditional milk rice to delicacies like Unduwal, Naran Kavum and Aggala, the Avurudu season about laying out a scrumptious feast to share with your family and loved ones. These festive foods are all about tradition and the memories associated with them.
Sweet meats and special dishes are an essential facet of the Avurudu season. While they have come to be identified with the annual festival, some of these food items are also prepared to mark special occasions. However it is during the Avurudda that food mainly takes its pride of place.
Food has a special place in the Avurudu season. It is directly related to some of the main traditions. From the lighting of the hearth at the auspicious time, to boiling the milk at the auspicious time, to baking the Kavum with the oil in the cooker to making milk rice at the auspicious moment and eating at the auspicious time, food plays a key role in bringing about joy and cheer to the season, renowned culinary expert Dr T Publis Silva said.
According to culinary expert Varuni Perera, the sweetmeats related to the Sinhala and Tamil New Year differ regionally. Varuni notes that Unduwal and Naran Kavum are mostly found in the hill capital.
In some areas Sow Dodol is called Vali Thalapa. They make it like Pittu and do not add coconut. Some people make Aluwa with cadju while others include sesame seeds. Generally the Cadju curry and Hath Malu are two dishes that are related to the Avurudu season, she mused.
Varuni adds that the traditional New Year food of the Tamils differ from the Sinhalese. They make their Kavum centred with Pani Pol, a sweetened coconut mixture. Sometimes they have coloured Kokis. While the Sinhalese have rice for our lunch table, the Tamils usually have Pittu.
Different varieties of cakes, especially Bibbikan are suitable for the Avuruddha. A lot of our traditional sweetmeats are made using a large amount of oil. Eating too much oily food could lead to health problems. Include salads in your main meal. Eat fresh fruits for dessert, she advised adding that such items are lighter than puddings made out of milk and fresh cream and healthier too. Cucumbers and water melon are the best to include in your menu.
Publis notes that it is fitting to add a goraka curry to our daily menu for three months after the Avurudu season as goraka embodies the ability to decrease the harmful side effects of consuming too much sweet and oily food. Garlic, black pepper, bitter gourd, tender leaves of cashew and Ranavara flowers too possess this medicinal quality of cutting down of access fat from the system.
Varuni says, Try to balance your diet and drink some Kolakanda in the mornings. This will get rid of any side effects.
Today some do not have either time to make sweetmeats or the knowledge or experience. So they buy a few of the goodies from the nearest sweet shop and send them neighbours.
Some people send the sweetmeats they received from anothers home to their neighbours. That is very cheap. If you cannot make all the food, just make one item and send it to your neighbour, Varuni opined.
There is no need to limit the Avurudu season for a few days. What happens ultimately is that people enjoy a few dates limited to the celebrations while indulging in epicurean food habits and end up with a lot of health and other problems. It should be Avurudu all year round because Avurudu symbolizes joy, togetherness and compromise, Publis concluded.
[Sinhala and Tamil Avurudu sweetmeats ]
Milk rice
Milk rice is the main meal at the Avurudu table and is made according to the auspicious time. In Sinhala homes Kekulu rice or Samba rice is cooked and thick coconut milk is added to the cooked rice to make a creamy porridge like mixture which is kept on low flame on the fire till it thickens. Then it is spread on an even surface with a banana leaf and cut into squares.
Tamils make the Pongal rice  a sweetened version of the milk rice. Green gram, plums, jiggery, cashew nuts and gee are added to the rice mixture along with the milk.
Oil cakes
This sweet delicacy possesses an odd shape with a bun like lump in the centre from which it derives the term Konda (hair) for its Sinhala name Konda Kevum. Treacle and sugar are cooked to a boiling point. Rice flour and steamed flour is added to the cooled treacle. A spoon of the batter is poured into a pan of hot oil, with a wooden skewer inserted at the centre to create the lump. Oil is constantly provided to the developing Konda or bun. It is an art to create the Konda and it can usually be mastered through practice.
Kokis
Kokis is a deep-fried, crispy and sweet snack made from a mixture of rice flour and coconut milk. Although it is considered a traditional Sri Lankan Avurudu snack, the popular belief is that the word Kokis itself has been derived from the Dutch, which has links with the word cookies.
Mung Kevum
Mung Kavum is a combination of rice flour and green gram flour added to warmed treacle. Diamond-shaped pieces of this mixture is soaked in a batter of rice flour and coconut milk and deep-fried.
Asmi
Everyone cannot make this sweetmeat. The batter for this item is unique. First, milk is added gradually to rice flour, which is constantly kneaded. A handful of cinnamon leaves are squeezed into a cup of light coconut milk, and the strained juice is added to the batter. The juice of the cinnamon leaf makes the batter thick and slimy. Once the batter reaches the required consistency, it is time to fry it. A punctured coconut shell spoon is used to pour the batter to create a web like design. This is kept aside for a day or two before being re-fried and decorated with a thick sugary syrup.
Athirasa
Athirasa, as the term implies is an extremely tasty Avurudu sweet, which is quite rich in sweetness as well. It is a form of oil cake made with jaggery and rice flour rolled into a paste, flattened into circles and fried.
Bibikkan
Bibikkan is a rich, dark, chewy and moist cake made of shredded coconut, jaggery and semolina. The ingredients include grated jaggery or treacle, melted in a little water, heated, then cooled and mixed into a batter with roasted semolina. Chopped dates, winter melon, ginger preserves, candied peel and cashew nuts are added, along with crushed fennel, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. A dash of salt too is included. A beaten egg is folded in before the mixture is popped into the oven.
Aluwa
This is a sweet made with just two ingredients: rice flour and coconut or palm treacle. The process begins with roasting rice flour on medium fire. Next, the treacle is heated to a boiling point. The rice flour is added with a dash of cardamom and handful of chopped cashew. Aluwa is easily identifiable with its diamond-shaped pieces and heavy coating of rice flour.
Unduwel
Unduwel is a very sweet food item made during Avurudu. It originated from the central province. It is a deep fried coil of a mixture of Urad dhal and rice flour soaked in sugar syrup.
Murukku
Coming in a range of sizes and shapes, murukku is prepared using a variety of flour. The snack can be savoury or sweet. For the sweet murukku, also known as seeni-murukku, it is coated in sugar syrup after the murukku is fried. The savoury murukku is prepared adding chilli powder and sesame seeds to gram flour.
Sour fish curry
Sour fish curry, popularly known as fish ambul thiyal, is one of the most beloved varieties of the many different fish curries available. The fish (usually tuna) is cut into cubes, then sauted in a blend of black pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, garlic,goraka, pandan leaves and curry leaves. All the ingredients are simmered with a small amount of water and cooked until the liquid reduces. This allows for a thick spice coat on each cube.
Hath Maluwa
Hath Maluwa as the name implies is a dish made of seven vegetables, cooked in a fine blend of spices such as ginger and garlic, green chilli, dil seed, cumin, sweet cumin and pandan leaves with coconut milk. The Hath Maluwa is prepared for special occasions and is a famous dish that adorns the festive table during the Avurudu season. Today, the type of vegetables used for this curry varies from one district to another.
Seeni Sambol
Seeni Sambol is a fried onion mix of chili powder, tamarind and sugar. Onions are chopped and sauted in oil along with the other ingredients until it is caramelised, by the sugar. A touch of Maldive Fish adds taste. Seeni is the Sinhala term for sugar, which demonstrates the importance of sugar in the preparation of the dish. Seeni sambol is a fine accompaniment for milk rice.

Fitch affirms Dialog Axiata at AAA(lka)/stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based telecom company Dialog Axiata PLCs National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka). The outlook is stable.
Fitch says that Dialogs standalone credit profile of AAA(lka) is underpinned by its market leadership in the expanding mobile and pay-TV segments.
We believe Dialog is in a position to gain revenue market share from smaller telcos in light of its superior 3G/4G network capability. Its financial profile is solid, with moderate 2017 forecast FFO-adjusted net leverage of 1.2x-1.4x and stable operating EBITDAR margin of 34%-35% (2016: 35%).
We believe Dialog could potentially receive support from its 83% Malaysian parent, Axiata Group Berhad (Axiata), if its standalone credit profile were to weaken.
Dialog and its parent have moderate linkages, which include sharing key management personnel, a common brand name and common creditors.
This could lead to reputational risk to Axiata should Dialog fail.
Fitch says that they expect Dialogs revenue growth to slow to around 5%-6% in 2017 (2016: 17%), as consumers are likely to curb their voice and data usage due to higher taxes.

Govt. vies for renegotiation
The Sri Lankan government has asked for the renegotiation of the lease period in the Hambantota Port Agreement.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama taking questions from the Japanese media at a Business Seminar hosted by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) in Tokyo, said they were in the final stages of the process and hoped to finalize the agreement within the next two weeks. We have and agreement in most areas but we are discussing the term of the lease. We have asked that it be reduced from 99 years and the China Merchant Port Holdings Company is looking into whether they can achieve the same results with the current model or change it to a different one if the time period of the lease is to be changed, explained Minister Samarawickrama.
The Hambantota Port Agreement which will have the Chinese company work on a joint venture with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) on the third phase of the Port, calls for China merchants to purchase an 80 percent stake in the Port at USD 1.12 billion. The current framework agreement also allows the SLPA to buy back a further 20 percent stake in the venture after 10 years of operation, taking the Sri Lankan stake at the Port to 40 percent.

Htota wont be a Military Port: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed that the Hambantota Port would not be a Military Port with security being strictly handled by the Sri Lanka Navy and law enforcement agencies. The Prime Minister was speaking at a business forum organized by the Japan External Trade Organization in Tokyo, yesterday.
As Chinese interest in the Port continue to be viewed with suspicion, especially with regard to its military interests, the Premier said, The Agreement on the joint venture between the Chinese company and the Sri Lankan Ports Authority precludes any foreign country from using the harbour for military purposes.
It is only a commercial operation and we do not want any of Sri Lankas harbours to be used for military purposes other than that of the Sri Lanka Navy, he added. The Prime Minister explained that law and order at the Port would be handled by the Police, Customs and Immigration of the Sri Lankan government and all internal port security would need to hire Sri Lankan staff.
Premier Wickremesinghe reassured his Japanese audience that any violation of conditions in the agreement would mean that the Sri Lankan government could take over the Port without payment of compensation.
Any warship can come into the Port, provided the Government of Sri Lanka agrees to it, said the Prime Minister as he sought to promote an equal playing field for all.
In March this year, the US Pacific Fleets transport ship USNS Fall River visited Hambantota on a Pacific Partnership goodwill mission. During its 12-day stay, it held a joint exercise with the navies of Sri Lanka, Japan and Australia. The visit was seen as a show of strength against Chinese expansion in the region along with allies such as Japan who is struggling to ensure that Chinese aggression in South China Sea does not extend to the Indian Ocean.

IMF more upbeat about global economy this year than in 2016
The International Monetary Fund sees a more favorable outlook for the global economy this year and next than in 2016, but it has concerns beyond the near-term, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said.
Our forecast for 2017 and 2018 is certainly more favourable than what we have seen in 2016, and probably a bit more so than we had forecast previously, she said before the IMF releases its world economic outlook later this month.
So there is a positive short-term outlook on the horizon, which is unfortunately tainted by the risks that are still there, and that lead us to be concerned about the risk of complacency, Lagarde added according a CNBC report.
I have also identified two key concerns that we at the IMF have: one is persistent low productivity and, second, excessive inequalities that grow together with that low productivity, she said after meeting the chiefs of other leading global economic organisations and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
On the influence of President Donald Trumps administration, Merkel said she had no reason to believe the IMFs mission was endangered in any way.

The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAD) provides additional concessional loan of Kuwait Dinar 5 million (US$ 16.5 million) for the Kalu Ganga Development Project.
The Kaluganga project is being implemented by the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry with the financial assistance of the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAD) and OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID).
The proposed Kaluganga Reservoir will have a capacity of 265 million cubic metres (MCM) of water and will divert 100 MCM annually to the Moragahakanda reservoir.
The financial assistance received are not adequate to complete the project as the cost of the project has increased during the project implementation due to various reasons, including unforeseen geological conditions in the foundations and design revisions.
The KAFAD will provide a supplementary loan of KD 5 million to partly finance the funding shortfall. This loan is provided at an interest rate of 1.5 percent per annum with a repayment period 22 years.
The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development provided KD 10 million for the project in 2009. The OFID will also provide an additional loan of US$ 18 million. The signing of the agreement pertaining to the loan of Kuwait Dinar 5 million took place at the office of KFAD in Kuwait recently.

Leo Burnett Sri Lankas Executive Creative Director Lalindra Nanayakkara, known as Nana, recently participated in a three-day typography workshop that was conducted by a world-class panel under the auspices of the University of Moratuwa and was attended by a cross section of participants ranging from industry professionals, designers to under graduates and art students.
The event brought together top advertising and literary professionals from across Sri Lanka and the region, to highlight the important role that typography plays in modern-day communication.
A series of case studies, seminars, lectures and reflections were shared to educate the participants on how they can make better use of typography, understand its roots, apply it in their academic studies and professional careers, and truly understand the technical aspects involved in the art of typography. At the typography workshop, Lalindra highlighted examples of exceptional typography led campaigns that have been created for Sri Lankan brands. Lalindra is a renowned communications professional, with a career that spans across 18 years.
Commenting on the key cases he covered at the workshop Lalindra said, I shared some interesting pieces of work with the students and highlighted that typography can actually become the core element in a creative idea. My presentation reiterated that instead of just using text for a headline or as accompanying copy, typography can be used to drive an entire campaign or concept.
Programmes of this nature also give us an opportunity to showcase the world-class creative ideas and campaigns that we have executed as an agency over the years, we are also able to impart our knowledge to the next generation of creative leaders and hopefully draw them to our industry.

A light from a Sign of Contradiction!
Christ and the way of life ushered in by Him calls people to reach out in three ways: to ones true self, to others and finally to God. Reaching out to others includes crossing borders in a particularly way towards the most weak, destitute, marginalized and the vulnerable. In his life and wandering through the length and breadth of his home country of Palestine, Jesus prime attention and concern was to embrace the sick, those oppressed by the evil spirits and sinners.
The Gospel pages are filled with such striking and amazing stories. Jesus even exposes himself to unnecessary criticism and rude comments of the religious leaders of the time, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, for taking such paths of social contact and encounter. For him, people claim the priority of his compassionate and tender attention. Yet, he is accused of being a rabble-rouse, of blasphemy and of chasing demons in the name of Belzeebul!
Notice how Jesus approaches the Samaritan woman at the famous historical well of Jacob. While the whole episode is a beautiful manifestation of the gentle patience of Jesus, the woman on the other hand puts on a mask, beating round the bush, concealing her lifes secrets and standing her ground.
It is a long journey for her to reach the Living Water that she is really in need of to slake her crushed spirit and slake her souls thirst. Jesus embraces little children and makes them symbols of the Kingdom of God. For, only those who make themselves like little children can lay claim to entering Gods kingdom. He is swift to ward off hypocritical attitudes when confronting the Pharisees who brought to Him a woman caught in public sin demanding that she be stoned to death.
Jesus reads their wicked minds and feels disgust at their hypocrisy. He throws an awesome challenge: Let the one without sin, cast the first stone! They all disappear dumb-founded and recoiling in shame. We are told that Jesus was constantly at prayer, sometimes in the early hours of the morning and at times in the midst of his heavy ministry while curing the sick, driving out the demons and preaching.
He submitted to Gods will always as we see in the dramatic and touching scene at Gethsamane. He teaches us what prayer is about and how powerful it is when accompanied by sincerity within oneself and humility before God.
Heavy burdens on the poor
No wonder then, Jesus condemns the self-elation of the Pharisee who at the threshold of the sanctuary brags about his righteous deeds while He praises and marvels at the humility of the publican who not daring to enter the temple stands at the door beating his breast seeking divine mercy on his sinfulness. It is this social outcast, the publican who goes home, justified and not the self-righteous Pharisee.
Matthew the evangelist records a series of woes uttered by Jesus against the Pharisees: they are like whitened sepulchers, beautiful outside with nothing but rotten bones and decay. They are like the blind leading the blind leading everyone to the pits of illusion, danger and disaster.
They are blind Pharisees who accuse people of the specks in their eyes, while they themselves have beams that blind them to the truth. They lay heavy burdens on the poor. On the contrary, Jesus declares himself as the source of solace, strength and consolation wishing that people learn from him who is meek and humble of heart. He invites all who labour and are heavy burdened promising rest for their weary souls.
In Jesus who is Word become flesh, we have received grace upon grace as St. John the evangelist says in the very first chapter of his Gospel. He immerses himself in the waters of the river Jordan requesting baptism from John the Baptist, His precursor so that He can identify himself with all who stepped in confessing their sins.
John is quick to declare that amidst the immense throng of people flocking to hear him, there stands a carpenters son from Galilee who is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, the laces of whose shoes he is unworthy to lose.
John now wishes that greater attention be paid to Jesus than to himself for he has accomplished his task of being the voice crying out in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths for the time has come for the decision of repentance and change of heart.
The axe is already laid at the root of the trees to cut down those that are not laden with fruit and be cast into the fire. John refuses to baptize Jesus but at His insistence both bow down to the will of God so that all things may be fulfilled.
For Jesus, it was the foretaste of His not too distant baptism on the cross where he would pour out his blood and commend his spirit in obedience, which would be the price of our redemption. As he said: If He is lifted up, I would then draw all men to myself. Jesus of Nazareth is the Eternal Galilean. St. Paul addressing the believers in the city of Philippi writes poignantly that the Son of God did not cleave to His divine prerogatives, but emptied Himself unto obedience of the cross for which cause God exalted Him and gave him a name, that is above every name, at the call of which everyone on earth, under the earth and in the high heavens would go down on their knees and proclaim: Jesus is Lord!. The divine teacher thus authenticated his own teaching that unless the grain of wheat dies, it will not bear fruit.
Jesus was poor for he was an itinerant preacher who made His listeners aware that he had no place even to lay his head though foxes had dens and birds in the air nests to rest. He had come in fact to do his Fathers will and not his own. The theme of this Lent was that Christ became poor for our sake so that in his poverty we are made rich. Our richness consists in the blessings of redemption flowing from His emptying Himself in love and loving those whom He loved, loving them to the end. Did he not abase himself to go down and wash the feet of his disciples, a mean task usually the lot of the slaves and servants in households when the master received guests into the house! Jesus wants the disciples too to love as he loved and to wash one anothers feet in humility.
Renouncing excessiveattachment
As Son of Man, in His humble state of the Incarnation, Jesus had come to serve and not to be served. He wishes all those who want to be perfect to follow Him in detaching themselves and renouncing excessive attachment to earthly goods, possessions and even loved ones. One must not allow himself to be possessed by them. When the rich young man who was thus invited, failed to face the challenge and as he departed, Jesus felt saddened though He was happy to learn that he had kept all the commandments since his youth. God seems to want the best of us and not what we can give in half-measures and with reluctance.
The only way then to enter the light of the Risen Lord and experience Easter, the dawn of new life, grace and Joy in the spirit in the open space of the Kingdom of God, is to look for riches that no brigand steals or no moth destroys.
That is why the first blessing announced by Jesus on the Mount of Beatitudes runs: Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of God. God in Christ reached out to us sinners in love and forgiveness.
He is the prodigal father ready to warmly welcome all those who have strayed away squandering their lives in debauchery and yet have decided to come back home. Lent is the journey home from the estranged land of sin and reckless living and Easter is the banquet readied at the Fathers house.
There are plenty of abodes in the house of the Father and Jesus had told us well in advance, that He had gone to prepare a place for His friends with whom He had joyfully shared the great secrets of the Kingdom of God hitherto unseen and unheard.
The Risen Lord is ready to support us in our weak faith and unsteady courage, even opening his wounds for the faithless to touch! He is there stilling storms to a whisper and navigating us to safety. He wants us to launch into the deep for a great draught of abundant fish. Importantly, the echo of Easter is: Fear Not, it is I. Peace be with You. It is the reassuring voice of the crucified and Risen Lord.

Litro Gas donates diving equipment worth over Rs. 20 mn to SL Navy
Litro Gas, the largest importer and supplier of LP Gas in Sri Lanka donated an extensive stock of new diving equipment along with a state-of-the-art Surface-Supplied System worth over Rs. 20 million to Sri Lanka Navy at an official handing over ceremony held at Light House Galley Colombo recently.
The system will enable divers to be monitored from the surface or a team positioned in land. The constant and clear communication model will ensure increased safety for divers.
Chaminda Ediriwickrama, Director, Sales and Marketing/Corporate Affairs, Litro Gas Lanka Limited, Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Sri Lanka Navy, Ravi Wijegunaratne and Shalila Munasinghe, Chairman, Litro Gas.
Our foremost inclination was to donate these equipment to Sri Lanka Navy. We know that they will be able to put the Surface-Supplied System to optimal use and we viewed this as our chance to contribute to nation building efforts. We are pleased to be able to be of some assistance in enhancing critical capabilities of Sri Lanka Navy, said Shalila Munasinghe, Chairman, Litro Gas.
Surface-Supplied System puts divers in an advantageous position to undertake more effective diving assignment as they have more freedom in terms of movement, control, vision and communication. The monitoring team will be able to successfully guide the divers from dry land or above the water level. The system is more advantageous during period when water turns murky and unclear. The advanced technological edge in using the system will set to improve the resources enhance the capacity of the countrys naval force. Sri Lanka Navy will be using the system during their regular operations in terms of development and building, other diving and salvage exercises as well as nation-building endeavours.
Thanking Litro Gas for the contribution, the Commander of the Navy - Vice Admiral Sri Lanka Navy, Ravi Wijegunaratne said, We welcome this commendable gesture from a corporate entity. The Surface-Supplied System will enhance our capacity in terms of naval operations and enable us to serve the country in a number of ways. It would be our pleasure to continue our interactions with Litro Gas in future as well.
This particular donation is timely in nature as the Sri Lanka Navy diving and salvage unit is continuously engages in a number of critical diving assignments. Sri Lanka Navys diving and salvage unit is involved in numerous development activities taking place in the North of Sri Lanka as well as Trincomalee area which includes construction and development work in piers and jetties as well as various salvage and building requirements in other parts of the island or whenever the country calls for their expert intervention such as the one which occurred in late March 2017, where the unit successfully completed the cleaning of sleeves of the Ambatale Water plant.
The Surface-Supplied System gives Sri Lanka a definite advantage in terms of diving and salvage operations as it allows Sri Lanka Navy divers to be benefit from direct communication and monitoring d by the surface or a team positioned in land. This will invariably result in increasing their safety at all times as they are effectively led and guided by an equally competent team from the surface, added, Director, General operations,Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva.

Mythology demystified
A critic is not a superior being over a true creative writer. He is only an interpreter of the text he is reviewing. It is better if he or she is also creative artiste.
He can then understand better the creative process of the writer and writing. He cannot question the content of the creative writer because the latter has his or her viewpoint. Perhaps a scholar who might have a wider knowledge and sensibility could offer some criticism to the writer in a constructive manner so that the writer can improve the text. Usually writers accept valid criticism. Invariably it is a matter of Taste that matters.
I was fascinated reading some of the poems, which the writer Sanna Uppal calls merely Muted Verses. Muted is unusual for a title of a book of 54 long and short poems. Most of them are pregnant with deeper layers of meaning. If one is spiritually inclined one could strike an immediate connection with the subject concerned.
The bookcover shows a temple bell tied with strong and knotty chain against a backdrop of greenery, implying Nature that is identified with the Almighty. Muted-tied down with restraints that the writer cannot express her voice totally.
The book priced at $12, 95 is distributed by Litterateur Imprints housed at1st Floor, Valluvacheri Building, Netaji Nagar Kochi, India.
The dedication itself sounds mystical. Sanna Uppal says: To all those who wish to embrace and heal their truth in the fluorescent memory of the deep silence within and without. To my liquid consciousness.
The poet has a Masters Degree in Philosophy. That speaks for her understanding the sublime thoughts in religious philosophy.
At a Literary Festival held at Udaipur in Rajasthan, India in the latter part of last year, I was fortunate in meeting some outstanding poets there. Some of them were women and one of them was Sanna Uppal. She is from Amritsar in Punjab and an unassuming young lady.
Speaking about the author, the publishers say the following which sums up her vision:
Love is the only shade that colors our very existence and shapes our entire being, everything eventually falls under one vibrant roof called LOVE. In a poem, a word must be both as deep and as immense like an ocean, the most productive challenge, we are blessed in lifes mystery and inscrutability. Face it and embrace it: unleashing the creativity in you she proclaims
Instead of commenting on the content of her poems which are evidently of superior quality of deeper spiritual nature, I shall single out at random some of her lines which I appreciated for your enjoyment as well.
From Dr Susana Roberts (Foreword Writer) quoted poems first. These lines I liked:
Muteness as grey words is the chant that ancient temples chant / Grey are the lips that are sealed hard / not aqua blue, not emerald green / Grey is the colour of the cemented sea / the only god that rules is /the grey god. I think Sanna the poet means Lord Vishnu who lie on the ocean. May be the Grecian God of the Seas.
Dry Robert quoted another poem. From that what I liked: Silences speaking through words/ much is air to discard. /
Defeated sometimes/ like a drama collapsed.
The faded essence of her words/ the reality she created/ the golden mind
Now, from Sannas Prologue, I liked:
Nothing on this earth comes to you on its own/ everything is reverberating/ Resonating your cause/In consonance with your beats
Life is a journey/a journey of the self/a journey through the self/ a journey towards the self
The search for love is endless/But when it ends/if ever it ends/ it ends up at the feet of eternity
Let me now show you some of the other line in Sanna Uppals well written poems of depth and facile writing:
I will embrace you/in the primordial mud of insanity/gaining virtuous surrenders

Navy opens five Reverse Osmosis plants
The Research and Development Unit of the Navy helped install five more Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants in different parts of the country where communities struggle to find drinking water.
This is an initiative to fight the rapid spread of kidney diseases in the area.
In line with theseobjectives, the Navy opened five more RO plants manufactured by the Navys Research and Development Unit for community use at Damanayaya in Dambulla, Kudagama, Halmillewa and Mayingamuwa in Anuradhapura, Thabbowa in Puttalam, Thissapura in Medirigiriya.
Accordingly, around 1,200 families in Damanayaya, 620 families in Kudagama, 550 families in Halmillewa, 520 families in Mayingamuwa, 520 families in Thabbowa, and 570 families in Thissapura will be benefited.
The Navy, on par with the far-sighted leadership of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, has been installing RO plants in various parts of the country where kidney diseases are rampant due to the lack of water resources to meet drinking water needs of the community within the region.
Thus far, the Navy has installed 190 Reverse Osmosis plants in different parts of the country to date, facilitating 90,046 families and 70,200 schoolchildren with drinking water.

New Year lessons back home
I go down the memory lane as far back as 1945, the period of post-World War II. We lived in the village named Bandiyamulla, Gampaha, which is now quite urbanised. That was my first encounter with the Sinhala and Hindu New Year events mainly linked to my maternal ancestral house where my grandmother, uncles and aunts lived. Our maternal house in Alavatupitiya, Seeduwa, was situated in a vast land full of plants.
My grandfather was an indigenous physician, dead at the time of my remembrance of New Year events. But he seems to have left a legacy, which was carried down the years. My mother used to visit the ancestral house to see the grandmother and bestow all the New Year greetings with presents. All events related to New Year take place in keeping with the auspicious moments.
I came to know that the head priest in the village temple has undertaken the duty of writing down all the auspicious times, Neket Vela, as a sheet of paper known as neket seeettuwa distributed to all the well known village heads. As my grandfather happened to be a village headman, it was customary to get the sheet of paper at the right time, even after his death.
Our mother wanted us to venerate kneeling down before the grandmother offering her with a bulat hurulla or a sheaf of betel leaves. As a child I came to know the significance of the betel or bulat, much more than from the books I happened to read later. Bulat is reckoned as the holy leaf that gives spirit in all the New Year activities.
The eldest is the ancestral houses happening to be my grandmother. As such she is the person who administered the auspicious moments, one by one. This is also known by the term lit kramaya or the almanac system. As children, we were made to know that the celebration of the New Year is the oldest festival linked to Surya Mangalya or the festival of sun. It is the sun which gives both light and harvest to the entire agrarian community.
When the harvest is brought home and kept in barns (atu kotu), a glorious smile appears on the face of the community. The entire environment is full of joy. There is a belief that the sun god or hiru deviya with most powerful living force on the nature and humans. In fact all the moment of festivities linked with New Year are broadly termed as Avurudu Sirit Virith. Commencing with the utmost relaxed period known as nonagatha or the period we stop all the other work in order to concentrate on the inner life force. The concept of nonaketa comes from no nekath or the period where there is no special auspicious period, astronomically. The elders wish to consider the period as a time specified for religious activities (punyakarma). Nonakatha or punyakalaya are synonymous. Most people prefer to go to the village temple, when there is no noise. It is also the time to relax by offering flowers at the foot of the Buddha statue. While adhering strictly to the auspicious moments the Sinhala village to seek companionship and pleasure through a series of living events during the period. On the major events it is marked by New Year games or avurudu kreeda where ankeliya a folk game which paves the way to gauge the intensity of the pattini cult where two sides are known as udupila and the yatipila. The former is the team of the character in the cult known as Kavalan and the latter the team of Pattini. The two characters and what befell on them leads to an age old legend recorded both in Pattini Hella a Sinhala short ballad and the counterpart in Tamil in the work titled as Silappadikaram. The legend has come a long way in the lives of both Sinhala and Tamil-speaking people in the world. Both works are honoured and paid homage by tradition. It is also believed by some traditionalists that the period of the New Year is marked honourable as it depicts certain episodes in the life of Pattini and Kannagi. She is also believed to have traversed seven directions.
As such she is known widely by the term Sat Pattini. In order to mark this, village elders believe that the food that should be partaken at the ancestral houses to be named as Hatmaluva. The legend says that seven types of herbal food goes to cook the hatmaluva. They include the following and we came to know from our grandmother. They are Vattakka Dalu or Vattakka creeper buds, kasata or the jak seeds, kadju (cashew), Mekaral, vambatu, alu kehel and ash plantains.
All these herbal ingredients are put together to partake with the main food being milk rice and kiribat. One main factor is the auvuru kema or the New Year Food is mainly a vegetarian preparation.
Followed by the New Year feast, partaken by all the members of the house, comes the ganu denu kirima or the auspicious moment to exchange greetings together with the exchange of money. The elders have the habit of giving more money to the children which is a delightful moment. My grandmother used to collect money throughout the year in order to distribute it among us in keeping with the tradition. The uncles and aunts get more money. Then comes the auspicious moment of veda allima or work time specified to engage in a particular function. It is said that my grandfather who was a veda mahattaya had the habit of growing a medicinal plant to cover the moment. Dairy keepers and cattle breeders engage in the function of treating their breed in order to honour them. Writers engage in either reading or writing as a visionary moment to upkeep their function determining to bring better results during the year to come.
The New Year day is also now to the villagers as Dolos Maha Yana Davasa or the day that dawns after passing 12 calendar months counting from Bak. The term Bak too is significant as taught to us by elders. The term denotes Bagya or glory and splendour. Anointing the herbal oil, especially by an elder or the head monk of the temple is denoted by the term hisa tel gana mangalya.

Oceanfront Condos at Nilaveli to be completed in October
This would be Sri Lankas first beach-front, serviced, luxury, and leisure apartments of its kind to be opened. Oceanfront Condos homes offers 81 condominiums in total.
What makes the model of Oceanfront Condos operations convenient is that once the apartment is purchased and furnished by the owner, the Company acts as a facilitator for condominium rentals.
While owners go about their life, the Company manages and lets out the condominiums on rent, thus enabling the owner parties to earn an additional income from their holiday beach-front homes.
Oceanfront Condos features a swimming pool, a gymnasium, and a caf within its precincts. It is also comfortably located just a 20 minute boat ride away from the Pigeon Island Marine National Park with its jeweled coral gardens and 300 types of reef fish that makes it a snorkelers and divers paradise. Oceanfront Condos close proximity to Trincomalee makes it a viable hub to visit.
Its natural harbor, Konesvaram temple and Fort Frederick are some interesting sites here. Another attraction, of course, is whale watching at the harbor. Potential buyers are invited to visit the property and its fully furnished show apartment this holiday season, to inspect and explore the value of this Nilaveli beachfront investment.

PM to woo Japanese investors
As Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sets his focus to woo Japanese investors to Sri Lanka, he asked that Japan take on a more assertive role in developing the economic architecture of the Indian Ocean.
He added that the island nation be seen as a gateway between the Indo-Pacific Oceans; a logistics and trade hub for Japan to access the rising middle class markets in Asia.
Delivering the keynote address yesterday at the Business Forum organized by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) in Tokyo, the Prime Minister stressed that the rise of the new economic order was very much in Asia. It is in East Asia, South Asia, Middle East and Africa that you will find the rising middle class and the biggest consumer markets, said Premier Wickremesinghe.
In this context, he welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abes Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy which sought to promote connectivity through free and open Indo- Pacific oceans via economic prosperity in the region, including Africa.
The strategy which aims at building a network of security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region to stem the risk of China changing the regional order by force, also has economic benefits for such countries which have seen major Japanese funding in return. ASEAN countries in particular have received development assistance for infrastructure- and human-resources development with Japanese firms focusing their FDIs on ASEAN countries.
Similarly, Premier Wickremesinghe asked that Japan take a more central role in shaping South Asian regional economic development. Japan has become more important now as America shows reluctance to be involved in economics of the region, especially with its withdrawal from the TPP, said the Prime Minister.
Premier Wickremesinghe who is also a strong supporter of freedom of navigation in the seas and an economically integrated region found common ground in the Japanese Strategy and chose to echo the Japanese Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Shunsuke Takeis idea of Indo-Pacific Ocean of World Trade.
The question, he said, however, was the need for a comprehensive plan of implementation for the Japanese proposal of two oceans. This was especially important said, Premier Wickremesinghe in the light of other regional powers also having their own strategies for the region such as Chinas One Belt, One Road initiative and Indias Look East Policy.
Japan has shown its ability through its relation to America. The Japanese Prime Minister met US President Trump twice, determining Americas reaction to Asia though economic relations not on the table. But time is short, how can the Japanese government with other governments work out what the plan is and how connectivity is to be established on infrastructure, roads and institutions The foundation of prosperity not only requires Japanese government intervention but also requires the Japanese private sector, said the Prime Minister as he pushed for greater connectivity through investment and trade with Sri Lanka and the region.
In the next 20-30 years, the region is expected to have an additional population of 250 million people and the Japanese private sector has to invest here otherwise someone else will, he said.
In reference to Prime Minister Abes USD 110 billion to the Asian Development Bank for development of quality infrastructure in Asia in 2015, Premier Wickremesinghe called for partnership of quality infrastructure in the Indian Ocean as intervention to develop infrastructure in the countries of the Indian Ocean region was necessary before businesses could tap into the rising middle class market.
He further explained that Sri Lanka was the best country for the Japanese private sector to focus on given its strategic location in the Indian Ocean and the access the country would provide through its various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to bigger markets.
We want Japan to use Sri Lanka as a hub for trade. We expect to deepen our existing FTA with India through the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), expect to sign a FTA with Singapore and another with China. We also hope to talk to Japan, Indonesia and other ASEAN countries with regard to FTAs, explained the Prime Minister.
With Sri Lanka also poised to become a logistics hub, the Prime Minister invited Japanese investment in the Colombo and Trincomalee Ports.
The new Terminal at Colombo will soon be open for investment. We invite Japanese companies for a joint venture. We also hope to further expand Colombo Port to the North up to 810 miles reaching Ja-Ela, making it the largest in the Indian Ocean. In addition, we have also invited Japan to partner with India to develop the Trincomalee harbor, he said and added,
The two Ocean policies are best when Japan, India and Sri Lanka are working together.
The Prime Minister also announced that the government would offer a Separate Desk for Japanese Investors, a new set of tax incentives which will have generous depreciation and allow foreign investors to take out their profits out of Sri Lanka without paying any additional tax, a single window for investment, taskforce for FDIs and exports, taskforce on tourism and open up the economy further to encourage more investment into the country.

Political chaos grips Maldives as Yameen fights for survival
With the Grace of Allah, I continue to be a member of PPM, and its sole elected president and leader, former Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said in a defiant tweet to his followers on March 26.
Gayoom, 79, was referring to the Progressive Party of Maldives, which he founded in 2011 after ruling the Indian Ocean archipelago with an iron grip for three decades to 2008. But it was not to be. On March 27, Gayoom was deposed from the party leadership for leading a rare parliamentary revolt against President Abdulla Yameen, his half-brother.
Gayooms tumble is more than a bitter family feud in South Asias smallest nation, a popular destination for high-end tourists. It exposes a political fault line that pits the increasingly isolated Yameen, a PPM stalwart, against a new opposition alliance. Fueling the increasingly bitter tensions between the ruling party and the opposition, Maldives Police, on April 6, arrested an opposition leader on accusations of plotting to overthrow the government, just days after the failed effort to impeach the Speaker of Parliament.
Maldives Parliament
According to Maldivian opposition figures in Sri Lanka, the countrys closest neighbor, Yameen, will struggle to retain a majority in the 85-member parliament.
Gayoom has played a significant hand in these shifting political tides, adding to uncertainty about Yameens future and pushing the Maldives toward greater instability. The opposition was emboldened after Gayoom struck a deal with his nemesis, former President Mohamed Nasheed, who replaced Gayoom in 2008 after the countrys first democratic election.
The Maldivian Democratic Party, headed by the charismatic Nasheed, closed ranks with Gayoom and two other parties to push for a no confidence motion against the parliaments speaker, an ally of Yameen. The opposition parties accused the parliamentary speaker of quashing attempts to achieve greater accountability in the house, such as questions to government officials involved in national development.
The parliament became a flashpoint on the day of the vote, as protesting opposition figures were carted out by soldiers in plain clothes, the usual parliamentary voting procedure was changed, and the new opposition alliance boycotted the no confidence vote. Yameens camp won, with 48 votes, but the result revealed the governments tenuous hold on the house, in which the president formerly commanded a comfortable majority, often winning more than 60 votes. Consequently, the opposition smells blood.
We will file another motion to challenge Yameen in the house; he is running a complete dictatorship, Ahmed Naseem, a former foreign minister, told the Nikkei Asian Review. He has even placed the parliament under the defense forces.
Western embassies in Colombo, which monitor the Maldives from the Sri Lankan capital, have expressed concern about the parliamentary showdown and Yameens subsequent strikes against opposition political leaders. The ensuing harassment of opposition politicians is contrary to democratic standards, the German embassy said.
Among the governments high profile targets is Qasim Ibrahim, the parliamentarian who heads the Jumhooree Party and was arrested on April 6 after being initially summoned by the police for a grilling. Colonel Mohamed Nazim, a former defense minister and critic of Yameen who had been released from house arrest in late March, was re-confined after the vote.
The government has dismissed international criticism, saying in an April 2 statement by the presidents office that it denies accusations of intimidation recently levelled by the opposition. In a further show of defiance, the statement said the government reiterates that the judiciary and police in the Maldives are independent of government or party interference.
Despite the show of bravado, the Yameen administration has been taking no chances. In late February, the defense ministry revoked the voting rights of the Maldivian National Defense Force, the countrys army of 3,000 troops, having earlier banned soldiers from engaging with politicians, bureaucrats, and foreigners.
These measures appear likely to be motivated by a split in the PPM between a faction that supports incumbent president Abdulla Yameen and that which supports his half-brother and long-time dictator Maumoon Gayoom, IHS Janes, a global defense and security consultancy, said in a March report on the Maldives.
Money laundering
Yameen has been reacting to increasingly forceful criticism since mid-2016. In August, he signed a toughened criminal defamation law intended to silence critics. In September, he denied claims by Al Jazeera, a Qatari-based broadcaster, that a $ 1.5 billion money laundering network was operating in the Maldives with the blessings of the government.
In the same month, he also dismissed criticism from the Commonwealth, a group of 52 countries with links to Britain, which accused him of interfering with the judiciary and weakening the countrys fragile democratic institutions. The Maldives quit the London-based organization in October.
Amnesty International, a human rights watchdog, said that oppression has since worsened, including attacks on journalists, raids on media premises, and growing threats against political activists. Nasheed told an Indian newspaper in March that 1,700 anti-government activists are either under threat, on trial, or in jail for peaceful activism.
The political uncertainty in the Maldives contrasts sharply with hopes that the majority Muslim country would prosper after the 2008 election. However, Nasheeds term was destabilized by Gayoom, who used his allies in the military, judiciary and bureaucracy to undermine the elected president, according to Nasheeds allies. Nasheed quit before the end of his term, and later lost a 2013 presidential election to Yameen in a controversial run-off.
The political uncertainty caused by Yameens autocratic rule has been complicated by a growing adherence within the Sunni Muslim population to the conservative Salafi and Wahabi forms of Islam, supported by cash transfers from Saudi Arabia. The Salafi influence is rampant because of the petrodollar funding, said Imtiaz Ahmed, executive director of the Regional Center for Strategic Studies, an independent think tank based in Colombo.
This radicalization has alarmed the United Nations and other international institutions. Security analysts have warned that the country has become a recruiting ground for so-called Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. Estimates of the number of Maldivians fighting with ISIS in the Middle East range from 100 to 200 -- a relatively high proportion of the population of just 400,000 people, who live on 200 of the countrys 1,192 islands. The Maldives is the second largest contributor of fighters, relative to population, said Ahmed, who was part of an U.N.-supported team that studied Islamic radicalization in the Maldives.
Yameen has also faced criticism of alleged government plans to endorse a $10 billion Saudi Arabian investment on an atoll called Faafu. In late March, a Maldivian television channel broadcast a leaked audio clip in which a PPM parliamentarian, and Yameen loyalist, said that the Maldivian constitution had been amended in 2015 to permit Saudi Arabian investors to buy land. The Yameen administration and the Saudi Arabian government have denied the reported deal.
Maldivians will have an opportunity to register their views in local council elections scheduled for May -- although the poll has been postponed three times already as Yameen struggles to find sufficient political loyalists to field as candidates of his party.
The parliamentary revolt led by Gayoom has made that task harder as more governing party lawmakers switch their loyalties. With a further impeachment motion to be presented in parliament against the speaker, Yameen could yet face a costly political price for his actions against his half-brother. - Nikkei Asian Review

Pondy govt to secure release of fishermen arrested for drug trafficking
Puducherry government yesterday assured that it would seek the Centres intervention to secure the release of six fishermen from Puducherry, arrested recently by the Sri Lankan Navy on drug trafficking charges. The assurance was given by Puducherry Agriculture Minister R. Kamalakannan when he met the fishermen of 11 hamlets of the region, who are on an indefinite strike since April 3, condemning the arrest of their colleagues. Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy had urged the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka to take steps to secure the release of the fishermen, he said and appealed to the protesters to suspend their agitation and resume fishing. The Chief Minister has proceeded to New Delhi...He has planned to meet the Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister and will take up this issue with them, he told the family members of the arrested fishermen.
The kin have claimed that the six were innocents and alleged foul play by the Lankan Naval personnel.
On April 2, the Navy arrested six Karaikal fishermen off Neduntheevu for allegedly possessing 13.5 kg of cocaine. -PTI

Premaranjith Tilakaratne: The forgotten rebel
When way back in 1963 the Ceylon Civil Service was abolished and replaced by the Ceylon (later Sri Lanka) Administrative Service, two things happened. The first, quite obviously, was a shift from the elitist, Anglophile mentality that the Civil Service (being a product of colonialism) had pandered to. The second was the emancipation of a horde of artistes who, thanks to a more nationalised administrative service, were able to balance their work and their other lives well.
Of these artistes, a great many were playwrights and actors. Henry Jayasena is probably the name that crops up at once, while among our actors Tony Ranasinghe figures in significantly. Because of the security provided for them by a more amenable government, they were able to experiment and take on the mantle that Sarachchandra and his golayas had secured for themselves in our Universities. Neither Jayasena (who stood for a hybridised, semi-operatic theatre) nor Ranasinghe (who was a leading member of Sugathapala de Silvas troupe) were products of those Universities, which probably brought about a clash or conflict between these two meandering streams.
Exquisite handling
To make matters more complicated, both Jayasena and de Silva stood for a theatre driven by dialogues: even Jayasena, for all his exquisite handling of decor and music, could not really think beyond the lofty soliloquies that garland much of his work. For that reason, a playwright who could do what was then considered implausible  challenge Sarachchandras stylised theatre while privileging the visual element  had to come. That playwright was Premaranjith Tilakaratne, the star of this weeks column.
Before I sketch out his biography, a broad sweep of his work is called for. Premaranjith was not a revolutionist in the theatre. He wasnt interested in being one anyway. His first play, Vaguru Bima, was staged in 1963. They were followed by a veritable torrent: Wahalak Nethi Geyak (1964), Thoththa Baba (1965), Ammai Appai (1966), Kontare (1967), Julie (1977), and a novel take on a Nurti tragedy, Sri Wickrema (staged during J. R. Jayewardenes presidency).
When I quizzed him about Sri Wickrema, the man talked not of the play, but of the man who patronised Tower Hall that day: Jayewardene was literally a cultured man. He knew Nurti and had seen Nurti plays as a young man. In my day, however, there was a culture of dismissing that kind of theatre as third rate and second hand. What its detractors missed out, which the then president did not, was that culture is a sum total of seemingly disparate visuals and words. You cant privilege one over another. More often than not, the dialogues-based plays that had been in the vogue since the sixties had monopolised the industry. That is why I never pandered to this convenient myth where words and verbose dialogues were considered superior to decor and music.
Visual potential
The overarching motif that defines Premaranjiths work then (and I can only conjecture, given that I havent seen them firsthand) is a commitment to the visual potential of the theatre. He confirmed this for me when he told me of an encounter he had with Shelton Premaratne, who composed the music for his most expensive work, Kontare (an adaptation of West Side Story):
I realised at the inception that the challenge and in fact the thrust of the play would have to be its music. I sought out influence from Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, and contemporary popular music, before coming up with the lyrics for the songs in it. Those songs would guide the story, so I attended to them meticulously. Afterwards, when I explained to Shelton as to how they would be played out, all he had to tell me was, Prem, to be honest youve done everything. I dont really have much to do here. It was a compliment, of course.
And in a big sense, that compliment echoes the mans upbringing. He was born in Ratnapura in 1937, educated initially at Sri Palee College in Horana (which had been structured along the lines of Tagores Shanthiniketan) and later at Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya. Apparently classes at Sri Palee ran on Saturday and halted only on Sundays and Wednesdays. That proved to be an obstacle for us, because it was at that school that we fell in love with the movies.
Overblown dialogues
Schools are remembered for certain memories and these include playing hooky. Given the schedule at Sri Palee, Premaranjith and his friends would resort to that on Saturdays, when theyd skip classes for the 10.30 show. Not that it had been easy, of course: his father (a strict iskole mahaththaya) was opposed to films on principle. Predictably, the son rebelled against the father. While much invective would have flowed, however, he remembers him with affection for me: He taught me much about respect, honour, dignity, and responsibility.
Incidentally it was his father who had entranced Premaranjith to the theatre. He was a big admirer of Sirisena Wimalaweera. Wimalaweera had a penchant for overblown dialogues, which were aligned with the religious parables he went for. I wasnt very religious as a child, which explains why I was more intrigued by the visuals than the stories in them. In any case, I continued to rebel against my father and patronise the cinema. I had grown enamoured of Bollywood, especially the films of Bimal Roy. Needless to say, like Wimalaweeras work these films attracted him for the mise-en-scne and music: I dont have a good memory for dialogues.
There was a man he befriended at his next school, Dharmapala, who had such a memory. That man was Tissa Abeysekara, against whom Premaranjith comes out as an artiste of a different mould. While I will not delve into his friendship with Abeysekara, I will point out that while the man (later to become our foremost scriptwriter) could and did recite the words and dialogues in a film they would see effortlessly, for his friend what came out more discernibly in a work of art was its sense of style. To be honest, I was a critic of Tissas work, barring his dialogues and scripts. We consequently clashed, sometimes over our conceptions of art and sometimes over politics. But through it all, we remained the best of friends until his passing away.
Ape Kattiya
Unlike most of his contemporaries, Tilakaratne never became a professional artiste. How I got into scripting and directing plays is interesting, he confesses, Wickrema Bogoda, whom Id befriended at Dharmapala, went to watch a couple of rehearsals of Sugathapala de Silvas Boarding Karayo with me. Now Bogoda would later join Ape Kattiya, but before that, having seeing the play, I was enchanted by the idea of striking my own path.
Theres much more than this which hes recounted for us, in his biography (published recently by Surasa) Durganthaya, including the inevitable clashes he had with Sugathapala: He knew what he was doing. I differed from him. Because he didnt like that, given the cult that had grown around him, we agreed to disagree.
Perhaps its a result of all his encounters, wild and divergent as they are, but I sense a hard to infer, harder to solidify character in the man. He is a nationalist, but he spurns tradition. When I talk with him about our jathaka canon, for instance, he is quick to exclaim, Whats there in them that merit attention, as a literature When I dwell on our epics, he is quick to retort, We dont have epics here, only episodes. In this respect, he resists categorisation, which is probably why the best way to sum him would be to differentiate him from the kind of theatre that BOTH Sarachchandra AND Sarachchandras rivals represented. I belong to no camp, he might as well have told me.
Where is Premaranjith Tilakaratne today He lives in Malabe, near Talahena, with his son. People have (I am sorry to say) forgotten him. That reflects badly on us, given his deteriorating (physical) condition (for since of late, he has not been in good health), but that also reflects badly on him.
In short, he remains a forgotten rebel, forgotten not because his work was never re-staged despite the popularity they enjoyed (in particular, Kontare) but because, given his distaste for popularity and populism, he shirked the kind of coverage his contemporaries received from the press. There is a reason, after all, why Lionel Ranwala is remembered and not Piyasiri Wijeratne and W. B. Makuloluwa, or why Amaradeva and Khemadasa are remembered and not Lionel Algama and Shelton Premaratne. The fault, as always, isnt with those who got the popularity they deserved, but rather with those who forget the other giants as deserving of that popularity they never got.

A relief of sorts
The move by the government to offer a measure of relief to the consumers, for the New Year, by way of a subsidized package of food items is to be commended. According to Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, a sack of essential items will be offered to consumers at Rs. 975 although the value will be Rs. 1,515. Doing the Pettah rounds on Sunday in the company of two fellow parliamentarian of the UNP to observe the price situation, ahead of the New Year, Minister Karunanayake said a host of items which are in common use by the ordinary consumer will be contained in the New Year relief package such as rice, sugar B'onions, dhal, potatoes sprats, canned fish, chillies etc. One million sacks will be distributed costing Rs. 540 million, with the price difference to be borne by the Finance Ministry.
It has to be conceded that prices of certain essential items had gone through the roof in recent times despite the best efforts of the government to keep prices under check. Hence the Finance Ministry's efforts to ensure that the consumer will not be fleeced, at least during the festive season (the relief package will be available until April 20), is praiseworthy indeed. One million packages will no doubt reach a wider section of the populace and will cover the areas where the New Year is traditionally celebrated in the far flung villages. There is one snag though. The Minister must ensure that unscrupulous traders don't cash in on the situation, because the temptation will be great for such traders to purchase the sacks in bulk and resell the items at the higher price. Therefore the Ministry should put in place a foolproof method so that the consumers will once again not be fleeced. The best way to ensure this is to limit one sack per family, although the traders could still get a number of families to pool their take and sell the items with a profit. Therefore the Consumer Protection Authority should be ordered to be vigilant lest the government's efforts to provide relief to the masses during the New Year will come a cropper.
It is good that the Minister also included the supermarkets in his itinerary because certain supermarkets sell items above the stipulated prices, naturally, to offset the huge overheads. These supermarkets should be kept in check lest the Minister's much touted price reduction will be brought to naught by such action. Of course, elements in the Joint Opposition, as usual, are mocking at the minister's efforts citing the high prices of coconuts and rice, although certain varieties have come down to normal. They, however do not talk about the low prices of other goods, such as milk power, nor, that of essential drugs, some of which are being sold at ridiculously low prices.
By and large, the government's move to afford some form of relief to the consumer during the festive season should be appreciated although long term solutions have to be found to jeep the prices of essential items in check on the long run.
The President's assurance
President Maithripala Sirisena's assurance that he will not interfere in judicial appointments is to be welcomed. According to an English daily he has assured National Unity Alliance Leader Azath Salley that he would not permit political interference in the appointment of the new President of the Court of Appeal. This, after Salley pointed out that the office of the Chief Justice had been compelled to appoint a Justice, junior in rank, to the Constitutional Council over the heads of two other senior judges. There was also the recent controversy over the appointment of a High Court judge, allegedly due to political interference, by passing a senior judicial officer, which even provoked a confrontation between the BASL, the Association of Judicial Officers and the Judicial Services Commission.
Any controversy that involves the judiciary, needless to say, undermines the public confidence in the justice system, making it an object of derision, like how the country's legislature is being viewed today. Hence, all measures should be taken to avoid such controversies. The country's judiciary has undergone vicissitudes under all governments, the most serious instance being when homes of judges were stoned after the ruling a Bench gave was not to the liking of the rulers of the day. For the first time in the country's judicial history a lady Chief Justice, no less, was impeached by a tribunal handpicked by the former ruler for that very purpose, and, black flags were hoisted in the hallowed precincts of the country's highest court - a black day indeed for the judiciary. If that was not enough the public were treated to the spectacle of pirith nool being tied on the hand of the impeached CJ within the court premises.
The President should not only ensure there is no political interference in the appointment of judges, he should also see to it that carrots are not dangled before judicial officers in the form of Adviser or Ambassador posts, as in the past, that went onto taint the country's judiciary.

SAGT to mediate with Trade Unions
South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) Chief Executive Officer, Erwin Haaze says that they are extremely dismayed at the negative impact of the current trade union action.
For nearly a week now terminal operations at South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) continue to be well below the world class standards we deliver to our customers.
This Best in class operational performance has attracted multiple independent globally recognized best practice awards consecutively in the last two years.
The disruption is influenced by worker disgruntlement over the annual bonus.
We are extremely dismayed at the negative impact this action has caused our customers.
The bonus was paid last week in accordance with the collective agreement (CA) which was concluded only about six months ago.
The bonus structure payment represents a number of months salary and was the highest paid in SAGTs history to date.
The company has taken a stand against this unjustified and illegal disruption of holding the company to ransom. Although this could mean that there is no quick solution, we are doing our utmost to bring resolution as soon as possible by exploring other options including mediation also. We are in close operational collaboration with the two other terminals in the Port of Colombo, who have in turn extended their fullest support in ensuring minimal impact to the ports customers.

Dasun Shanaka smashed a superb century  121 not out off 95 balls with seven sixes and seven fours as Galle routed Colombo by 188 runs in their Super Provincial limited-over match played at CCC grounds yesterday.
Shanakas brilliant knock coupled with Dimuth Karunaratnes innings of 86 saw Galle winning the toss and batting first rattle off an impressive 302-4 in 49 overs.
Lahiru Madushanka  
Colombo in their reply collapsed in a heap to be bowled out for 114 with left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara causing the damage taking five wickets for 29 runs after Suranga Lakmal had initiated the breakthrough with two wickets.
In the other match played at Colts grounds Kandy inspired by a century from skipper Chamara Kapugedera beat Dambulla by 19 runs.
Kapugedera came to his teams rescue when they had lost half the side for 90 to enable them to end up with a final total of 336-7.
The two partnerships that turned the match was between Kapugedera and Lahiru Madushanka who put on 88 for the seventh wicket and an unbroken stand of 116 for the eighth wicket by Madushanka and Ramith Rambukwella.

Rambukwella provided the innings with a late spurt with a cameo knock of 52 not out off 26 balls that included five sixes and two fours.
Dambullas run chase was inspired by Kusal Mendis and Hiran Cooray who put on 114 for the third wicket but they lost wickets regularly and were eventually dismissed for 317 in the 49th over.
Mendis made 77 off 66 balls with three sixes and eight fours and Cooray scored 109 off 119 balls with 10 fours and three sixes.

The biggest ever crowd to a May Day Rally in Sri Lanka will participate at the forthcoming SLFP May Day rally in Kandy, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a meeting that followed the opening of the CWE outlet at Barawakubuka.
The minister said Dulles Alahapperuma had said 200,000 people will be brought to Galle Face to show their strength. It will be a dream, he said.
Those who left the SLFP and formed new parties never succeeded and they were thrown to the dustbin by the people so that they will not raise their heads once again, he said.
The minister said 50 CWE retail outlets will be opened before the end of the New Year festive season to enable the people to purchase consumer items at low prices.
Black marketeers who ruthlessly harass and fleece the consumers should be brought to book and dealt with severely, he said.
The minister said the joint opposition is trying its best to mislead people by spreading false rumours.
The people of the country are aware that the far-sighted policies of the President and the Prime Minister will bring prosperity to the country.

Spiritual leaders instrumental in reconciliation process: President
President Maithripala Sirisena says spiritual leaders are the real messengers who connect the hearts of the people and strengthen reconciliation as wished by every religious philosophy.
He was speaking at the cultural programme, Erabadu Vasantham, dedicated to enhance ethnic and religious reconciliation, held at Singakkuliya, Dankotuwa on Sunday. A programme was also organised to remember the service of the late Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody in line with the cultural event.
He said the guidance for reconciliation is witnessed in Thripitaka, Bible, Quran and Bhagavad-Gita.
The President highlighted that Buddhist monks and all other priests belonging to Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity are expected to make use of the norms of the great teachings.
Speaking further, the President said the country was built upon on peace and reconciliation among different communities from the ancient times.
Sri Lankan nation should come together as a strong human wall while consolidating peace and harmony among different ethnic communities at the present context, the President said.
He explained that though some elements would try to insult the term reconciliation, Sri Lankas future will only be fruitful if the term would be given the true meaning and implement it in the society realistically.
The President recalled the services of legendary artiste Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody, who earned the hearts of people from all walks of the life in Sri Lanka.
He presented a token of appreciation in the memory of Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody to a senior member of his family Winifrida Jayakody.
The Maha Sanga led by Chief Prelate Most Ven. Iththapane Dhammalankara Thera, Christian and Catholic priest including former Archbishop Rt. Rev. Oswald Gomis, Hindu priests, Ministers Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, North-Western Province Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dasanayake, Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando, and Sarasavi Arts Association President Ananda Karunarathna were present.

Isnt it strange that many years ago, in a far off land, a poet called Chaucer wrote these famous lines in his Canterbury Tales Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote/The droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote, capturing the very essence of what we are experiencing at this very moment, in our island nation in the 21st century.
The heat of March is thankfully over. For most of us, the best days of our lives lie ahead; Sunshine and showers, laughter and presents. April, undoubtedly is the most beautiful month of the year and therefore the best time to pay homage to the natural elements; the sun, the moon and the rain gods.
Spring is in the air, the Koha, keeps reminding us every few seconds. The long, red petals of Erabadu make you wonder if they are the proverbial fires of spring. The kaju and jambu trees are heavy with fruits. Butterflies waltz to the orchestra of the magpies. Jasmines invite the two-winged dancers to a feast. The whole world seems to be rejuvenated making you mutter to yourself Chaucers lines, over and over.
New Year customs
Closer to home, Martin Wickramasinghe described in vivid details in Gamperaliya (the extract is from the English translation titled Uprooted) the New Year customs in the South during the early 20th century. Not so long ago, at the beginning of the 20th century, a few days before the New Year the village potter used to bring a pingo load of clay pots and pans to each of the three or four leading families in the village, so wrote the sage of Koggala. On New Years day as the auspicious time drew near the members of the family sat on reed mats, round a white cloth spread on the floor of the hall. The servants, male and female, knelt on the floor beside them. Each had his serving of milk rice on a square of singed plantain leaf, placed before him on the white cloth. When the auspicious moment arrived they all started to eat.
Celebrations
Elsewhere, in the country too there were preparations to celebrate the transition of the sun from the sign of Pisces to the sign of Aries beginning a new solar year. The villagers in the Eastern province would get ready to welcome the new year from as early as February when the best vegetables in the Chena like the largest pumpkin and the best brinjals were kept aside till April.
The beginning of April would find the villagers going in search of the clay needed to apply on the floor and stacking up mountains of firewood to be used during the New Year.
It is said, that on New Years day, observing auspicious times would differ from province to province. Unlike the villagers in the southern province villagers in the Eastern province did not observe specific auspicious times on the day of the New Year. To them the entire day was auspicious. On New Years day the women would wake up early in the morning and make their way to the well, sprinkle a handful of flowers on the water, worship the well three times and worship the earth three times before drawing the first bucket of water. When they filled the kettle to boil the water, they would fill it to the brim unlike on other days when only the necessary amount of water was put into the kettle. All the kitchen utensils would be washed and stacked in one corner of the kitchen, covered with a white cloth; on this day the pots and pans were given a well-earned rest.
The most popular places in the village during April are the trees which have massive swings hanging from their boughs. But the swings too differ from village to village. Some villagers built massive swings, wide enough to carry at least four or five adults at a time which would be hung on the branches of a tree with leather straps. After finishing their daily chores the women would gather at the swing as the sunlight faded from the sky, and take turns to sway too and fro to the rhythm of the Onchili Waram, till the early hours of the morning.
The women also spend many an enjoyable hour playing age old rhymes like Dontha Babakkata Denna Deyak Natha... on the raban. They even enjoy the strenuous task of pounding the rice to make sweetmeats by bringing the pestles and the mortars into one house and taking turns to pound the rice into flour. Soon the time comes to watch the white mixtures of flour turn into delicious kevum, kokis, aluwa and athiraha.
In the past, these sweetmeats were made using the rice from the newly harvested paddy fields. According to the writer and journalist Thimbiriyagama Bandara, in the past, before the New Year celebrations our ancestors had observed the harvest festival (Aluth Sahal Mangallaya). It was only after the newly harvested rice was offered to the deity, to the priests at the temple, and distributed among the neighbours that the rice was used for making sweetmeats for the New Year. The New Year, therefore, is a celebration of joy after the harvest is reaped, observes Bandara.
Not too late
Even though these farming traditions are no longer with us, it is surely not too late yet to find some cowries and an old coconut shell to begin playing that ancient game of chance called Panchi or to throw a rope over a rafter in the roof to make a swing and to wonder if they too have symbolic meanings attached to them. Yes, as with almost everything associated with the New Year, according to Prof. Vinnie Vitharana the cowrie is a symbol of procreation; the swing represents the sun, which also swings from the east to the west, and the hearth, which is lit at an auspicious time, by the woman of the house, facing a prescribed direction, symbolizes the centre of life and nourishment in the household.
Today, we may indeed not be farmers, we may not be able to interact with Mother Nature in the same way our ancestors did, but we cannot deny the spirit of spring. It is still with us. It is still there in the warmth of the early morning sun, in the azure skies, in the orchestra of the birds, and in the dew drops on a petal of jasmine. So, let the spirits of spring enter your heart.
May the year ahead be filled with joy and good health and dreams that come true.

Sri Lanka regaining power in EU seafood market
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the government is set on a path of pursuing its former position in the EU fish market.
We had the power of being able to determine fish prices in the EU market, which we have lost to Maldives on account of the EU ban on Sri Lankan fish exports, the minister said.
The European Commission imposed a ban on Sri Lankan seafood exports in 2014 stating for failing to make credible progress towards fighting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
The ban lasted for 15 months until EU lifted it in June 2016 following intervention by the leadership of the present government. Amaraweera said, the ban now being lifted, they are determined to take back its former place in the EU. Sri Lanka was the second biggest fish exporter to the European Union.
We are going to regain the power we once had over pricing of fish in the EU market from Maldives within the next two to three years, Amaraweera said.

Suren Cooke Agencies  organizes vector  control campaign
Suren Cooke Agencies, a pioneer in making the community a safer place to live, organized a vector control campaign in several rural areas, to help people get relief from mosquitoes.
Suren Cooke Agencies has always been in the forefront of the vector control industry and takes great pride in working on corporate social responsibility projects such as these.
Dengue is the most deadly mosquito-borne viral disease, especially confronting countries located within the equatorial region, having high temperature. Rainfall and humidity, those are conducive for mosquito breeding and migration that causes extensive transmission of the disease.
Suren Cooke Agencies, the masters when it comes to pest management industry in the country, extended their support to the  News1st Gammadda initiative, in Thamaraville, Barathikulam, Faizal Nagar and Idiman 4th Div areas in Kinniya, Trincomalee, to carry out a successful vector control campaign using their latest equipment.The two-day programme covered 14 schools in the four villages.
Suren Cooke Agencies used their latest product Pulsfog High out Put Thermal Fogging Machines during the campaign, a method which proved to be an effective way of eradicating mosquitoes from a neighborhood when a large area is concerned without undue harm to the environment.
Suren Cooke Agencies works closely with government institutions to train the staff on the proper usage of the Pulsfog Thermal Fogging Machines in their war against the deadly mosquitoes.
Commenting on new advancements in vector control, founder of Suren Cooke Agencies, Cooke said that they are currently in the process of further testing the one of the latest products, the Sky Spray 1000 Copter which will further reduce the time and manpower needed for such campaigns.
If you don't keep innovating, you cannot make a real change and there is always a better way, Cooke said.

Tales strewn across a detour
Instead of reflecting just as words on their reading-glasses, ManjulaWediwardena is back in the readers minds and thoughts with his third collection of short stories named Beauty of viciousness and other stories from Rathmalana. The book is the first collection of a planned series of short stories based on Rathmalana, the city that Wediwardena lived and grew up.
Wediwardena has published his second collection of short stories called Saint Judas eleven years after the banning of his maiden collection of short stories Mary named Maria in 2000. Those who had an opportunity to read Judas will definitely look for this new collection of viciousness with hidden beauty. This piece of observation is on Wediwardenas writing style of short stories in his new collection.
According to Tolstoy, All great literature is one of two stories; a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town. Wediwardena as a writer, poet and a journalist adds value to that quote by going on various journeys in life as a man from town and sharing his stories with strangers coming to town.
Outdated definitions
Keeping Manjula Wediwardenas new short story collection on my desk with a cup of coffee (now cold) waiting to giveaway the first sip, Im hesitant to agree with outdated definitions such as A short story should be a short piece of fiction that can be read in one sitting (Edgar Allan Poe). Though Wediwardenas stories can be read in one sitting, the hardest is to avoid the spaces and voids he naturally creates in-between his lines. Those traps are formed for some readers to just topple, for some to sink and for some to dive in. There is no escape from them. Whoever reads Wediwardenas stories will topple, sink or choose to dive into those emotional, rational and ideological spaces. Therefore, an effective reader going through Wediwardenas short stories once, would find them forcing him or her to re-read.
Judas Iscariot is known for the kiss and betrayal of Jesus to the Sanhedrin for thirty silver coins. His name is generally considered as a synonym for betrayal or treason. Being a writer famous for naming his books with controversial titles, Wediwardena shows the saint in Judas in his second collection of short stories (Saint Judas). The short story titled Saint Judas implanted a new lens in the readers inner eye to take a sensible tour through history and philosophy. Following the same, the title of Wediwardenas new collection is also conveying messages, releasing signals and radiations through to the conscience of conscious human beings, inviting them to see some beauty in viciousness without pretending to be viciously beautiful.
Writers move to the city from distant villages to make their dreams come true. Then they start to write blaming the city and embroidering what they miss in the village. What they pretend to forget is the place on which they keep their feet steady while creating such masterpieces. Wediwardena loves the brimstone on which he was born and embraces its viciousness, seeing its underlying beauty of humanity. As Garcia Marquez once said, a true writer (friend) is the one who holds your hand and touches your heart, Wediwardena stretches both his hands out to the readers to hold and walk with him through six short stories, tapping on their minds opening the door to their true sanity.
Manipulated spelling
The collection reassures Wediwardenas unique writing style and its ability to caress the hidden softness within corruption and cruelty. Carefully picked structure, theme and language of each story imply his shrewdness in literature. Best example is the manipulated spelling of the title. Throughout the book he explores humanity affected by the vicious cycles of power, poverty, love and hatred. When describing his writing style of short stories, quoting the phrase smile with tears is not an exaggeration because of his unique way of twisting thoughts and endings of each story. When one of his stories ends in a hilarious but also vicious kind of way, another story will end with continuing endings. Wediwardena is incredibly capable of twisting thoughts and behaviour of his characters and play with readers expectations of the story. Finally he surprises the reader with something utterly unexpected and let them shut the book with a million of thoughts about the story they just read.
Wediwardena discusses how women are abused through love and relationships in any society. An appreciable fact in his style of writing is that he never uses his ink, paper and time to poke directly on the readers eyeballs. He blows a single grain of dust into their intuition and let it grow as a pearl, hurting and stirring their thoughts, directing them to look at the society through their inner eyes. Readers can agree or disagree with this fact after reading Until tonight turns into dawn and Beauty of Viciousness.
Wediwardena explains that there is no difference between a woman in the city and a woman from village in his first short story.
Now, I can only see her feet that are polished and flattened by wearing high-heels. Even though she wears high heels as a lady from town, the whole story of a womans destiny is written in just a handful of words. Reading through the pages and diving into the voids between lines the reader realises that a womans destiny never changes regardless of what they wear (high-heals, flats or nothing) or where they live (village or town).
Single thread
Further, there is a beautiful detailed explanation of a night outside the protagonists house in this particular story. Someone can argue that it is not relevant as this is a short story. But, just as Tolstoys short stories, Wediwardenas stories are interlaced with a single thread. An omission of just one word or even a single punctuation mark of his paragraphs will cause the whole story to collapse. The explanation of the night in this story symbolises the guilt that the writer feels (and its beauty) when leaving his home to see his two mistresses (a mother and daughter) just the night before his wedding. The amazing ending of this story happens with twisted thoughts and symbols.
Experimental way
Meeting Adam invites readers to be rational to look back on Sri Lankan history as well as biblical history and rethink. Wediwardena consciously gifts the whole story through some intoxicated thoughts of a doped young man who imagines that he was a butterfly. The storys end is structured in a very unique and experimental way which I chose not to explain here and kill the excitement of reading it in full.
He stopped sucking on his dummy reveals another side of the society which is suppressed and kept a secret by the authorities as well as the corrupted intellectuals exploiting their own professions. The writer explains how has the system been adjusted, twisted, turned and bent in order to justify their abusive actions and what had lead them into such situations. Skilfully addressing all layers of the society, Wediwardena has not forgotten to inject the corruptions within the cultural as well as traditional circles into this story.
Forte of Wediwardenas poetic fictions is the hidden morals in those so-called voids he creates between lines. Even if a reader consciously leaps over one void, he or she would accidentally topple into another within the same story. The touch of a rebels skinny hand is one example. The touch of a rebels skinny hand holds the readers hand to walk a rebellious hike into the insurgent period in Sri Lanka which had never seen a glorious ending. It explains how the innocent youth of the country had been lead into disasters through fake personalities and socio-political structures. This story knocks on the older generations heart and forces to question themselves of their actions and decisions made in their youth. It also exhibits how the innocence of young age is taken for granted by the tainted political movements even today.
Target straight
As a journalist, poet and a writer, Manjula Wediwardena can be considered as the most proclaimed explorer of literature in Sri Lanka during the past two decades. Not only he valiantly creates his own poetic versions of Sinhala words but also uses them to hit the target straight, without the slightest mistake. For such a skill he could be called as The sniper of words (in my personal opinion). His newly created and used words are then followed by the young generation of poets and writers (wisely as well as blindly).
Wediwardenas success is obviously backed by his voyages through various walks of life as a true human being who stands by his words and believes in his actions. When the events were lining up to put a full stop to his excursions, Wediwardena had flung himself in the air to fly and land on somewhere else in the world which had eventually granted him a pass to explore the world literature. Though he lives oceans apart, Sri Lankan literature is still fortunate to be nurtured by his contributions.
The interlacing of themes, style and literature of this new book of short stories can be considered as something that is capable of marking a turning point in the history of Sri Lankan short story.

Toppling govt. not an option with no better alternative: Anura Kumara
There is no point in toppling the government as there is no better alternative, said JVP leader and Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He said one has to think as to who they would bring into power after toppling this government. He added that all had always attempted to topple governments in power. The JVP leader made these observations yesterday in response to a question raised by the media at a press conference held at the JVP Political Head Office in Pelawatta, Battaramulla in connection with a statement made by the GMOA that they would topple the government within three months.
If there is no alternative, it is better to develop a group to take over power rather than toppling the government, Dissanayke said. So we are in the process of educating and directing the public to develop an alternative group to take over the government.
When questioned by the media on the Joint Oppositions (JO) prediction of bringing two million people to the May Day rally at Galle Face, Dissanayake said it was better to inform the Navy to provide security at Galle Face as the drunkard participants would fall into the sea and drown.
However, if we assume if one bus transports 50 participants to the JO May Day rally, it will need 40,000 buses to transport the two million people, Dissanayake added . But there are only 21,000 buses in the country, both public and private. So these predictions have no basis, he added.
JVP Parliamentarian Dr Nalinda Jayatissa also participated in the press conference.

New York:The United States, Mexico and Canada on Monday announced a joint bid to stage the 2026 World Cup, aiming to become the first three-way co-hosts in the history of FIFAs showpiece tournament.
US Soccer Federation chief Sunil Gulati, who announced the bid in New York with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts, insisted they had the full backing of President Donald Trump, despite the US leaders rocky relations with Mexico.
Gulati said 60 of the tournaments matches would be staged in the United States, with Canada and Mexico hosting 10 games each. The United States would host all knockout games from the quarter-finals onwards, he added.
He played down the possibility that politics could hamper the bid, emphasising that Trump was especially pleased with Mexicos involvement.
The president of the US is fully supportive... We are not at all concerned at some of the concerns that some people may raise, Gulati said.
Trump was elected last year after a campaign marked by rhetoric against Mexico, vowing to build a wall to keep out illegal immigrants he branded criminals and rapists.
The joint bid will start as the heavy early favorite in the race, despite United States prosecutors leading the probe into football corruption which rocked the sport in 2015 and led to the downfall of former FIFA supremo Sepp Blatter.
A bid from the North America region for 2026 had long been regarded as inevitable by FIFA watchers. That sense of certainty hardened last year, when FIFAs council ruled that neither Europe nor Asia would be eligible to run for the 2026 tournament on the grounds that the regions are hosting the next two World Cups. Russia is hosting the 2018 finals, followed by Qatar in 2022.
With Europe and Asia ineligible, CONCACAF could in theory face potential competition from the Africa, South America and Oceania regional confederations.
US soccer officials had been publicly coy about the possibility of a future World Cup bid since the country lost out to Qatar in the battle for the 2022 tournament at a corruption-tarnished vote in Zurich in 2010.
However the prospect of a fresh American bid gathered momentum in 2014 after the World Cup in Brazil.
That campaign captured the imagination of US sports fans, with huge crowds attending public screenings of games at cities across the country.
The countrys club game is also booming, with record numbers attending Major League Soccer games in 2016.
The United States also burnished its credentials as a major tournament host with last years 16-team Copa America Centenario.
The United States first hosted the World Cup in 1994, staging a commercially successful 24-team tournament that played out to packed stadia.
The 1994 tournament remains the most attended World Cup in history, with just over 3.5 million fans flocking to its 52 games, an average of 68,991 per match.
Mexico has hosted the World Cup twice before -- the 1970 finals won by a Pele-inspired Brazil and the 1986 tournament won by an Argentina team led by Diego Maradona.
Canada, who have only made one World Cup appearance when they were eliminated in the first round of the 1986 finals, has never hosted the tournament.
However Canada earned plaudits for its staging of the Womens World Cup in 2015, which was won by the United States in the final in Vancouver. Under FIFA plans for its expanded 48-team World Cup, CONCACAF is awarded six berths. Gulati indicated that officials expected all three host nations to be granted places.
There has never been a World Cup where the host countries have not been qualified, Gulati said.
A tournament in North America is also likely to be attractive to FIFA for solid public relations reasons.
With dozens of modern, tournament-ready venues to choose from, there is little risk of stadiums being left to rot as white elephants following the event, a problem which has embroiled grounds used at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.
We have the luxury of having stadiums that already exist, Gulati stated. The thought of building sports facilities that dont have a long-term use is not particularly inviting for anyone.AFP

US strike wiped out fifth of Syrian President Assads air force
SYRIA: The US strike on a Syrian air base destroyed a fifth of the Damascus regimes remaining warplanes, Pentagon chief Jim Mattis said yesterday as Washington fired a fresh salvo of warnings at President Bashar al-Assad.
The public assessment of Fridays missile strike and the forceful rhetoric came as G7 ministers met in Italy to send a clear and coordinated message to Russia over its support for Damascus.
The United States on Friday blasted 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air base near Homs, which the Pentagon said Assads jets had used to launch a deadly chemical attack on rebel-held Idlib province.
The United States will not passively stand by while Assad murders innocent people with chemical weapons, which are prohibited by international law and which were declared destroyed, Mattis said in a statement, noting that 20 per cent of Assads operational aircraft were destroyed.
The Syrian government would be ill-advised ever again to use chemical weapons, he added.
Mattiss warning came as White House spokesman Sean Spicer appeared to lower the threshold for new US action against Assad to include barrel bombs, a crude yet hugely destructive weapon of choice for the Syrian leader.
If you gas a baby or drop a barrel bomb onto innocent people, you will see a response from President Donald Trump, Spicer said.
But US officials later walked back Spicers remarks.
Nothing has changed in our posture, a senior administration official said.
As the president has repeatedly made clear, he will not be telegraphing his military responses, the official said.
Trump discussed Syria during separate telephone calls yesterday with British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
May and Merkel expressed support for the action of the United States and agreed with President Trump on the importance of holding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accountable, the White House said in a statement.
Downing Street said Trump and May had agreed that a window of opportunity now exists in which to persuade Russia that its alliance with Assad is no longer in its strategic interest.
The two leaders were looking to US Secretary of State Rex Tillersons trip to Moscow this week as an opportunity to lay the groundwork for a lasting political settlement, Mays office said.
Iran and North Korea have slammed Washingtons retaliation and put it on a direct diplomatic collision course with Moscow, where Tillerson heads today for talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
Johnson on yesterday called on Moscow to do everything possible to bring about a political settlement in Syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the pressing task for the G7 was to find a political solution, a political transition in Syria, particularly if the West wanted to triumph over the Islamic State group.
Italy arranged a last-minute meeting for today between the G7 ministers and their counterparts from Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
Italian media said the aim was to avert a dangerous military escalation.
Japans Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said he told Tillerson that Tokyo supports the US in its push to deter the spread and use of chemical weapons, and discussed the pressing North Korean nuclear threat. - AFP

Wells Fargo claws back another $75m from former bosses
Wells Fargo has clawed back a further $75m (60.3m) from two former executives in the wake of a fake accounts scandal.
Former boss John Stumpf will give back $28m, while Carrie Tolstedt will lose share options worth $47m.
Last year it emerged staff at the bank had set up two million deposit and credit card accounts in customers' names without their approval. The US bank was accused of "widespread illegal activity" and fined.
Both Stumpf, who was chief executive at the time, and Tolstedt, who ran the the Community Bank division responsible for the illegal activities, resigned over the affair.
The latest clawbacks were announced as the bank published a 110-page report on the causes of the scandal.
It said Stumpf had been "too slow to investigate or critically challenge sales practices" at the bank, or to "appreciate the seriousness of the problem".
Meanwhile, Tolstedt "did not like to be challenged or hear negative information".
"Community Bank leadership resisted and impeded outside scrutiny or oversight and, when forced to report, minimised the scale and nature of the problem," it said.
In total, Stumpf has paid back $69m while Tolstedt has given back $67m over the scandal.
Lawyers for Tolstedt, who declined to be interviewed for the investigation, rejected the report's findings.
"We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion," said Enu Mainigi of law firm Williams and Connolly.
The bank was fined $185m by regulators last year and has paid $110m to settle a lawsuit brought by customers.

Woman who tried to bribe OIC to get a heroin dealer released, arrested
A woman who tried to offer a bribe of Rs. 250,000 as part of a consideration of Rs. 500,000 to Sapugaskanda Police Crimes Division OIC Inspector Linton de Silva to release a heroin dealer, was apprehended by Police along with the money offered by her. The heroin dealer who was arrested at Davale Road, Makola, was brought for interrogation to the Police station around 1.15 am yesterday.
The arrest was made after explaining the gravity of trying to offer bribes to a disciplined Police force. The heroin dealer was arrested on information gathered from a suspect arrested at Makola with 100 milligrammes of heroin.
The suspect had confessed that the main dealer supplying drugs to him had been using a daughter of his mistress too, to accompany him in transporting the drug. The main dealer was arrested by getting him to Devale Road, Makola around 9.15 pm on April 10 using a decoy. As police pounced on the man, he had swallowed the heroin he had in his possession. The drugs were seized after getting him to vomit it out. The amount of heroin had weighed 2.200 grammes.
The suspects were due to be produced before the Mahara Magistrate yesterday.
Further investigations are continuing directed by DIG Kapila Jayasekara and SP Upali Jayasinghe under the direct supervision of IGP Pujith Jayasundera.

Wretched Arsenal hit new low as Palace run riot
London:Arsene Wengers wretched season hit a new low as Arsenal crashed to a humiliating 3-0 defeat at lowly Crystal Palace that leaves their top four bid in tatters.
Wenger has been under siege in recent weeks as angry Arsenal fans demanded his resignation and the calls for the Gunners boss to quit will grow even louder after one of the most chastening defeats of his 21-year reign.
Needing a victory to keep pace with their rivals in the race for Champions League qualification, spineless Arsenal showed none of the required poise and passion as they crumbled on a woebegone Monday night in south London.
Andros Townsend put Palace ahead in the first half and Yohan Cabaye doubled the hosts lead after the break.
Luka Milivojevics penalty rubbed salt into Wengers wounds as he digested Arsenals fifth defeat in their last eight league games.
Arsenal, beaten at Palace for the first time since 1979, were shambolic and their underachieving stars were barracked with chants of youre not fit to wear the shirt in the closing stages of their heaviest league defeat this season.
Wengers retort to critics who claim hes past his best is to point at his record of leading Arsenal into the Champions League for the last 19 seasons. AFP
