Dense web of regulations hindrance to business climate
Main factors hindering the improvement of the business climate in Sri Lanka have been the high transaction costs in complying with regulations and a dense web of business regulations which discourage new entrants to the market, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama.
He was addressing the Sri Lanka means Business event at Temple Trees on Monday.
The minister said that as a result, these factors have obstructed enterprises to grow, undermined productivity, limited investments and limited access to finance.
There have been efforts to introduce investment climate reforms by successive governments; however, these efforts were not sufficiently coordinated, lacked strategic prioritization and institutional mechanisms to support such reforms.
The minister assured that this time around the government is firm to introduce reforms and the roadmap which was launched by Prime Minister serves as a testament from government towards providing a better business environment that is more conducive to private sector development.
There will be challenges. Sri Lanka is competing with several regional counterparts to attract this investment, he opined
We are not limiting our commitment to improving the business environment focusing on the areas covered in the Doing Business report but hope to go beyond this to provide opportunities for the people of Sri Lanka to better their prospects. (SS)

[emailprotected] launched in Sri Lanka to bridge digital divide across Asia Pacific
Over 55 million researchers, academics and students across the Asia Pacific region, including Sri Lanka, are set to benefit from a new phase of dedicated research and education (R&E) networking [emailprotected] - which was inaugurated recently at the [emailprotected] local launch in Sri Lanka to seamlessly extend and further build on the successful Trans-Eurasia Information Network (TEIN) initiative.
[emailprotected] is the successor project to TEIN4, the most recent phase of the TEIN initiative. It currently supports 24 countries and economies by providing a regional high-capacity internet backbone for R&E collaborations within the Asia Pacific region and its interconnection with the pan-European GANT network and with other parts of the world.
The contract for [emailprotected] was signed in December 2016 between the European Commissions Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO) and the Korea-based regional networking organisation TEIN*CC, which has been managing TEIN4. [emailprotected] relates closely to the core project objective of 'digital connectivity'.
With a substantial five-year EU co-funding commitment of  20 Million up to 2021, [emailprotected] is designed to support capacity building and network-enabled applications with high societal impact, particularly in the least developed countries in the region. The project sets out to meet these objectives through Call for Proposals open to the wider R&E and networking community.
Following the formal inauguration of the project at regional level in February 2017 in New Delhi during APAN43, this national launch event in Sri Lanka was hosted by the [emailprotected] partner LEARN, with representatives from the European Union delegation and Government officials.
European Union Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Tung-Lai Margue said, The EU has long recognized the potential of promoting people-to-people connectivity. [emailprotected] is an excellent example of regional integration, with the R&E communities of 21 Asia Pacific countries interconnected by powerful high-capacity, high-quality internet links.
This project will be a vehicle for promoting a peaceful, secure, open and cooperative ICT environment between Asia and Europe, and in turn benefit society as a whole.
The official launch of [emailprotected] marks the opening of a major new chapter in research networking across Asia Pacific, said Prof. P.S.M. Gunaratne, Chairman of LEARN. Building on the considerable achievements of the predecessor phases, [emailprotected] will enable the connection of more countries at higher speeds, roll out advanced network services and contribute to achieving development goals through improved access to education and research resources, thus bridging the digital divide in the region.

Cardinal urges GMOA to postpone strike
Colombo Archbishop His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday urged the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) not to go ahead with their planned strike beginning today, considering the seriousness of the current dengue outbreak.
Addressing a media briefing at the Bishops House in Colombo, the Archbishop of Colombo said the GMOA should give serious thought to calling off the planned trade union action in order to assist patients affected by dengue.
While noting that he had no intention of interfering with the trade union action planned by doctors to win their demands, the Archbishop said that however it was not an opportune moment to strike as there is a risk of a dengue epidemic spreading in the country.
He insisted that the GMOA should think about the plight of the innocent patients, suffering due to dengue and postpone the strike.
The GMOA on Monday announced that they had decided to engage in an indefinite strike against what they called as the governments failure to resolve the SAITM issue.
Health authorities said the total number of dengue deaths has risen to 226 in the worst ever dengue outbreak in the country.
The total number of dengue cases recorded was 76, 077 from all parts of the country by June 30, Epidemiology Unit sources said.
The highest number of dengue patients,32,764 is from the Western Province with 11,181 reported from the Colombo district. The Colombo Municipal Council area recorded 3,014 dengue patients while the other parts of the district recorded 12,749 dengue patients.

Childhood, a short season
Titled as Childhood in Contemporary Cultures, the compendium of essays edited by Margaret Mead, the well-known anthropologist, and Martha Wolfenstein, the reputed folklorist, first appeared in the field of cultural anthropology as a pioneer reader in 1955. Gradually as the field of studies extended to the interlinked areas of sociology and communication like collection had to be reprinted several times in keeping with the demand.
In all the subject areas of childhood in contemporary cultures are subdivided into eight segments.
1. Cultural approaches to the study of childhood.
2. Observational studies (on childhood)
3. Child rearing literature
4. Fantasies for and about children
5. Childrens imaginative productions
6. Interviews with parents and children
7. Clinical studies (on children)
8. The epilogue (to the findings) by the two compilers.
The collection of findings is supplemented with photos, illustrations and a bibliography of their books referred to in the text. Though the compilation could be classified as a study in social and cultural anthropology, the essays embedded could be of interest to all nations, transcending the geographical and cultural barriers. The compilers tell us at the outset that children are newcomers in the social sciences.
Living conditions
The findings encircle countries of around the globe giving emphasis on the broad insight into culture and living conditions. The intention of the team of researchers is to find the ways in which children can be studied and interpret how the materials made by, for or about children, can be utilised for the betterment of the living conditions of the children in all cultures.
This book, which consists of a series of findings on children, is stated as grown out of the Columbia University Research in contemporary cultures and inaugurated by Ruth Benedict as far back as 1947. As a byproduct, the leader of the team, Margaret Mead, who worked as the chief researcher attached to American Museum of Natural History, brought out a work titled The Study of Culture at a Distance (1953). This work centred around quite a number of areas which later broadened the study horizons of cultural anthropology which in turn gave way to the broad perspectives of social sciences at the university level of education.
Today, one finds the study of childhood is not emphasised as a broad-based area in social sciences. Instead, its findings are vaguely centred around the studies in childcare and child psychology. In the theoretical setting to the work, Mead emphasises the fact that children are newcomers as a subject of literature, newcomers in the study of human physiology and anatomy, newcomers in the social sciences.
Interested reader
In the volume of learned essays of varying types, the editors do not propose to present and exhaustive study of ways of studying children within a particular cultural context, but rather to give the student and the interested reader some idea of the kinds of research which may truthfully be explored from the standpoint both of method and of results.
The editors have taken care to include several kinds of studies on the same culture so that the student or the reader can see for example what it looks like to study French films, French drawings of children, French children playing in a park, books read by French children, the songs sung by them, the story completion on the part of children etc.
One significant point laid down by the editors is to note that there should be gaps that should be left out in the areas linked to childhood. Social conditions tend to change. The changing patterns of children too have to be noted.
On looking out for sources of material on childhood, the factors such as child training, literature, child in fiction and drama, observations on child behaviour interviews with children and adults, games and toys and childrens story books, the insights on the part of the adult ought to be productive as well as sensitive. Today, the emphasis has gone into the mass media materials as utilised in press, radio and television.
Fears and resonances
Special units have been carved out in order to bring better results and better awards. Margaret Mead states that because of the recurrent biological similarities of growth of parent-child relationships of needs and fears and resonances, it is possible to compare childhood of one society with that of another. How many readers may agree with the notion, I wonder.
But the fact remains that the common elements and the uniformities are the basics of the comparisons, according to Mead. She adds that when we look at behaviour culturally, it means what we look at it comparatively.
As further interpreted by Mead, when the anthropologist says children take fathers surname, the culturally nave answer will be of course who elses name would they take But the culturally sophisticated - whether that comes from reading, travel or study from the knowledge of other periods of history or from knowledge of other cultures - will realise that in many societies there are no surnames, wherein other children take their mothers surname or take the surname of both the parents. This gives the situation that taking the fathers surname is a particular type of cultural behaviour, neither natural to the human race nor a predictable occurrence for a given part of the week.
With this example, Mead tries to drive at a conclusion which goes as every single statement that an anthropologist makes a comparative statement.
The segment on the areas pertaining to fantasies far and above children looks quite fascinating for the modern reader interested in fairytales and allied studies. The study on Jack and the Beanstalk by Martha Wolfenstein and the study of the Chinese Childrens classic Monkey give insights to the type of fables and legends that could make children think and understand about their living conditions.
All in all, this is a gift for all times, resourceful for all cultures, especially in search of reconciliation.

DBK, the prolific writer
Don Baldwin Kuruppu was a straight forward man who expressed his views in a candid manner and expected others also to do the same. He was a sincere friend and always out to help others.
Baldwin (as he was known to his friends) was born in Uduwa, in the Horana area. After his school and university careers he served as a teacher in Ananda College in Colombo. He was a very respected teacher who went out of his way to help his students to excel in their studies and guided them even in their later careers.
I got to know Baldwin when he was the Personnel Manager of the Ceylon Cement Corporation. Later he joined as a Trainer/Consultant at the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM). He contributed to the training at NIBM and initiated a number of effective training courses like the programme on Transactional Analysis, the contents of which, he published as a book.
He was instrumental in the introduction of employee participation programmes in most of the public enterprises during the seventies of the last century. His leadership in this activity made him serve in the Ministry of Industries on a part time basis and advise the corporations supervised by that Ministry to make the best uses of participative management approaches to enhance their contribution to the national economy.
Baldwin was a prolific writer. One of his first publications was the Sinhala translation of Don Quixote (Travels of Baron Von Manchusen) as Manchusen Charika that is very popular among the school children due to the very appropriate spoken Sinhala he has used to relate the humorous episodes in the story. He migrated with his family to Melbourne, Australia and continued his literary activities there too. He was a live wire in the Sri Lankan community in Melbourne. He has written and published quite a number of novels about the foibles of our migrants down under in a sarcastic manner. Yet they have been widely read there as well as in Sri Lanka. His grasp of the Sinhala and English languages helped him to produce literary pieces for the local newspapers (when he was in Sri Lanka) based on incidents of current interest that were greatly appreciated by the reading public. He was also a popular speaker, orator and a career counselor.
While in Sri Lanka his reviews on literary works and dramas were a frequent feature in the national press.

Dutch ingenuity at work with expansion of Panama Canal

Last March, it was announced that the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) ordered a vessel scheduling and maritime resources management system called Quintiq. A Dutch software company developed the system and this is not the only innovation the Dutch brought to the new Panama Canal.
The expansion of the Panama Canal was completed last summer. The project, also called the Third Set of Locks Project, doubled the capacity of the Panama Canal by adding a new lane of traffic allowing for a larger number of ships. The width and the depth of the lanes and locks were also increased, enabling larger ships to pass. All this marine traffic needs a system that gives oversight. That is why the Panama Canal Authority selected Quintiq to plan, schedule and optimise all vessels transit operations through the Canal to reduce costs, improve safety and increase overall efficiency and reliability.

Eminent Economist delivers reality check at CILT Logistic Leaders Evening
The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transportation (CILT) Sri Lanka Logistics Leaders Evening was held recently with a lecture titled Sri Lankas competitiveness  A Tiger or a Small Miracle by former Central Bank Deputy Governor, W. A. Wijewardene at the Auditorium of the National Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka to a well-attended audience. Wijewardene started off by explaining why measuring competitiveness was important for Sri Lanka and advocated several imperatives for the country to move out of the current middle income trap towards a high income nation.
Despite government projections of 7% minimum growth it is only likely that Sri Lanka will achieve somewhere between 5  5.5% growth rate till 2020 with the current state of affairs. Some of the key growth imperatives were: Economic reforms on a wide scale, Make the private sector move the country forward, Introduce measures to improve productivity and efficiency of using both human and physical capital, Create a bigger market for Sri Lankan products.
He highlighted the example of Singapores forward-thinking mindset that allowed a small state to become a global economic powerhouse.
A deeper evaluation of the current situation revealed that the biggest reason why Sri Lanka is lagging behind is a need to change our cultural mindset to be more modern and hardworking, to rethink how education is delivered, and to leapfrog four cycles of the industrial revolution in order to become relevant. Wijewardenes suggested way forward plan included: Take a stock of the state of human capital (un) development and the quality of the facilitating logistical services, Get into an economic policy capsule with participation from politicians, bureaucrats, academia, and civil society organizations, map out strategy for developing the talent pool of the country needed by 2025, 2035 and 2045, Sign off the strategy with time bound KPIs to monitor progress, rectify deviations and plan out for emerging developments.His final conclusion was that, as it is, it is neither Tiger nor Small Miracle for Sri Lanka unless a massive reform program is implemented with consistency, consensus, dedication and commitment! Wijewardenes full presentation is available with the CILT Secretariat and anyone interested may contact them.

Eureka I have found it!
MY inextinguishable search for a sustainable solution for some or all the bugbears of my native land got my head around and in spite of total immersion in it; this poor soul was unable to find it. I myself was, at the end, in big shoes which were too large for me!
Yet, thanks to Dickens and others for instilling a drop of their endurance into this poor soul to escape from not being able to make head nor tail of the current ordeal our paradise island is confronted with due to utopian thinking in the wake of prior tinkering.
No full-blooded patriot can keep cool under these circumstances and in other countries, the writers come to rescue with their quill, very poignantly our ones are seen at hustings and court premises to depend on their tribe.
John Dryden and Alexander Pope of the satirical age of poetry in England rendered a yeoman service in a situation akin to that of our motherland. Dryden was once severely attacked by some thugs for his writing, the literary history says. The tapestry of English literature is abundant with ample resources to find time-tested solutions to our chronic diseases which are pestering and bleeding the nation.
Hibernation
I plead mercy for digressing your attention from your invaluable time to another aspect why most of the intellectuals and the members of the intelligentsia do not pay their due heed to national problems. In my view, some lop-sided professors and pseudo-intellectuals predict election results which do not tally with the ground realities of the status quo.
Most of their predictions even do not come nigh. After doing it they go to hibernation. Some philosophers decipher this conundrum in this way, Unquestionably a literary life is, for the most part, an unhappy life, because, if you have genius, you must suffer the penalty of genius; and if you have the only talent, there are so many cares and worries incidental to the circumstances of men of letters, as to make the life exceedingly miserable.
Richard de Silva is no more with us. Yet, it is high time to make a pragmatic approach to eliminating or at least to mitigate the suffering of the poor. They deserve to be benefited by the vast literature written on their behalf by iconic writers.
In my perusal of the vast sphere of literature, the other day I found the solution which I was searching for. Even my spouse was flabbergasted to hear. She insisted on telling her when I began to run around my house with the panacea in my little head even though at times she loads it with unbearable kudos for my cognitions.
Luscious meal
Here I run the gauntlet. Yet, my honey persisted me to keep it within our walls, but Im a little crow that caws others to enjoy a luscious meal.
Eureka!
This is how I explained it to my beloved spouse who saved my life at many an occasion when the parade isle was in flames and bleeding. Yet, I survived to do my duty by the nation even in the evening of my life when the country demands. I love my motherland. Once a sage said in Sanskrit,  Mother and the native land are more excellent than swarga. Now you may understand why our ministers are in such a foray to grab a ministry to serve their motherland.
Yet, the system is quite contradictory to the west -minister mode. My wavering mind delays me to come to the point at once, pardon.
My small home library is always waiting for offering solutions when I am in distress. It is very palpable to her. I quite understand her language. She invited me to a remote corner in her home and showed me a yellowish old book of stories, my beloved father had bought me with his hard earned money. This is the goldmine where I found the precious stone.
Some pages had been nibbled by insects, most probably by cockroaches which have invaded my immeasurable storehouse of knowledge. Even the publishers blurb they have eaten and also the front page with the authors name. Could any sympathetic reader enlighten me on it The book is old, yet my father invariably told me that there was no wear and tear in books.
Insofar as now I understand that he had told so just to satisfy my mind because as a member of the underdog for whom our old red brigade left no stone unturned to redress their grievances, had to work hard to keep the home fires burning and send us to school.
Scottish bagpipes
In this fine piece of writing, there is a pied-piper. He wears a funny cloth quite similar to that of a clown in a circus. The picture of the pied-piper is eye catching. He has a long musical instrument. It is called the bagpipes.
It is played by blowing air into a bag held by the arm and pressing it out through pipes. Scottish bagpipes are the world famous.
Once upon a time, in the township of Hamlin in Germany, there was a terrible situation created by rats. It was a sudden spate of rats, maybe due to their breeding pattern. They began to eat everything on their way and it reached a staggering proportion that the city-dwellers were unable to get rid of.
They duly complained the mayor without staging fasts unto death as they were not unruly naughty fellows.
The mayor sent round a tom- tom beater to declare that anyone who could solve the rat menace would be offered a prize of one thousand pounds.
There came the pied-piper and the challenging task was undertaken. The pied-piper went around the city playing his bagpipes and all the rats followed him. He went through a tunnel, left the rats somewhere and returned to the mayor in a most triumphant mood. The city-dwellers lived happily ever since.
Yet, lo and behold! The mayor did not honour the promise of thousand pounds. After a long heated exchange of words and an altercation, the pied-piper went out of the city hall and went around the city playing another tune. All the children, big and small, rich and poor, came out of their homes and followed the pied-piper.
The pied piper did the same to the children too and the parents stormed the mayors chamber and troubled his life out to get back their children.
The rest of the story couldnt be traced as the pages had been eaten by silverfish.

Gifted prodigy
Head Prefect of Bishops College Hiruni Liyanarachchi is a young lady with moral fibre. Perfect Prefects interviews this young leader who is a combination of gentleness and strength.
I believe in helping other people. I feel that we as a society need to help each other. You do not have to be a leader to help. You just need to extend your hand. People say we are still children and students and we cannot make an impact on the world. But I still believe we can help and make a difference even through the smallest act of helping. Even the memory of us helping can keep that person going on in a really hard situation. The memory that someone cared enough to help, said Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi is someone who feels strongly about those who are in difficulty and is interested in issues like Poverty and Female Rights.
I think in Sri Lanka the way some people think about women in general, their attitude towards women in general, it is something that has to change, and it is not something we can do immediately, but we can start little by little. Because I know it will take a long time. But someone has to start it, pointed out Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi believes that one quality a head prefect should have is that she needs to be approachable.
Approachable
We have a lot of scope and a lot of opportunities as prefects. I have the power to help others with whatever resources and power I have. For me to help them, they should be able to approach me and say  this is the problem I have. You need to be very kind and compassionate and be very approachable. You also need to be humble. And that comes with being approachable. They should be comfortable enough to approach me. I always try to have a nice and friendly relationship with the girls. It is more like a friend than a head prefect. Almost like a big sister. So they will come up to me and tell me what their problems are, explained Liyanarachchi.
She also feels that we should be able to accept what comes our way.
We have so many events that go on in school. So many things to organise. We give duties to prefects and we hope that these events will go well. And we hope things will not go wrong. One thing I have learnt throughout the years is that nothing will be perfect. You have to accept what comes your way. But if you know that you have tried your best and that you have given it your 100 percent, even the small things that go wrong, you can accept it.
You should not beat yourself up about it. You should be proud of yourself and confident about yourself and be happy with what you are doing. Also, you should never give up. There will be days when you are on your feet the whole day and nobody will pat you on the back and say thank you. But there are also instances when people will come up and thank you for the help and shake your hand.
Confident
That is a gift you will have. There are days that will be very tough. Sometimes before an event, you will find things going really wrong. Those things are going to happen and sometimes you are so tired. You feel like just breaking apart. But you cant do that. When we became prefects our vice principal told us, that there are going to be times when you want to give up but you cant. You have to keep doing it, tomorrow is another day and it will bring something good for you, elucidated Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi articulates when she feels too stressed.
Hiruni Liyanarachchi.

One thing I do when I feel too stressed is I articulate how I will fix things. If it has been a very stressful day, I go to one of my two deputies or my parents or my sister and explain what I am going to do and how I am going to approach it. When I have a plan clearly in my mind about what I am going to do, it makes me feel better when I tell somebody. When things get stressful I hate sitting somewhere and thinking about it. I want to get up and do something about it. To relax I read a lot of books, and I watch movies. I have cousins living right next door. So if I want to get away from work and have some fun, I go there and play with them and sometimes I call up my best friends, added Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi says that she is a fan of romantic comedies
I love Bollywood movies, I am a huge Hindi Movie fan, I like movies based on autobiographies, for example, a persons life journey. When it comes to books I like romance novels and autobiographies, stated Liyanarachchi.
When it comes to people I admire in this world, it would be Mother Teresa, Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi. I dont know everything about them but I love the message they left behind. I think this is very important. Also right here at Bishops my former head girl Mandani Tennekoon inspired me, said Liyanarachchi.
Liyanarachchi also shared a story with us.
Stressed out
When I first got to know that I was going to be head prefect before it was announced at Assembly, the Principal called me to her room. My two deputies and I were sitting outside and we did not know what was happening. We thought we were going to get scolded! First, my deputies were taken in and then I was called in. And then the principal congratulated me and told me I was going to be the Head Prefect.
My first reaction was to cry and I am a person who cries a lot. When I am stressed out I cry! But it makes me feel better! Some people get distraught, but not for me! For me, it is a way of release. So I cried in front of her because I was a little scared because I knew she had discussed this with other people and they were pinning their hopes on me and believing I could do it. I was so proud and honoured to take it. What would they think of me a few years down the line That was the worst things that could happen! I am also friendly with the students. I have a good balance between my extra-curricular and studies. I try to maintain that balance. I also am hard working. I try to do my best! shared Liyanarachchi.
Right now she is doing a combination of Commerce and Arts  Economics, Accounts and Literature. In the future, she wants to do Psychology or Sociology and start her own NGO and maybe even join the UN or the Red Cross.
I would like to be a psychiatrist or a human rights activist. I would like to be an activist for women or help the street children. The street kids. Whenever I see street kids walking along with the mother begging, I think what if I could give them a place to live and find the mother an occupation Then she can send these kids to school Then the cycle will be broken, believes Liyanarachchi.
Qualities
She especially mentioned her deputy prefects, Shahla Sangani and Radeesha Wanduragala, who have helped her a lot. She also mentioned that her teachers have been amazingly supporting and helping her.
My mother and father are extremely supportive and I am who I am today because of them. They gave me all the qualities that have made me into a head prefect. They taught me how important it is to help. I have seen them helping other people. I hope I will have a good income and proper job so I will be able to help other people. My mother has gently guided me along my educational path. My grades have been good and I have balanced my extra-curricular activities. Whenever I have issues they help me out always. My Principal, Vice Principal and teachers have been extremely supportive. My prefect guild is the best, informed Liyanarachchi.
She believes the most important quality is believing in yourself and being confident.Always it is important that you learn about the things around you. Sometimes when we get responsibilities we do not know what to do. You have to inquire as to what can be done without just sitting around. You need to exert yourself and give your 100 percent. You may not know something but you ask and get help. Getting help is completely alright. Whatever you are doing you give it your maximum, because at the end of the day you can tell yourself that you tried your best, pointed out Liyanarachchi.At the annual Avurudu celebrations.

Gliricidia, an alternate to coal to meet ever-growing power supply crisis
Planting of gliricidia specially in coconut estates in the country would play a big role in finding solutions to the ever-growing crisis in supply of electricity in the country. It is claimed that gliricidia is an alternate and could replace coal imported from overseas saving much needed foreign exchange.
The BioMass Supplies (Pvt) Company which plays a leading role in introducing gliricidia as an intercrop specially in coconut estates, assists greatly in the production of biogas via planting gliricidia.
The Coconut Plantation Societies in the Puttalam district have shown keen interest in planting gliricidia in the coconut estates coming under their purview in collaboration with the said company from May this year.
Last week the BioMass Chilaw office conducted a demonstration session for the benefit of the Chilaw plantation officials at their Palugaswewa Coconut Estate, to show how scientifically one could plant gliricidia as an intercrop.
As a result of it being planted systematically within the coconut estates, the green matter of gliricidia-sepium automatically turns into organic input within the plantation, increasing the capacity to increase the number of coconuts from each tree.
The company has assured them that growing gliricidia as an intercrop would earn them an extra income while ensuring the absorption of the needed amount of nitrogen to the soil. The roots of the coconut tree loosen the soil allowing more water to take in and reduce the damage caused by insects and add fertilizer necessary for coconut trees. It develops soil structure, air raising capacity and water retention capacity.
Biomass, a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) since 2015, is a private sector company with expertise in the emerging field of alternative energy drawn from renewable resources. The company serves early stage companies seeking its advice and knowhow to accelerate growth.
We are members of the RSB since 2015. Like the organic, they are the body. If someone, is in the BioMass business, RSB, as a world organization body has the right to issue the Validation Certificate and is also in a position to trace those registered with it via GPS, a device connected to the mobile. It helps collection of detailed information, including the global positioning of the land/farm as well. It is able to collect information such as where the stuff come from and the quantity chopped. Gliricidia though grown as an intercrop, does not replace forest. It is food and fuel. It does not affect the soil but its leaves become fertilizer. The roots give nitrogen to the soil.
BioMass Manager Supply Ruchitha Kurera pointed out that biomass was a renewable resource and ecologically clean fuel that we could use more effectively.
BioMass commenced work in 2012 in Kantale and work really started in 2014 with the recruitment of office staff. Kurera went on to say though the company was yet in the process of establishing itself after receiving Cabinet approval, it has got involved in making pallets which could be used to generate power. We are making pallets and that can be used in power generation. We export our product directly to Japan. We ourselves are not generating power but sell it to people who generate power here or anywhere else. We supply our products directly from our plant at Kantale to local and foreign companies without any modification and their boilers could co-fire with coal, 5 to 10 percent and meet their requirements."
He also said that the company works in liaison with coconut, paddy farmers and other crop cultivators. "We have 40,000 registered farmers and we conducted well over 600 farmer training programmes to benefit them. They, with their added knowledge, have taken the task of growing gliricidia trees. By now, a total of 50 million trees have been planted and they are supervised by our field officers. We recommend 450 trees for an acre in coconut plantation within the land and gliricidia could also be grown along the fence. The harvesting is done once a year."
He said when growth reaches maximum at the end of one year, the company purchases the gliricidia trunks from the cultivators or the farmers. Farmers will be able to earn Rs. 10,800 per acre.
"We never cut the trees from the bottom. We cut them three feet (3) above and that helps sustainability and ensures continuance of their further growth. We sell the logs purchased from the farmers to local buyers. Those who buy, put the logs into gas-fire. The gas-fire generate steam and this is called 'dendro power'. It is not just burning wood, you burn to get gas. It is called gastificasion. That is the process the said companies adopt," Kurera said.
Anura Siriwardene, Puttalam District Manager, with his office at Pambala in Chilaw, said that the company was in the process of developing the Puttalam district and opened the office in Chilaw two month ago. "In Puttalam district, we have 30,000 acres of gliricidia grown as an intercrop and we expect 135,000 fuel-wood from Puttalam.
We have 17 field officers attached to our Chilaw office and our massive network extends Trincomalee to Anuradhapura, Padaviya, Gomarankadawala, Moravewa to the district of Vavunia, and then from our network from Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya, to the outskirts of Batticaloa," he said.

GMOA strike put off
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday postponed their strike which was to be launched today on the SAITM issue.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge addressing journalists in Colombo said they decided to postpone the strike by one week taking into consideration several new developments. Aluthge cited positive proposals put forward by Minister Lakshman Kiriella at a special meeting held on Monday, the request made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith to postpone the strike considering the dengue outbreak, a decision by the government to make a special announcement on the issue which was conveyed by Minister Kiriella to the GMOA, discussions held with the Maha Sangha of the Asgiriya chapter and the seriousness of the dengue outbreak as the new developments.
Aluthge also praised Presidents efforts to solve the issue and added that however some other powerful individuals were trying to scuttle a settlement.
He said discussions with Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella on Monday was very positive and both sides had agreed to carry forward talks in the next few days as well.
He said the GMOA will also meet the Archbishop shortly following his request to halt strike action.
Several leading Cabinet Ministers informed the GMOA that both the PM and the President have one stand on the SAITM and their stand will be announced through a statement soon. The current dengue outbreak is another reason to postpone the strike, he addded.

Goodbye, disaster!
Beneficial characteristics of Vetiver
It is non-invasive. Its seeds are sterile. It does not have running stolons. Propagation is only via cuttings. As such, it will never become invasive.
It is non-competitive: Roots grow vertically down. Vetiver does not compete with plants nearby. It is quite safe from pests and disease: It repels pests including white ants.
It is hardy and fast growing. It gives quick results. It recovers quickly, even from forest fires.
A six-month-old plant will have roots about 5 feet long and a mature plant will have roots about 15 to 20 feet long.
It is ideal to effectively control erosion and flood waters.
Low-cost vetiver hedges trap silt to form drains.
In tea and other plantations, the leafy material can be used as mulch to control weeds and improve water absorption and retention. Vetiver hedge forms a ditch naturally into which sediment collects and does not get washed away like dug out ditches.
No maintenance is needed. The bush may be cropped and used as roofing thatch or chopped and spread as mulch.
It is a proven beneficial plant. It has proven globally in many projects in many countries around the world. Vetiver has been promoted and supported by the World Bank for many years.
We have a Ministry of Disaster Management. It was established in December 2005. We have a Disaster Management Centre too. It was established in 1996 under the Department of Social Services. Dealing with disasters as a specific subject and a serious responsibility of the central government became a reality most probably after the Tsunami of 2004.
The public cannot help wonder whether these institutions and their staff are concerned, aware and capable only of post-disaster management and not disaster mitigation if not disaster prevention.
Disasters are due to natural events  mostly floods and droughts in the case of Sri Lanka. However, it looks like they have become unusually frequent from about 15 years ago. Almost every year we have had serious floods, earth slips and droughts. What remedial measures have been taken to mitigate at least the damage from floods and earth slips
It is easy to blame climate change for these events but that is not the only cause. Natural events cannot be stopped or avoided. Our citizens and those in power have definitely contributed towards creating disasters by the indiscriminate clearing of mountain slopes for illegal agriculture and ravaged minor and major forests for illicit timber.
However, we need not suffer disasters as if it is our fate. We must fight back. It is possible to reduce damage and chances of natural events developing into disasters. It is the almost total lack of this initiative at all levels of authority that has resulted in the public having to face disasters. If the initiative was there the uses and practical application of the versatile plant mentioned below would have been recognised.
Post-disaster management
The authorities, seemingly informed poorly, seem to think that all that needs to be done is to supply food, water, clothing, temporary housing and to make good some small portion of material losses. These are massive scale recurrent expenditures and suffering that can be substantially reduced at a fraction of the cost spent yearly on post-disaster management.
All it takes to ensure substantial relief is a simple plant  a type of grass. Its application for the mitigation of floods and earth slips has become a science, a technology and a profession practised in many countries  rich and poor  like the USA, Australia, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and many African and South American countries, adding up to over a hundred. Indonesia has used it in her recovery from the damage of the 2004 tsunami.
An international organisation has been created to popularise its use globally. That was about ten years ago.
We have not heard of the use of this particular plant in Sri Lanka. Here a different species
of this plant is grown to extract aromatic oil. We have not even heard of its use in disaster mitigation. If that is the actual situation in Sri Lanka, it is a very poor reflection on the relevant authorities like the Ministry of Disaster Management, the NBRO and many others. It shows ignorance, ineptitude, incompetence and an utter lack of caring regarding their initiatives, duties and responsibilities.
The plant is Vetiver.
The Sri Lankan species is called Savandara in Sinhala and Kuruver in Tamil among many other names. The botanical names in use are Chrysopogon zizanioides and Vetiveria zizanioides. What is recommended is the South Indian variety. It grows much more robustly than other vetiver species.
Stabilising waterway and river banks, coastal areas, the plant reduce flood velocities, retaining silt, remediating wastewater. On top is a six-month-old plant and new plants from cuttings.
Anchoring by Vetiver is far cheaper, more effective, environmentally compatible and longer lasting than currently used stone and concrete structures.
No maintenance is required. Villagers can handle anchoring as shramadana or as a profitable enterprise. It can be cultivated on flat lands. If the land is subject to runoff, erosion of topsoil is prevented by vetiver hedges.
Cultivating in the hill, Vetiver hedges replace the conventional ditches along contours. They are cheaper to establish than ditches. They need no maintenance and are permanent - unlike ditches. They do a better job than ditches. They enable safe cultivation of hillsides.
These hedges improve soil moisture content too. Most of our people eke out a poor living as rainfed crop subsistence farmers on state land. The only way to improve their living standards is for them to produce food and cash crops on a sustainable basis. That can be done only by preserving the land. Vetiver hedges along contours enable that - stopping runoff and erosion.
Disaster Management Ministry
Rainfall can be predicted to a satisfactory extent  but not the collection and draining of the accumulated water. That has to be studied. It is the accumulated water that becomes a flood. Floodwaters can be guided along pre-planned routes, thereby greatly reducing damage. Even in prosperous countries, people voluntarily erect sandbag barriers to direct flood waters away from important areas. In our country, everybody just waits for the disaster to happen. This is simply unacceptable and criminal neglect.
Creating sandbag barriers is tedious, expensive and labour intensive. It cannot be done at the spot or quickly too.
Now there is a simple, quick and affordable method to do the same tasks better, at the spot. It can be used to raise riverbanks, block unwanted waterways, prevent inundation of desired areas, create reservoirs of flood waters, break up and divert water flows. They can be used to create 10  15 foot high barriers. Taller barriers can be created by stacking them in a stable manner.
The Disaster Management Ministry can purchase these and store them safely for use whenever necessary. Controlling floods in this way is cheaper, less damaging and reduces suffering. The preventive material and its installation will cost just a fraction of the money wasted on uncontrolled flood damage now.
Vetiver too has proven to be useful in flood control. The bush is tough and firmly anchored. It does not get uprooted and carried away. It survives long periods of submergence. Hedges grown across flood flow routes will slow down and even change the direction of water flow and retain the sediment.
The erosion is caused by the wind and by uncontrolled rainwater runoff. Sheet erosion is caused by wind and rainwater and landslides are caused by rainwater.
Sheet Erosion is the blowing and washing away of surface soil, mostly the valuable topsoil, into drains, waterways and ultimately rivers. Almost all our rivers are brown with suspended soil. This is an obvious but neglected devastation which must be greatly mitigated if not stopped completely. Our country is being dissolved into the Indian Ocean in terms of tonnes every day!!!
Erosion raises riverbeds, increasing the potential for flooding.
Erosion fills up reservoirs reducing their water holding capacity  thereby reducing their usefulness in irrigation, power generation and in flood control since they can store less water. The authorities and connected members of the public are duty bound to control this damage. It affects food production, the GNP, foreign exchange reserves and kills the land due to increased use of chemical fertiliser.

Government agrees to seven GMOA proposals - MP
UNP Parliamentarian Prof.Ashu Marasinghe said the Government is ready to face the strike action of members of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
During the Government Group Meeting, all parliamentarians have unanimously agreed to dilute the unfair and unethical trade union action of the GMOA he said.
The GMOA is going to hold a continuous strike demanding to the Government to close down SAITM medical faculty. The Parliamentarian said that the GMOA has forwarded eight proposals to the Government for its consideration but there is no proposal to shut down the SAITM medical faculty from them. According to him, the Government has agreed to seven of the eight proposals.The strike action of the GMOA is not justifiable and it is unethical,he said.
He added that the standards in medical education are must. Accordingly, not only for SAITM but also all other medical faculties including medical faculties in Jaffna, Rajarata and Eastern medical faculties should be subjected to undergo common quality standards.
Minimum standards in medical education will be implemented by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as the Legal Draftsman is attending on drafting the minimum standards now.
Asked what stance of the Government is relating to the GMOAs demand to shut down the SAITM medical faculty, he said that SAITM medical faculty will not be shut down.
The GMOA says that their members work with the world tradition. Is there a world tradition to put innocent patients in danger by launching strikes he said.Is there a world tradition to disobey the Hippocratic Oath he questioned.
The GMOA is the only trade union in the world, which gets a two hour lunch break.The doctors, who pretend that they work to world traditions, work only six hours a day.

Govt. ready to facilitate export friendly economic policy: Finance Minister
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that since Sri Lanka intends to implement an investor and export friendly economic policy, the government would implement tax reforms favourable to exports.
He explained the government vision to a delegation of representatives from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Sri Lanka, accompanied by the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma when they called on him at his Ministry on Monday.
The representatives briefed Minister Samaraweera on various investment projects undertaken by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the country and exchanged views on ease of doing business in Sri Lanka.
The Japanese delegation apprised the Minister of issues faced by investors with regard to various tax reforms implemented from time to time. They stated that most of their products are being exported under forward contract with buyers and any sudden amendment to the tax regime may affect their exports.
The Japanese delegates requested the Finance Minister to give them at least six months notice prior to the enforcement of any tax amendments, as it might have an adverse impact on exports.
The Japanese Ambassador was accompanied by a high-profile business delegation consisting of the Chairman/President of Training and Service Industry Group of Mitsubishi Corporation Eiji Suga, Vice Chairman of Taisei Corporation Hiroki Horikawa, Vice Chairman of Noritake Lanka Porcelain Yoshinari Shimaya, Vice President of Itochu Corporation Akira Matsui, Vice President of Oriental Consultants Noboru Kitazawa, Vice President of YKK Lanka Ryuhei Nagahata, and Secretary General of the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) Kazuhiko Obama.

Govt for tendering system to purchase renewable energy
The government has decided to move on with a tendering system to purchase renewable energy sources particularly solar and wind power while canceling the existing licensing system, Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera said.
We have identified that there is an opportunity for competitive tendering in renewable energy, earlier, there was an understanding it was not possible. As we have introduced fair tendering process, there has been good response from the private sector both locally and globally to invest in this sector.
As per the policy, in power generation, the government will invest in infrastructure, development of the systems, but the government will not invest in power generation. With regard to solar power, Sri Lanka opened a competitive tender in this regard as a result the country managed to reduce tariff from Rs 22.10 per unit to Rs 17.01 per unit.
In 2016, May the government opened the same tender with regard to wind energy, through that tariffs were reduced from Rs 19 per unit to Rs 12.29 per unit, registering more than 40% reduction.
In addition, the government has instructed the Ceylon Electricity Board to carry out the purchasing of solar energy at a very systematic and transparent manner.
During the next couple of months, the government will call tenders to purchase 875 megawatts of power. Moreover, a special presidential committee on instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena has been established on energy demand side management.
Plans are also afoot to distribute 10 million, 9 mega watts bulbs among 2.8 million consumers in the near future with the objective of curtailing the demand for electricity by 300 megawatts.

Guru Nanak in Ceylon
The Sikhs, knows as the 'warrior race' of India, comprise twenty five million of the world population with the extended family counting to around thirty million today.
The Sikh Founding Guru Nanak-the most widely travelled religious leader of his time-visited Ceylon during the Portuguese era which commenced in the year 1505 at which time there existed three independent Kingdoms in the country.
1. The Kingdom of Kotte
2. The Kingdom of Kandy
3. The Kingdom of Jaffna
At the same time there were seven vassal states in the east of the country that may be even titled princedoms.
Guru Nanak visited Kurukal Mandap near the presents  day eastern town of Batticaloa where he resided for several days thought invited by the ruler to reside at his palace a short distance away. After his stay at Kurukal Mandap, Guru Nanak travelled to Kataragama and thereafter to Sitawaka (Avissawella) and to Kotte via Badulla and Sita Eliya (Nuwara Eliya) After his visit to Kotte he was on his return journey visiting Anuradhapura and departing from Mannar to India.
His visit to Kotte was around 1509 during the rule of King Dharmaparakrama Bahu IX where he had several interactions with the King.
Dr. W. S. Karunaratna Assistant Director Department of Archaeology presented a paper at an International seminar where he announced the discovery of an inscription giving an account of a dialogue between the king of Kotte the Jnanakacharya which was in the museum in Anuradhapura.
The Sikh Udasis and Janamsakhis give detailed accounts of the travels of Guru Nanak within and outside of India including Ceylon.
These accounts have evinced great interest from inter alia academicians historians and indologists and which are seeing on-going research on the travels and experiences of Guru Nanak and the impact of his great teachings.

HNB Ath Pavura to be launched soon
HNB Ath Pavura is a new weekly reality TV show coming soon on ITN, Sri Lankas leading television channel, and is brought to you by Lanka Impact Investing Network and Social Enterprise Lanka, in partnership with Horizon Campus.
Ath Pavura is Sri Lanka's first television show to promote Social Entrepreneurship and Impact Investment through an exciting reality TV show format.
Social Enterprises are businesses that are solving social and environmental problems through creative business models and innovative products and services.
They are self-sustainable because they earn revenue and generate profit. Charities and donor-funded NGOs as well as purely profit driven companies are not considered as social enterprises. Our vision is to build a thriving Social Enterprise sector in Sri Lanka by 2025. Ath Pavura is a giant step in our journey.
The purpose of Ath Pavura is to find and promote social entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. Its the best opportunity for entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka to promote their innovative solutions to social and environmental problems on television and inspire many more aspiring future social entrepreneurs, said Eranda Ginige, Founder of Social Enterprise Lanka.
Impact Investors are the new generation of investors who are willing to invest their money, time and resources in social entrepreneurs expecting a financial return as well as a measured social impact.
Any economic development for any country entrepreneurs and enterprises are the key driving force.
Not only for products and service development for the economy but also for economic enrichment through employment generation entrepreneurs and enterprises are dynamics of the eco system. Ath Pauvra is an initiative of a GAME CHANGE in the financial services market in Sri Lanka directing entrepreneur
s towards more sustainable, scalable and commercially viable enterprises that can impact the society and the environment. Further Ath Pauvra is platform and place of meeting of the mind of Social Entrepreneurs and the impact investors of Sri Lanka, said Chandula Abeywickrema, Chairman of Lanka Impact Investing Network.
As the pioneer TV station of the country and the channel which is having the widest coverage, we are proud to join hands with this concept. We changed the culture of the reality show by Youth with Talent and we have identified new skills of the Sri Lankan youth from that programme and created new job opportunities of the country as well as outside. So with this experience we hope to build a new era of television history which would benefit the Sri Lankan economy as well from this programme, Chandana Thilakarathna, CEO, Independent Television Network.
Ath Pavura is designed to create opportunities for Lankan Social Entrepreneurs to promote their business, products and services on television, and to pitch their new social business idea or an existing social business in order to secure investment money as venture capital.

IVF sets industry records
The internationally accredited, multi award-winning Lanka Hospitals Colombo awaits the imminent announcement of its millennial IVF (In Vitro Fertilization - commonly known as test-tube) baby delivery. Proven to be one of the most sophisticated facilities in South Asia, Lanka Hospitals Fertility Centres success is founded on its clinical and professional excellence as well as its success rate, which are on par with similar outfits in the developed world.
The celebrated Fertility Centre at Lanka Hospitals is operational throughout the year and is equipped with state- of- art facilities, with a higher rate of success in IVF without disrupting the female partners menstrual cycle. It has set several benchmarks in the sub-fertility field in Sri Lanka, including the first pregnancy through Vitrified embryo transfers giving the couple several chances of conception with Frozen Embryo Replacement (FER).
Dr. Madara Ralapanawe Clinical Embryologist of Lanka Hospitals spoke of the high clinical standards of the processes involved in an IVF conception at the clinic.
Following the extraction of mature eggs from the ovaries in standard IVF, 2 to 3 eggs are inseminated with 80,000 to 100,000 sperms and will be kept in an incubator which mimics similar ambience of a fallopian tube - at 370 C  similar to body temperature, with 6% carbon dioxide and 5% Oxygen. Even the culture media used is similar to content in the fallopian tube. Here, the sperm has to swim itself in the natural way. In ICSI, or (Intra Cyto-plasmic Sperm Injection) where sperms are directly injected to mature eggs, the sperms entering of the egg can be confirmed in a lab setting. Similar to the natural process, the sperm will go-in and the egg will be fertilized becoming two pronucleai or a zygote and subsequently at the cleavage stage further division of cells take place. The success rate of fertilization is higher in ICSI as the sperm is being directly injected to the egg and fertilization and cleavage are the same as that occurs in the natural process. Explained Dr. Ralapanawe.
Lanka Hospitals not only ensures the privacy of the would- be parents but also renders vast convenience by ways of minimising hospital visits, treatment methods and hormonal injection administration, thus considerably reducing the disruption to their regular lifestyle during the IVF process.
The expectant couples do not have to transit in rented houses in Colombo just to visit the hospital throughout the cycle, which is the common practice here. As in any other developed part of the world we at Lanka Hospitals instruct the couples to self-administer the hormone injections or to consult the doctor of their convenience. The female partner only has to make about 5 visits to the hospital for the whole treatment process including 3 visits for the scans, one for egg pick-up and one for embryo transfer. These are the new practices globally and Lanka Hospitals has been practicing them for a significant period. Stated Consultant Obstetrician & Gynaecologist of Lanka Hospitals, Dr. Nishendra Karunaratne.

JICA signs grant agreements for HR Development of young Govt officials
Two grant agreements were signed on June 30 for a value of 470 million Japanese yen (equivalent to approximately Rs 640 million) between Dr. R. Samaratunga, Secretary to Ministry of Finance and Mass Media and Fusato Tanaka, Chief Representative of JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) at the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, following Exchange of Notes between Kenichi Suganuma, Ambassador of Japan and Dr. Samaratunga.
The Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) was introduced in 2009 with the purpose of developing the capabilities of young public sector officials who are expected to play a leading role in formulating and implementing socioeconomic development policies of the Government of Sri Lanka.
JDS programme facilitates Government officials to improve their analytical capacities and decision making skills. The Government of Japan through JICA provides more than 150 short-term training programmes and around 18 long-term scholarships annually in diverse fields to realize this goal, said Priyantha Ratnayake, Director General of External Resources Department. Under the first and second phase of JDS, JICA accepts 120 Sri Lankan officials from year 2009 till 2019 for two-year Master's Degree courses in reputed universities in Japan in the areas of Public Administration, Public Policy, Public Finance, Regional Development, Economics, Business Management, and Environment and Disaster Management. Currently, 90 officials have returned after successfully concluding the programme in Japan.
In parallel to ongoing assistance, JICA will further extend 120 Master's Degree seats under a third phase of JDS to be implemented from 2017 to year 2023, in increasing the cumulative number to 240 Government officials.
In addition to the Master's Degrees , a Doctoral Programme will be newly introduced and launched under a third phase of JDS, based on the results of a preparatory survey conducted in early 2017.
JIC Chief Rep. Tanaka said, JICA's assistance strategy towards Sri Lanka provides a high prominence on Human Resource Development in public sector. In this respect, the JDS programme is well known and popular for its special features, in terms of preparations and amenities provided to its fellows. A consultant assigned by JICA provides close facilitation to fellows throughout the program from the time of application to pre-departure and on-arrival to Japan.
During more than 60 years of Japan's official development assistance to Sri Lanka, JICA has been proactively lending its support to develop large and small scale economic and social infrastructure, in addition to fostering human resources and contributing to rebuilding and reconstruction efforts in the wake of manmade and natural disasters.

## Title: Korean quiz

Korean quiz
The key to successful bi-lateral ties between two countries is the attitude. It is not a case of putting it on paper  a written agreement. That is just ink on paper. What must be done is to create permanent friendships. And that needs to come from within. One powerful way of changing attitudes is through culture. Daily News attended the preliminary round of the K-Pop festival and saw and heard the love!
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Sri Lanka this year, the Embassy of the Republic of South Korea, the National Unification Advisory Council South West Asia Chapter, the Korean Residents Association of Lanka, and the Korean Businessmens Association in Sri Lanka are co-organizing a variety of programs on two separate occasions  in July and November.
The South Korean Cultural Festival 2017 was held last Saturday at the Bishops College Auditorium. The event is organised in partnership with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Culture Affairs of Sri Lanka, and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.
The 2017 Festival consists of two main events, - the Quiz-on Korea and the K-Pop World Festival.
The Quiz-on Korea is a quiz competition where the questions will be on generic topics on Korean lifestyle, traditional culture, history and language. The winner will be invited to learn and experience South Korea this September and compete with national representatives from different countries around the world to win the top prize.
The K-Pop World Festival is a K-pop performance competition, for which the Embassy has invited talented Sri Lankan vocalists and/or dancers to show their K-pop spirit on stage. Winning team(s) will stand the chance to go to South Korea for the final round and compete internationally this September, following a screening process. They will also be able to meet and perform together with K-Pop stars.
The K-Pop World Festival was proof of this Korean Wave, epitomised by K-Dramas and K-Pop. This deep interest and love for the Korean culture manifested in song and dance. The thunderous applause the performers received, coupled with the enthusiasm of the crowd lifted these performers up.
It was heartening to see young Sri Lankan girls singing in Korean. It was really very beautiful, the way they sang. This is exactly the reason why this Korean Cultural Festival has been organised over the years  the youth. Young people showing their passion for Korea culture.
It was not only the singing but the power packed dances that appealed to the audience. It showed vigour, dynamism and energy. It showed love for the Korean Culture. It showed creativity and it showed commitment. It showed why exactly song and dance can soothe the savage beast. Why it can break down barriers of prejudice.
Culture has played an important role in the relationship between our two countries. And today we are celebrating 40 years of diplomatic ties between our two countries. Our seeds of friendship have been planted in many sectors, of which culture is one. Cultural relationships between our two countries have been especially strong. We can see the South Korean Television and pop influence in Sri Lanka which is actually popular worldwide. I understand that it has a fan base amongst Sri Lankan youth. This is a cause for great happiness. Their interest in Korean language and culture is something we greatly appreciated, said South Korean Ambassador Won Sam Chang.
Because of the interest displayed by Sri Lankans, this cultural festival has been held repeatedly in Sri Lanka and the Ambassador felt that this festival has strengthened our relationships even more.
The quiz will test the participants knowledge on various sectors of South Korea and will be an excellent and rare opportunity for him/her to visit South Korea. The winner will go to South Korea representing Sri Lanka in September competing with 24 countries in the finals. I wish the participants for K-Pop all the best and wish them warmly. They will also get to display their talents in the finals in South Korea this September. K-Pop is a festival held in Korea annually since 2011. It is now spread worldwide. This year it is taking part in 70 countries, said Chang.
Chang commented that he was pleased to see the hype and enthusiasm generated because of this festival.
I am sure this festival will be something special to you and enliven you. I ask for your support in the future as well and for your keen interest and hope you will take a great interest in the Korean week scheduled to begin on November 14. This too celebrates our anniversary. I wish to thank all those who have made this event possible, added Chang.
Deputy Minister Home Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural, Palitha Thevapperuma, expressed his delight at being invited to grace the occasion.
If there is no culture in a country, the countrys morals and values suffer. Our country is now facing this threat. A culture is vital to a society, and whatever progress Sri Lanka has experienced, whatever we have, it is because of our culture. Because of external influences outside of our culture, our culture has suffered and morals and values have collapsed. I think having these sort of festivals in Sri Lanka, is very positive because, through these festivals, the cultures of the host country and foreign country equally benefit. That bond is very important. Like I said before there are external forces outside of our culture that are threatening to tear apart its fabric, said Thevapperuma
Thevapperuma highlighted the importance of preserving the environment and morals and culture.
We need to leave behind a legacy for those coming after us. We must be proud of our country as Sri Lankans and we have reason to be proud because we have achieved much in our past. We must all contribute to building our country. We must take it in the right direction. South Korea is a country with good values and is a humane country. It is a country where the citizens have proper conduct and human qualities. Its citizens are educated. We hope that our ties will continue long into the future. We must go from strength to strength, pointed out Thevapperuma
Meanwhile, celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties, the South Korea Navy Cruise Training Task Group is also scheduled to visit Colombo Port from October 26 - 29.

Lanka Hospitals IVF Centre sets industry records
The internationally accredited, multi award-winning Lanka Hospitals Colombo awaits the imminent announcement of its millennial IVF (In Vitro Fertilization - commonly known as test-tube) baby delivery.
Proven to be one of the most sophisticated facilities in South Asia, Lanka Hospitals Fertility Centres success is founded on its clinical and professional excellence as well as its success rate, which are on par with similar outfits in the developed world.
The celebrated Fertility Centre at Lanka Hospitals is operational throughout the year and is equipped with state- of- art facilities,with a higher rate of success in IVF without disrupting the female partners menstrual cycle.
It has setseveral benchmarks in the sub-fertility field in Sri Lanka, including the first pregnancy throughVitrified embryo transfersgiving the couple several chances of conception with Frozen Embryo Replacement (FER).
Dr. Madara Ralapanawe Clinical Embryologist of Lanka Hospitals spoke of the high clinical standards of the processes involved in an IVF conception at the clinic.
Following the extraction of matureeggs from the ovariesin standard IVF, 2 to 3 eggs are inseminated with 80,000 to 100,000 sperms and will be kept in an incubator which mimics similar ambience of a fallopian tube - at 370 C  similar to body temperature, with 6% carbon dioxide and5% Oxygen. Even the culture media used is similar to content in the fallopian tube. Here, the sperm has to swim itself in the natural way.
The success rate of fertilization is higher in ICSI as the sperm is being directly injected to the egg and fertilization and cleavage are thesame as that occurs in the natural process. Explained Dr.Ralapanawe.
Lanka Hospitals not only ensures the privacy of the would- be parents but also renders vast convenience by ways of minimising hospital visits, treatment methods and hormonal injection administration, thus considerably reducing the disruption to their regular lifestyle during the IVF process. The expectant couplesdo not have to transit in rented houses in Colombo just to visit the hospital throughout the cycle, which is the common practice here. As in any other developed part of the world we at Lanka Hospitals instruct the couplesto self-administer the hormone injections or to consult the doctor of their convenience.
The female partner only has to make about 5 visits to the hospital for the whole treatment process including 3 visits for the scans, one for egg pick-up and one for embryo transfer. These are the new practices globally andLanka Hospitals has been practicing them for a significant period. Stated Consultant Obstetrician & Gynaecologist of Lanka Hospitals, Dr. Nishendra Karunaratne.
Lanka Hospitals will be celebrating the birth of its millennial IVF baby, one of the most noteworthy accomplishments (since the clinics inception in 2008) in the Sri Lankan healthcare industry, in the near future.

Lanka launches first reform road-map for 111-year-old cooperative system
Cooperative Development 2020 Vision is the road-map that we are introducing to modernize this sector, said Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on 1 July.
Sri Lanka launched the first ever reform initiative for its third economic force in more than 100 years with a strong nod of encouragement from none other than the countrys head of state on July 1.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing his Ministrys 95th International Cooperative Day event held at Kurunegala on July 1, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, himself a one-time employee in a cooperative in his youth. Joining the event was Secretary of Ministry of Industry and Commerce Chinthana Lokuhetti, Wayamba Province Cooperative Minister, Gunadasa Dehigama, and Ministers Gamini Jayawickreme Perera, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, S B Navinna, T B Ekanayake, and Champika Premadasa. A cheque of Rs 100 mn from the Cooperatives Board was also handed over by President Sirisena to the Wayamba Provincial Cooperative Employee Fund at this event.
The Cooperative system is our third economic force. It was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1906, said Minister Bathiudeen addressing the event, and added, Since then it continued to follow the same traditional methods and even today, there is no change in the way it does its business. This Cooperative Development 2020 Vision is the road-map that we are introducing to modernize this sector as well as its business practices. I thank the President Maithripala Sirisena for the guidance given to us in this regard.
The cooperative sector, considered as the third economic force in Sri Lanka, has a strong presence in rural areas of the country. There are almost 14454 cooperatives employing 46000 in various productions services, SMEs, womens development, rural banking, insurance and farming active in Sri Lanka. Its asset base stands at a huge $1.8 billion with another dollar one billion in savings. The membership in SL coop system exceeds five million, a considerable number of them being women.
President Sirisena praised the Cooperative Development 2020 Vision given to him by Minister Bathiudeen. I had a look at Minister Bathiudeens Cooperatives Development 2020 Vision and I have to say he has carried out my requests on coop reforms very well in formulating it. Our Cooperative system is also facing the burden of taxes. I will discuss with Minister Bathiudeen and shall get a Cabinet Paper moved to remove some taxes on cooperatives so that they become more viable. I shall do my best to our Cooperative sector to relieve it from its issues.
The comprehensive Cooperative Development 2020, the first major reforms to be introduced in 111 years since the introduction of the system to the country, envisions modernizing this sector with the introduction of modern business practices, strengthening sub sectors, introducing new information technology, and connecting more youth to the network.

Licensed banks adopt Basel III capital standards
From July 1, licensed banks in Sri Lanka adopted minimum capital standards based on the Direction issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in late 2016. This Direction is in line with the Basel III guidelines issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) related to capital, leverage and liquidity in order to strengthen resilience of banks.
Basel III capital standards endeavour to strengthen the quantity and quality of capital in banks through the introduction of capital buffers in addition to the minimum capital requirement as follows: capital conservation buffer which is required to be built during good times to be drawn down in a stressed situation; countercyclical capital buffers to curb excessive credit growth and asset bubbles in the financial system; and capital buffer for systemically important banks (SIBs) to avoid a systemic risk.
Licensed banks will meet the increased Basel III minimum capital requirements against risk weighted assets on a staggered basis in line with the international timeline for full implementation by January 1, 2019 as follows:
Six licensed banks identified as domestic systemically important banks with assets of Rs.500 billion and above, accounting for 71% of the banking sector assets will need to enhance their capital from the current 10% to 14%.
All other licensed banks with assets less than Rs.500 billion from the current 10% to 12.5%.
In 2015, the banks implemented the Liquidity Coverage Ratio in terms of the Banking Act Direction issued under the Basel III Liquidity Standards.
Capital planning processes of banks have been further strengthened to enable banks to be compliant with the stringent rules under Basel III.
Large state banks and private sector banks in Sri Lanka have been augmenting capital through the infusion of fresh capital and retention of profits.
It is intended that small state-owned banks will be consolidated to further strengthen their capital positions and to grow their balance sheets.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is assessing the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessments compiled by banks reflecting the capital position, risk management and business expansion over the medium term and will continue to monitor the implementation of the Basel III standards in banks.
Licensed banks in Sri Lanka will meet the requirements of July 1, 2017 and going forward banks are expected to further enhance their capital. This is expected to boost the ability of the banking sector to attract funds for expansion at a reduced risk premia benefitting the economy of Sri Lanka.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka envisages issuing guidelines to banks on Basel III: Leverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio standards in line with the international timelines.

Mahapola injected money into NatWealth Securities: Counsel
Due to the losses incurred by the NatWealth Securities Limited, the Mahapola Trust Fund, which finances the said company, had to inject an extra amount of money for its operations, it was revealed yesterday at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue.
NatWealth Securities Limited is a primary dealer fully funded by the Mahapola Scholarship Trust Fund.
The losses incurred by NatWealth Securities are due to incorrect reading of the bond market and the erroneous decision making, Counsel Romali Thudawe suggested, leading evidence at the Commission through Assistant Senior Manager N.K.B.Meegolla of the said company.
Meegolla agreed that Mahapola in fact had to inject money into NatWealth Securities but denied the losses incurred were due to wrong decision making.
Meegolla also said that there is no research team attached to NatWealth Securities to study the bond market behaviours.
Counsel Romali Thudawa also suggested that losses incurred by NatWealth Securities in the years 2015 and 2016, are not due to the questioned Treasury bond transaction held on February 27,2015,even though evidence was led to mean so.
She pointed out that NatWealth Securities had in fact gained a profit from selling the Treasury bond they purchased at the questioned auction.
The losses incurred by the NatWealth Securities are due to other trades they have failed in gaining profits, Counsel Romali Thudawa who represents Perpetual Treasuries Limited pointed out.
Eventhough Meegolla stated that the bid they placed at the February 27,2015 auction was a dummy bid, the said bid would have been accepted even if the Public Debt Departments initial recommendation to accept Rs. 2.6 billion was implemented on that day, Counsel Romali Thudawa also pointed out.
Meanwhile,Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva questioning the same witness asked whether his company incurred losses after he took office at the company, to which Meegolla answered in the affirmative.
Meegolla, asked to explain what followed the questioned bond transaction on February 27, 2015, said a meeting was called upon the next working day by the Association of Primary Dealers to discuss regarding the matter. Meegolla said representatives of all primary dealers participated the said meeting.
Commissioner Retired Deputy Auditor General V. Kandasamy asked if a representative from the PTL also participated the said meeting. Meegolla said, if his memory serves correct, the CEO of the Perpetual Treasuries Kasun Palisena attended the meeting.
He observed that the representative of the PTL kept silent at the meeting while other Primary Dealers raised their concerns and demanded to meet the Superintendent of Debt of the Central Bank.
We were updated on the Central Banks decisions on policy rate changes, only after the questioned Treasury bond auction was held. We took it as the Central Bank misleading the Primary Dealers. That is why we wanted to meet the SPD of the Central Bank. Meegolla explained.
Meegolla further said a meeting was held subsequently at the Central Bank regarding the matter on March 23,2015. He said, he has the minutes of that meeting which was sent to him by the Public Debt Department.
An argument broke out between Acting Attorney General Dappula de Livera and counsel Chanaka de Silva regarding marking the document.
De Silva said, since the witness cannot confirm the content of the minutes, the said evidence cannot be marked through Meegolla. De Livera pointed out to the Commission that the meeting minutes do not reflect the Primary Dealers point of view.
De Silva said, when the private counsels make a submission, the AGs panel should not try to ridicule the submission and shut them down. This is not a one sided hearing. De Silva pointed out.
While Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake was leading evidence, Meegolla said the PTL breached the Primary Dealers Code of Conduct by allowing the Bank of Ceylon to bid on behalf of them at the questioned Treasury bond auction held on 27 February 2015. Meegolla said the breaching was regarding the confidentiality clause in the Code of Conduct regarding the Primary Dealers.
Former Dealer in the Capital Alliance Indika Mendis, also gave evidence before the Commission yesterday.

Major demand for eye lenses with free supply
The demand for eye lenses has gone up by 61,000 due to the availability of free eye lenses for patients who undergo eye surgeries at State hospitals, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated.
Minister Senaratne said a total of 89,000 eye lenses are imported to Sri Lanka to provide eye lenses for patients free of charge. Now the demand has gone up to 150,000 eye lenses.
He said so after opening several development projects completed at Ratnapura General Hospital at a cost of Rs. 300 million.
Minister Senaratne also stated that new State Medical Faculties will be set up for Moratuwa and Sabaragamuwa universities. The number of medical students enrolled at Karapitiya Medical Faculty will be increased to 300 from 150. The demand for doctors will go up by three fold in the future, he said.
No country in the world produces the entire requirement of doctors for that country. Another new hospital will be set up in Sri Lanka and the investment for this hospital has already been received. Medical tourism will be introduced to Sri Lanka soon. All university students will be provided with hostels by 2018, he added.

Minister promises all measures to protect World Heritage Sites
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday promised to take all measures to protect the World Heritage Sites and other archaeological sites despite various protests orchestrated by people with vested interests.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department, Minister Kariyawasam said that some bankrupt politicians are attempting to gain political advantage by charging that the government is going to take over the assets of temples.
Some politicians who had stolen artifacts and destroyed some historical sites are now pointing fingers at us. They even called me Bahirawaya. I like them calling me Bahirawaya since Bahirawaya is the one who protects valuable places or things. As a Buddhist, I am ready to be a Bahirawaya to protect places of religious and historical value,the Minister said.
Minister Kariyawasam said the Archeological Department has the authority to issue tickets for the places which have been gazetted as the World Heritage Sites and archeological monuments. The purpose of issuing tickets is not to misuse these sites. Such types of malpractices occurred in the past. But, now there is no room for such malpractices. People are free to inquire about any topic or subject under the Right to Information Act.
He further said that the income of the Central Cultural Fund had been increased by Rs.600 million last year.
Denying allegations that the government was going to take over the Rangiri Dambulla Viharaya, Minister Kariyawasam revealed that they are taking action to curb corruption within the temple following a request made by the Rangiri Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Dr.Godagama Sri Mangala Thera.
"Sending a letter in February this year, Ven.Mangala Thera asked me to conduct an investigation into the alleged malpractices and corruption which has been taking place at the temple," the Minister said.
On an inspection of the World Heritage Site,we found that the antiquities were in a precarious condition and no maintenance had been done to protect and preserve it despite the large income earned by the temple, Minister Kariyawasam said.
"UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova on a recent visit to the temple said Dambulla was at risk of being removed from the World Heritage Site list,"the minister said.
We cannot approve of the acts of certain Buddhist monks who have been running the temple. Since the early 1980s and up to 1996, it was the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) which issued tickets to foreigners,but in 1996, the monks pressurised the government to stop that practice. But,after 2009, the monks started issuing tickets priced at Rs.1,500 each to foreigners,he said.
He pointed out that according to the Antiquities Ordinance,the Archaeology Department is entitled to issue a ticket.
"The Dambulla Temple which comes under the Vihara Devalagam Ordinance is required to submit their yearly accounts for auditing purposes to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs. According to that report, the annual income of the temple in 2015 was Rs 2,971,000 and the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs has also certified this. But we cannot accept this since the annual income of the temple remained as Rs.2,919,900 in 2000 where the price of the entrance ticket for foreigners was between 3-4 dollars. The present value of an entrance ticket is priced Rs.1,500," the Minister said.
Our investigations show that they would at least earn between Rs.2-8 million a day on average, the minister said.
The Minister stressed that though the temple had been collecting the money they had not spent it for maintenance and preservation and instead had built illegal structures, leading to the damage to the archaeological value of the site. The Central Cultural Fund has spent Rs.50 million this year.
"The Central Cultural Fund can utilise this money for the preservation of all sites. We have already taken measures to provide funds of less than Rs 500,000 each for the renovation activities of 150 temples.
The Minister further charged that the administration of the Dambulla Rangiri Viharaya has not allowed Central Cultural Fund officials deployed for the maintenance of this world heritage site to enter the premises.
"The paintings of the Dambulla Cave Temple are in danger due to the absence of proper maintenance," Minister Kariyawasam added.

New faces refresh Government
This week proved to be a very eventful one in the local political scene with several issues coming to the fore. Last week, we saw the resignation of Presidential Secretary P.B. Abeykoon over what he called personal reasons. Later on, Defence Secretary Eng. Karunaratne Hettiarachchi, who had succeeded Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, also tendered his resignation. This created vacancies for two of the top positions in the Governance structure.
When these two appointments were made after the formation of the Yahapalana Government in 2015, many who had the interests of Yahapalanaya at heart expressed reservations. Several websites which were supportive of the Yahapalana Government had mercilessly criticised the two officials. However, these faded away as the two officials settled into their respective jobs.
With the second anniversary of the Rainbow Coalitions victory in August 2015 looming, the Government is now having a new look with a new Presidential Secretary as well as a new Defence Secretary in place. This time, two officials with impeccable credentials and a great track record have been selected for the two top jobs in the Government sector.
New Secretary to the President Austin Fernando, who assumed duties yesterday, is no stranger to high posts, having held several very senior positions. His most recent position was as Governor of the Eastern Province. A former Defence Secretary and reputed civil service officer, Austin Fernando retired as a senior official in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) before he was appointed as an adviser and later Governor, Eastern Province by the President. He has a Special Degree in Economics from the University of Kelaniya in 1980 and a Diploma in Agriculture from the School of Agriculture, Kundasale in 1981. He has a Masters in Development Management (MOM) from the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) Manila, the Philippines in 1995. He is one of the most experienced civil servants in Sri Lanka.
Fernando, an old boy of Richmond College, Galle, is the author of My Belly is White: Reminiscences of a Peacetime Secretary of Defence. He is reported to be writing an autobiographical book in Sinhalese which is due to be published soon. Addressing Presidential Secretariat staff after assuming duties, he encouraged the staff to discuss and present their ideas for projects that could benefit the country.
Bring your different ideas about strengthening peace and harmony in the country to the table. Its always what we want to do. We have to work as a family. We have to be open and ready to listen to new ideas from veterans as well as those who think out of the box. We are discussing a model of cluster formation of ministries. It is a model we are now thinking about to enhance the public administration,s efficiency, he said.
New Defence Secretary, Presidents Counsel Kapila M Waidyaratne was Senior Additional Solicitor General at the Attorney Generals Department. He has a Bachelor of Arts (Economics) from the University of Colombo and an MA in International Relations from the University of Colombo. He served as a trial attorney at the UN International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia from 1998-2003. He joined the Attorney Generals Department in 1983 and was confirmed in his ASG post in January 2015. He has represented the Department at many conferences here and aboard. He is an old boy of S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia.
The Army Commanders post also fell vacant with the promotion of former Commander, General Crishantha de Silva as Chief of Defence Staff. The Armys Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. N.U.M. Mahesh Senanayake RWP RSP USP was appointed as the new Army Commander. He is the 22nd Army Commander of Sri Lanka. Prior to his appointment as the Army Chief of Staff on March 22, he served as Commander of the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters. Before he was appointed as the Commander, Security Forces - Jaffna, he served as the Military Secretary at the Army Headquarters. He joined the Sri Lankan Army in the year 1981, after receiving his education at Ananda College, Colombo.
Senanayake was sidelined by the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa Government on the basis that he had been loyal to Field Marshal (then General) Sarath Fonseka, who contested the January 2010 Presidential Election as the Common candidate against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Following the arrest of General Fonseka on flimsy charges following his defeat, many Army Officers who were believed to have been loyal to him were also subject to interdiction and/or harassment. Some of them migrated while those who remained in the Service were not granted due recognition and promotions. Many of those who had left the Service before retirement age were reinstated once the present Government came to power.
Lt. Gen. Senanayake has also served the staff appointment of Colonel General Staff, 52 Division and Brigadier General Staff at the Security Force Headquarters, Jaffna during the most critical phases of the humanitarian operations before May 2009. Senanayake had actively contributed to almost all the major military operations, conducted in the North and the East of Sri Lanka during a span of more than 30 years. He is a graduate of the prestigious United States Army Command and General Staff College and also had the distinction of working with the US Army as the Senior Manager Project Management of Afghan Operations and Strategic Planning for Civil Reserved Air Fleet (CRAF). Besides, he holds a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Civil Engineering from the Jawaharlal Nehru University of India.
The events of last week left one other appointment to be filled. The President picked former Foreign Minister (2007-2010) Rohitha Bogollagama to be the new Governor of the Eastern Province, following the departure of Austin Fernando to Colombo to head the Presidential Secretariat. Bogollagama entered Parliament in 2000 from the UNP and crossed over to the SLFP in 2004. An old boy of Ananda College, Colombo, Bogollagama took oaths as an Attorney-at-Law in 1976. He had held the ministerial portfolios of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion, Advanced Technology and National Enterprise and Industries. Bogollagama did not retain his seat at the 2010 Election and has largely kept away from active politics for a number of years.
Uma Oya
Uma Oya continues to haunt this Government, although it originated under the previous regime. The President has appointed a three-member ministerial committee to look into the whole saga. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a member of this committee, said their visit to the area was hindered by a group led by the JVPs Samantha Vidyaratne. There are only two options on Uma Oya before the Government  stoppage or continuation. The Government is saddled between a rock and hard place, since much of the project has been completed and all the funds used for the projects would be in vain if it is stopped. On the other hand, the project risks causing further environmental and structural damage. A team of Norwegian experts will soon be in Sri Lanka to scrutinise the project and give their verdict. The Government is also probing claims that there had been corruption on a massive scale during the previous Governments bidding process for Uma Oya, whose waters are to be diverted to the Hambantota area through a 20 Km long tunnel. Uma Oya naturally supplies water to the North Central Province, which is an equally dry area like Hambantota itself.
Garbage, the other most important public issue facing the Government, is constantly in the news. The government group which met under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has agreed to give full authority to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to end the issue with regard to waste disposal and management in the Colombo City. Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said the President and Prime Minister have agreed to give full authority to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to solve the waste disposal issue in Colombo city within six months. Minister Patali gave an assurance that he can end the waste disposal issue within six months if he is given necessary powers. The President and the Prime Minister agreed to grant him authority to eradicate this issue soon, Deputy Minister Ramanayake said. In a previous turn as Environment Minister, Ranawaka had initiated a recycling drive and other successful garbage disposal systems.
SAITM issue
Minister Ranawaka, who is no stranger to controversy, incidentally figured in a matter pertaining to the controversial SAITM issue. Ranawaka, perhaps the lone anti-SAITM voice in the Government, reiterated his demand that SAITM be shut down. Addressing the media at the Party Office in Battaramulla, Ranawaka stressed that SAITM should be legally abolished as a permanent measure and not as a temporary one pending the Supreme Court decision. Minister Ranawaka emphasised the necessity of ensuring justice for the students recruited for the medical degree during the past eight years. The SAITM issue cannot be solved on the streets or at hospitals and it can only be solved through a transparent agreement between the Government and the SLMC followed by an in-depth analysis of the issue, the Minister said.
Minister Ranawaka charged that the architect of SAITM was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Without stopping there, the Minister disclosed that the former President had actually intended to open three more private medical colleges. The Minister also expressed the view that Prof. Carlo Fonseka should continue to head the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Meanwhile, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has apparently postponed their strike over the SAITM issue planned for today. No reason for the one-week postponement was immediately announced by the GMOA, but there was a severe public backlash over its last strike which hampered work at hospitals island-wide amidst the dengue epidemic.
There was some confusion over the fate of the Anti Corruption Committee Secretariat (ACCS), which many speculated could be shut down. However, all indications are that it will resume operations and continue the anti-corruption drive. A drive against corruption and action against corrupt deals of the previous regime was one of the main election pledges of the Yahapalana Government and the ACCS was the result of that pledge. Led by the Prime Minister, the secretariat has a sub-committee and a rapid response committee. The secretariat also has its own short-term and long-term goals. The secretariat functioned at its premises near Temple Trees for 28 months.
The Government has also turned its attention to the looming power crisis. Now that the LNG plant t Sampur has been ruled out, the Government has to meet that shortfall of 500 MW through other power projects. A solar power plant at the same venue will generate around 50 MW while a 240 MW wind power plant is also envisaged (Sri Lanka has an estimated total wind power potential of 5000 MW). The project aligns with the governments targets to increase renewable energy share by up to 100 percent by 2030. The government has decided to build the wind and solar farms in the Northern regions because they receive less rainfall throughout the year than the rest of the country, and are therefore more suitable as locations for renewable energy generation. Unless immediate action is taken, the power issue threatens to become a huge political issue as well.
Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator has asked the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to develop 12 new scenarios which will provide different power plant combinations and submit on or before July 7. The PUCSL said these scenarios should be developed with updated prices for coal, natural gas and oil and with the cost of externalities (Social and environmental costs) and should be submitted together with input data. This should ensure that the CEB can meet the power demand for the next 20 years. Solar and the wind are likely to be a major driving force in the power mix. The Government has already started a Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Power), a net metering solution for businesses, homes and factories.
Donor conference
Meanwhile, a four-member ministerial team has been established to make preparations for the upcoming donor conference to seek funding to rehabilitate the areas devastated by recent floods and landslides. The team headed by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera includes Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake. Finance Ministry Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga will act as the Secretary to the Committee. No date has been set yet for the conference, which is to be held in Colombo so that any donor representatives can tour the affected areas to check the damage first hand. This is likely to be a success with the Governments new approach to international relations, talking of which the new Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake is already implementing some of the new policy initiatives. The former Governments Look Africa policy is being replaced with careful adjustments, such as the proposed shifting of the Sri Lankan embassy in the Seychelles to Antananarivo in Madagascar, where a lot of Sri Lankans are engaged in the gem trade. Winning the world is a priority for the Government and Minister Karunanayake, though entirely new to the subject, is already proving his mettle. The forthcoming Donor Conference would add another feather to his cap.

No need for new Constitution: Mahanayake Theras
The Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas yesterday decided that there is no need to bring in new Constitution. The Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas were of the view that a new Constitution will create more conflicts in the country.
They proposed that the government bring in an amendment to the Constitution changing the existing electoral system.
The Maha Sangha opined that the existing electoral system has led to create division among the politicians of same party. They viewed that the electoral system which creates divisions among the members of same party needs to be changed immediately.
The Mahanayake Theras of the Three Nikayas made these decisions following a discussion held at the auditorium of Palipana Sri Chandrananda School of the Asgiriya Maha viharaya in Kandy.
The Mahanayake of Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven.Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera, Mahanayake of Ramannya Maha Nikaya Most Ven. Napane Premasiri Thera,

NOLIMIT listed among top 25 Best Companies to Work for in Sri Lanka
NOLIMIT was listed in the top 25 best companies to work for in Sri Lanka for the second consecutive year, by the Great Place to Work Institute at the recently held gala awards ceremony.
The 2017 study conducted in partnership with LMD business magazine and the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce evaluated over 110 organizations across 16 sectors representing an employee population of 31,000 out of which 18,800 employees were surveyed.
The prestigious accolade places NOLIMIT side by side with all the corporate stalwarts in the country. Sri Lanka is one of the 57countries that contribute to this global study, which is the largest of its kind. This year is the fifth consecutive year of the study in Sri Lanka.
An exclusive employee-focused framework is used to evaluate the levels of trust, pride and fellowship that exist in an organization through the Trust Index survey, which is a proprietary employee tool developed by the Great Place To Work Institute.
The definition of a Great Place to Work is reflected on three vital relationships that demonstrate employees trust in the people for whom they work and pride in what they do, and friendship among the people with whom they work. Employee experience is not only evaluated under the five dimensions of the Great Place to Work model.
Riswan Mohamed, Manager Human Resources at NOLIMIT commented, To be adjudged as one of Sri Lankas best 25 companies to work for is an honour that gives us great pride. We always strive to value and appreciate a culturally diverse workforce which has enabled us to recruit and retain the best talent and that has been our biggest strength. We have earned a reputation as a caring employer and have successfully built a strong foundation of trust that has become very evident in this study helping to prove that NOLIMIT is indeed a Great Place to Work.
NOLIMIT has several salient people practices that keep employees happy and contented. One is the strong teamwork among the staff who have been extensively trained to exceed service expectations.
We have over two decades of catering to Sri Lankas fashion trends, providing quality shopping for the nation. Our employees are proud to see the stores progressing and take ownership of our success pointed out Amjad Hassan, General Manager of NOLIMIT.

Open to indifference
Absurd refers to unreasonableness, foolishness, and Nihilism is the complete rejection of political institutions, religious and moral beliefs. It includes total rejection of all existence and objective reality.
Nihilism is derived from the Latin word nihil which means nothing. Nihilism appeared in Ivan Turgenevs novel Fathers and Sons. In it, Bazarov, a doctor is continually in conflict with others, stands alone and believes in nothing. Fredrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus denied objective truths and accepted values. Existentialism owes to the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard (1813-1855) and was popularised by Sartre (1905-1990). It states that man is a unique and isolated individual in an indifferent or hostile universe responsible for his own actions and free to choose his destiny.
Annihilated at death
The Buddhist text, Samannaphala Sutta, mentions six sectarian teachers who advocated incoherent ways of living. Of these Purana Kassapa believed that good and evil deeds were equally devoid of any religious significance. Makkali Gosala was a fatalist. Ajita Kesakambala held a materialist view that man is annihilated at death. Pakuda Kaccayana held the view that human beings disperse at death. These four teachers were ethical nihilists who denied the existence of moral causation. Ajita Kesakambali held a strong philosophical opinion of ethical nihilism (natthikavada). Makkhali Gosala roundly denied all initiative and choice in man (akiriyavada). Pakudha Kaccayana who professed a fatalistic pluralism based on the Upanishadic concept of the indestructibility and the unchangeability of the atman has been called sasatavada or eternalism.
However, in ethics, it leads to an akiriyavada or amoralism. Nihilism and fatality have been valued concepts in the past. The story of Angulimala illustrates absurdity and nihilism. The Guru ordered Ahinsaka to present a garland of 1000 human fingers (angulimala). This absurd request made. Ahinsaka becomes an outlaw who resorted to cutting off a finger from each traveller. He was making a garland of fingers (angulimala). Which too was absurd. The philosophical doctrine of sunayavada (The way of emptiness) is not equated with nihilism as the term is equivalent in meaning to suchness (tathata) and ultimate reality or ultimate truth (dharma-dhatu). Great Emptiness (Maha sunyata) is the abandonment of even the notion of emptiness.
There is a glimmer or a glimpse of the absurd in Shakespeares Hamlet who at times performs meaningless actions in a state of madness or disillusionment. He is at one and the same time gentle and cruel, loving and vindictive, a deeply reflective introvert and a man capable of acting on impulse.
Detached introvert
Kulasuriya in Martin Wickramasinghes novel Viragaya appears to be an absurd character living a fake existence shunning social and economic ambitions. This statement is only a presupposition. Alienation is a strong theme in Viragaya. Aravinda appears to be a disinterested, uninitiated and detached introvert. Aravinda matured spiritually with experiences and lived a fruitful life. So there is no evidence to label him as an absurd, nihilist and existentialist character like Meursault in Albert Camus novel The Outsider.
The Outsider inspired a variety of interpretations. Jean-Paul Sartre described it as an existentialist novel. Other critics like Bree, Thody and Cruickshank described Meursault as a mere representative of the authors absurdist views. The novel is in two parts. Part One Chapter one introduces the unusual protagonist, Meursault. He is not moved at receiving a telegram that his mother has died in an old peoples home. When going to attend her funeral he sleeps through the journey. The caretaker wanted to show mothers corpse. Meursault declines to see it. He was not a mourner. He drank coffee and smoked a cigarette. His behaviour at the funeral was unconventional. Chapter 2 reveals that he is unaware of his mothers age.
He expresses his sensory experiences while enjoying a movie (a comedy) with Marie. This happens on the day following his mothers death. He enjoys smoking, eating chocolates, and spending that afternoon in a lazy manner. All these behaviour patterns indicate his absurd character. His attitudes are neutral. His attitudes and actions are linked to personal freedom of choice. But Meursault is able to cope with and manage the tragic change. Later chapters reveal his unassuming and disinterested disposition.
Robot woman
To the question of Marie Do you love me Meursault says that the question has no meaning. He is interested in love and sees the incident of his friend Raymonds beating his mistress, Meursault refrains from calling the police as he does not like the police. He is not ambitious. He is willing to marry Marie but shuns a marriage ceremony. He expresses a curiosity to the little robot woman whom he thinks that she is spiritless and mechanical in behaviour. Chapter six is the gruelling chapter with a climax on an unusually hot Sunday on the beach. Meursault is suffering from a sunstroke and is also after a couple of drinks. Meursault murders the Arab (Raymonds cousin) under unavoidable circumstances. There is no premeditation. But why does he fire four more shots after the first shot But he does not repent.
In Part Two, the court proceedings are described. Meursault refuses to lie to save himself or for the sake of lessening his punishments. His heatstroke is not given any consideration in the proceedings. The prosecution lawyer proves that Mersault is an absurd person, a nihilist and an existentialist.
The magistrate considers him to be an outsider who does not believe in social conventions. Meursault is not remorseful over shooting the Arab. His view is that the adverse circumstances caused the shooting. Mersaults responses imply that life has no meaning. In the prison, he speaks to the chaplain in a strange manner. He denies the existence of God and an afterlife. He is aware that death is certain and later refuses to see the chaplain. While awaiting his execution, he realises that he has lived happily. His last wish is that there should be a crowd of spectators at his execution and that they should greet him with cries of hatred.
Meursault has been a subject suffering from a depressive mood disorder. Depressive mood disorder is a relatively common disorder, and its recurrent nature disrupts patients lives. It has a lifetime prevalence of 17% 15-20% of patients with depression commit suicide. Meursault exhibits symptoms related to an impairment of emotions, cognition, human relationships and behaviour. His experiences and feelings are unusual. He is alienated as he observes the absurdity of life but continues to live accepting death to occur at any time. Meursault has been convicted largely on evidence unrelated to premeditation of a crime but on character assassination.
He remains a cryptic intellectual.

Lotteries sans draw date or numbers
CID to probe into Bandula Gunawardenas statement
The CID will probe into MP Bandula Gunawardenas statement on the sale of lottery tickets sans a draw date or draw numbers, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake told Parliament yesterday.
The minister was making a special statement in reply to the charges made by MP Gunawardena regarding the National Lotteries Board (NLB) at a Joint Opposition media conference on June 25. The minister said the pieces of paper displayed by MP Gunawardena were not lottery tickets, but an art work of Govisetha lottery.
No complaint has been received from the sales network or customers in this regard.
The matter has been handed over to the CID for investigations.
The NLB seeks legal advice on the future course of action, he said.
MP Gunawardena should go before the CID and make a statement in this regard. If he does not do that, we will make sure that he will be summoned. There are nine lotteries of the NLB in the market.
Three million lotteries are printed daily. The irresponsible statement of the MP could have affected the sales of the lottery tickets, he said.
The minister said the monopoly of printing of lottery tickets held by a company for 20 years, was broken in 2016 by adopting a competitive bidding process.
JO MP Sisira Jayakody, raising a point of order, questioned the authority of Minister Karunanayake to make statements relating to the NLB stating that the auditing of the NLB comes under the purview of the Finance Minister.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the statement was in order as the NLB has been gazetted under the Foreign Ministry.
IDPs entitled to get registered as voters
Parliament yesterday passed the Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) Bill allowing Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to get registered as voters in the electoral district where they permanently resided prior to May 18, 2009.
The Bill was moved for the debate by Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe and was passed with amendments.
The amendments were to revise the definition of internally displaced persons and to apply the provision to the entire country without restricting it to the North and East.
According to the Bill, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Registration of Electors Act No 44 of 1980 and subject to Article 89 of the Constitution, any citizen of Sri Lanka who has been an Internally Displaced Person, whose name appeared in the register of elections for any electoral district for any year until the end of 2009 and whose name has not been entered in any register in operation subsequent to the year 2009, will be able to register in the electoral district he had been living prior to May 18 2009.
However, those who have not reached the age of 18 at the time, he or she got displaced and those children of displaced persons who have been born after the displacement will not be entitled to this facility.
Body parts mixed with waste at Muthurajawela
Minister Musthapha rebuts rumours
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday in Parliament denied the claim that human body parts have been mixed with waste dumped at Muthurajawela.
The minister replying to a question by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said human body parts from hospitals and mortuaries are incinerated by the health authorities at incineration plants in Welisara.
He said the government will construct a sanitary landfill and compost plant at Muthurajawela. Another sanitary landfill would come up in Aruwakkalu in Puttalam with railway connectivity, he said.
The ministry is carrying out a detailed survey of existing dump sites to see the possibility of converting them to environmentally friendly sanitary landfills. We need to resolve land issues and construct at least two sanitary landfills in every district. We have planned to purchase 100 garbage compactors from local funds and another 151 from Korean soft loans to improve waste transportation facilities of the Local Government authorities, Minister Musthapha said.
He said a taskforce would be set up to monitor waste management activities in Colombo and the suburbs. We will prepare a waste collection and disposal master plan for each province with the support of all stakeholders. We will hand over the summary of the report to the President on July 17, the minister said. He said three waste to energy plants would be set up at Karadiyana, Muthurajawela and Moratuwa with the help of other ministries for waste in the Colombo metropolitan area and Gampaha district.
JO members protest against dumping garbage in Muthurajawela
Joint Opposition members yesterday in Parliament protested against the dumping of garbage in Muthurajawela.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena raising a question under the Standing Order (23) 2, asked the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister to explain the Governments plans to tackle the municipal solid waste and garbage issue effectively.
The collection and disposal of domestic, commercial and industrial waste and garbage is not being carried out to the satisfaction of people. Piles of garbage are seen rotting by the roadsides and dumped in environmentally sensitive places throughout the country. This affects the environment the health of the people. It is a major cause of dengue epidemic he said.
The MP asked whether the Government would give attention to the plea of Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith to put an end to dumping garbage at Delatura, Ja-Ela. The MP quoting the Cardinal said human body parts discarded by hospitals were mixed with garbage and they posed a serious health hazard to those living in the area.
MP Gunawardena asked the Government to end haphazard dumping of waste and adopt long term solutions to the garbage problem.
Appeals of the Maha Sanga, other religious leaders and public representatives have brought the attention of the Government to similar situations cross the country. Will the Government pay attention to the proposal by the Joint Opposition after the Meetotamulla debacle to hold the Local Government election Gunawardena questioned.
He asked the Government to implement an emergency programme to deal with the crisis and incorporate the public and their organisations towards transparent and effective planning for the collection and disposal of local bodies' solid waste and garbage.
Minister Faiszer Musthapha replied to the questions raised by the MP. The JO members who were unsatisfied by the ministers reply protested in the well of the House demanding not to destroy the sensitive ecosystem in Muthurajawela by dumping garbage. MPs Niroshan Premaratne, Prasanna Ranaweera, Prasanna Ranatunga, Sisira Jayakody and Indika Anurudha were engaged in a heated argument in the House.
Sumanthiran locks horns with Mano Ganesan
A heated argument broke out between National Dialogue Minister and Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Leader Mano Ganesan and TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran at the Steering Committee meeting yesterday, Parliamentary sources said. The Steering Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met yesterday at the Parliamentary complex to discuss the interim report on Constitutional reforms. The argument was over the Tamil parties agreement on the proposed Constitutional reforms.
MP Sumanthiran charged Minister Ganesan that the latter had allegedly made a statement that Tamil parties had given their consent to the reforms. Minister Ganesan, while denying making such a statement, however, stood his ground that there was nothing wrong in saying so as the Tamil parties have not opposed to the proposed amendments. As the argument dragged on, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe intervened to calm down the two members, stating the issue could be resolved through discussion outside the meeting room. Parliamentary sources said the Steering Committee meeting was cut short as a result of the argument.
The Steering Committee will meet today and tomorrow to finalise the interim report.
Kande Vihara monies counted on request: Wijayadasa Rajapakshe
Buddhist Affairs Commissioner General intervened in counting the monies in temple collection boxes following a request made by the Aluthgama Kande Vihara temple Chief Incumbent, Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Rajapaksa said the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs did so as it is his duty according to the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities Act.
Making a statement, the minister said the chief incumbent of the temple informed that the till boxes at the temple were overflowing and requested in writing for the government's assistance to count them and deposit the money in bank accounts as it was the practice.
Minister Rajapaksa said the law applicable to temples and devalas is included in the Buddhist Temporalities Act. Those institutions are functioning under the provisions of the Act.
"The Government does not involve in the affairs of those institutions if there is no request from their authorities," the minister said. He said the Kande Vihara temple developed rapidly under the leadership of its current chief incumbent. "According to the Buddhist Temporalities Act, there are two types of temples. According to the provisions of the Act, the Public Trustee should maintain accounts on the income received by those temples. It is the duty of the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs to deposit such monies in bank accounts. The Temple of Tooth Relic, Kataragama Devale, Seenigama Devale, Adams Peak temple and Kande Vihare too come under the category of temples, monies of which should be deposited by the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, the minister said.
He said that there are 258 such temples and devales according to the section 4.1 of the Act. He said whenever the till boxes of the temples were filled, the chief incumbent informs it to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs. He said the officials go to the temples and count those monies and seal the boxes. With regard to the Kande Vihare instance, the chief incumbent had informed the commissioner in writing that the tills were full and asked the latter's help to count them.
"That was how the tills were opened and monies were counted," the minister said.

Party leaders agreed to hold debate on LG Election Bill this week
Political party leaders agreed to hold a debate on the Local Government Election Bill within this week.
They arrived at this decision at the party leaders' meeting yesterday.
The agreement was reached following Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena demanded to hold a debate on the amendment within this week to hold the Local Government election soon. He made this demand during a debate following his special statement made under the standing order 23 (2).
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said although MP Gunawardena demanded to hold a debate on the Local Government Election Bill, he did not make the demand at the party leaders' meeting.
Minister Kiriella said he had no objection to discuss the matter at the next Party Leaders' meeting to hold the debate within this week.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya too observed that that matter had to be discussed at the party leader's meeting and action should be taken in accordance with its decision.
Responding to MP Gunawardena's statement, Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said he had taken every effort to expedite the measures to hold the Local Government election within his capacity. It was up to the House to pass the amendment to the Bill to hold the election, he said.
MP Gunawardena said the debate on the Local Government Amendment Bill had not been brought into the agenda of this week.
"Although you demand to hold the debate on the Local Government Election Bill here, you did not make the same request at the party leaders' meeting," Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
"We have no objection to discuss the matter at the next party leaders' meeting," he said.
When the JO Parliamentary Group Leader stated that Minister Mustapha had postponed the Local Government election by way of a gazette notification, Minister Mustahpa said the Extra Ordinary Gazette on Friday postponed the operation of Local Government bodies to a further period of three months.
He assured that if the Local Government election would be held before October 1, he would bring the date in the gazette to an early date by way of another gazette notification.

'Responsibility of the government to fulfil peoples mandate'

It is the responsibility of the government to fulfil peoples mandate, even the Mahanayake Theras are a part of it said Cabinet Spokesperson and Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Rajitha Senarathne, today.
He made this observation at the cabinet press conference when asked aboutthe Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of three Nikayas decision that there is no need to bring in new Constitution as it will create more conflicts in the country.
The final decision has to be made by the parliament. Six committees have been appointed in which some secretaries are from the opposition. The whole parliament now sits in as a constitution assembly like in 1972. The reports formulated by these six committees will be submitted to the Parliament. If it is passed by two thirds majority and if the Supreme Court orders to go for a referendum, people can come up with their opinions, he said.
Minister Senaratne said that before objecting to the drafting of the new constitution, they should understand the real objectives and questioned for how long that the country can run without a new constitution.
We are formulating the new constitution to implement it and not just to keep watching. People can express their views and opinions when it is completed. We cannot come to a final decision based on opinions forwarded by some organizations. It has been clearly stated that the new constitution will be implemented only if the Sinhala majority agrees to it, he said.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that even in the past important decisions like making the Tamil language one of the national languages and devolving the power were opposed initially but later they were introduced.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the final draft of the constitution is not yet completed and it is still under discussion.
Many have expressed their opinions individually as well as a party. Some they agree to the proposals made at the committee meeting but would go out and object it, he said.
He stressed that the people need to understand the real objectives behind the need for a new constitution for the betterment of the country.

Rhythm of harmony
Nadatheertha 2017, the brainchild of veteran Musician Samantha Pereras mind, the creation of the genius of Samantha Perera, held last Friday, was a musical symphony of international standard. It was a rare opportunity for Colombo to witness a musical symphony that could be ranked as one of the best in the world.
Nadatheertha was attended by a packed audience. This goes to show that they were aware that they would witness something special. But very few would have guessed how spectacular it would be.
A humble Samantha Perera revealed his thoughts when he said that this country is going through many upheavals. Perera articulated the healing power of music. There is an English idiom that says A picture is worth a thousand words. That day at Nelum Pokuna, what transpired was worth a newspaper column. It was a wordless experience.
It was music in its most pristine and most potent form. A force that speaks to the heart before the mind. A force that compels you to get lost in it.
Perera said that dreams are powerful and dreams can come true. He said that this symphony was his dream. Indeed to get lost in a dream  in someone elses dream, is an experience that again cannot be described in words.
This is Pereras legacy and through it, he says, others that come after him have opportunities gifted by this legacy.
When Perera said that Music is Universal, it may sound clich. But if you were there that night it made all the difference. If you were there that night you would have understood perfectly why people say that Music is Universal.
Pereras companions created music that was absolutely perfect. Their instruments combined to create a masterpiece. An experience that was absolutely phenomenal. The only other performance that comes to my mind was that of Greek Composer Yannis concerts.
The Musical Symphony was organised jointly by the Department of Cultural Affairs and the State Advisory Board of Music on the direction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, North Western Development and Cultural Affairs.
Whether it will stand the test of memory cannot be guaranteed for the best is always yet to come, yet it was a performance that connected us to a world of sound that is not tangible, that is not describable but a world that exists. A world that only can be experienced by the senses and a world that cannot be fully understood by the mind.
Music that is lost in this world will be revived in the world to come. That is its beauty. There were very little special effects. The entire performance was balanced on instrument and voice. Calling the performers talented is an understatement. They were masterful. It was perfectly in harmony. A smooth and powerful flow.

SL must address daunting challenges with reforms - WB
Sri Lanka faces a number of challenges that increasingly put its future economic growth and stability at risk and thus must be addressed through determined reforms says the World Bank. Presenting its Sri Lana Development Update for 2017 in Colombo they say that these key challenges are inter - linked and require a comprehensive and coordinated approach. Adopting a piece - meal solution to address the challenges is unlikely to be successful.
External risks include disappointing growth performance in key countries that generate foreign exchange inflows to Sri Lanka: exports, tourism, remittances, FDI, private portfolio and official financing. Steeper than expected global financial conditions would increase the cost of debt and would make rolling over the maturing Eurobonds from 2019 more difficult.
Faster than expected rises in commodity prices would increase pressure on the balance of payments and make domestic fuel and electricity price reforms more difficult. A strong political will and support of the bureaucracy could help advancing the reform agenda. The World Bank see that the external sector is poised to benefit from the reinstatement of GSP+ preferential access to European Union and rapidly growing tourism, although the drought could adversely impact exports and increase petroleum imports. Foreign capital inflows to government securities and FDI inflows will help closing the external financing needs with no Eurobond falling due in 2017.External buffers are projected to improve, with emphasis placed on purchasing foreign exchange, maintaining a more market- determined exchange rate, using monetary policy and the sale of selected government assets.
The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 5.2% of GDP for 2017 creating space for planned increase in public investment thanks to the impact of VAT changes in its first full year of implementation.
Further revenue - increasing policy measures along with improved tax administration will help increase revenues and reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.5 of GDP by 2020. (SS)

Slow but steady growth in banking sector - NDB Securities
Pioneer stockbroking and equity research firm NDB Securities Ltd (NDBS) published an update on the outlook of the banking sector along with an analysis on nine listed licensed commercial banks.
This report comes as an update to a comprehensive banking sector report done earlier by NDBS. The update delivers better data, analysis and strategic direction on the overall banking sector environment coupled with CBSL's stringent requirements laid out by Basel III.
The sector update used publicly available data and expert opinion of industry stakeholders to provide information on one of the key sectors listed on the CSE.
NDBS CEO Prasansini Mendis said, The industry is slowly regaining momentum after a challenging year. We withstood 2016 and many more challenging years in the past through best industry practices, expert knowledge on the industry, time efficient service models, in-depth risk management and compliance framework.We are now further equipped to serve our clients better with the relocation of our company to plush new premises at 135, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 4, from this month.
She added, We as a company strongly believe that in depth research will continue to add value to the investor. Going forward, we expect to deliver similar updates in addition to our in-depth macro, sector and counter publications that will complement services delivered by our experienced advisory arm and state-of-the-art IT and back office system.
NDBS Head of Research Sidath Kalyanaratne said, This update is released at a time where CBSL has imposed further stringent capital requirements that are compliant with BASEL III guidelines. Under the new Basel III guidelines, in addition to the stringent regulations imposed on all LCBs and LSBs, the domestic systematically important banks (with assets over Rs 500 billion) have seen tighter capital requirements imposed to further strengthen the banking system. Most of the banks are in the process of raising equity to strengthen capital ratios and buffers. Despite the strengthening of the regulatory framework, above measures are expected to change the competitive landscape of the banking sector significantly.
He added We won the best stockbroking research team award last year at the capital markets awards 2016 organised by CFA Sri Lanka. Since then, we have worked even harder to improve our depth, breadth and quality of research and made increased efforts in sharing our knowledge with the current and potential investment community in our country. We believe this sector update will reflect the industry trends in terms of growth, profitability, risk, stability etc. over the short to medium term.
Manager  Research, Dhinali Peiris said, The loan growth of the banking sector recorded 17.7% in 2016. Banks with higher loan share to SME and retail witnessed higher NIM expansion with AWPLR gaining 441 basis points (bps) during 2016. However, going forward we expect a slowdown in demand for new loans due to the impact of monetary and fiscal measures taken by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) in 2016.
The banking sector deposits grew by 16.5% in FY16 whilst the average weighted deposit rate (AWDR) increased by 197 bps compared to 2015 where the AWDR was mostly stagnant. This increase caused the CASA of the banking sector to decrease from 40.3% in 2015 to 37.1% in 2016. Further, with the increased consumption taxes, we expect demand for deposits to slow down.
Dhinali added, In terms of profitability, we do not expect NIMs to further improve from FY16 levels due to reduction of upward pressure on interest rates coupled with declining CASA and increased competition for deposits. Therefore, with restrained forecasted net interest income growth, we estimate the growth in profitability to be rather moderate over the short term.
High competition, additional capital and leverage requirements amongst smaller banks will threaten their return on equity in the short run. Hence, we continue to support the banking consolidation which will further strengthen the system and improve banks access to financing via international capital markets.

SP Governor opts to introduce new land laws for foreigners
Southern Province Governor Dr.Hemakumara Nanayakkara plans to introduce new measures to end the irregular and fraudulent land dealings of foreign investors using diverse awkward manoeuvres and to introduce a proper mechanism for the recovery of taxes from foreign investors carrying out numerous businesses, without paying taxes to the Provincial Council.
The Governor disclosed his plans presenting the policy statement of the Fourth Session of the seventh Southern Provincial Council at the Council Secretariat at Kalegana, Galle yesterday.
"I intend to provide opportunities to foreign investors who have referred their projects under the Sri Lanka Board of Investments when issuing lands for broadening investments. In this backdrop, the relevant steps should be taken immediately to avoid anomalous land acquisitions made by foreign investors by using different traits. Similarly, I would like to emphasise the necessity of measuring actions for preparing a proper methodology for recovering taxes from foreign investors involved in different businesses,evading paying taxes and the other taxes that are to be recovered from tourist industry and businesses,"Dr.Nanayakkara said.
The Governor who pointed out some statistics regarding economic performances of the Southern Province also expressed his reservations over the authenticity of some figures.
"The Southern Province has contributed 10.4% to the Gross Domestic Production of Sri Lanka which amounts to Rs.11,183,220 million.Hence,it is imperative to mention that the Southern Province's contribution to the Gross Domestic Production in plantation sector is higher than the value depicted in statistics," he observed.

He submitted a comprehensive Police statement covering all sectors of the provincial administration under the powers vested upon the Provincial Council by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.

SLANA (Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC Agents) which was formed in May 2016 had its first AGM on May 26 2017, with Ajith Seneviratne Director General of Merchant Shipping and H. D. Premachandra, Managing Director of Sri Lanka Ports Authority as the guests of honour.
SLANA has been the voice for the NVOCC Operators and Agents, highlighting the difficulties faced by the entire shipping industry. The key issues that have been highlighted to the Minister and the officials.
The constraints and restrictions imposed by the government upon the service providers in December 2013 forcing and preventing the service providers in the shipping industry from collecting legitimate fees and charges from their customers for services offered.
The regulation was imposed by way of gazette 1842 / 16 (of 27th Dec 2013), which was against all international norms and practices.
Parties with vested interest not directly involved in the shipping industry, pressed upon the Finance ministry officials of the then government to introduce such regulations in an unethical manner, without any discussions with any of the industry stake holders.
These regulations have been detrimental to the Shipping and Logistics services industry and has tarnished the image of our country.
The Gazette 1842 / 16 also prevents the NVOCCs and the Shipping lines from recovering the Terminal Handling Charges (THC), a land based cost which is a direct cost arising from the payment to the Port Terminals. The THC which is a land based cost is recovered in all countries globally, expect in Bangladesh.
Due to the THC charges not being paid locally, there is also an unnecessary erosion of foreign exchange out of our country.
The need to introduce a separate category for the NVOCC agents in the Licensing of Shipping Agents Act, providing due recognition to the members of SLANA.
The former Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunge instructed the ministry officials to get new proposals from all the industry stake holders (about 10 days prior to his portfolio being changed) and formulate a new gazette in regularizing the charges in the shipping industry, considering the adverse effects that were brought upon the industry by gazette 1842 / 16. The matter is in process.

The doctors had also met the Asgiriya prelate and was scheduled to have an audience with the Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith last evening According to GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge, several senior government ministers too had made contact with members of the GMOA and dissuaded them from going ahead with the strike with the promise of a workable solution to the SAITM issue.
The GMOA however will resume trade union action after one week if attempts were made to go back on the undertakings reached vis a vis SAITM or if the Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne makes provocative statements, Dr. Aluthge said at a media briefing summoned last evening to announce the temporary suspension of the strike.
The doctors last week came out with all guns blazing suggesting, this time around, they really mean business. The decision to take a step backwards from the drastic action planned should be welcomed by all given the plight the patients would have been pushed into, especially in view of the emergency situation brought about by the dengue crisis.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa had already assured that they would take measures to minimize the impact on patients and the TU action would not cripple the treatment of dengue patients. This gesture too should be appreciated given the tone and tenor of the warning earlier that this time around their strike would be a no holds barred one and would be carried out in all its intensity, with one doctor warning that they would even pull out from emergency services.
Dengue patients, as is well known, largely comprise the poor, who are exposed to squalid conditions and pollution in the underbelly of the city and the suburbs. These folk invariably have no option but to seek treatment at government hospitals.
According to our reports there were 71,298 persons infected with dengue up to last month this year and the numbers keep on increasing. Then there is the case of those who come for treatment for fever, in the ordinary course, that shows signs of developing into dengue, but are turned away at government hospitals due to the GMOA strike This callous action would have resulted in a patient with a dengue risk catching the epidemic that may have resulted in his or her death There is no doubt that the doctors decision to stay their strike action was influenced by the plight of the dengue patients more than any other factor given the public outcry this would have raised. It was clear that whatever public sympathy that the doctors had attracted for their campaign was beginning to wear thin as the strikes began to multiply.
Be that as it may, it is gratifying indeed that saner counsel had prevailed and the doctors have decided to put their strike action on the back burner, at least for the time being. But a solution needs to be found to the SAITM issue and both sides must compromise. The GMOA should not stick to its entrenched position but display a degree of flexibility on the matter. After all it is the future of medical students, on both sides of the divide, that is at stake. The government already made a concession to nationalize the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and allowed the Sri Lanka Medical College to lay down the prescribed standards for the medical degree. Likewise the doctors to should strive to come half way down the road from their rigid stand.
The GMOA should also be seen to be independent of any political alliances that are against the government if it is to win public sympathy with its campaigns. It is all too plain that a majority of the agitating medical undergraduates are being manipulated by certain political forces whose one objective is to bring down the government. It should also desist from aligning itself with campaigns and issues that has no relevance to the medical profession such as the ECTA. The GMOA membership should also do some soul searching and ask themselves why they did not go hell for leather, as they do now, against SAITM, which was Mahinda's baby, in the past. Why has it also turned a blind eye to the private medical facility at the Kotalawala Defence Academy, set up at the instance of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa It is such duplicity that has created a strong impression in the public mind that powerful political forces that are presently out of power are bankrolling the whole anti-SAITM agitation.

US says N Korea long-range missile test 'new escalation of threat'

The US has confirmed that North Korea tested a long-range missile which some experts believe could reach Alaska.
Secretary of StateRex Tillerson called ita "new escalation of the threat" to the US and the world and warned that Washington "will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea".
Pyongyang claimed on Tuesday to have successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
In response the US and South Korea conducted a joint military exercise.
A statement by the two countries' militaries warned that "self-restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war" and that their drills showed "we are able to change our choice".
The two Koreas are technically still at war as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice.
Tillerson said "global action is required to stop a global threat" and warned that any nation that provided economic or military benefits to the North, or failed to fully implement UN Security Council resolution, was "aiding and abetting a dangerous regime".
The US has asked for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the issue. A closed-door session of the 15-member body is expected later on Wednesday.
Though Tuesday's test appeared to be a significant development, experts believe that North Korea does not yet have long-range nuclear weapon capabilities.
A long-range missile usually designed to carry a nuclear warhead
The minimum range is 5,500km (3,400 miles), although most fly about 10,000km or more
Pyongyang has previously displayed two types of ICBMs: the KN-08, with a range of 11,500km, and the KN-14, with a range of 10,000km, but before 4 July had not claimed to have flight tested an ICBM. It is not clear what differentiates the Hwasong-14
What has North Korea said
State news agency KCNA quoted leader Kim Jong-un as saying the test was a "gift" to the Americans on their independence day.
The report warned of the possibility of more tests, saying he ordered officials to "frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees".
Pyongyang had earlier said the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,731 miles) and flew 933km for 39 minutes before hitting a target in the sea.
North Korea, it said, was now "a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world".
The launch, the latest in a series of tests, was in defiance of a ban by the UN Security Council.
Does North Korea really have a long-range weapon now
Some experts believe that Tuesday's test proves that it has a missile that could travel across the globe and reach Alaska.
Physicist David Wright said it couldreach a maximum range of about 6,700km on a standard trajectory, while South Korea's defence ministry on Wednesday put the range between 7,000 and 8,000km.
But whether that missile could deliver a warhead is still a question.
Experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it onto a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target.
They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets.
Butothers believe thatat the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon that could strike the US within five to ten years.
By bringing Alaska within range, the new missile test is an unambiguous game-changer in both symbolical and practical terms.
US territory (albeit separate from the contiguous continental US) is now finally within Pyongyang's cross-hairs.
For the first time a US president has to accept that the North poses a "real and present" danger not merely to north-east Asia and America's key allies - but to the US proper.
President Trump's weakness lies in having overplayed his hand too publicly and too loudly.
How is the rest of the world reacting
Seoul's director of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Cho Han-Gya, said that "Kim Jong Un's regime will face destruction" if it "ignores our military's warnings and continues provocations".
Japan said "repeated provocations like this are absolutely unacceptable" and has lodged a protest.
Meanwhile China - who is Pyongyang's main economically - and Russia have called on North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile programme in exchange for a halt on the large-scale military exercises by the US and South Korea.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who met in Moscow on Tuesday, said "the opposing sides should start negotiations".

Violating the Hippocratic Oath
As the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) engages in strike action supposedly to win their rights, it is the public that has to face the brunt of it being at the mercy of the government doctors. The GMOA had planned to stage an island wide indefinite strike yesterday, claiming that the government had failed to offer them an acceptable solution over the SAITM issue, but later announced that the strike would be postponed for one week. However, many suspect that GMOA actions are a part of a larger campaign to create political instability. While those who can afford private medical care can cope with such a decision taken by the state doctors, it is those who cannot afford private healthcare that are made to suffer.
The GMOA are proud to claim that they are fighting to preserve the free education of this country. Yet, after utilising public funds to obtain their education, is it fair to jeopardize the lives of the very public who gave them the opportunity to become doctors. Several members of the public expressed their views to the Daily News regarding the GMOAs constant strike actions.
Convener of the Lawyers forDemocracy Presidents Counsel
J.C Weliamuna
Just because the GMOA has the right to launch a strike, that does not mean that they can go for repeated strike actions. It is a nuisance on one hand and secondly, caters to the private agendas of office bearers of the GMOA. There is no doubt that they are working on a political agenda. Their first demand was to have regulatory standards for private education. But, now they are going on a huge attack, which is politically not feasible for any government. They are networking with a group of people who are working on their own political agendas. Their speeches show that they have lost their professionalism as well. There are hundreds of doctors who are against it but they do not want to come out and be vilified by them. Even the demand to take over a private institution is not democratic. I must say that the GMOA demands are very primitive and unreasonable. They are taking patients as hostages, therefore, it should be condemned. Not only the patients, but a section of doctors should come out against the GMOA. Unfortunately, they are working on a bigger agenda to topple the government.

Dr. Lalani Kapuruge
I do not approve of the strike launched by the doctors today and it is not justifiable.
Dr. HarischandraYakandawala
So much time and resources are wasted because of the SAITM issue and the government should solve it as soon as possible with the consent of all parties. Dragging this issue further will not do any good for the country. Both the doctors and SAITM students are correct. The SAITM students spend their time and money because of the `hopes given by governments. The people have enough of things to worry about, so it is not acceptable to put them in further trouble. There should be some other way for the GMOA to win their demands.
Consultant ENT Surgeon
Dr Chandra Jayasuriya
Up to now, the standard of Sri Lankas medical education is at a very good standard and there is excellent world recognition for Sri Lankan doctors. The country produces adequate doctors. Only the cream of the country (Advanced Level Science Examination) become doctors no matter from which district they are from. Sri Lankan medical students who studied in foreign universities and passed the Act 16 Examination are also good. `As an individual, today I am here because of my high IQ level, intelligence, dedication and free education. I am here today not because I had money or `connections. I am from an ordinary family without a lot of money. I know how much talent medical students in state medical faculties have, because I have been lecturing them since 2002. They can be trained very easily without much effort because they are highly intelligent, she added.
Consultant Psychiatrist
Dr. Jayan Mendis
I do not want to say the doctors strike is justifiable or not or I do not want to be a part of the doctors strike. Be it SAITM or anything else, it is a real mess mixed up by all types of persons, qualified, not qualified, experienced, inexperienced and irrelevant persons. No party shows an interest in coming to the table, have an open discussion, and come to an agreement and solve the issue.
Consultant in MedicalAdministration and the CEO /Director of the National Institute for Nephrology Dialysis andTransplantation,
Dr. RathnasiriA. Hewage
No doctors strike takes place in this hospital because if the doctors strike, around 50 patients die every day without dialysis. Therefore, all trade unions had come to an agreement not to implement strikes at this hospital. The hospital is exempted.
A Consultant Rheumatologist and Specialist in Sports Medicine attached to one of the leadingprivate hospital in Colombo
The doctors strike is not justifiable because there is a dengue outbreak in the country at the moment and there are a lot of patients who need urgent medical treatment.
Dewruk Rajapakse,
a Civil Engineer
GMOA strikes are inhumane, illegal and just disgusting! They are breaching our fundamental rights. Access to health is a universally accepted right of all people. GMOA actions should be controlled before the general public beats them up. When the GMOA conduct strikes, almost all the OPDs stop functioning. It is the section of the hospital where patients are provided medical consultations and other allied services and more importantly, it is the poor majority who goes there. So who is suffering from the GMOA strikes Patients may not die but they will suffer. I have witnessed poor patients sleeping by the main gates of government hospitals due to the GMOAs inhumane strikes.
The GMOA is against regulated private education. But why The more qualified doctors, the lesser the demand for their private practice. Their demand will shrink, as it will be divided among all qualified doctors. Hence, they fear the influx of new doctors to the field from private education institutes. Health stats are way better in Sri Lanka. According to the GMOA, it is because of health care services only. Yet, it is proven that any state that has a higher literacy rate has high level of health attainments. It is because people are concerned about their living standards. So, we cannot accept the GMOAs claim which they reiterate in every media show, as if they are the only group who has put an effort to these stats.
How could the GMOA strike during a health emergency More than 200 people have died due to dengue. The truth is that the government is in bigger trouble and they are unable to create more educational opportunities. The government should regulate the institution if the standards are very low. Just because the GMOA threatens, we just cannot abolish it. We need more qualified doctors to provide a better service.
Meanwhile, the GMOA never questions about the quality of services provided by the private sector. If private health education needs to be stopped, the same should be applied for private practice as well. I am of the opinion that GMOA strikes are unreasonable and should immediately stop.
Dr R. Sivalingham
from Kandy
I am of the opinion that the government should take immediate measures to put an end to the SAITM issue. Now, the GMOA has taken the whole issue into their hands. They are tarnishing the image of all doctors. Even the patients who come to me ask why the doctors are behaving in that manner and ask me why they are not being more responsible. I have got no answer; it is very pathetic, people do not see a difference between a doctor and thug.
I have been practicing for 15 years. When the GMOA launched the strike last time, I went to the hospital as usual. I was terribly upset to hear what people talk about doctors. My father was also a doctor and I was always reminded of the social responsibility. Unfortunately, many doctors give very less importance to their patients now.
I do not personally agree with SAITM, the standards are very low. But, the government is just trying to please all parties and I dont see any progress in their initiatives. The government should act smarter to stop the GMOA from taking this issue into their own hands.
Dr M. Najeeb
from Kegalle
We cannot argue when our senior doctors ask us not to work. When I was at the University, the students represented the opinion of the Union head. Once I refused to take part in a protest and I told my class mates that I am not going to come as I do not see any logic behind that. The following morning, three guys entered my class room, held my shirt collar and warned me that I cannot go against the decision made by the union. Later my friends forced me to join the protest and I had to scream and shout out slogans along with them. It is the same with many doctors as well, even though I am not a part of the GMOA, I still have to adhere to my senior doctors at the hospital.
P.H.J.B.Sugathadasa
Health Ministry Secretary
Right now at the ministry, we are working to address the full extent of this issue. Especially when it comes to the standards we need to ensure that these standards are upheld. Thats what matters the most. It is irrelevant whether it is privately owned or publicly owned, that is my position.
We have many private schools and hospitals in the country, so private ownership itself is not the problem.
The GMOAs actions are unacceptable. A responsible trade union would not do this.
UNP Colombo District MP
Mujibur Rahuman
It is not clear what the GMOA wants. They are opposing private medical faculties only and they dont mind other faculties such as engineering etc. In fact they are not even opposing the private medical faculty at the Kotalawela Defence University.
They only seem to have a problem with SAITM. But, they want to have their private practice at private hospitals and have no objection to overseas qualified doctors coming here and practicing after sitting for the Act 16 examination.
It is strange how the GMOA never objected to SAITM during the previous Rajapaksa regime even though it was started during their time.
It is my view that they are having a hidden political agenda behind their actions and they are merely trying to use the SAITM issue to fulfill these political agendas and topple the government.

When music becomes dramatically different with Mussorgsky
Some time back when I went to the Queen Elizabeth Hall at South Bank Centre, London to hear and watch the International Piano Series directed by Krystian Zimmerman and Maurizo Pollini to celebrate the bicentenary of Fryderyk Chopin, I was in for a pleasant surprise. Though somewhat annoyed, I sat down with my friend to watch a drama unfold before my eyes that was simply spectacular. Instead of Chopin's Romantic scores for the evening, there arose Leif Ove Andshnes performing Mussorgsky's PICTURES at an EXHIBITION with stage design and visual accompaniment by the vibrant young South African artist Robin Rhode.
It was something I could not comprehend. I was not dreaming, for sure. Together, they redined the piano recital, presenting the aesthetics of a contemporary art gallery to the concert hall and created a new version of Mussorgsky's PICTURES at an EXHIBITION that was originally written to accompany paintings by Victor Hartmann where this new version created images for a 21st century performance. That version included a new work by Thomas Larcher and written to accompany visuals along with a performance of Schumann's KINDERSZENEN.
WHO IS HE I had never seen or heard this Norwegian pianist called Leif Ova Andshes and believe me, he simply swept me off my feet. Potentially one of the great rising stars, Chopin had been at the centre of his playing. His fine musical grace and individuality has been already lauded especially in the glittering context with transcriptions and tributes to Chopin. He demonstrated a poetic sensibility rare in a youthful pianist that made the young South African artist Robin Rhode to rise to the occasion.
MODEST PETROVICH MUSSORGSKY Was born into a wealthy rural, landowning family. He began by picking out on the piano the tunes he heard from the serfs on his family's estate. At the age of six, he began to study piano with his mother. His parents initially set him out on the career of military officer.
He became a cadet and finally commissioned in an elite imperial regiment. Two years later, in 1858, he resigned his commission. During this time, he met a musically-inclined army doctor: Alexander Borodin. The two became friends. In 1861, with Russia's emancipation of the serfs, his family lost significant income, and he was forced to earn a living. In 1863, he began a spotty career in the civil service, which dismissed him at least twice.
In 1867, Mussorgsky also composed ST. JOHN'S NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN (usually called NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN), depicting a gathering of witches and demons for a black sabbath. While one can cite predecessors like Berlioz and Liszt for such an idea, nobody had come up with such crazy sounds before  shattering dissonance and wild cries as savage as anything in Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, more than four decades in the future. Mussorgsky revised it at least twice to fit it into later, unrealized projects  Mlada (1872, a group opera by the Kuchka never completed) and the composer's own unfinished opera Sorochints Fair.
After his abandonment of The Marriage, Mussorgsky began working on a Stasov suggestion, the opera Boris Godunov. The composer completed a version in 1869 and submitted it to the Mariinsky Theater, who rejected it, mainly due to the fact that Mussorgsky had provided no role for a prima donna. Mussorgsky took back the score and at once began to revise it, altering the work far beyond what the theater had asked for. In general, he moved from the musical realism of the first version to a folk-based arioso, extremely subtle and flexible dramatically. He resubmitted his new version in 1872. The theater accepted it, and after some wrangling with the censor, Boris premiered in 1874. This was to provide Mussorgsky his greatest public triumph. He was considered theyoung man to watch.
Because he began late and died young, almost all of Mussorgsky's music can be considered early work. Yet he progressed at a frankly incredible rate, went through at least three major changes of style, and even conducted successful "one-off" experiments. His songs lie at the center of his achievement and form the basis of much of his dramatic work. There's an astonishing variety, from "realistic" portraits, to evocation of peasant song, dramatic monologues (from a child) in The Nursery (1870), psychological expressionism and a non-Wagnerian chromaticism in Sunless(1874), and a new pre-Mahler poetry in Songs and Dances of Death(1877). Instrumental works play less of a role, although even here he wrote masterpieces: the aforementioned NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN and the piano cycle PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION (1874). If he had composed only the last, he would be considered an eminence in Russian music. The piece is new not only in its details (bar-by-bar meter changes, startlingly original chord progressions and piano textures) but in its form  Romantic character-pieces linked by interludes varying a basic theme, with the final variation absorbed into the last character-piece.
Mussorgsky's music challenged the hegemony of German and Italian music in the nineteenth century and lay outside the standard Brahms-vs.-Wagner fight. He opened up a new musical path and a new aesthetic attitude. However, it's not his innovations alone that make him so important. Boris Godunov is arguably one of the three greatest operas of its time, the work of a musical dramatist of genius. Mussorgsky's songs, so little known in the West mainly due to language difficulties, put the composer in the exalted company of Schubert, Brahms, and Mahler, and show a greater variety of expression than all three. Patronized by the nineteenth century, the composer became a hero to the Twentieth.
