Reminiscing Toy Story
Every scene is an opportunity for a gag, and every plot development an excuse for more gags. This basically sums up Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheneys latest contribution to animation films The Secret Life of Pets. The film is made merely for entertainment and nothing more. Thus it lacks ambition. There are a series of episodes taking place but no depth in the tale.Another in a long line of family-centric animated escapades, the computer-generated project is reminiscent of Pixars pioneering Toy Story franchise. The only difference is that there are pets in the place of toys!As with the toys, the pets too constantly vie for their owners affection. But what do they get up to when the master isnt around Left to their own devices, the critters run rampant through the streets, alleyways and sewers of New York City.
Domesticated pets
The film kicks on with the arrival of Duke, a rather inconsiderate newfoundland, into the house of Max, a Jack Russell Terrier, who starts to feel insecure and bullied. Shortly, Max and Duke get lost, and worse, land in the clutches of Animal Control. They are shortly rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball who has issues with humans. However Snowball and clan soon turns against Max and Duke because they would not fit in as theres domestication all over them. Meanwhile Gidget, a white pomeranian is so smitten with Max that she heads a pack of domesticated pets to his rescue.
The jokes and gags are the stereotyped type which go with cats and dogs. Some of the jokes dont even make you laugh out loud. For instance the scene in which Max and Duke are scared away by cats was trying too hard to make the episode look funny. In another episode Max and Duke make sad dog faces to cajole a man to part with his hotdog. Likewise a cat does not shy away from steppting on a mans private parts when he scampers across a room. In one instance a dog is so overcome with its owners homecoming that it urinates in excitement. If you are a dog or cat owner, you will be all too familiar with these tactics. So they would hardly make you smile let alone laugh.
Artful skyline
Although the 3D effects arent top-notch, the replication of the bustling New York skyline is artful. The animation and design teams have also taken commendable care to capture the quirkiness of an entire cast of animal characters.
One of the best features of the movie is Snowball. One would hardly expect a rabbit to be evil but Snowball makes an effective villain.
Kevin Hart who renders his voice to Snowball too does his bit well and his voice fills the evil bunnys persona admirably.
The Secret Life of Pets wont stick to you the way the great movies do, but is a genuinely enjoyable sit. The background details are pleasing on the eyes even if the tale bores you. If you are a dog or cat person you might enjoy this movie. Or else it like its four legged canines and feline, this movie too tries too hard to please!

Ice Age 5makes an appearance
Since that first movie, the world has been threatened by 'The Meltdown' (2006), seen the 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' (2009), and been through a 'Continental Drift' (2012). With 'Ice Age: Collision Course', there is now the threat of mass extinction, no thanks to the twitchy Scrat (Chris Wedge), whose shenanigans with a UFO cause a giant asteroid to start hurtling towards Earth.
The original 'herd' of Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) has also expanded to included an entire village of characters, including Mannys wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), Sids Granny (Wanda Sykes), Diegos girlfriend Shira (Jennifer Lopez), possums Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck), and the latest addition, Peaches fiance Julian (Adam DeVine).
And thats not counting Buck (Simon Pegg), the one-eyed weasel who makes a comeback here, having appeared in 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs'.
There are some new characters in this one as well  a yoga-loving llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a pretty ground sloth called Brooke (Jessie J) who falls in love with Sid, and three Dromaesaurs (flying dinosaurs, apparently) voiced by Nick Offerman, Stephanie Beatriz and Max Greenfield, who have a slightly skewed sense of logic when it comes to surviving the end of the world.
'Ice Age : Collision Course' in 3D will be premiered on July 22 by Ceylon Theatres at Majestic Cineplex 10.30am, 1.30pm, 4.30pm and 7.30pm Fri/Sat 10.30pm and Empire Cineplex 10.30am,1.30pm, 4.30pm 7.30pmand Fri/Sat 10.30pm

Star Trek Beyond gracefully finds orbit amid tragedy
When the Star Trek Beyond cast and filmmakers gathered in Los Angeles last month for Anton Yelchins funeral, they had a decision to make. Their film, the third in the rebooted series, was coming out in less than a month and a rigorous press tour was imminent. They could either put themselves out there to promote the film in the raw and devastating weeks after the death of their beloved co-star, or they could withdraw.
We came to the conclusion in the end (that) if we withdraw, were going to risk not helping a film that should be seen, not least because it stars Anton Yelchin, said Simon Pegg. Thats how we found the strength to be here ... Its hard to talk about, but we dont want to not talk about it.
And then, in late February 2015, Leonard Nimoy  the man who originated Mr. Spock  died of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at age 83. While Quinto had taken over his character officially, Nimoy had appeared in both new films as Spock Prime and the door was left open for his return.
We knew we were going to make a tribute to Leonard when it happened, but we thought lets make him part of the DNA of the story too, Pegg said.
So Pegg and Jung wrote Ambassador Spocks off-screen death into the film, using it to affect Quintos arc, and also serve as an elegy to the actor.
Of course, no one could have foreseen that they would lose another before the film came out, and one of their youngest, in Yelchin who was only 27 when he died after being struck by his own car last month. The close-knit cast and crew of Star Trek were also able to say goodbye together at the funeral.

Im pregnant, not a corpse Kareena
Soon after her actor-husband Saif Ali Khan confirmed Kareena Kapoor Khans pregnancy on July 2, reports about her maternity break and speculation about her upcoming projects started doing the rounds. It was also reported that the Bollywood actor, who is due in December, will complete the shoot of her next with Sonam Kapoor and also the shoots for some magazine covers by October before she goes on maternity leave. But Kareena is disappointed with these reports.
Im pregnant, not a corpse. And what maternity break Its the most normal thing on earth to produce a child. It is high time the media back off, and stop treating me any different than I ever was. Anybody who is bothered shouldnt work with me... but my work goes on as is, like always. Stop making it a national casualty. We are in 2016, not in the 1800s.
Probably, even at that time, people were way more civilised and normal than the way the media is behaving and speculating now, says Kareena, adding, Im just fed-up of people making it (her pregnancy) to be a death of some sort. In fact, it should be a message to a lot of people that marriage or having a family has absolutely nothing to do with my career.
Apparently, Kareena currently has over 18 brand endorsement deals, and she plans to shoot for the campaigns in the upcoming months. Ask her about her association with her brands, and she says, It is great they will love me for what I stand for, what I represent, and my talent.

Voice for all seasons
There are some who are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. Yet there are some who are born talented. Annesley Malawana was born to entertain. Beginning his musical stint from Ratnapura which also happened to be his hometown, Malawana joined hands with Clarence Wijewardena and took the Sri Lankan music scene by storm. The 1960s, 70s and 80s marked their height of success. Now around two decades later Malawana is still very much in demand and his songs are evergreen. His name is a household word today and if one were to go back to history it is a story that is embellished with achievements that speaks volumes for a voice that is a God-given gift that cannot easily be matched!
He will be celebrating his Golden Jubilee in music with a grand musical show titled 50 Year Reflection. It will be held on August 6 at the BMICH at 7pm. Some original members of the Moonstones - Indrani Perera, Lankika, Chanaka and Anil of the Golden Chimes, Rukshan, Dixon, Sunil, Chandral and Paul from Super Golden Chimes, a Calypso medley featuring Priya Pieris, Merrill, Milroy, Raymond, Errol and Christine will perform at the event. The Guest Artistes will be Corrine, Keerthie and Chitral Somapala. Musical backing will be provided by my band Super Chimes with Channa-Upuli Dancers providing the dance acts. The MC for the evening will be Vijaya Corea.
Q: 50 years in the field is no small triumph. How do you feel when you look back on your journey
A: I cant believe that I have reached this great milestone but I am so happy about it. I owe it to my fans in Sri Lanka and all over the world and to the people who helped me when I started music way back in 1966.
Q: Out of all your songs your first hit Mango Nenda is still the most popular. Why do you think that is so
A: Yes, Mango Nenda is the most popular song of mine. I think the success lies in its catchy melody. It has a real story behind it too. Whenever I get on stage people always request for this song.
Q: You have worked with the legendary Clarence Wijewardena. What is the most important lesson you learned from him
A: Clarence was a great personality. He made a big change in the Sinhala music industry and it was a pleasure working with him. I cannot simply name one thing that I learnt from him. I learnt a lot from him and I am ever so grateful to him for that. Our combination gave the music lovers the best of the hits that came out in the 60s and 70s.
Q: Looking back would you have done anything differently
A: No. I just followed Clarences footsteps and I never went wrong. I would take the same path if I was given a choice to begin all over again even today.
Q: What would you say is the highlight of your career
A: Well when we started The Moonstones in 1966 we went right to the top in the music scene and The Super Golden Chimes did even better. I will never forget the great times we had during the 60s and 70s.
Q: Besides music what are your other passions
A: I love sports, especially tennis! I never miss any of the tennis matches shown on TV.
Q: How do you feel about the present state of the music industry
A: The present music industry is very advanced and highly commercialised. During our days we did music for our enjoyment but now money comes first. But I dont blame anyone for that. The present day musicians have to move with the times.
Q: What do you think about reality shows which select vocalists and brand them as superstars
A: No comments.

It was a night of simple joy for the fans of Richard Marx as he performed Live at the Stein Studios, Ratmalana to packed audience on June 26. There was the stage, there was him and there was him paying attention to his audience and serenading them with the classics they grew up listening to.
Richard Marx set the mood to bring back all those memories one had with the start of everyones all time favourite Endless Summer and having the audience sing along with him. He had it all. The looks, the voice and the charm  thats all that was needed to end a perfect Sunday.
These are some of the highlights of the night as Richard Marx sang almost everything that you and I grew up listening to.
