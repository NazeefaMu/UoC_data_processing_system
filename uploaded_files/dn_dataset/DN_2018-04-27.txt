Cryptocurrency ban could  cost India dear
The Reserve Bank of Indias decision to bar banks and non-banking financial companies from having any links to firms or individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies could lead to millions, if not billions of dollars leaving the country, according to a cryptocurrency company looking to enter the Indian market later this year.
I totally agree with the concerns of the RBI, but their approach is somewhat different from what it should be, based on the actions of other regulators around the world, Akash Aggarwal, founder and CEO of Alluma, said in an interview.
But they have not said cryptocurrency is illegal, or that it is banned in India, or that you cannot trade in cryptocurrencies in India, and they have not told cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down. They are only scared of it touching the fiat currency, and are worried about money laundering and terrorism financing.
As per the RBIs policy, a citizen of India is allowed to remit $250,000, which is 1.5 crore, and we are talking about nine million users in India, Mr. Aggarwal added. If people start sending money out of India just to trade cryptocurrencies, is the RBI or the government of India ready to lose those million or billions out of India
According to Mr. Aggarwal, Indians do trade extensively on international exchanges and will continue to do so even if the RBI cuts off their link to the fiat currency since it has not banned people from trading one cryptocurrency for another.
Even if the RBI cuts off the fiat currency supply to the industry, people will trade cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency, which they have not banned, he said, adding that this is primarily the service his company is looking to provide when it enters the Indian market.

Displaced by NWPCP to receive alternative lands
People who would be displaced in the Kandapalla-Korale area of the Matale district under the North Western Province Canal Project (NWPCP), would be provided with alternative lands and compensation, Matale District Parliamentarian and District Co-ordination Committee Chairman Ranjith Aluvihare said.
He was addressing an awareness programme on displacement due to projects such as the NWPCP.
Under the project, 350 tanks in the Kurunegala and Matale districts are to be supplied with Mahaweli water.
The water scarcity in the areas near the tanks would be quelled with the completion of the project within the next five years, Project Director Neil Bandara said.
The Wayamba Ela Project is funded jointly by the Asian Development Bank and the government. Rs. 16 million would be spent on the project, while about 13,500 families would be benefitted. Over 30,000 acres would also be developed, NWPCP director Asoka Perera said.
"We appreciate these development activities, but it should be carried out sans partiality. The activities of certain officials are unfair. We have not yet been provided with information regarding our compensations. Some officers said the government would pay Rs. 6,000 per perch. It is unfair, Ranwediyawa Mahasen Farmer Organisation Chairman D. G. Pabilis said.

Erabadhu Mangalya in Bandarawela
The Sinhala and Tamil New Year, which falls on April 14, is a celebration that is carried out on a grand scale every year. Although it concerns primarily the Sinhala Buddhist and Tamil Hindu communities in Sri Lanka, the others Muslims and Christians are drawn into the celebration as well.
It is a privilege indeed for one to live in a multi racial country where people of different races and religions have the opportunity to mingle with one another during auspicious occasion like this.
Prior to the arrival of this so called Sinhala and Tamil New Year festival, a spate of celebration is carried out in the government and private sector institutions which is ritualistic and everything that happens is symbolic.
Recently, one such celebration was carried out in the Bandarawela Zonal Education office with the invitation to Bandarawela, Haputale, Haldummulla and Ella divisions in the office premises. This New Year celebration was well organized with the leadership and guidance of the Zonal Director of Education R.M. Ariyadasa, Directors of Divisional Education offices and the additional directors. The office staffs were kept busy engaging in making, baking, storing traditional food items and entertaining the participants. Obviously, a collective effort had been placed and proved beyond doubt by the above in the process of organizing the proceedings.
This is believed that this Sinhala and Tamil New Year marks the beginning of the new year and being optimistic that everything must commence on the belief of any kind must be settled and all bickering resolved, not forgetting laying down a few resolutions for the new year.
The celebration was commenced with religious observances followed by traditional and cultural events such as cross country race, musical chair, pot breaking, placing eye on a drawn picture of an elephant, partaking of traditional food items and many more colourful events and activities had been lined up to promote ethnic goodwill and traditionalism among the staff brimming over with excitement, fun and laughter. The students of neighbouring schools also participated and performed cultural dances to highlight this celebration.

Farmers hardships remain unaddressed
Farmers' hardships to which priority was not given to by the previous regime, still remains unaddressed by present government as well, All Island Farmers' Federation Chairman and Provincial Councillor Namal Karunaratne said. He was addressing a media briefing at the Dambulla Yapagama Siyapatha Hotel.
He said there was no proper market for agricultural produce. As a result, farmers have to discard their yields and hence, face losses. Moreover, farmers are currently in a quandary as they had not yet received due fertiliser subsidies which were promised by the government.
It had been said that all farmers could obtain a 50-kg bag of fertiliser at a price of Rs. 500 for paddy cultivations, while for other crop cultivations, it would cost Rs. 1,500 per bag. However, farmers cannot afford subsidies at such exorbitant rates, Karunaratne said, adding that there was no fertiliser in the open market or government sector at the stipulated rates.
He said that certain traders sell 50-kg bags of fertiliser at a price of Rs. 3,750. Politicians are too consumed in power struggles that they forget the problems of the people. Meanwhile, the President is attempting to amend the Cabinet, while the United National Party proceeds to re-organise itself.
All Island Farmers' Alliance Secretary T. D. Sarath also addressed the event.

After Cape Town, Ivory Coast city feels the thirst
IVORY COAST: Earlier this year, Cape Town grabbed the worlds headlines as it careened towards a water armageddon.
Crippled by a three-year-long drought, the South African city braced for a complete shutdown of domestic water supplies.
In the event, Cape Town dodged the immediate bullet. But thousands of kilometres (miles) away, another African city has had far less luck -- and much less attention for its ordeal.
We havent had a drop from our taps for three weeks, said a resident of Bouake, Ivory Coasts second largest city, while she awaited her turn to draw water from from a well. The situation is catastrophic, said an employee of the state-run water distribution company, Sodeci, who asked not to be named. Located in grassy savanna around 400 kilometres (250 miles) from the Ivorian economic capital of Abidjan, Bouake is a city of more than half million souls, with a million more in surrounding territory. The area has been hit by a double whammy. The dammed lake that supplies 70 percent of the citys water has run dry.
One factor is an unprecedented drought that has gripped the region -- a phenomenon in line with expert warnings about climate change. But another, says the territorys director for water affairs, Seydou Coulibaly, is the impact of unregulated sand quarrying, which has altered the course of waterways feeding the reservoir.
We are struggling to get clean water for drinking and cooking, computer technician Eliezer Konan told AFP. Washing has become difficult. Its a real ordeal. In a bid to bring some relief, the city has begun drilling wells to obtain fresh water.
We have finished a first operation and well be moving on to the second site in two to three hours, Hassane Cousteau Cissoko, director of the drilling firm Foraci, said last Thursday in the Houphouetville district.
In all, 10 wells will be linked by pipes to a Sodeci water tower, which will then be able to distribute two million litres (more than half a million gallons) of water per day. This will relieve the population but is far from enough to replace the usual supply from the Loka dam, Cissoko said.

All day fixtures for  Sri Lanka at WC 2019
The ICC yesterday confirmed Sri Lankas matches in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, which sees the 1996 world champions play their nine league matches in five cities. The 10-team tournament, to be played on a single-league format with the top four progressing to the semi-finals, will run from 30 May to 14 July across 11 venues of England and Wales.
Sri Lanka will face-off New Zealand in their opening match on 1 June in Cardiff, and will take on Afghanistan at the same venue three days later. They will then move to Bristol, where they will meet Asian rivals Pakistan and Bangladesh on 7 and 11 June, respectively.
Sri Lankas fifth league match will be against defending champions Australia at The Oval on 15 June, before they meet hosts England at Headingley on 21 June. Durham will host Sri Lanka for their seventh and eighth league matches which will be held on 28 June and 1 July against South Africa and the Windies, respectively.
Sri Lankas ninth and final league match will be against India on 6 July at Headingley. Their participation in the semi-finals stage of the tournament will depend on their placing on the points table following the completion of 45 league matches.
Sri Lanka fast bowler Suranga Lakmal, who has taken 98 wickets in 75 ODIs, said: We are looking forward to the World Cup with great enthusiasm and cant wait to embark on the tour of England and Wales for what Im sure will be an interesting tournament, especially with a format that sees all teams play each other.
Sri Lanka have just under 50 per cent success rate at the World Cup, having won 35 matches and lost 35 matches. They were involved in a tied match, while their two matches ended in no-results.
Apart from winning the 1996 tournament in the subcontinent, Sri Lanka have featured in the finals of the 2007 and 2011 events. They qualified for the semi-finals in 2003, while their only quarter-final appearance was in Australia and New Zealand in 2015. In the other six tournaments, they have failed to progress beyond the group stages.

Ambitious plans on  the cards to develop  ICT industry
To better leverage ICTs for development, a higher level of preparedness and better infrastructure accesses are needed. In this context, government leadership and vision are critical. ICTs have the potential of opening up new digital divides.
These sentiments were expressed by Dr. Kithsiri Manchanayake after his re-election as the Chairman Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) at the Annual General Meeting held recently at Hilton Colombo Residence.
In the absence of corrective mechanisms, ICTs could indeed contribute to a non-inclusive type of growth, thus exacerbating the problem rather than mitigating it. If harnessed properly, ICTs can create economic opportunities and foster social and political inclusion, ultimately contributing to shared prosperity, he stressed.
He also said that ambitious plans are now on the cards to develop ICT industry through the Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka (FITIS) the apex ICT Industry association in Sri Lanka.
FITIS represents the all ICT industry segments including Hardware, Software, Education and Training, Communication and Professional. It will drive the ICT Industry to its full potential to achieve National Objectives, Dr Manchanayakke said.
In order to achieve these new, enhanced targets, we have to make a series of significant changes for the forward-march and overall progress of Sri Lankas ICT industry. We have worked out a comprehensive plan of action to make this initiative a reality, Dr. Manchanayake said.
Certainly, we will continue playing an active role as the voice of the Information Communication Technology (ICT) industry. Given the dynamic, rapidly evolving technological environment permeating all sectors, including where the battle against poverty is waged, there is plenty to cover and FITIS will hit the ground running, said Dr. Manchanayake.
Key to its efforts would be continued dialogue and partnership with key stakeholders that include the government, industry, and users, with a view to harnessing the potential of ICT for promoting and supporting inclusive growth.
Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) is considered the conveyor belt of globalisation and have tremendous influence on the functioning of global and national economies. The role that ICT plays is for the benefit and betterment of our citizens. They help find innovative solutions to address the daily challenges we face; poverty, unemployment, lack of access to quality education and health care, and climate change, to name but a few.
We look to bring new ideas to the table in this regard and also continue to push the Federations existing causes. We are conscious that unless Sri Lanka comes to grips with the challenges of ICTs, we may be left behind in the ICT revolution, said Dr. Manchanayake.
FITIS recognises that although the ICT revolution is well under way in some parts of the country, many of those who stand to gain from it are not yet connected.
While certain segments of the population are benefitting from ICTs, many are left behind because of their age, limited digital literacy, lack of access, or remoteness. FITIS represents Sri Lanka at two main regional ICT alliances such as ASOCIO (Asian Oceanian Computing Industry Organization) and APICTA (Asia Pacific ICT Alliance) and FITIS plans to carry out some business match-making events between local companies and counterparts in other countries to promote local software internationally by using this opportunity.

Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said he will provide his fullest support to hold the Provincial Council Elections by the end of this year.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed him to look into inadequacies in the existing mixed electoral system and propose an amended Bill in Parliament. Accordingly, a committee of experts will be appointed to study the Local Government Act and come up with necessary amendments including the number of council members elected.
Minister Musthapha was speaking at a press briefing held at the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry premises.
Minister Musthapha said he is in agreement with the Election Commissioner to hold the Provincial Council Elections in Northern, Central, North-Western, Southern, Western and Eastern provinces.
He added that the government should never go back to the preferential voting system which paved way for dirty politics. He pointed out that such a step is completely against the mandate received by President Maithripala Sirisena in 2015.
The public demands this system. I agree that there are a number of shortcomings in the Act. But that does not mean that we should give it up. We should amend and continue with this electoral system, he pointed out.

Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) Director General Asanga Abeyagoonasekera was invited to speak on the panel Chinas growing influence in the Indian Ocean: Implications for the U.S. and its regional allies at the prestigious think tank in Washington DC, the Hudson Institute on April 20.
At the panel, the Director General INSSSL emphasized the important role Sri Lanka could play as the regional stabilizer in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) due to the Islands geostrategic position. He said, geopolitical thinker Halford Mackinder rightly identified almost a century
ago, the two outer islands in his work, which is Great Britain playing a significant role in the Atlantic Ocean and Japan in the Pacific Ocean. Sri Lanka sitting at the outer crescent is also an island which could play a significant role in the Indian Ocean in this century, specially as a stabilizer and promote peace as rightly spelled out in 1971 by former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranayake as the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.
Referring to the works of geopolitical thinker Rudolf Kjellen he said, China has already developed three primary attributes to reckon as a great power which is spaciousness, freedom of movement and internal cohesion. Director General said, Chinas One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative is the modern day Marshal Plan of China, to assist many developing nations and project as a global power.
He said, it is wrong to see Chinese loans as predatory loans, China has assisted many developing nations to build infrastructure, India should not worry of the Chinese sphere of influence in Sri Lanka because all foreign policy decisions are carefully calibrated by our policy makers along with the experienced foreign service officers and they are not knee jerk reactions. Sri Lanka will never allow military bases as we promote peace in the region. The key challenge is, even after 70 years of independence from colonial past, India Sri Lanka and surrounding nations have failed to develop the economic condition.
The other panelists include Visiting Fellow Hudson Institute Saturo Nagao, Research Fellow and Director Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia Hudson Institute Aparna Pandey, Senior Fellow Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments Toshi Yoshihara.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has called the government to ban Ajinomoto (MSG).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they will brief the President and the Health Minister on the health issues in the use of Ajinomoto.
He said that media had reported the ban of Ajinomoto in Pakistan. Sri Lankan farmers too use Ajinomoto as a pesticide and insecticide since 2015 after the ban on Glyphosate and since 2015 the import of Ajinomoto to Sri Lanka has shown an alarming increase, he said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, foetus expose to a high dose of MSG causes autism to develop and overactive behaviour. It also leads to low weight births with danger of developing diabetes and overweight. The research done using animals had proved that MSG also causes diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure) and over weight.
Some restaurants and eating houses add a few tea spoons of Ajinomoto into food, especially into Koththu which is highly dangerous and over the approved levels. The President has already launched a programme to promote poison free food, he added.

CID seeks legal action on Mahendrans extradition
The Attorney Generals Department yesterday informed Court that the CID is in the process of initiating necessary legal action to extradite former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara informed Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne that Interpol has already issued a Red Notice against Arjuna Mahendran in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue. Jayasundara detailed that the Red Notice issued by Interpol would be effective across 192 countries.
In order to institute extradition law against Arjuna Mahendran,the CID sought a Court order directing the registrar of Fort Magistrates Court that a certified copy of entire case record be provided to the CID.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till May 10 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English to the arrest former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue.
The court had issued a warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with the court orders.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Defence Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.

Owing to poor publicity networks, people are unaware of current development projects being carried out by the government. The country's TV channels do not provide necessary coverage for such projects, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a gathering following the opening of the new jetty, accompanied by Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi at the Tangalle Fisheries Harbor.
The jetty covers a 1,000-square metre area [100 m (length) x 10 m (breadth)] and would enable the docking/mooring of eighty fishing crafts.
The minister said there was a plea for his removal from the United Peoples' Freedom Alliance General Secretary post and added that he would resign when President Maithripala Sirisena provides his consent.
He said that the 16-member group of ministers who forwarded the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, was making allegations against him and other ministers.

Death knell for Champions Trophy - replaced by World T20 tournament
KOLKATA, Thursday: The International Cricket Council said Thursday it will kill off the Champions Trophy tournament and replace it with a world T20 championship that will be held every two years.
The death-knell for the 50-over Champions Trophy is the latest stage of efforts to use 20 over cricket in a new campaign to get wider recognition and a potential Olympic place.
"The T20 format we always knew was the vehicle for growing the game and transforming the game from being a sport played by a few countries to a truly global sport," ICC chief executive Dave Richardson said after the world body met in Kolkata.
The next Champions Trophy "will be turned into a world T20 and that fits in with our strategy to use T20 as a way of growing the game," Richardson added.
It means there will be a World T20 in Australia in 2020 and another the following year. But Richardson said after 2021 the World T20 would be held every two years "to provide more teams with more opportunities to play".
The 50-over World Cup will remain a four yearly event. It is in England next year and India in 2023.
Richardson said cricket still holds out hope of getting an Olympic place by the time of the 2028 Los Angeles Games.
In a further boost to the T20 game, the ICC has also decided to give "international status" to all 20 over matches between the world body's 100-plus member nations.
"New minimum standards will be introduced making it as easy as possible for members to play international cricket in a sustainable and affordable way," said an ICC statement.
Global rankings will also be introduced from November for women's teams and May 2019 for men.
CODE OF CONDUCT 
The ICC Code of Conduct review was also discussed with both the ICC Board and Member Chief Executives united in their commitment to address player behaviour. There was clear direction from both to move towards stricter and heavier sanctions for ball tampering and other offences which were indicative of a lack of respect, this would include abusive language, send-offs and dissent to an umpires decision. In parallel with that, the creation of a culture of respect that embodies the spirit of cricket on and off the field of play.
FUTURE TOURS PROGRAM 
ICC Members have signed off a new Future Tours Program (FTP) for 2019-2023 that incorporates the introduction of a World Test Championship and an additional ICC World T20 event in place of the Champions Trophy in 2021. This provides opportunities for 16 teams to compete at a global level with a sub-regional, regional and global qualification process every two years, giving more regular cricket to more Members.
The final structure of the FTP (19-23), which received unanimous backing, includes the following:

ICC Cricket World Cup  2019, 2023
ICC World T20  2020, 2021
ICC World Test Championship
Final  2021, 2023
World Test Championship
Cycle 1  2019-2021
Cycle 2  2021-2023
ICC Cricket World Cup Qualification League  2020-2022
All bilateral Tests, ODIs and T20Is outside of the above competitions
CHAIRMAN OF ICC 
The Board agreed the process by which the ICC Chairman will be elected for the next two years from June when current Chairman Shashank Manohars first two-year term expires.

Everything You Need To Know About Ayurveda
Ayurveda is a traditional style of medicine which uses completely natural treatments and emphasizes a balanced lifestyle. Although predominantly associated with India, its massively popular in Sri Lanka, where you cant walk a block without finding another ayurvedic dispensary or clinic. Ayurveda has also gained a foothold in Europe and, predictably, an unending line of hotels and spas in Sri Lanka (always quick to capitalize on tourists) have started to offer ayurvedic vacations from a week to a month long.
Im skeptical of alternative medicine, but ayurveda has such a long history and so many practitioners that itd be folly to completely dismiss it. With over 3500 years of practice, refinement and experience, ayurvedas tenets are certainly well-tested. Much of it is common-sense and impossible to refute  healthy living, hygiene, balanced diet  but other aspects are more peculiar.
Ayurveda teaches that there are three basic types of people: Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Vata-types are delicate and easily excitable. Pitta are sensitive people with an average build, who can easily maintain their weight, and have sharp, yellow teeth (!) The Kapha are large, oily people with a strong constitution.
Depending on your type, you must concentrate on various areas of health and watch out for diseases to which youre especially susceptible. For example, I was told that Im a Pitta, and so must limit the amount of salt I eat, and avoid over-heating.
I received my diagnosis from an authority: the resident doctor at the Wedamedura Clinic in Kandy. Aching and exhausted from our busy first few weeks in Sri Lanka, we decided to award ourselves with Wedameduras Full Treatment. For two and a half blissful hours, our bodies were poked, rubbed, prodded and dripped upon.
It began with an extremely thorough full-body massage; head, face, feet, toes, arms, back, shoulders, chest and stomach (you might be thinking to yourself that a stomach massage sounds awful; youd be right). Afterwards, we were set in front of large bowls of hot water and oil and, with towels draped on our heads, made to inhale the steam. This was rough, but my face and throat felt great afterwards.
Then I was brought into a separate room and made to lie down on a table. My eyes were covered and hot oil was dripped onto my forehead, while my captors cackled together in an unintelligible tongue behind me. Sounds like a torture scene out of some bad 80s flick, but this was my introduction to shirodhara massage. And I loved it.
For roughly five minutes, a variety of hot oils were poured slowly out onto the middle of my forehead. By gently massaging the third eye (think of the Hindus forehead dot), shirodhara relaxes the muscles in the brain and head.
The warm oil spreading into my hair felt like a scalp massage from ghost fingers. The treatment ended with a steam bath, a strong shower, and a checkup with the doctor. She remarked that my blood pressure was excellent  after a deeply relaxing 150-minute massage, I would hope so.
We loved our experience at Wedamedura. Unlike many (in fact, almost all) of the packages offered by Sri Lankas various resorts and hotels, this a legitimately ayurvedic place, with a staff trained and licensed in the practice. In addition to massages of varying lengths, they offer week-long ayurvedic vacations which encompass everything from yoga and diet, to sightseeing around Kandy.
So, ayurveda. I dont know. The massage was incredible, and now that Ive learnt my type, I think Ill have to do a bit more research. Although I cant imagine myself gnawing on tree bark anytime soon, theres surely a lot of practical wisdom to be gleaned from this ancient system of medicine.

Namals alleged money laundering case
FCID yet to receive AGs  advice on legal action
The FCID conducting investigations against five suspects including Hambantota district MP Namal Rajapaksa for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.15 million in a company owned by Namal Rajapaksa, yesterday informed Court that they were yet to receive the Attorney Generals (AG) advice regarding the future course of legal action against the suspects.
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Pradeep Liyanage, the FCID said that the preliminary investigations regarding the incident have been concluded and sought the AGs advice in this regard. Accordingly, further magisterial inquiry into the incident was fixed for October 25.
Meanwhile, the Court was informed that Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa, who had evaded court since the inception, is living in Australia. The prosecutors told court that they have taken necessary steps to extradite Indika Prabath Karunajeewa. The Court had issued warrants through Interpol for the arrest of Indika Prabhath Karunajeewa.
Four suspects Namal Rajapaksa, Sudarshana Bandara Ganewatta, Nithya Senani and Sujani Bogollagama were present in Court. The travel bans imposed against them were lifted until the next magisterial inquiry.
The FCID had commenced investigations into a complaint that MP Namal Rajapaksa had allegedly purchased Hello Corp.Pvt. Ltd for Rs.100 million using ill-gotten funds of Gowers Corporation and NR Consultation Pvt Ltd, allegedly owned by Namal Rajapaksa.
The FCID informed Court that investigations revealed that MP Rajapaksa had been allegedly involved in money laundering amounting to Rs. 15 million at NR Consultation Pvt Ltd and another Rs.30 million in Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd, in 2012. The Attorney General had filed indictments in the Colombo High Court against Namal Rajapaksa and five others for alleged money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million at NR Consultation.
Police alleged that money laundering transactions had taken place through a company named Boston Capital, allegedly owned by Rohan Iriyagolla and he has revealed everything in this regard.
Wasantha Samarasinghe, in his complaint, alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being a MP, from the Rs.125 million he earned through illegal means.

## Title: Fitch: Govt on track with IMF program

Fitch: Govt on track with IMF program
The government has shown strong commitment to the IMF program that began in June 2016. The IMF announced on April 20 it had reached staff level agreement on the 4th review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), subject to approval of the automatic fuel pricing mechanism, a Fitch Ratings statement said yesterday.
It said, the recent political developments have created some uncertainty and prolonged upheaval could undermine investor confidence. That said, the unrest has had limited economic impact so far, and Sri Lankas B+ sovereign rating already factors in a degree of political risk.
The statement further said, We noted an improving policy framework that supported macroeconomic stability when we affirmed Sri Lankas rating with a Stable Outlook in February 2018. Structural fiscal reforms, such as a VAT hike, have pushed up the revenue-to-GDP ratio and narrowed the fiscal deficit in recent years. An Inland Revenue Act in 2017 implemented from 1 April 2018 is likely to increase revenue further.
This progress may still continue if recent political problems can be resolved and the government keeps in place an economic team that prioritises reform and stability. Some positive efforts have continued even amid the upheaval. For example, in March 2018 an Active Liability Management Act was passed and the cabinet approved amendments to the Monetary Law Act (MLA), which facilitate flexible inflation targeting.
The risk of political instability disrupting policy continuity might be mitigated by the election schedule. The presidential election is not due until end-2019, and parliamentary elections will follow. Early elections would require approval from a two-thirds majority of parliament and the president. The current administration is therefore likely to remain in power for at least another 18 months.
However, policy implementation looks likely to become slower and more challenging. Reform distractions and pressure for more populist policies might also rise as Sri Lanka enters an election cycle. Fuel and electricity price reforms to create automatic adjustment mechanisms were an IMF structural benchmark to be completed by end-2016. Approval of the fuel price reform is a requirement of the completion of the IMFs next review, and further delay in implementation could raise risks to the fiscal outlook.
Large upcoming debt maturities and low reserve coverage make Sri Lanka vulnerable to shifts in global investor confidence, which could be affected by an extended period of political unrest or signs of waning commitment to the IMF program.
Gross external debt was equivalent to 59% of GDP in 2017, and a quarter of this - around USD15 billion - is due to be repaid in 2019-22. The Active Liability Management Act may allow the authorities to smooth debt repayments, while foreign reserves were bolstered by a sovereign bond issuance of USD2.5 billion in April.
However, reserves stood at just USD7.3 billion in March 2018 and Sri Lankas international liquidity ratio of 69% is well below the 147% median for sovereigns rated at B or below. A high proportion of public debt is denominated in foreign currency, which could weaken repayment ability should there be sustained rupee depreciation. The rupee has weakened by 2.4% against the US dollar so far in 2018.

Food for thought
The 16 SLFP rebels who quit the unity government following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is planning to cross the floor of the House on May 8 when parliament convenes for the new session, and sit in the Opposition benches but professing to support President Maithripala Sirisena, rebel MP Laskman Yapa Abeywardena told the media the other day. He and the other rebels were adamant that they would not play any part in a government that has the UNP as its chief component. They insist that there cannot be a journey with a government in which Ranil Wickremesinghe is the Prime Minister. Ranil Wickremesinghe agamethi wela inna aanduwak samaga ape gamanak ne, Abeyweardena was emphatic. Dilan Perera too signaled in no uncertain terms that their association with government, that included the UNP, was now history, while Dayasiri Jayasekera, after some procrastination, finally stepped down, and, like the rest, attacked the UNP and its leader.
Amidst this brouhaha on the part of the SLFP rebels comes the news that Cabinet portfolios are once again for the asking for those who quit the government following the NCM, if indeed they return to the fold.
True, those who quit stand to lose all their ministerial perks, including salary cuts, vehicles, special accommodation at elite addresses, personnel staff etc. It will be interesting to see if there will be any takers, particularly after the public spectacle made by the departing ministers, virtually portraying themselves as martyrs.
Addressing a news conference, on Wednesday, SLFP spokesman Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said his party has informed the UNP that those who had voted for the NCM should also be given portfolios, if they so desire, adding the Premier Wickremesinghe was told in no uncertain terms of the SLFP's stand regarding Cabinet portfolios for those who voted for the NCM.
It is not clear if the rebels have been approached in this regard by the SLFP and if they (rebels) are willing to eat humble pie and accept Cabinet portfolios, once again, after what they have been saying about the UNP and its leader. But the likes of Mahinda Samarasinghe could not be unaware how these rebels, particularly the ex-ministers, conducted themselves while holding important Cabinet portfolios. For instance Susil Premajayantha was going about bad mouthing the PM at every turn, openly critical of the Hambantota port agreement and was publicly criticizing the UNP for selling state assets. Ditto for his erstwhile colleague Dayasiri Jayasekera, who, only the other day, shortly after leaving the government, was seen wrapping his arms around Mahindananda Aluthgamage in the company of Dilan Perera in the Fort Magistrate Court premises. How viable will offering Cabinet posts, once again, to such types, when it is quite clear where their loyalties lay, perhaps, Mahinda Samarasinghe will be able to explain.
Equally it will be untenable for the ex-ministers who voted for the NCM to sit in the company of Premier Wickremesinghe, at Cabinet. Also, in an ironic twist, being accommodated in the Cabinet once again, they will from time to time be compelled to vote for Bills presented by the Prime Minister in parliament, signifying their CONFIDENCE in the PM. Are they going to barter away their credibility, or whatever is left of it, in this manner Besides, the return of the prodigals are not going to be taken to kindly by the young Turks in the UNP occupying the back benches who were vociferous in wanting the renegades thrown out.
Premier Wickremesinghe who is having a lot on his plate at the moment, no doubt, will be risking another rebellion within the party ranks if he sanctions the reentry of the 16 SLFP rebels who clamoured, and, is still clamouring for his ouster.
Believe It or Not
In one of the most bizarre happenings one would ever encounter, and one that could be right out of Ripley's Believe It or Not, a notorious underworld figure celebrated his wedding with full police protection at a reception hall in Wattala. The reason. A rival underworld leader was gunning for our man, according to a report in a vernacular newspaper.
Full police protection, including backup jeeps and motorcycle escorts were provided to the young couple right from Marriage Registrar's office to the honeymoon destination.
All the guests, numbering over 300, were thoroughly searched by a police contingent numbering over 20, at the reception hall with the Wattala OIC too in attendance. What is more, written orders to the Wattala Police for police protection for the wedding had come from the IGP, no less. This follows a request from the groom (to the IGP) that there will be an attempt on his life on the big day.
Below this particular news item another report states that two STF personnel who went on a raid to seize heroin in the same Wattala area were set upon and brutally assaulted by an underworld gang. The two policemen who were seriously injured in the attack are receiving treatment at the Ragama Hospital.
Sri Lanka, a land like no other.

Central Bank ANNUAL REPORT - 2017 LAUNCH
Foreign reserves up to record US$ 9.98 bn
The stabilisation policy measures taken by the Central Bank and the government in the past two years has resulted in reserves increasing from US dollars 8 billion by end 2017 to a historic US$ 9.88 billion, said Governor Central Bank, Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday.
He expressed these views after submitting the Central Bank Annual report to Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Adverse weather conditions and their spillover effects continued to affect real economic activity and the economy recorded a growth of 3.1 per cent in real terms. However we predict this to grow to 5.5% end of the year, he said.
Coomaraswamy said that the annual average inflation too was managed well last year. He said that several measures were introduced to deepen and develop the domestic foreign exchange market further during the year as well.
Such measures helped the Central Bank to purchase a significant amount of foreign exchange from the domestic market without creating excess volatility in the exchange rate, while facilitating a market based exchange rate aligned with macroeconomic fundamentals.
The overall balance of the balance of payments (BOP) recorded a surplus of US dollars 2.1 billion in 2017 after two years of deficits, as a result of significant inflows to the financial account. Substantial inflows were observed in the form of debt capital, while foreign direct investment (FDI) recorded the highest ever inflows in 2017 supported by improving investor sentiments.
Nevertheless, the improvements in relation to the government securities market, which corrected some distortions that prevailed in 2015 and 2016, resulted in a significant decline in yields on government securities, thus exerting a downward effect on some market interest rates towards the end of the year.
In the external current account, although earnings from exports increased to the highest levels recorded, the increase in imports, mainly arising from drought related imports of petroleum and rice as well as increased importation of gold, caused a wider trade deficit. Gold imports too contributed largely towards import of increase
The Governor said that with the tax import on Gold exports the prices would be in par with India and the smuggling in large volumes to India too would reduce.
The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 2 per cent during the year, while the real effective exchange rate indices also depreciated, raising the competitiveness of the currency. Such a fairly-valued currency in real terms is expected to enable a gradual adjustment of the current account deficit of the BOP in the period ahead.
He said that this would not have a negative impact no have additional payments for debt repayment. We also expect that the exchange would stabilize soon, he added.

Fusion of myths, legends and art
Martin Russell writing his monograph on the art of George Keyt has said, They represent a powerful and self confident development of the Indian tradition. The contemporaries as his David Paynter, Justin Deraniyagala and Harry Pieris received their art education in Europe and they introduced the art traditions and techniques of the European artists into Sri Lanka.
George Keyt was the son of Henry Keyt and Constance Sproule born in Ampitiya close to Kandy on April 17, 1901 and he passed away in a private hospital in Colombo at the age of 92 on July 31, 1993. George Keyt on the other hand relied on the art tradition of India which he skilfully evolved into a distinctive style of painting and drawings spanning over seven decades of his chequered career as an artist of Sri Lanka.
At first Keyt attended St.Helens Gilrl School in Kalutara, and later he received his secondary education at Trinity College Kandy. As a student at Trinity College he developed a keen interest in art and poetry. When riots broke out in Kandy in 1915, he sketched some scenes of the riots for his principal Gordon Fraser and won his admiration for his skill in capturing the incidents. He had the distinction of selling his first Biblical picture he painted to Mrs. Dias thereby displayed his early prospects of an artist in the making. In 1918 when he was 18 years old he left school for employment in Colombo at Studio Plate the then the leading firm of photographers where he learnt the art of improving the negatives with his brush. His interest in art made him study the elements of art from George de Niese the well known artist in the art circles in Colombo.
The Buddhist revival movement in the 1920s, gave Keyt the opportunity to write poetry, stories and articles on Buddhist themes which were was illustrated within drawings and they were published in W.B. Bastians Buddhist annuals. Keyts early painting Women Bathing exhibited for one night at the Purcell Room in Colombo was painted in water colours or gouche showed a woman wearing a cloth for bathing. This figure appeared similar to a stone carving of Buddhist or Hindu figure but not statuesque, on the contrary the figure suggested movement. The figure appeared to remain in that position for not more than a fraction of a second. Her left arm rests on her thigh and the rest of her figure showed torque and movement.
Pablo Neruda the Chilean poet then living in Colombo impressed upon him to draw from life. This resulted in painting Govindamma the temple dancer showing her voluptuous figure. Later Keyt was the son of Henry Keyt and Constance Sproule born in Ampitiya close to Kandy on April 17, 1901 and lie passed away in a private hospital in Colombo at the age of 92 on July 31, 1993. was influenced by the art of Rabindranath Tagore and Abhindranath Tagore and the Bengali school of art. The work of Cezanne and the French art helped him to change his style of painting. Justin Deraniyagala had a full control of colour and composition in painting his figures. Keyt on the other hand painted thinly outlining his figures with a thick line using bright colours mixed with either petrol or turpentine on canvas or jute. The formation of the 43 Group through the initiative of Lionel Wendt who was well known for his photography and also as a pianist, gave the opportunity to artists to exhibit their work in Sri Lanka and abroad. The translation of the Sanskrit poems of Shri Jayadevas Gita Govinda by Keyt with the help of Harold Peiris who was a scholar form Oxford was published in 1940, when Keyt was living in Bombay. The central theme in Gita Govinda , was the sublime love of Radha and Krishna gave Keyt a poignant theme to paint. He painted Krishnas body in blue and Radhas in golden yellow.
Keyt in painting another work Jalaja named after a South Indian dancer portrayed her figure in a captivating manner. When he painted Woman and Bird he aroused a sense of curiosity in the mind of the viewer. The appearance of the falling blue of her garment with the foliage and the bird painted with a low note give this feeling. His favourite themes centred around Sita, Parvati and Damayanti portrayed moods and feelings. The portrayal of the Indian heroes and heroines described in art and poetry Nayika, conveyed his style of painting portraits. The Indian epics, Ramayana and Mahabharatha formed a wide range of themes for him to express himself in a series of paintings which won the admiration of Rasikas. It is apparent that he derived his influence from the art and sculpture of India especially Ajanta, Bagh, Khajuravo, Konak and also Vatsyanas Kamasutra  the Hindu treatise of intimacy between man and woman. According to Keyt the intimacy or love between man and woman forms sensuous aspect of love which he described as Sachitananda  the inner happiness and not carnal desire.
He also painted on the Shiva theme and his notable paintings included Sringara Rasa, the Lords Departure, Shri Krishna and the Gopis, Varsha, Vihara, Ragas, Raganis, Sita and Parvati. His large scale work was Gotatmi Vihara Murals in Borella in which he depicted some selected episodes from the life story of the Buddha based on the description given in the Classical Sinhala text Pujavaliya. In painting the Gotami murals he painted life-size figures following the style of Hindu and Buddhist art in India and Sri Lanka. But he deviated from the traditional art of the sittaras of the Kandyan period. He drew his figures imaginatively showing the dresses and jewellery worn by the Sakyas. When he painted the murals he never made any preliminary sketches as such. Instead the images were drawn straight away on the walls and his style evolved naturally.
The Buddha was depicted throughout as the Great Compassionate One and His figure dominated in a heroic scale. The most striking episode in the murals is the Mara Yuddhaya, the conquest of the forces of Mara and this scene has some resemblance to Pablo Picasos famous painting Guernica the destruction of the small town by the same name in Spain, by bombing during the Spanish civil war. The forces of Mara have been shown disturbing the calm and serene mind of the Buddha. This was shown with the weird looking masks worn by the dancers when they perform Thovil in the deep south of Sri Lanka. Keyt used them in painting Mara Yuddhaya, the evil forces of Mara.
Keyt once explained how he painted, I spent several years in India. The Ajanta frescoes, Rajasthan murals and Jain miniatures inspired me. He also added each work has about four stages. When he started painting he used to stop after each stage and review his work and made the necessary modifications. He painted using varied styles on still life, landscape portraiture and village life which he did after he moved away from urban life and went to live in Harispattuwa at first, before he moved to live among the Kandyan peasantry in Sirimalwatte. He had the penchant to use bright colours. The simplicity of his designing gave strength to his figures which he combined both with ancient and modern styles. Keyt had understood the Bhakti cult of the Vaishnavites and possessed perceptiveness in employing the Indian mythology and legend and created poetic metaphors when he painted his figures. He was pre-occupied while he painted mountains and their slopes, expanse of water, parks, trees and buildings. A change was made in painting when he gave up naturalistic style and then relied on calligraphic line. He drew figures showing full face of women and men or their profile, three quarter face all in one, limbs and garments which he displayed using bright colours. His paintings were exhibited with others in Colombo. The notable exhibition was held with Justin Deraniyagala at the National Art Gallery in Colombo, sponsored by the Ceylon Society of Arts. Some of his selected paintings are on display at the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi, Birla Museum of Modern Art in Calcutta, the Modern Museum of Art in Bombay and also at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Keyt is undoubtedly the painter of our time who interpreted for us subjects from Hindu mythology and legend giving them a contemporary meaning.

GAYANI DE ALWIS ELECTED AS  CHAIRPERSON OF CILT SRI LANKA
The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) Sri Lanka held its 34thAnnual General Meeting (AGM) recently at The Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo, attended by an august gathering of members.
Gayani De Alwis was elected, uncontested as the 21st Chairperson of CILT Sri Lanka. It is the second time that CILT Sri Lanka elected a female Chairperson after 27 years. The three Vice Chairpersons elected were Dr. Namali Sirisoma, Channaka De Alwis and Gihan Jayasinghe. Dr. Lalith Edirisinghe and Upali Gunawardena were elected as the Secretary and Treasurer respectively.
De Alwis is an experienced supply chain professional with over two decades of experience in the profession, locally and overseas. She was the former Director of Customer Service of Unilever Sri Lanka. She was the founding Chairperson of Women in Logistics and Transport (WiLAT) Sri Lanka and had been an active Chartered member of CILT Sri Lanka Council since 2011.
The AGM also featured strong representation from the womens forum of CILT Sri Lanka, WiLAT Sri Lanka and the Young Professionals Forum (YPF) Sri Lanka and below are the extracts from the newly elected Chairpersons inaugural address themed STRONGER TOGETHER.
We are the only chartered professional body in the country for professionals engaged in logistics, transport and supply chain. Our aim is to develop the science and art of logistics and transport.
CILT was setup in 1919 in the UK, and we are celebrating our 100 years of existence next year. Over the years the CILT has been led by 20 exemplary chairpersons, bringing the CILT to what it is today. SL has been very progressive towards gender diversity with Mandri Sahabandu, our first female Chairperson appointed in 1991, long before CILT international appointed Dr Dorothy Chan in 2013.
Today in Sri Lanka there is much interest in logistics, transport and supply chain as a discipline.We have seen many universities and educational institutes venturing into this space both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.We have seen international university study programs launched in Sri Lanka.This in fact is an opportunity for us to develop a continuous pipeline of student and professional members by engaging them with CILT.
Another priority therefore is for CILT to continue to accredit more educational service providers and courses run by universities and position CILT qualification and accreditation as a preferred choice for the industry.
CILT will continue to assure quality of these programs by developing course curriculum and through the quality assurance process.Advanced certificate program, which CILT started, will be concluded in September this year with the batch completing the program.
CILT will also develop tailor made programs for companies and for public through experts from our membership.So we will be reaching out to the membership in due course to enroll them in our faculty.
Logistics and transport landscape has changed significantly in our country and there are many national programs that will rely on logistics, transport and supply chain expertise. As the Premier Chartered Professional Body in this discipline, there is so much on offer and so much to contribute, said Chairperson of CILT Sri Lanka Gayani De Alwis .
This is an understanding that we all of us should have in ensuring delivery of our third objective; policy advocacy.We must be neutral and play an active role in offering our advice to the government on national issues of relevance to logistics and transport. Already our membership is engaged in this regard and we need to continue this to support the government in their endeavor to make Sri Lanka a logistics hub, she said.
National policy for shipping and maritime sector development, national civil aviation policy development, bus priority lane, Megapolis, evaluation committee on the issue of new route permits through tender, CCC National Agenda Committee on L&T etc., are some of the areas our members have got engaged with, she said.
Our two dynamic groups in our fold  YPF and WiLAT are assets to CILT.These two groups should be nurtured and guided to make CILT a vibrant place. YPF which was formed in 2012 has come a long way in the past 6 years and they are a treat to watch.
Their achievements have been recognised globally by CILT by making our YPF Chair an YPF ambassador, for the second time. Two areas I would like YPF to work on this year is to engage more working young professionals and bringing them to your fold and encourage student membership upgrade to MILT.
WiLAT too have made great strides in the past 5 years and their flagship ignite mentoring program has received global accolades and WiLAT SL is leading this initiative globally now, she added.

Holding back the years
Shimmi Munshi says she regularly gets mistaken for her sons girlfriend because she looks so young  suggesting she stopped ageing at 20.
Shimmi, from Bolton, is 41 years old, but looks quite a bit younger. At age 20 she gave birth to Ameen, her only son, who is now 20  but even when he was a teenager people thought she was her sons girlfriend.
Ive always looked young, says Shimmi. As my friends began ageing, I seemed to go in the opposite direction, but Ive no idea why. I was a single mum, juggling work and motherhood, and anyone would think the stress might have started to show. Instead, I seemed to stop ageing. I didnt notice it particularly, but all my friends did. They were all moaning that Id discovered the secret of eternal youth and they wanted me to share it.
Shimmi says theres no big secret to her looks  she hasnt had surgery and her skincare is pretty basic.
At the school gates, the other mums would ask if Id had plastic surgery, or if I had spent a fortune on skin creams and beauty treatments, she says.
And they were gutted to learn I had no secrets. There was no mystery at all to the way I looked. Id certainly never had cosmetic surgery. And my beauty routine consisted of baby wipes and whatever moisturiser was on special offer in the supermarket! I have never spent a lot of money on beauty products though of course, I take care of myself; I drink green tea and I dont smoke or drink booze. Im a member of the local gym and I drink lots of water. But I am no fitness fanatic or beauty queen. In fact, I rarely look in the mirror. I dont actually think about my looks much at all. Shimmi reckons her youthful looks are likely down to great genetics, as her parents, Siraj and Nooie, both look great in their old age. But while her young looks may be the envy of her mates, Shimmi says that sometimes looking like a 20-year-old can be annoying.
Ive been asked for ID buying alcohol so many times and sometimes they just refuse to serve me outright, she says.
Its worth it though to see the look on the shop assistants face when I hand over my ID. I feel like the female version of Peter Pan  the girl who never grew up. When my son was younger, people we didnt know presumed we were either brother and sister or a couple. We were so close, because I had brought him up on my own, and so there was a special bond between us. Anyone who met us would just naturally treat him like he was my boyfriend. We went on holiday to Poland, and I had booked an excursion, and the tour guide wouldnt believe that we were mum and son. He kept insisting we were a couple and Ameen was so embarrassed. Another time, in Turkey, the locals thought we were brother and sister. At Ameens prom night, people thought we were a couple too. Its very flattering and it made me giggle but it drove him mad! Even at parents evening at high school, his teacher said to me: We really would rather see Ameens mum. She thought I was his sister!
Thankfully Ameen isnt too bothered.
As a teenager, he didnt like all the attention, says Shimmi.
He is now 20 and has got used to the constant comments about his mums looks. I think hes finally accepted all the fuss. He still lives at home and we are as close as ever, so it hasnt affected our relationship at all. Hes training in IT and Im very proud of him.
Shimmis looks are especially surprising considering she has gastroparesis, a disease that makes her vomit up to 60 times a day and means shes regularly in and out of hospital. I might be feeling absolutely rubbish but somehow I still manage to look young, she says.
I wish I had some special secret I could share  but the truth is, Ive no idea how I do it. Hopefully my good luck will last into old age and I will be still be looking 30 when Im 80!

Chinas technology firm Huawei, which is betting on the biggest opportunity in the smartphone market in India, wants to establish itself as a premium smartphone brand, a segment where it would compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung, a top official said.
We are number three smartphone maker in the world In India, our focus will be to position Huawei brand among the top premium brands...comparable with Apple or Galaxy [Samsungs range of smartphones], said Peter Zhai, CEO, Huawei India consumer business group.
Wireless investments
In India, wireless investments are much more than fixed line. I believe smartphones will grow faster. It is the biggest opportunity for us, he added.
The company unveiled two smartphones Huawei P20 Pro at a price tag of 64,999 and the Huawei P 20 lite costing 19,999. Smartphones would also help boost the firms consumer business that includes data cards, accessories, tablets and laptops.
The consumer business in India just started, said Mr. Zhai. It shows very huge promise in the future. Consumer business of Huawei could be its biggest business in India, surpassing infrastructure, in the next three-five years, he said. Globally, the consumer business group is worth about $36.4 billion.
On product roadmap, he said, The number of products does not matter. Every year, in the Indian market, hundreds of models are launched but there is a lack of reliable brands how to exist for long time is a challenge in consumer business.
To win this market in short term is not difficult if your prices are cheap... But if you want to do long term business, and be a reliable brand, you need every product to be [of] high quality and sustainableOur investments in technology dont allow us to sell the phone at 9,999, he said. On advertising spend, Mr. Zhai said, advertising should be proper. Too much advertising will increase the price of the product. (BusinessLine)

An industry in peril: Salvaging Sri Lankas tourism
The recent incidents that took place in Mirissa where a group of Dutch tourists were assaulted and sexually harassed and another group of Israeli tourists were assaulted at the Midigama beach have brought to light the issues facing the tourism industry. Despite the government efforts to promote tourism as a key source of revenue to the country, the question arises as to whether we are heading in the right direction to market Sri Lanka as a safe tourist destination.
The Mirissa incident is not the first, while previously a British tourist Khuram Shaikh was stabbed and then shot to death and his Russian girlfriend raped at a tourist resort in Tangalle on Christmas Day in 2011. Seven years later such incidents are still happening. Hence, how safe are Sri Lankas beaches and tourist resorts for tourists
Many in the tourist industry down south allege that the beach boys are the main cause of such incidents. The Dutch tourists too were recently said to have been attacked brutally by these beach boys, who seem to be under the influence of liquor and drugs. According to the Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga, the main problem for such incidents is that there are many unlicensed bars and illegal liquor and drugs that are being distributed in the area. He said the Excise Department should be held responsible for not having taken measures to raid such illegal establishments and maintain proper standards.
Foreign women are attracted to savage looking locals.
However, according to Weligama Urban Council Chairman Rehan Wijeratne Jayawickrama, this is an isolated incident and it does not suggest that the Mirissa beaches are unsafe for tourists. These sort of incidents do not occur frequently. An action was taken within 48 hours to address the problem. We intend to organise awareness programmes in collaboration with NGOs and the tourism ministry to educate these beach boys on the importance of respecting women and on their behaviour and approach.
He also blamed the police for failing to notify the LG authorities about the incident, of which they knew only through media reports.
Speaking to the Daily News about the issues facing the tourist hotels and operators in the country, the owner of Calamander Unawatuna Beach Paloma Scott said she too has a business in Unawatuna with the same type of setting up as Mirissa with bars restaurants etc. But she said in Unawatuna there isnt much of a problem with beach boys as in Mirissa. But, she noted that generally, it is the attitude of the locals towards foreign women is where the problem lies. 
Minister Amaratunga said he intends to request for the assistance of the Navy to further fortify security on the beaches of the country. The government has also allocated Rs. 30 million to establish police posts at 20 identified tourist hotspots in order to provide better security for tourists visiting the country. This measure was taken in the wake of the recent incidents that were reported in Mirissa recently, where a group of Dutch tourists were assaulted, said Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
The Minister said in areas where issues have arisen, measures will be taken to by the police to increase security measures and the tourist police will be further strengthened to handle these issues and make Sri Lankas tourist destinations safer for tourists. The Law and Order Ministry and the Tourism Ministry require the cooperation of the public in this regard to notifying us when and if such incidents occur. We need to prevent such incidents from taking place in the future.
However, according to Paloma Scott, increasing the police presence in these tourist hotspots, is just part of the solution. I myself have become friends with the Habaraduwa Police and there are two policemen who patrol the area in the morning and evening and I think even the presence of uniformed officers does have a deterrent effect as it has certainly seen a reduction of the number of beach boys in my area. I think I have fewer beach boys in my area of the beach as a result of constant police patrols.
However, she noted that the key thing is the attitude of men, especially beach boys and tuk-tuk drivers and Sri Lankan men in general. They dont accord the same respect to a foreign woman as they would to a Sri Lankan female. As a foreign woman, I too sense that they treat me differently. I am looked at differently and I am not given that same respect and they always feel that they can push boundaries, she lamented.
Are foreign women attracted to local men
Foreign women are attracted to local men to fulfil their sexual fantasies, said Asanka Kaluarachchi, owner of the Mirissa Beach Wadiya, referring to local males seen on the Mirissa beach sported long hair and tattoos.
The relationships only last a few days and unfortunate incidents like the recent incident result when females make wrong signals, he added. According to Kaluarachchi, with the authorities permitting beach parties, Mirissa is losing its attraction as a tranquil tourist destination where a family could while away the days in peace and quiet. The number of families visiting Mirissa is on the decline while the numbers of young people both local and foreign are on the increase. All most all of them are on to drugs and pills. It is a known fact that almost every type of narcotic is available in Mirissa, he added.
Ananda Jayadewa who has been in the hotel trade for the past 35 years and owns the Paradise Beach Club which is the largest tourist hotel in Mirissa said that visitors to Mirissa who are concerned about their safety should steer clear of the beach parties held each night. Drugs and sex are the main attraction at these events. It is common for attractive females to be served with drinks lazed with drugs and sexually abused. Most incidents are not reported to the police, he noted.
However, responding to claims by local restaurant owners that some foreign women engage with these rough looking beach boys for casual sexual encounters, Paloma said, You cant have one situation without the other. There is no doubt that foreign women would form such casual relationships as there is no doubt that Sri Lankan men are rather good looking and on the surface, they are very chivalrous and respectful, kind, gentle and chatty etc. European men arent that and these European women perhaps feel comfortable around these local men. I think one thing leads onto another, but just because some women want to have such relationships with these men, that does not mean that they can treat all white women badly or judge them in the same manner. 
With regard to claims that the beach parties, seem to be the main hotspots for drugs and other unsociable activities, she said, Yes, in most instances these beach parties are the root of the problem. Even last Sunday night I had the same problem. Just down the bay, there was a party that was held and the thumping the whole night was unbearable. There are rules that are set in place that such loud music cannot be played beyond 11.30 pm with the only exception being on New Years night where these parties are allowed to go on until dawn.
However, although there are rules and regulations, not all establishments follow these rules. Some places can extend the deadline for such parties until 12 midnight especially on the weekends, but certainly not beyond that. Parties also do fuel the overuse of alcohol and drugs and these are places that certain drug dealers hand out to get their customers. But, here again, its the duty of the police to keep the situation under control. Dancing and partying alone is not the problem but its the other unscrupulous activities that go on at these parties is what needs to be prevented, she said.
However, according to Paloma, there are also tourists who come to Sri Lanka and do certain unlawful acts which they would not be able to do in their own countries, with the notion that they could get away with it. So one thing leads onto another. Another thing is that especially local Sri Lankans have this notion that white tourists have loads of money to spend. I would have hoped that the Sri Lankans would be educated enough by now to know that they are no different to the rest of the people.
We too have to work hard to save the money to come on holidays just like everyone else. That money is precious and it is not pleasant when they are ripped off. This again feeds the westerners derision of the local people. I am not saying there still isnt racism, yes there is. The racism of white against the brown people. I have seen white people treat the coloured people differently, but fortunately, this is now changing and we dont see it happening as much. But they could very well be scornful of the local people when they feel that they are being ripped off or cheated on. Then they become aggressive themselves and this is certainly not good for the tourism industry.
The decision to remove all illegal constructions from the coastal areas was taken recently, as these illegal places were found to be flouting all regulations and breeding a culture of drugs and other illegal activities.
According to the Coast Conservation Department Director-General Prabath Chandrakeerthi, they have taken the decision to demolish all illegal constructions along the coastal areas, while 17 such locations are being identified for demolition which will commence on May 1. However, while the Law and Order Ministry, the Police, the Coast Conservation Department and the Tourism Ministry are making arrangements to remove all such illegal constructions and businesses, the Provincial Councils and LG Minister Faiszer Mustapha states that such places should not be demolished or removed as it would affect the livelihood and employment opportunities of the locals.
It is such contradictory actions by the government and lack of proper standards that has led to a situation where there is no standard that is maintained.
Expressing her views on such ad-hock tourist spots and unlicensed bars and restaurants, Paloma Scott said that the hoteliers in the region who own legitimate businesses lament that while they are being charged, monitored and taxed, there are others who simply put up constructions, or offer rooms in their homes and earn the same while not paying anything to the government.
No legal responsibility 
Most of these illegal places have no legal responsibility and as such, all illegal and anti-social activities take place in such places. The recent incident in Mirissa is a fine example of such a situation. While it is important to support the local population make a living through the tourism industry, Sri Lanka needs to also be mindful about protecting the image of the country and promoting it as a safe tourist destination. Commenting on this situation as a legitimate business in the area, Paloma said she feels that everyone should be made to operate on a proper legal standing. They should be licensed and made to apply proper safety rules etc. But the nature of the beach is part of the charm and I must say that what always attract the tourists is not just the big grand hotels but the small constructions that have been erected as a shack has its charm too and attracts tourists as well.
The weather and climate are what tourists come here for and they dont always want to sit in an air-conditioned hotel and would prefer these little open places on the beach with cadjan over your head. This also gives the locals an opportunity to earn a living as all of them are not fishermen.
However, in defence of the small-scale restaurants and bars on the beach which may not be legitimate, which are mushrooming everywhere where people offer bed and breakfast and as it is cheap some tourists also prefer these places, she said, these places are not properly legislated and dont have to pay any taxes etc. which is an issue for the legitimate businesses. So there is a problem here, how do you discriminate Do you just say no shacks or charming huts we just want properly built hotels I think that would be a great shame. I think the problem here is that there are double standards. If you do abide by the rules and get licenses, then you find others nearby doing the same but not paying taxes etc. These illegal places sell liquor, food etc. without licenses while those who do it legitimately too sell the same at the same price. So this is unfair to those who run legitimate businesses. If there are rules you need to apply them to everybody. And most of the small businesses in the southern coast can afford to pay for licenses as they do make quite a profit. They are not very poor that they can afford to pay, she noted.
However, according to Paloma, it is the government officials that are the main problem. A lot of them are corrupt. There is a history of some people getting away with anything by bribing the officials. I think the whole process of local government needs to be looked at. The businesses that operate legitimately and pay their dues need to be protected as well. After all, those who do pay taxes are contributing to the industry, so why should others be allowed to make money without having the overheads of paying taxes etc. while only a few who pay are being burdened This is not fair. The government and the Local Government need to get their act together and implement the law fairly.

International cricket will return to Pakistan soon, says Arthur
Canterbury Thursday: Nine years on from the armed attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore, Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur says he hopes were really close to the worlds leading teams touring there again.
International cricket in Pakistan was effectively suspended for several years after the 2009 attack.
Zimbabwe, however, played several limited-overs fixtures in Pakistan three years ago.
Pakistan have subsequently welcomed a World XI and last year played a Twenty20 international against Sri Lanka in Lahore, while earlier this month they completed a 3-0 at home to the West Indies, the World Twenty20 champions.
But Test cricket has yet to resume in Pakistan, with the United Arab Emirates remaining their home away from home.
I hope were really close, Arthur told reporters on Wednesday.
The colour, the passion, the excitement for our local people to see cricket there was amazing and for our players to play in front of their fans and families and just play at home was amazing.
Weve had a couple of those now -- the World XI, Sri Lanka and now the West Indies, he added. They were great occasions so lets hope that opens the door for a lot more cricket in Pakistan. Arthur, a former head coach of both his native South Africa and Australia, was speaking at Canterbury, where Pakistan begin their tour of Britain and Ireland with a four-day warm-up match against Kent starting Saturday.
Arthurs first Test series in charge of Pakistan ended in an impressive 2-2 draw in England in 2016.
He then oversaw Pakistans 2017 Champions Trophy triumph, which culminated with a stunning win over arch-rivals India in the final of the one-day international tournament at The Oval in London.
Pakistan, after providing the opposition for Irelands inaugural Test, face England in a two-match series.
England will come into that campaign following Test series defeats in both Australia and New Zealand, but Arthur expects them to prove far more threatening on home soil.
Its a little bit early to get too controversial, said a smiling Arthur when asked if Pakistan could could exploit the weakness of an England top-order featuring captain Joe Root.
I saw Dawid Malan play exceptionally well in Perth...we know Root is world-class, (Jonny) Bairstow is world-class, they are a really good side. Pakistan, described by Arthur as a young team, trying to resurrect our Test side following the retirements of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan, will look to left-arm paceman Mohammad Amir to lead their attack.
Amir, whose career was almost ended by a jail term and suspension for spot-fixing during the 2010 Lords Test, has been a key man for Pakistan since making his international return in 2016.
The 26-year-old, a proven swing bowler in English conditions, had his entry to the UK delayed by visa problems but Amir was expected to join the rest of the squad later Wednesday.
Hes our number one bowler, we back him in tough situations, said Arthur. We need him to get the ball swinging, we need him to get his length slightly fuller, and if he gets that hes going to ask a lot of questions. Arthur insisted he was conscious of Amirs workload ahead of the 2019 World Cup in England, where Pakistan will look to repeat their Champions Trophy success in the same 50-over format.
We only have three weeks off in our calendar now before the World Cup, Arthur said.
So we just have to manage them because ultimately we want the best team to play in that 2019 World Cup. Kent will be captained by former England batsman Joe Denly, who played alongside Amir and Babar Azam for the Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League Twenty20 tournament.
They are quality players and Im looking forward to catching up with them this week, said Denly. I know from personal experience that there are some really talented guys in this Pakistan squad. - AFP

Karapitiya doctors on token strike today

Doctors attached to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital will launch a 24-hour token strike today (27).
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the strike is to protest the commencement of heart surgeries by the British doctor who is now investigated for his credentials to conduct heart surgeries.
Hospital sources said that the British surgeon (67) had been performing heart surgeries at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital since 2015 without a valid licence from Britain.
He did not have the practising licence in the United Kingdom (UK) that was needed to be renewed regularly. He only had the registration of the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK, and not practising rights. He was deprived of practising rights in the UK in 2015 for some reasons and he had concealed it while producing his documents to the SLMC, the GMOA said.

Kim and Moon to meet at military demarcation line
SOUTH KOREA: North Koreas leader Kim Jong Un and the Souths president Moon Jae-in will meet at the Military Demarcation Line that divides the peninsula before their summit Friday, Seoul said, in an occasion laden with symbolism.
Moon will greet his visitor at the concrete blocks that mark the border between the two Koreas in the Demilitarized Zone, the chief of the Souths presidential secretariat Im Jong-seok said.
When Kim steps over the line he will become the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War ended 65 years ago.
The meeting will be only the third of its kind, following summits in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, and the high point so far of a rapid diplomatic rapprochement on the tension-wracked peninsula, ahead of a much-anticipated meeting between Kim and US President Donald Trump.
The Norths nuclear arsenal will be high on the agenda. Pyongyang has made rapid progress in its weapons development under Kim, who inherited power from his father in 2011.
Last year it carried out its sixth nuclear blast, by far its most powerful to date, and launched missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, sending tensions soaring as Kim and Trump traded personal insults and threats of war.
Moon seized on the Souths Winter Olympics as an opportunity to try to broker dialogue between them.
But Im played down expectations, saying that the Norths technological advances meant deal would need to be fundamentally different in nature from denuclearisation agreements reached in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Thats what makes this summit all the more difficult, he added.
The difficult part is at what level the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement regarding (the Norths) willingness to denuclearise, he said, and how it will be expressed in text.
In the past, North Korean support for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula has been code for the removal of US troops from the South and the end of its nuclear umbrella over its security ally -- prospects unthinkable in Washington.
Trump has demanded the North give up its weapons, and Washington is pressing for it to do so in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way.
Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told AFP that the issue was not something that can be decided between the North and South.
North Korea will want to see first what kind of offer it will get on regime security guarantees, he said.
That will be discussed at the US-North Korea summit and its not easy to promise denuclearisation before any concrete talks on that. In recent days Seoul has promoted the idea of a path towards a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which stopped with a ceasefire, but Im did not mention the issue.
Reunions of families left divided by the conflict could also be discussed, and Moon has told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he would raise the emotive subject of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the Norths agents.
Kim will be given a military honour guard on Friday and the two leaders will walk to the Peace House, a glass and concrete building on the southern side of the truce village of Panmunjom where the summit will be held.
Kim will sign the guest book before the morning session starts, Im said, describing the occasion as a summit for peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula. The Norths group will cross back to its side for lunch, and before the afternoon session Moon and Kim will together plant a pine tree, which stands for peace and prosperity, on the (Military Demarcation Line), which has symbolised confrontation and division over the past 65 years, Im said.
The soil will come from Mount Paektu, on the Norths border with China, and Mount Halla, on the Souths southern island of Jeju.
After they sign an agreement a joint statement will be issued.
We are thinking it could be called the Panmunjom Declaration, Im added.
A banquet and farewell ceremony will follow in the evening before Kim returns to the North.
Pyongyangs delegation will include Kims sister Kim Yo Jong, one of his closest advisers, who attended the Winter Olympics in the South in February as his envoy. The Norths ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam, who accompanied Yo Jong to the Games, will also be part of the group, as will its foreign and defence ministers.
Unlike in the past, the delegation includes top military official and diplomats, Im said.
We did not expect this. We believe it signals that North Korea views the summit not just as a North-South summit but is also considering the US-North Korea summit. - AFP

Lalith Athulathmudalis absence very much felt today: Minister Fonseka
Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said Sri Lanka experiences today the loss of the late Lalith Athulathmudali.
He was delivering the commemorative speech to mark the 25th death anniversary of the late Lalith Athulathmudali at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
Minister Fonseka said he first met Athulathmudali in 1986, the National Security Ministry at the time. The first and the last official meeting with Athulathmudali was in 1986 when I was the Major General of the Army. He met us to speak about training and the ongoing anti-terrorit operations. I was impressed by the young Minister; he addressed many issues of army officials. He spoke with intelligence in a practical manner. He did not fail to spend a whole day with us. It was the first and the last time I met him, he said.
Minister Fonseka said the country today is experiencing his absence. I rushed to the hospital as a colonel working at the Army Headquarters no sooner than I heard that he had been shot at. Unfortunately, the country lost a great leader that day, he added.
Minister Fonseka said Athulathmudalis performances as the National Security Minister were remarkable.
He concentrated and responded to two main areas to complete the responsibilities entrusted to him in national security. First preparing and dealing with non-military actors including politicians locally and externally and secondly, building up the military and strategic methods, he said.
Minister Fonseka said that being a leading political figure in government, Athulathmudali spoke in length in Parliament about the enormous sacrifices made by the military and also informed the civilians about the situation, the nature and the need for the operations to be carried out by the Army in the north and east.
He could understand the real situation and respond to false accusations. He became a strength and encouragement to the troops. He strongly believed that the people in the military were sacrificing their lives and future for the sake of others and he insisted that civilians should understand this truth, Minister Fonseka said.
The late Athulathmudali spoke to the people about the need to protect democracy in all parts of the country. He rejected communalism and racist and religious differences, he said. Minister Fonseka said that as Athulathmudali was new to the field, he interacted with senior and junior military officials to know facts and information about the situation and studied the strength and shortcoming of the military and immediately took necessary measures.
Minister Fonseka said that when Athulathmudali wanted to strengthen the military, he did not received enough support from the then Finance Minister and he confronted difficulties in finding required finance.
Then he came up with establishing a defence fund. Even at that time, political undercutting had been the order of the day more than the national interest as much as whats happening today. he said.
A book titled Lalith Athulathmudali - Rejitha Semarum written by Udaya Wanasinghe, Ranjith A Palihapitiya and Nandana Kumarapeli was also launched.

Bomb threat onboard MH128
Lankan student to face plea hearing today
The Sri Lankan student who threatened to set off a bomb on board a flight from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur is due to face court for a pre-sentence hearing, SBS News reported.
Manodh Marks, 26, forced Malaysia Airlines flight MH128 to turn back shortly after take-off in June 2017 when he started screaming that he had a bomb. The student, who had been living in Dandenong, Victoria, Australia, was overpowered by passengers and tied up until the flight landed at Melbourne Airport.
Police made passengers stay on the plane for almost 90 minutes before storming the aircraft and arresting Marks.
Officers copped criticism for taking so long to remove Marks, who had actually been holding what authorities called a speaker-type object. Marks pleaded guilty to attempting to take control of an aircraft, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years behind bars.
He is due to face a plea hearing in a County Court today. (SBS News)

## Title: LORNSZ PEREIRA belongs to ROYAL CLASS
## Supertitle:

LORNSZ PEREIRA belongs to ROYAL CLASS
1957 sports saw an individual who was a complete and exemplary sportsman, until he immigrated to Australia in 1974 and that sporting star was none other than LORENSZ PEREIRA a royal sportsman from Royal.
Many of us who track performance class him as one of the best, if not the best, all round sportsman produced by Royal College in its rich history. From cricketer, to rugby football, lawn tennis, athletics. He was similar to another Royalist Dr.C. Thurairaja we featured in this column a last week.
PEREIRA however showed his shinning features in cricket and rugby. As a schoolboy cricketer from the time he donned cricket flannels under Fitzroy Crozier in1956, Michael Willie in 57, he has skipper in 1958 and under Sarath Samarasinghe classy wicket keeper in 1959. He showed top class as a stylish, elegant left hand batsman whom crowds came to watch him execute the cut like a Sathasivam, the off drive like a C.I. Gunesekera, field like a genius in with diving to save runs like a Jonty Rhodes and plucking catches like Bob Simpson would do in the slips. In fact every year of his career at Royal he was acknowledged as the best fielder.
Brilliance an example
I count myself lucky to have played against him and learn to play the game and whose brilliance in the field was an example. When St.Benedicts played Royal at Reid Avenue in 1958, he tossed a flighted off spinning delivery and being bemused by the flight I played too early and was caught and bowled.
Then in the 1959 game at Kotahena facing Lionel Fernandos cutters the writers leg spin/googlies,the off spinners of Cyril Ernest he scored Brian Lara like century to take his team to victory. I pride myself in being able to play against a gentleman of fame like PERERIA and then forge a lasting friendship until he emigrated to Australia in 1974.
On my tours to Australia covering the Sri Lanka teams tours, it happens that I run into the ever smiling- a smile that was writ from birth - and talk of those days when cricket was sport and not a boxing ring. His brother BRYAN played against me in 1957 and 1958 in the under 14 and 16 school matches. Although not having the flamboyance of his brother, he was a dogged batsman to whom making runs that mattered.
Something unique
What is unique was in the 1958 Battle of the blues of 1958 when Michael Tissera captained S.Thomas and PEREIRA Royal, was unbelievable and may not ever occur happen again and that was that Tisserswa caught by wicket keeper Samarasinghe off PEREIRA and in return PERERIRA was caught by wicket keeper Errol Lisk bowled Tissera.
Few sportsmen have the credentials that LORENSZ PEREIRA has. Besides being a sports ICON he obtained his masters from Cambridge University and played cricket for Cambridge under Mike Brearly a future England captain.
On his return he joined John Keeels and became the first non-white to captain both the Colombo Cricket Club and the CH & FC at cricket and rugby clubs respectively. He played under Crozier in the bigun in 1956 and then as deputy to Michael Willie in 1957 he made a memorable debut of making a peach of a half century and bagging 6 wickets. His skipper Willie made a century 121. Then under his leadership in in 1958 he made 35 runs and took 5 wickets. In 1959 under Sarath Samarasinghe he made 65 and took 3 wickets.
Kadalays selection
To quote PEREIRA Royal captain of 1957 Willie wrote; I note that it was note that Kadalaya has nominated PEREIRA as the best fielder Royal prduced. On this matter I must take issue with him as he clearly did not notice Willie prowling alternatively at mid-off and fine leg!
Seriously, PEREIRA was a brilliant fielder, without doubt the best schoolboy fielder of my time. He loved fielding and made it look easy. He used to anticipate the batsmans shot and pulled off some great stop and catches. Of course, the ball would be mis-hit and PEREIRA was caught gong in the wrong direction. PEREIRA was adjudged the SCHOOLBOY CRICKETER OF THE YEAR in 1958. Mithila gutty Guneratna, the Wisden of all things Royal, recounts that PEREIRA , in his debut in th Brady Shield in 1957 under Ratna Sivaratnam ,PEREIRA intercepted a pass from Ken de Joodt to Sena Sylva in the trinity 25 and scored a spectacular try under the Trinity posts leaving the crowds gasping for breath.

He followed that up in the Brady of 1958 under the captaincy of Dudley Fernando winning the Bradby from Trinity after 8 years by scoring the most spectacular try when in he threw the ball into a line out on the right wing raced across the field behind the ensuing three quarters movement and scored under the corner flag untouched which is now acclaimed as the legendary try in the Bradby. PEREIRAS is considered as the leading outstanding all-round sportsman in the history of Royal College, Colombo.
No wonder he was awarded five colors in major sports at Royal in cricket, rugby, tennis, athletics in addition, public school athletics placed 3rd in the 100 yards final including the victorious 4 x 100 team. It was not, merely the five colors but the quality and extremely high standards achieved in each that stands out.
He also captained the Royal cricket at tennis and captained the Combined Colleges Cricket X1 against a visiting West Australian schoolboy cricket team in 1958. In tennis he reached the singles final of the Public School tennis tournament and on two occasions. One was to former Thomian all rounder P.S.KUKARA who went on to win the national singles titles. PEREIRA played rugby for Ceylon in the All India tournament in Madras whilst still in college. He was Head Prefect of Royal and won the Dornhorst Memorial prize for the most outstanding student in 1959.
After leaving Royal, PEREIRA played cricket for SSC in the Sara trophy and rugby for the CR AND FC. He also captained the Sri Lanka rugby team and played for his country against a visiting full international England rugby team.
PEREIRA obtained his Masters from Cambridge University and played under Mike Brealey a future England captain. On his return he joined John Keells and became the first non-white to captain both the CCC and CH & FC and cricket and rugby clubs respectively.
Migrated to Australia
PEREIR migrated to Australia in 1974 and is now Principal City Planner with the Victorian Government Planning Department. With former Royalist Ranil Wickemasinghes government planning town improvement, it would be a big score if he could lure the brilliant PEREIRA back to the country.

Melania Trump waxwork unveiled
US: Melania Trump took Washington by storm with her bold fashion choices this week -- now, the model-turned-First Llady is a permanent fixture for tourists in New York, complete with her signature pose, lips pursed and eyes slightly squinting.
The work was introduced by former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who hailed his ex-bosss wife, known for her low-profile public persona, as a very caring and graceful person who is often underestimated.
She really has her finger on the pulse of whats going on politically, whats going on in the media, and is able to really offer sage advice, added Spicer, who left his job last July.
Rumors have long swirled over the health of the first couples marriage, particulary since allegations by a former adult film actress and an ex-Playboy model that they had relationships with Trump after he married Melania in 2005. Spicer downplayed the notion of a lasting rift.
Im sure they have their moments like any couple does, but she is a great supportive spouse, he said, adding: I think there is a genuine love and concern and thats whats the most important.
Pressed for further anecdotes from his six months in the Trump White House, Spicer instead plugged his forthcoming book, The Briefing, which is set to be published in July.
It will be the latest in a rapid succession of political tell-alls after former FBI chief James Comeys A Higher Loyalty and journalist Michael Wolffs explosive Fire and Fury, which has sold more than two million copies since its publication in January.
The Melania Trump wax work, which stands in a faux Oval Office next to her husband, will leave New York on May 31 for the Madam Tussauds museum in the capital Washington. - AFP

Mumbai Indians head coach Mahela  Jayawardene lashes out at batsmen
Rohit Sharma led Mumbai Indians has found ways to lose the games from winning positions. With their shocking batting display, the side now sits just above Delhi Daredevils because of their positive net run rate.
Mumbai Indian head coach Mahela Jayawardene felt that no one in the side took the responsibility of winning the match.
On the slow wickets, both sides batters struggled but the horror display by Mumbai saw them record their joint-lowest IPL score in history.
After the top-order failure, the middle order too crumbled under pressure after the fall of Krunal Pandya. Krunals younger brother had a night to remember with the bat he managed 3 runs off 17 deliveries, playing a maiden over during his struggle in the middle.
Talking about the performance of his side, Jayawardene while speaking to the press said that while the losses earlier were close but the performance in the current match was disappointing. According to Jayawardene, they have got no one but themselves to blame for the situation where they are right now.
Some of the matches we lost, I thought we played good cricket, they could have gone either way. (But) today was very disappointing. We just probably played the wicket thinking there is going to be demons out there, said the former Sri Lanka captain.
Jayawardene was of the thought that all their batsmen needed to do was knock the ball here and there and collect the runs but they failed to do that. He suggested that not a single batter took responsibility.
We just had to knock it around. We did not take any responsibility, so that part was quite disappointing. The dew came in as we expected, after 10 overs. No one took responsibility; that is quite sad, added the head coach of Mumbai Indians.
Mumbai Indians were in a similar position in the 2015 edition of the IPL where after losing 5 matches in the first 6, they went on to lift the trophy, fans of the franchise will be hoping for a similar turn around from the reigning champions.

North Korea's Kim Jong-un crosses into South Korea

Kim Jong-un has become the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea by crossing the military line that has divided the peninsula since the end of the Korean War in 1953. In a moment rich with symbolism and pomp, South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and Kim shook hands at the border.
Kim said he hoped for "frank" discussion during a warm opening exchange as talks kicked off. The historic summit will cover nuclear weapons and a possible peace treaty.
Much of what they will talk about is likely to have been agreed in advance, but many analysts remain sceptical about the North's sincerity in offering to give up nuclear weapons.
Nevertheless, the whole of South Korea stood still for the moment the two leaders shook hands on both sides of the border in the demilitarised zone between the countries.
Then audiences watched in surprise as Kim invited the South Korean president to step briefly across the demarcation line into North Korea, before the pair stepped back into South Korea - all the while holding hands. It was an apparently unscripted moment during a highly choreographed sequence of events.
'A new history' begins The leaders were met by an honour guard in traditional costume on the South Korean side. The pair then walked to the at the Peace House in Panmunjom, a military compound in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two countries, to begin talks.
"A new history begins now - at the starting point of history and the era of peace," read the message Kim wrote in a guestbook at the Peace House. The gravity of the meeting - the first between Korean leaders in more than a decade - was also punctuated by lighter moments. Kim joked about bringing some of North Korea's famous cold noodles for the summit. "I hope you will really enjoy the noodles that we brought," he said.
The White House said it was hopeful talks would make progress toward peace and prosperity. The Korean summit is seen as a prelude to a proposed meeting between Kim and US President Trump by early June, an unprecedented move as no sitting US president has met with North Korean leader.
The focus of talks The main focus of the talks is to address North Korea's controversial nuclear weapons programme. Seoul has warned that reaching an agreement to rid Pyongyang of its nuclear weapons will be "difficult".
North Korea's nuclear and missile technology has advanced significantly since the sides' leaders last met more than a decade ago. The meeting - the third of its kind following summits in 2000 and 2007 - is the result of months of improving relations between the two Koreas. Kim announced last week that he would suspend nuclear tests.
The move was welcomed by the US and South Korea as a positive step, although Chinese researchers have indicated that North Korea's nuclear test site may be unusable after a rock collapse following its last test in September.
As well as addressing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the leaders of the two Koreas are expected to discuss a path to peace on the peninsula to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, and a series of economic and social issues.

Oil prices to average $65  a barrel in 2018  World Bank
Oil prices are forecast to average $65 a barrel over 2018, up from an average of $53 a barrel in 2017, on strong demand from consumers and restraint by oil producers, while metals prices are expected to rise 9 percent this year, also on a pickup in demand and supply constraints, the World Bank said on Tuesday.
Prices for energy commodities  which include oil, natural gas, and coal -- are forecast to jump 20 percent in 2018, a 16 percentage point upward revision from Octobers outlook, the World Bank said in its April Commodity Markets Outlook. The metals index is expected to rise as an 9 percent drop in iron ore prices is offset by increases in all base metals prices, led by nickel, which is forecast to rise 30 percent.
Agricultural commodities, including food commodities and raw materials, are anticipated to see a price rise of over 2 percent this year on diminished planting prospects. Weather disruptions are expected to be minimal.
Accelerating global growth and rising demand are important factors behind broad-based price increases for most commodities and the forecast of higher commodities prices ahead, said Shantayanan Devarajan, World Bank Senior Director for Development Economics and acting Chief Economist. At the same time, policy actions currently under discussion add uncertainty to the outlook.
Oil prices are expected to average $65/bbl over 2019 as well. Although prices are projected to decline from April 2018 levels, they should be supported by continued production restraint by OPEC and non-OPEC producers and strong demand. Upside risks to the forecast include constraints to U.S. shale oil output, geopolitical risks in several producing countries, and concerns the United States may not waive sanctions against Iran. Downside risks include weaker compliance with the oil producers agreement to restrain output or outright termination of the accord, rising output from Libya and Nigeria, and a quicker-than-expected rise in shale oil output.
Oil prices have more than doubled since bottoming in early 2016, as the large overhang of inventories has been reduced significantly. said John Baffes, Senior Economist and lead author of the Commodity Markets Outlook. Strong oil demand and greater compliance by the OPEC and non-OPEC producers with their agreed output pledges helped tip the market into deficit.
Upside risks to the metals price forecast include more robust global demand than expected. Supply could be held back by slow incorporation of new capacity, trade sanctions against metals exporters, and policy actions in China. Downside risks include slower-than-expected growth in major emerging markets, the restart of idle capacity, and an easing of pollution-related policies in China. Precious metals are expected to climb 3 percent this year in anticipation of U.S. interest rate increases and higher inflation expectations.
Grains and oils and meal prices are expected to rise in 2018, mostly due to lower planting intentions. The mild La Nia cycle that extended into the early part of the year only affected banana production in Central America and soybean production in Argentina and did not impact global markets for those crops substantially. The possible introduction by China of countervailing duties in response to U.S. tariff increases could impact the soybean market.
A special focus section examines the changed landscape for oil-exporting economies after the 2014 oil price collapse.
The oil price plunge eroded oil-related revenues, forcing abrupt cuts in government spending that accentuated the slowdown in private sector activity in many regions. Income inequality and political instability also weakened the ability of some oil-exporting economies to weather low oil prices.
Oil exporters with flexible currency regimes, relatively large fiscal buffers, and more diversified economies have fared better than others since the oil price collapse, said Ayhan Kose, director of World Banks Development Economics Prospects Group.
However, most oil exporters still face significant fiscal challenges in the face of revenue prospects that have weakened since 2014.

Pan Asia Bank posts Rs 498 mn PBT in 1Q
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC reported Rs 498 million in profit before tax for the quarter ended in March 31, 2018 (1Q18) powered by a steady growth in new loans and improvement in overall margins which was resulted by prudent asset  liability pricing amidst rising market interest rates.
This enabled the bank to increase its net interest income by 11.0 % to Rs.1.34 billion for the quarter from Rs.1.21 billion recorded in the same period last year.
Meanwhile the core banking performance was aptly supported by the non-fund based incomes such as fee incomes and trading gains. The bank managed to increase its net fee and commission income by a modest 8.0 % to Rs.368.12 million from the same period in 2017.
Meanwhile the net trading gains rose sharply to Rs. 199.58 million during the quarter from Rs.69.83 million in the same period a year ago as the bank sold its short term investments in the trading portfolio realizing a sizable capital gain.
As a result of these fund and non-fund based incomes, the bank increased its total operating income by 17 % on year to Rs.1.99 billion.
Pan Asia Banks Director/ Chief Executive Officer Nimal Tillekeratne said although the bank witnessed a temporary slowdown in the bottom-line during its first quarter, the bank is now on a path of steadfast growth with built in resilience across all areas of operations which will reflect positively in the financial results in the coming quarters.

Piling commences at Ekroma Fortune
Ekroma has awarded their piling contract to D P Jayasinghe (Pvt.) Ltd for their Grade A office space project, Ekroma Fortune.
Located in Colombo 02, the piling commenced few weeks ago. In keeping with Ekromas credentials as a reliable and trusted real estate partner, the high quality of the construction is guaranteed, and as such the Baur BG 30, which is one of the largest piling machines in Sri Lanka, is being used in the piling.
Ekroma Fortune is a new Grade A commercial space with high end specifications, located in the plush central business district at W A D Ramanayake Mawatha, approximately 40m down from Sir James Peires Mawatha. Ekroma Fortune was launched in the previous month at a high profile corporate event held at the Cinnamon Grand on March 16, 2018.
Commenting on the project, Ekromas Managing Director, Onesh Subasinghe said, Ekroma Fortune is entering the market at the most appropriate time, when a great shortage of Grade A commercial spaces in the Central Business District is most evident. Based on research conducted by JLL Sri Lanka, there is a shortage of 3.5 million sq.ft. in Grade A spaces and Ekroma Fortune looks to fill a small fraction of that need. By branding our company and projects, under the Ekroma brand name umbrella, we expect to derive significant brand recognition, which is long overdue.
Ekroma Fortune would be a very unique investment opportunity, allowing investors to reap the benefits in terms of asset appreciation and monthly recurring income, playing in line with market dynamics for Grade A office space at present. There is a high demand for Grade A office space in Sri Lanka and the relative shortage in supply at present means premium rates can be charged on a per square-foot basis ensuring exceptionally high potential as the rental yield, he said.
The uniqueness of this project is that Ekroma Fortune pioneers the concept of selling Lots starting at 1350 sq.ft., while allowing flexibility for full floor purchases at 8000sq.ft., which is not the norm in the industry. Ekroma Fortune is also ideal for Multinational Companies who wish to set-up their main corporate office within the Central Business District. Ekroma Fortune will spiral upwards 15-storeys high with a built up area of 153,000 sq.ft, which is customizable for early buyers.
The strategically selected central location ensures numerous bus routes, railway stations and the upcoming LRT System are within walking distance. The fact that many schools, hospitals, banks, hotels, embassies, supermarkets and places of worship are also within very close proximity further enhances its value.
The countless places of entertainment and recreation that surrounds Ekroma Fortune bring together the perfect environment for work and play. Colombo 2 has established itself as the emerging commercial and entertainment hub, with numerous ongoing mega developments just meters away, and the upcoming Port City a mere 8 minutes away.The office space itself will feature all the possible amenities for a seamless experience for its occupants comprising of a self catering canteen, Ocean, City, Lake and Park Views with partial glass facade, high speed elevators, dedicated washrooms for even the smallest Lot, and almost 4 floors of parking.
The architects for Ekroma Fortune are the Thailand-Based Design Team 3, the Australia-based Structural Consultants  CSEC and EME Solutions, as Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing consultants and Selvaskandan as Project Management Consultant. Ekroma Fortune is scheduled for completion in November 2019.
Engaged in commercial property leasing, condominium development and strategic investments, Ekroma is a BOI approved real estate and development company that is led by a dynamic team committed to maximize the value of their clients interests by giving them the opportunity to become a part of the emerging Central Business District, through investment in Ekroma Fortune.

Primary Industries policy  to be export-driven - Minister
An export-supportive national policy will be implemented promptly to achieve national goals set by the Primary Industries Ministry, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
The main objective of establishing the Primary Industries Ministry in 2015 was to assist the government to reach its development goals. Under these objectives, it has been planned to obtain US$ 25 billion annually from exports and create one million job opportunities by 2025 through import substitution policies.
The minister made these remarks recently while addressing a workshop on preparing the export-supportive national plan at the ministry.
Development of a national policy for primary industries is important to boost the export sector. The initial conceptual framework of the national policy has already been developed, he said.
The Ministry of Primary Industries was established in 2015 with the intention of developing Sri Lankas primary industries. The MPI seeks to promote economic development in order to realise the governments development goals of achieving US$ 25 billion in exports and creating one million employment opportunities by 2025 through import substitution policies, he added.
The key objective of establishing the ministry is to promote exports and export more value-added products which have a significant value in the global market, Minister Gamage said.
With diverse agricultural zones allowing enormous potential for agro-industry and access to a large fishing area, Sri Lankas primary industries are the backbone of the economy and have much to offer both local and foreign investors in the agriculture, livestock and fisheries sectors, he added.
The minister, while continuing his speech, said that the private sector is considered as an important stakeholder in the development arena.
Hence, having considered the importance of private sector involvement, the ministry is taking every possible measure to uplift private sector industries.
Accordingly, the main focus of the ministry is on support for the private sector, including smallholders, and for private sectorled development pathways, through value addition and exports. Therefore the ministry works to enrich the economy and drive trade and investment forward through the management and sustainable utilisation of the countrys natural resources and through enhancing value chain development.
At the heart of primary industry development is the goal of increasing the value of primary sector assets such as agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, by focusing on projects that will lead to sustainably increasing productivity, protecting our land and water from harmful pests and diseases, safeguarding our diverse and unique natural environment, encouraging an innovation culture through technological development, taking measures to ensure food quality and integrity, and creating a platform for sustainable economic growth in order to ensure the best social and economic outcomes for Sri Lanka.
The minister further emphasised that the policy should be aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular with Goal 1 (No Poverty) and Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and should contribute to numerous other goals, including Goal 2 (Ending Hunger), Goals 5 (Gender Equality), Goal 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption) and Goal 13 (Climate Change).

Royalty for musicians, artistes streamlined under new IP laws
The National Intellectual Property office of Sri Lanka has prepared draft legislation to regulate the payment and collection of royalties to musicians and artistes, National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO) of Sri Lanka, Director General Geethanjali Ranawaka said.
Addressing the opening sessions of the two day high level sub regional workshop on Empowering Creativity for Sustainable Development and the Role of Copyright for Policy Makers of South Asian Countries at Galle Face Hotel, Ranawaka explained that the NIPO and the World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO) has been working closely to improve the copyright and patent systems in the country.
The above event was organized to celebrate 18th International Intellectual Property (IP) Day.
The importance of intellectual property had been recognized at the highest level of government with the President appointing a committee last year to investigate into a special mechanism to collect royalties.
Piracy, illegal sales of music and other artistic material in the country has been seen to greatly limit the creative and economic potential of the entertainment industry in the country.
NIPO has also taken steps to establish Technology and Innovation Support Centres (TISC) in ten universities and institutes around the country to make it easier for patents to be registered and help inventors register their patents in a hassle free manner.
The Intellectual Property Act interim provisions have also been amended and submitted for parliamentary approval to register geographical locations specifically in Ceylon tea and Ceylon cinnamon.
The Government also plans to accede to the Madrid Protocol; an international treaty which allows trademark owners to seek registration in any countries in the Protocol by filing a single application by the end of 2018, Ranawaka said.
The theme of this years IP was, celebration of the brilliance, ingenuity, curiosity and courage of the women who are driving change in our world and shaping our common future.
WIPO Director General, Francis Gurry addressing the gathering through a pre-recorded video said there was a 17 percent deficit in the participation of women when it came to new inventions.
He stressed that this needed to be addressed in order to improve the capacity and economic contributions of women around the world.
Intellectual Property Advisory Commission Chairman Dr J.M. Swaminathan questioned the ability of Sri Lankan IP laws to deal with a digital economy. He asked policy makers to look into the copyright section of the IP law to incorporate the rapidly changing digital and scientific sphere.
Strong intellectual property laws will benefit developing countries in the long term by protecting research and innovation within the country, he said. Interight Co Limited, UK, President, Brian Nicholas Garnett in the meantime noted that when creating IP laws, the government should include what is required for the purposes of the country and secondly see how it best fits international norms and standards.
Thirdly he stressed that enforcement of the law was imperative and finally excellent laws needed to be supported by resources for enforcement.Touching on the modern era of IP law, Garnett noted that there was too much emphasis being given to the development of technology at the expense of creativity.
The music industry today is complaining that there is a huge difference in the value of the technology companies who earn from that creation and the creators who have created it. We downplay the creativity to technology, he said.
Copyright he said was the important link between art and technology, If you dont protect the creativity, the rest wont mean much.
He added that collective management systems of copyright were also becoming more important around the world and the capacity of this needed to be improved.Finally as technology becomes more complex, from Artificial Intelligence systems to 3D printing, the term copyright would need to take a broader meaning, Garnett said.
The role of policy makers thus is to find the balance between promotion of technology and creativity, he added.

Sarnath Sacred  Relics Exposition  for Vesak
The Indian High Commission in Colombo yesterday announced that the most Sacred Relics from Sarnath would be brought to Sri Lanka for public exposition to mark Vesak.
This is the first time these Sacred Relics are being brought to Sri Lanka from India, and special arrangements have been made by the Indian Government for this purpose.
The public can pay homage to the Sacred Relics at Temple Trees in Colombo from April 28 to May 2, 2018, the High Commission statement said yesterday.
The Sacred Relics of Sarnath are yet another manifestation of the shared Buddhist heritage of India and Sri Lanka, which forms a spiritual bond between our two nations. These Relics are enshrined at the Mulagandhakuti Vihara at Saranth in India. Sarnath is historically significant since the Buddha preached His first sermon there.
Anagarika Dharmapala, founder of the Maha Bodhi Society of India, played a key role in building the Mulagandhakuti Vihara to restore the glory of Sarnath. The land and the Sacred Relics were gifted to the Maha Bodhi Society of India by the Government of India.
A specially made casket secures these two most revered and authentic Relics. The first Relic, enclosed within the silver casket enshrined in the Vihara, was found by Sir John Marshall in 1913-14 near the ancient city of Taxila (Takshasila).
They were found in a small Buddhist chapel close to the Dharmarajika Stupain, a silver reliquary with inscriptions dating the year 136 (circa 79 A.D). They were recorded as the relics of the Blessed One.
The second Relic enshrined at Sarnath was found by A.H.Longhurst of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1929 in a large Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in the Guntur District of the then Madras Presidency. The Stupa in which the Relic was found is described as the Maha Chetiyaor viz. the Great Stupa of the Blessed One.
The High Commission of India thanks the Mahabodhi Society of India for loaning these Sacred Relics for exposition in Colombo. This is the second time that the High Commission of India has taken an initiative to exhibit the Sacred Buddha Relics in Sri Lanka. The first initiative was the exhibition of the Kapilavastu Relics in 2012.

Surgical breakthrough by  Colombo National Hospital
The Colombo National Hospital yesterday created a surgical breakthrough by successfully performing a surgery to remove a thyroid gland using the 3D Trans Oral Endoscopic Thyroidectomy method.
The operation used 3D Einstein Version cameras and has removed the need to have an invasive procedure performed.
The operation was conducted by a medical team from the National Hospital Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Unit headed by Specialist Dr. Rizny Sakkaff.
A resident of Bandaragama, Mohamed Faiz (42) underwent the surgery.
The patient, half an hour after the surgery, had regained the use of his voice and was happily talking to the doctors.
Dr. Sakkaff said this was the first time in Sri Lanka where this operation was conducted using a 3D Einstein Version camera. As the operation was non-invasive, it had left no scars on the patient. In addition the cost of the operation was very much reduced and the recovery period of the patient was faster than when traditional surgery was performed.
Dr. Sakkaff explained that such surgeries were not regularly performed because there was a shortage in the equipment and technology needed and many did not have the knowledge to use them.
The Kuliyapitiya Hospital on February 8 had also conducted a non-invasive procedure to remove a thyroid gland, but they had not used 3D Einstein Version cameras.

Thai seniors compete in  first Elderly Games
THAILAND: Aged 98 Sawang Janpram cruised to victory in the 100-metre sprint, came first in the discus and set a record in the javelin -- the undisputed star of Thailand's first national Elderly Games held this week.
Competitors who gathered in northern Nan province defied age stereotypes and the searing sun in the government-backed sporting event, organised to promote an active lifestyle among seniors as Thailand tries to stave off an ageing crisis.
"I saw many people my age ailing in bed and I didn't want to be like that. So I began to exercise," the spry Sawang told AFP after setting a record of 15.3 metres in the javelin throw -- albeit as the sole competitor in his 95-99 age category.
Back in his hometown in eastern Thailand, he has watched as his less active peers "all passed away," the former school principal explained with a wry chuckle.
Thailand's population is getting older, and fast, posing risks to the middle-income country's social and medical services as well as its economic productivity.
By 2031, the percentage of the population over 60 is expected to nearly double to 28 percent, according to the National Economic and Social Development Board.
"Now Thailand is a fully-fledged ageing society it's the right time and place to hold these activities," Nattavuth Ruengves, deputy governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand, told AFP on the sidelines of the competition.
The event, which concludes Friday, aims to boost healthcare among seniors, with the added social draw of competitors enjoying the opportunity to meet friends.
Held in an outdoor sports complex, the atmosphere was festive, with cheering crowds and athletes helping each other after they crossed the finish line.
"It doesn't matter if I get a medal or not, I feel happy to see friends competing together," said Duangpee Sansing, the 81-year-old winner of a 400-metre race.
"I am not that tired because I am happy," she told AFP as she hugged a friend and fellow runner.
The seven-day event drew more than 1,000 athletes from across the country.
They battled it out in sports as far apart as football, body building and ballroom dancing to sepak takraw, a traditional volleyball game in which players use their feet instead of hands.
The age groups competing ranged from those approaching middle age to Sawang's bracket, 95 to 99.
The 98-year-old participated in an unofficial version of the event organised last year by the Senior Citizens Council.
He also represented Thailand at a regional elderly games held in China last year where he broke a record for the shot-put, according to his daughter.
Determined to excel again this time around, he has stayed in shape with a daily walking regimen.
Although his athletic prowess helped him blitz his rivals with a 24.59 second dash to claim the 100-metres, Sawang said the event was more about camaraderie than crowing.
"I want to be here to meet many friends and most of the athletes here are nice and helpful -- it makes me feel warm inside," he said.

Thrice the worry!
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have begun introducing their new prince to family members, as the world awaits an announcement on the baby's name.
Prince William and Kate have retreated to the sanctuary of Kensington Palace after showing off their third child to the world on the steps of the Lindo Wing.
As the Duke and Duchess settle into life as a family of five, the first visitors began arriving at their west London home on Tuesday. Pippa Middleton, the Duchess's sister, was the first to be pictured after meeting the as-yet-unnamed baby.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could have been the first to visit as they are neighbours at Kensington Palace. The new baby prince's great-grandmother the Queen, 92, is still at Windsor Castle with the Duke of Edinburgh who is recuperating after a hip operation.
Prince Charles said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon that he and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, are "both so pleased at the news". He added: "It is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I dont know how I am going to keep up with them."
The name of the baby Prince of Cambridge, who was born on Monday at 11.01am weighing 8lb 7oz, has yet to be unveiled. Royals traditionally keep the public guessing before revealing their choice and William and Kate will want to share the name with the Queen and the rest of their family before making it public. Duke says they are 'very happy' but have 'thrice the worry now'
Smiling broadly, the Duchess was dressed in a vibrant red Jenny Packham dress with a white lace collar, reminiscent of William's late mother Diana, Princess of Wales - who wore red and white outside the Lindo Wing after Prince Harry was born in 1984.
As William and Kate headed home after appearing in front of the banks of cameras with their seven-hour-old son, the Duke said they were "very happy" and "very delighted".
He joked, holding up three fingers, that he had "thrice the worry now", adding: "We didn't keep you waiting too long this time."
The Duke and Duchess thanked the hospital for their care and the public for their wishes. Kensington Palace said: "Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank all staff at the hospital for the care and treatment they have received.
"They would also like to thank everyone for their warm wishes."

Transforming Life on Stage
Cold Theatre 7 is a theatre group who believe that what they are doing is fun and meaningful. Led by Kevin Cruze they feel that theatre can unify all segments of society by being a second family to anyone who takes that leap of faith. Dramatic Moves features Cold Theatre 7 where you meet and see where it takes you.
We started five years ago and initially there was a group of members from St. Josephs where I schooled who wanted me to go public and do a production. At that point I felt I did not have the time to go public. But these guys insisted on me doing it. So I accepted the responsibility of writing the script. So I decided on the script. The next question was- how are we going to market ourselves That was when I was thinking of a name and I was thinking big! I thought to myself, 10 or 15 years down the line if we continue this, I want to look back and see how I started, said Leader of Cold Theatre 7, Kevin Cruze.
Cruze recalled that the individuals who turned up for the first meeting, were some of the best actors during his schooling time. He refers to them as the cream of the last decade. These were people he acted with and then directed later on. So the cream of the last decade became Cold.
What drives me is my self- belief and the fact that I have a good team backing me. As long as you have those two, you can achieve a lot. My first production was challenging in the sense it was my first production. The musical was challenging because it involved music, choreography and acting, so I was stepping into unknown territory. 12 angry men and 12 angry women was challenging, because I was a young director, but I think I was able to project what I wanted. They were all professionals with their own agendas so getting them together at once was a challenge. When they were together, conveying what I wanted from them was a challenge. They were all professionals in their own right and they pulled off what I wanted them to pull off, said Cruze.
Cruze confessed that he is more into the mystery and horror element. Although he has not done any horror plays he is into murder mysteries. When it comes to thrillers I am at the edge of my seat, not knowing what is coming next! That is what I want my audience to experience. I also want to promote this love for theatre amongst the young people or the next generation, pointed out Cruze.
Dramatist of Cold Theatre 7, Kavitha Gunasekera, is a drama teacher on the weekends. She has seen the transformative power of drama in the students she teaches, changing the way they respond to life in general.
For me there was a point in my life, when I had to move from another country to Sri Lanka. I was born overseas, but because of the exposure I had in the performing arts back in school, it allowed me to come back and settle down in a way that I never thought would be possible. I want to give that back to the children I teach. In the auditions I never thought I would get the part in Then There Were None or even continue in theatre. It was a risk that I took, and a risk Kevin took as well putting me in the cast. But thanks to his leadership and guidance, it has grown into something I never thought would be possible, said Gunasekera.
12 Angry men and 12 Angry women, is about a kid who apparently murdered his father. The cast is against the kid with the evidence pointing to him. Then the twelve jurors are put into a room to come up with a decision whether the boy is guilty or not. 11 say he is guilty but one says not guilty. So he wants to talk about the case. Soon doubt starts to creep in, and one by one people start changing their minds. Soon it swings back and forth. Soon all 12 finally say that the boy is not guilty.
In 12 angry women, I played the role of Juror number 10. This was a role written for a male. It was also written in a particular period. So to be able to bring it into a modern day society and make it appealing to a Sri Lankan audience while honoring what the playwright wanted is something I enjoyed as well. The role of Juror 10 resonates with me for multiple reasons. Juror 10 is a racist and a bigot. Until the very end we dont see that layer of personality coming out. It took a long time for me to really understand that character. I think it worked out in the end because the audience reception was such. I think it was timely for the country as well. Because the mentality Juror 10 projects is what we need to combat in society, explained Gunasekera.
Gunasekera pointed out that juggling work, family and drama is difficult but manageable.
I think you need to prioritize. It is about drawing a line. When work is done work is done. You then focus on the script and rehearsals. And when rehearsals are done, rehearsals are done. Then you focus on life at home and whatever you need to do in terms of responsibilities. The world maybe crashing down around you, but it is about focusing and balancing it out, said Gunasekera.
Dramatist Amesh Fernando of Cold Theatre 7, said that the great thing about theatre is that you become part of a family consisting of people from different cultures and backgrounds.
I first started drama just to get some experience and see what it was like. And I really connected with it. I enjoy Kevins style because he is more of a friend than a director.
His work ethic and style prompted me to join Cold Theatre 7. Drama is one place where you feel comfortable and connect with people. It is one place where you can just be yourself. Cold Theatre gives us that experience. Here everyone is treated equally, said Fernando.
Fernando feels the script of 12 Angry Men is fantastic and he loved the play because he got to act with some amazing personalities.
They were like the Godfathers of Sri Lankan theatre. To act with them was a real privilege and honor.
It was a fantastic experience. There was a lot of intensity when it came to rehearsals. It was one play that was challenging for me personally. Juror 3 was the toughest role I have ever done. 12 Angry men is the best play I have been a part of when it comes to Cold Theatre 7.
Juror 3 is a very intense character who is highly opinionated and always thinks he is in the right.
He is very open about his opinion. He also wants to prove that what he says is right above other peoples opinions or view point.
It was emotionally and physically draining doing the character. That is the only play out of all the plays we have done, when I was on stage for one and a half hours at a stretch without any interval or break. Acting for one and a half hours is something very tough to do, explained Fernando.
Fernando has benefited a lot from theatre. He has got to know some incredible people from different backgrounds.
That is something theatre has taught me. Embracing equality and how we must treat everyone around us as equals regardless of who they are and what backgrounds they come from, said Fernando.

UNDERSTANDING  OCEANS
Importance and relevance of oceans keep increasing every day due to land based resource scarcity, growing population rate and reduction of land mass due to rise in sea levels. Despite technological advances, 95 percent of the oceans remains unexplored. With more than 60 percent of the worlds population living within 100 km from the coast, and with 13 out of 15 largest cities predicted to be located near oceans by the turn of the millennium, academics, professionals, and scientists have turned their central attention towards understanding oceans. The enormous ocean resources, slightly discovered and mostly hidden, are of immeasurable value in the future, given the excess utilization of land-based resources.
Damsarie Ranasinghe.
Over the past few decades, techniques and theories have been developed as an attempt to understand oceans a little better. Yet, the potential and scope of ocean studies remain wide. With increased understanding and findings, study of oceans has become more specific and categorized, one of which is Operational Oceanography.
Operational Oceanography 
In layman terms, oceanography is the study of marine or ocean sciences. Operational Oceanography, a derivative of this vast subject area, aims to provide sustained and accurate marine measures, analyses, predictions and assessments which are used to advance marine policies and activities including national security and marine environment. The European Component of the Global Ocean Observing System (EuroGOOS) defines OO as the activity of systematic and long-term routine measurements of the seas, oceans and atmosphere, and their rapid interpretation and dissemination.
As such, OO is capable of producing accurate now-casts, hind-casts, re-analyses and future forecasts of the ocean including state of the living resources, covering global-to-coastal marine environments and ecosystems through rapid transmission of observational data. These observational data, generated by means of mathematical forecasting models can foretell early warnings of adverse weather changes, electronic charts, prime routes for ships, ocean currents and even the productivity. Being a fairly new concept, OO has managed to provide accurate and valuable real time data on marine and coastal environment, marine resources, marine safety and climate and seasonal forecasting.
In order to deliver successful and accurate forecasts, there must be enough ocean observations available with super computer facilities and models to decipher and disseminate the data. As a result of such, the OO facilities were limited and applied by financially and technically competent nations, such as the USA. In other developing nations, most OOs are run either by national weather centres or by coordinated partnerships between government and various research organisations.
Operational Oceanography in the military 
The US Navy has pioneered in OO having incorporated them in its military strategies since Cold war. In Italy, OO has been used to define its marine strategy directive related to ecosystem sub-regions. As a result, sea surface temperature seasonal data, chlorophyll climatology data and trends along with wind coastal upwelling indices are obtained which helps determine the environmental impact at a given location and time. The EU project Mediterranean Ocean Forecasting System: Toward Environmental Predictions (MFSTEP) composed of a real time observing system with satellite and in-situ elements, a numerical ocean forecasting system at the basin scale, biochemical models for algal biomass forecasting and a product dissemination system. These products were used to determine oil spill drift and dispersion, sediment transport and fish stock assessments which determine the operational value for the stakeholders.
Monitoring disasters 
Operational Oceanography.
The Indian Ocean Region over the past half a decade has faced many unpredicted natural disasters in the form of earthquakes, cyclones and flooding resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Given the proximity of South Asian and South East Asian states to the Indian Ocean, a better understanding of the ocean currents, salinity, wind and sea level could have reduced the damage caused. Lack of effective OO centres resulted in the enhanced damage to both property and human lives. However, some efforts have been taken by East and South East Asia to incorporate OO.
In 2005, the first Ocean Operational system was implemented in the Indonesian archipelago with the collaboration of Indonesia and European Institutes. The system provides information for sustainable use of marine resources, improved management of the sea with high business impact for both public and commercial operators. It further capitalizes on their capabilities in fisheries, environmental policies and human activities in the marine environment. The Chinese Global Operational Oceanography Forecasting System (CGOFS) includes both ocean circulation and ocean wave models providing 3D predictions on marine temperature, salinity, currents, sea levels and ocean waves.
On the contrary to improvements in East and South East Asia, South Asia is still behind in understanding OO. In 2004, the enormous damages caused by the tsunami would have been avoided if the regional countries were equipped to monitor the ocean dynamics. Vast number of deaths and damages incurred by natural disasters over the last decade could have been curtailed, had there been accurate and reliable data on the environmental changes.
Today, India is the only country in South Asia to take an OO initiative. Following a proposal made in June 2010, in December 2017 Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the establishment of an International Training Centre for Operational Oceanography as a Category 2 Centre (C2C) of UNESCO in Hyderabad. The centre would be mainly used as a capacity building centre for Indian Ocean Rim countries, bordering African countries as well as small island states. The establishment of the UNESCO C2C in India will provide a unique opportunity for India to emerge as a leading country in the Indian Ocean, drawing in cooperation and improved engagement with its neighbours.
While the centre is of immense value to the region, it further gives a strategic edge over to India with its newly acquired role as a lead in regional marine science. Nevertheless, this is a progressive step taken towards scientific research in the region to help governments with achieving sustainable development goals as well as overcoming natural hazards.
Importance of Operational Oceanography to Sri Lanka
Given the immense untapped ocean resources around Sri Lanka and being situated at the centre of major sea lanes of communication, it is of utmost importance that the island is aware and conscious of the ocean around it. The ocean tetra-tonics, wind movements, salinity and the pH levels, not only help monitor movement of vessels, observe the wave and plate movements, but at the same time, give a thorough report of how ocean resources are to be governed.
It further helps in oceanic meteorology and weather forecasting which is critical to the region.
Situated at the southernmost point of the Indian Ocean, the sustainable management of marine resources is of prime importance to Sri Lanka. Blue Economy and Ocean Resource Management are main components of countrys Blue-Green vision 2030, which requires an advanced understanding of OO for successful implementation. This requires reformed knowledge and application of oceanography through which, necessary scientific data can be deduced to make informed policy decisions.
However, the development of OO in the country is hindered by various factors. Despite the availability of the technical expertise in the subject, lack of technology and the interest retract the relevant actors from taking significant steps to develop oceanic studies. The country has not understood the importance and need to engage in ocean centric education which poses a greater challenge to the island. Relevant research, hands on experiments and practical experience is not sought, and at the same time active engagement in the area has further reduced, mostly due to lack of awareness and understanding.
Operational Oceanography in Asia remains at a basic level despite efforts from India, Indonesia and a few other countries like China and Korea. In order to obtain better results and better technical expertise in the area, countries must exhibit both personal and scientific interest in the area, keen interest and need on the part of the government to implement better ocean centric policies and a collective determination for sustainable ocean usage, all of which is not possible due to lack of consciousness. It is therefore, appropriate time that Sri Lanka as an island nation pursues necessary and needful steps towards advancing ocean centric policies and implementing oceanography in a larger scale to obtain a strategic advantage in the region and beyond.

Not all positions however were welcome within the party as UNP Senior, Joseph Michael Perera chose to resign his post in the Working Committee over the re-appointment of Karunanayake as Assistant Leader.
Perera, who has been involved in active politics in the UNP for over 55 years, openly opposed Karunanayakes appointment. MP Ranjan Ramanayake also opposed Karunanayakes appointment.
I told them that I did not believe that the ordinary UNPer wanted Ravi Karunanayake to be appointed as Assistant Leader and I told them that I could not accept that. He has damaged the party enough, Perera said when contacted by the Daily News.
Perera added that he would continue to work on behalf of ordinary UNPers who have suffered much in the recent years.
UNP MP Karunanayake in the meantime dismissed Pereras objections and stated that the Senior merely wanted an excuse to quit the Working Committee.
Responses to the appointments have been mixed even among those who were appointed. Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva tweeted,Honor to be Treasurer @officialunp #SriLanka. No family connections to party; only professional n entrepreneur. Equal opportunity, whilst Deputy Minister Ajith P Pereras official Facebook page carried the simple status only disappointment.

US House passes  overhaul of music laws
US: The US House of Representatives voted unanimously on Wednesday to overhaul how musicians are compensated for the playing of songs, agreeing to revamp antiquated regulations as streaming shakes up the industry.
The reform package still needs to go through the Senate, but it enjoyed support across the political spectrum and from industry and artist groups -- a rare consensus in bitterly divided Washington.
The Music Modernization Act would notably extend copyright protections for songs from before 1972, the cutoff under current law that has set off an avalanche of lawsuits from older artists upset about non-payment.
The law sets up a board led by music publishers that would handle so-called mechanical licenses, which are issued by copyright holders for the use of songs by streaming companies and others. The move gets rid of the current system in which songwriters issue so-called notices of intent through the US Copyright Office, a complicated process often blamed for delays in compensation.
The law also shakes up the Copyright Royalty Board, which determines rates of compensation, by calling for uniform payments from all music services. In another shift, the law would formalize copyright protections for producers, mixers and engineers -- often not included with songwriters in compensation.
With revenue from digital music streaming expected to double in the coming years, it is important that this bill become law so we can keep up with the changing dynamics of this great American industry, said Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third highest-ranking Republican in the House.
Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said that the bill marked a unique moment in time where virtually all the industry stakeholders have come together in support of a common music policy agenda.
This is a historic opportunity to accomplish something that hasnt been done in decades, he said.
On-demand streaming, led by Spotify, has rapidly transformed the music industry and brought new growth after years of stagnation.
Global revenue from recorded music grew last year by 8.1 percent, the highest on record, the IFPI industry body said Tuesday.

USD 1.1 bn deal for Tuas Terminal II  inked in Singapore
The USD 1.1 bn agreement for the second stage of development of the Tuas Terminal was signed in Singapore during the Singapore Maritime Technology Conference (SMTC).
The agreement was inked by a consortium made up of Japanese construction company Penta Ocean, its South Korean counterpart Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company and dredging company Royal Boskalis Westminster from the Netherlands.
With Phase I well underway, this second phase of development will increase the total port capacity by another 21 million TEUs by 2027, MPA Singapore said.
The work activities under the second stage of the terminal development include the design and construction of 387 hectares of reclaimed land bounded by 9.1km of caisson walls.
The latest innovations and technologies, such as E-cranes and reclaimer barges, will be employed to maximize the use of dredged materials for filling above sea level, the port authority said.
When fully developed by the 2040s, Tuas Terminal will be able to handle up to up to 65 million TEUs annually.
The conference hosted the signing of five MOUs and two agreements between MPA and local and international partners today.
We are glad to have like-minded partners who strongly believe in the importance of digitalization, technology and innovation. These MOUs will help us to take the maritime sector to a new level of development in areas such as automation, data analytics, intelligent systems and cybersecurity. Along with support for maritime start-ups, MPA hopes to create an enabling environment for both existing and new players to co-exist side by side as part of a vibrant innovative cluster. That way, Maritime Singapore will be able to stay ahead of the curve as a world-class hub port and international maritime center,Andrew Tan, Chief Executive of MPA, said.
Aside to the Tuas Terminal development deal, MPA Singapore renewed its MOU with the Research Council of Norway (RCN) for the seventh term for three years till 2021.
In addition, the port authoritypartnered up the Finnish technology group Wrtsil Corporation to promote the development of maritime technologies in the areas of digital acceleration, cyber-physical security and intelligent vessel and port operations.
Further, MPA will be teaming with Keppel Offshore & Marine (Keppel O&M) and the Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine Singapore (TCOMS) to jointly develop autonomous vessels.
The Singapore port authority has also inked a Memorandum of Intent with eight classification societies on the development of the Singapore Maritime Data Hub (SG-MDH).
The eight classification societies are American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), Bureau Veritas (BV), China Classification Society (CCS), DNV GL, Korean Register of Shipping (KRS), Lloyds Register of Shipping (LRS), Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (NKK) and Registro Italiano Navale (RINA). All eight are members of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS).
Finally, the port authority announced that it will be launching the MINT Fund Call for Proposals and the Smart Port Challenge in June 2018.

Workers of the  world unite
Arise ye prisners of starvation
Arise ye wretched of the earth
These words of the Internationale would reverberate throughout the world on May 1, uniting the human race. It is a sad reflection on our culture that Sri Lanka stands as an exception where the right of workers to celebrate the International Workers Day has been obstructed by executive decree. True, the working people are divided but they had at least the privilege of celebrating May 1 though at different locations and in different ways. Even that is obstructed. However, a cynic may question how a national leader could change an international holiday.
Vesak full l moon is on April 29 and May 1 is two days later. There is no rationale in decreeing a postponement of the May Day celebrations. It shows the contempt for working-class traditions. If Christmas Day fell on the Unduvap full moon would it also be postponed Or would Prophet Mohameds birthday be postponed if it coincided with a full moon While the workers are asked to postpone celebrating May Day corporate entities will have a field day (or rather a week) in marketing Vesak as a commodity  commodification of culture.
The working people are, however, divided even apart from the executive decree. Parties and groups that claim to represent the working class have been splitting like the amoeba and are still splitting on numerous sectarian and opportunist grounds. The Left as such is a feeble voice in the present Sri Lankan polity. Those of the old generation still recall with nostalgia the contribution made by the Left in the struggle for independence and subsequently for social progress and those of the not so young generation now nearing the fifties and sixties would recall with pride the heyday of the New Left in the 1970s. A non-sectarian impartial history of their history is yet to be written.
Political parties
Judging by the organic crisis affecting almost all political parties today Sri Lanka is sliding into a bottomless pit unable to find its bearings and with no defined goal to be attained. Political parties that have taken power singly or jointly have all failed to uplift the state of the masses, which alone is the ultimate criterion of development.
The Left is the only political movement with a broad ideology that is opposed to and which provides an alternative path of development, as has been witnessed by historical developments elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, its potential cannot be harnessed in view of the disunity and disarray of its numerous components.
In the days of yore the Left standing far ahead of the masses, visualized that the Revolution was round the corner gave priority to the purity of the doctrines and neglected the arduous task of carrying the masses who have been nurtured in the womb of capitalism towards socialism through reforms that they would understand. The initial successes at the parliamentary struggles blinded them and instead of subordinating the parliamentary struggle to the mass struggle, they chose its opposite  subordinating the mass struggle to the parliamentary struggle.
As a corollary to the above, trade unions were subjected to individual party control with every sect having its own trade union giving rise to the plethora of Unions in a single trade or a single establishment. Bourgeois parties followed suit and brought under their wing substantial segments of the working people. Union leaders, whether in the private or public sector were bought over with perks and privileges of office  directorates, chauffeur driven vehicles etc. A labour aristocracy of a new type emerged.
Trade union action
The Left, although at first gradually and on the sly flirted with right-wing nationalism bordering racism, later it went all out to preserve the Nation under chauvinist slogans. The Left is still unable to fully extricate itself from the grip of chauvinism.
Schism over the National Question has seriously undermined the unity of the working class with majority trade unions being led by bourgeois and/or communal parties. The most oppressed section of the Sri Lankan working class  plantation workers have been literally orphaned without substantial solidarity by city workers during several instances of trade union action.
Numerous were also tactical and strategic mistakes by Left parties. While in 1948 the Left could not agree on the formation of a broad anti-UNP government, in subsequent decades it went to the other extreme of coalescing with bourgeois parties in the name of anti-UNP unity.
There are no puritans sans sins, anymore. It is time to unite around a programme of action to save an impending disaster for the country. Doctrinaire differences should be ironed out not as a condition apriori but in the course of united action over agreeable reforms so that the people could have a confidence in the future and in the Left.
Flashes of memory about the Hartal of 1953 or the blissful but short-lived United Left Front of 1963 saw tremendous mass enthusiasm and support. The developments in our northern neighbour Nepal which had worse divisions on the Left also show the potential that exists if the Left is united.
There was a time that every Left party or group thought they are the vanguard. That situation is no more. The vanguard is a role that has to be earned. It is not a legacy. There is no way to earn it other than by mass struggle on behalf of the people.
The intellectuals who see the morass to which the country has fallen and who are capable of providing a vision of an alternative path of development should not keep silent. It would be a disservice to the country. It is time for them to come together and work out a programme for the renewal of popular confidence in a leftward drive for a better future. A better future is possible and certainly, our people would reach it one day. One day We shall overcome!

Though the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 2.9 per cent during the year, the Indian rupee has depreciated by 4.8% against the US dollar, Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
Speaking at the launch of the annual report, he said the US dollar depreciated 4.4% in Philippines and 2.7% in Australia and 2.4% in Indonesia. He predicted that the market sources will soon step to lower it.
He also said there is a myth created that due to the depreciation on the dollar against the Sri Lankan rupee, the government would have to pay huge additional amounts when it comes to foreign debt settlements.
This is not as we are paying foreign debt in US dollars and not in rupees.

A Memorandum of Understanding will be signed soon to continue the Yahapalana government. This government will not fall though many want it that way, said Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella on Wednesday. The Minister made these remarks while attending a ceremony to welcome the representatives of the Gampola Urban Council.
A Memorandum of Understanding will be signed soon with the agreement of the President and the Prime Minister. The new Cabinet committee is scheduled to be sworn in soon.
The government would be continued with a coalition with the UNP and the SLFP. We have established independence in the courts.
We have upheld democracy and had created a chance for the country to glow internationally, stated the Minister.
Certain media institutions wait to see the collapse of the government. But it will not happen. Together, we won a presidential election and we overcame the no confidence motion too, he said.
The Minister further hinted at the future plans of the government too. We are ready to face the presidential election during the next year. Both the parties worked together and rendered a great service to the public, the greatest of them being the media freedom, the Minister stated.
