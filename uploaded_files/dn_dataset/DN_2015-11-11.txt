Avant Garde used as a mudguard to cover up burning issues - Gammanpila
The Government is using the Avant Garde issue as a mudguard in order to cover up all the burning issues and it should tell the country which law had been violated by Avant Garde, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said.
Addressing media in Colombo yesterday he said that all local law experts have already stated that no law had been violated by Avant Garde but only Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake say that it had violated laws. He was addressing the press briefing of the common opposition.
General Secretary of Socialist Freedom Front Raja Collure said that the rule of law has ceased to exist in the country and the Attorney General as the Government's lawyer has been subjected to ridicule. The rule of law cannot be ignored or overlooked for political expediency . The same Minister is responsible for both Law and Justice. Tilak Marapana is one of the prominent and respected former Attorney Generals and he resigned because he could not work according to his conscience. He protected the rule of law.
The Chief Organizer of the Common Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said that Avant Garde is used by the Government in order to make people forget about all the other burning issues. If there is anything wrong with Avant Garde, the Government should expose it.
DLF Leader and MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that the Government was in a political mess and it is connected to many issues such as Avant Garde,the Central Bank bond issue, the corrupt coal tender etc. All Ministers are under the control of the Prime Minister and all responsibilities goes to him. It was revealed that recently one minister openly criticized him and received a very good positive response from the other UNP Ministers and MPs.

Batticaloa Teaching Hospital Emergency and Accident Project
Batticaloa gets fully fledged Hospital
Despite the advancement in certain aspects of life in Sri Lanka, it is still a developing nation with insufficient funds to provide appropriate medical and hospital facilities in rural areas.
The foundation supporting a National Trauma Service was established in September 25 in 2011, when a Deed of Trust was signed by Dr. David A Young, Nihal de Run, Nalin Patikirikorale, Indrajith Fernando and Yoland (Bobby) Hansen as Trustees of the Trust in Colombo. It was also granted legal status in Australia with having Governor of Victoria Prof. David de Kretser as its Patron and Dr. Ranjith Hettiarachchi and Abbas Akbarally as Vice Patrons. Nihal de Run was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer with Dr. Greg Hoy as Vice President. The Foundation appointed cricketing legends Muttiah Muralidharan, Kumar Sangakkara, Dav Whatmore and Shane Watson as its Ambassadors. The project was launched with the understanding of the Ministries of Health of Sri Lanka that the entire project cost would be shared by the Foundation and the Government. The project was designed in two phases, the first phase to build the Emergency and Accident Unit that would cost a sum of US$ six million. Of this, the Foundation is funding US$ two million, while the rest would be funded by the Sri Lankan Government's Ministry of Health. The first phase also includes the drawing of blueprints and engineering sketches, while the construction work is scheduled to commence in November 2015, following the appointment of the Central Engineering and Consulting Bureau of Sri Lanka(CECB) on a turnkey basis.
The second phase of the project is to equip the new building with state of the art surgical equipment and machinery, operating theatre, furniture, ward beds, etc.
The Foundation is committed to provide a further donation of US$ 1million in kind, while the rest would be provided by the government.
Explaining as to how the fund raising programme is in process, Foundation's CEO Nihal de Run said they have already raised a sum of US$ 1.6 million, but the Foundation seeks to raise another and is in need of another US$ 400,000 to support the building project.
The fund raising is currently being conducted both locally and internationally. The completion of the project and the handing over of the new building is scheduled for end 2017.
Leading Corporations such as Sri Lanka Telecom, the Asiri Group of Hospitals, John Keells Group, Baurs, Phoenix, Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) Ltd., Penguin, Brandix and the Melbourne Orthopedic Group have already funded the project to date. There have also been some very large donations made by prominent individuals in Australia and Sri Lanka.
Construction of this Trauma Unit would assist people who are badly injured in motor vehicle accidents, industrial and domestic accidents, burns, bites and vision impairment and injuries lingering post tsunami. The growing tourist industry in the Eastern Province also calls for treatment to be available to tourists who are injured during recreational incidents. BEAPs mission is to empower doctors in Sri Lankan Teaching Hospitals to improve health care services, by providing them with medical resources, training and support to build the necessary infrastructure within their teaching hospitals and to extend the National Trauma Service from Karapitiya to Batticaloa and beyond.
The Rotary Club of Strathmore, Victoria, Australia has adopted the project BEAP as their international project and they have linked with the Rotary Club of Colombo East and the Rotary Club of Batticaloa, to help with the project. The estimated building cost would be Rs. 820 million (approximately US$ 6.3 million) and the fit-out and equipment cost is estimated at Rs. 260 million (approximately US$2 million ).

Beware! Sexting can land you in trouble
Digital devices and social media have made sexual exchanges instantaneous and more gratifying. Just one slightest mistake, though, can put your reputation on the line.
It begins with a Facebook friend request. Once accepted, you embark on a let's-get-to-know each-other-better adventure without wasting any time. Things escalate quickly from kiss blowing emojis to conversations that are more intimate. The action gets hotter as your fingers flutter on the keypad at breakneck speed. "Hey baby, I'm going to hit the gym," you say, and he demands a sweaty workout picture that reveals your cleavage. Having lost almost 10 pounds in the past couple of months, you happily show off your curves. The next time, you decide to turn up the heat by sending him a semi-nude out-of-the-shower selfie and that is followed by a graphic account of your body. Your three month-relationship is sailing smoothly, but then suddenly, it hits the inevitable tip of an iceberg. And as you sling mud at each other, it occurs to you that you probably shouldn't. After all, the boy owns your reputation.
No matter how much you trust your partner, a compromising photo could come back to haunt you for the rest of your life. But does this mean we conclude our sexting experiments altogether Make your decision while we offer a low-down.
NOT-SO-SWEET SIXTEEN
Remember your initial days in college when you were struck by Cupid's arrow The very sight of your crush made your heart go pitter patter, and you were convinced that he was the one. Natasha Sabrewal, 18, and her boyfriend Ryan D'Souza were in a stable relationship for over a year. They went to the same college and watched the same movies. While both of them promised each other that they wouldn't have sex till they graduated, they saw no harm in sexting and sharing sexual selfies. Little did they know that they were rocking the boat. "We never crossed our limit as teenagers, but there were times when we just couldn't resist the attraction. So we sexted a couple of nights every week. One baneful day Ryan forgot his phone at a friend's place. By the time he could go back and pick it up, his friend had transferred all our personal pictures to his phone and began blackmailing us. We were in college and we hardly had any money so we took the matter to our parents who were rather unforgiving. Although Ryan and I are still together, my parents refuse to treat me like before. This tragic episode has left me traumatised. I often get nightmares of the pictures resurfacing on social media," regrets a vulnerable Natasha. Just one click and your private pictures are instantaneously shared with many people. The problem is, once it's on social media, there's no going back.
REVENGE OF THE EX
Kavita Mittal, 30, was over the moon after getting engaged to the love of her life -a hand some, soft-spoken boy she'd met on a matrimony site. The D-day was finalised and relatives from across the world were going to fly down for the wedding. But a stroke of bad luck changed the course of her life -an email sent by her exboyfriend to her fiancee's sister. It had a number of attachments, including intimate chats and seminude images of Kavita. "When you're in love, you're ready to do anything for that person. That's where I went wrong. I never knew things would take such an unfortunate turn," says a disheartened Kavita, who later married her fiancee in a simple ceremony, against their family's wish.
"Sexting works well for mature couples and strengthens their bond, especially when they spend long periods apart. However, this phenomenon can prove to be dangerous for those who don't understand its consequences. It begins with harmless emoticons and there's a gradual exposure to semi-nude and nude selfies," says Dr Shyam Mithiya, psychiatrist, sexologist and counsellor. He indicates that sexting also caused a significant increase in the number of divorce cases. "There's an instant loss of emotional connect between couples after a fight, and when that happens, the partners turn into individuals and begin to connect with newer people on WhatsApp or Facebook -emotionally and then physically. One thing leads to another and both individuals no longer wish to work things out as a couple," he says.
WHAT IS SEXTING
Sexting is the act of sending, receiving or forwarding sexually explicit messages or photos via cellphone, computer or other digital device. The term `sext' was first used by the media in 2005 and was also considered for the New Oxford American Dictionary 2009 Word of the Year. The trend is popular among teens with approximately 25 to 30 per cent of them admitting to sexting.

China hopes to get better response for new two-child policy
CHINA: China hopes to get a better response for its new two-child policy as the earlier relaxation of permitting second child to couples from one child families evoked poor response with only 13 per cent of 1.45 million eligible parents applied for permission to have second child.
About 55,850 qualified couples have applied for a second child in Beijing city till last month, which is 10 per cent of those eligible in response to last year's relaxation of the family planning policy under which parents from one-child parents were permitted to have a second child.
By the end of May, 1.45 million couples with one parent being an only child had applied to have a second baby from all over China, accounting for about 13 per cent of all eligible couples, National Health and Family Planning Commission said.
The number of eligible couples applying to have a second child has increased between 80,000 and 90,000 every month, the commission said.
The poor response to the limited relaxation reportedly prompted the ruling Communist Party to permit all couples to have second child in a major policy move last month under which over 90 million couples would be eligible to benefit.
About 35 per cent of women qualified under the new policy is 35 years or above. The new policy would come into effect from early next year after formal ratification by legislature, the National Peoples Congress (NPC).
After stringently implementing the one-child policy for about three and half decades, the party is in a hurry to push for more children due to rapid increase in old age population which this year is expected to touch about 221 million of the 1.37 billion total population which is the world's highest.
The resultant demographic crisis began to create labour shortages in the county and the crisis were expected to deepen in the coming years.
The new second child policy was expected to help raise the population to an estimated 1.45 billion by 2030.
Judging from the response to the previous relaxation, most of the Chinese couples were not very enthusiastic to have a second child which they see as a burden in view of heavy costs involved in bringing up two children, experts said.
Most couples don't want to expand their families, if the low number applying for a second child in Beijing under today's rules is an indicator of parental thinking.
Yuan Xin, an expert in population studies at Nankai University in Tianjin, said that with the development of the Chinese economy and society over the past several decades, the traditional concept of having more children has changed and more people are opting for fewer children, especially in big cities such as Beijing.
"It has been a mainstream concept among Beijing residents to give birth to fewer children after decades of the family planning policies the city adopted in the 1970s", and allowing all couples to have two children will improve the population structure of Beijing and maintain the vitality of society, the Beijing commission said.
The city will amend its population laws and improve family planning services, such as building more maternal care and nursery institutes and kindergartens, to cope with an increase in births, it said.

This programme was launched recently in Iranamadu in Kilinochchi District under the patronage of the President. After the launch, it was carried out island-wide.President Sirisena assured that he would personally monitor the performance of the programme by visiting every district in the future. The President also stated he would visit Northern and Eastern Provinces to seek the issues faced by the people. Attention was paid on the programme to select the best farmer which has been implemented to encourage people about the local food production programme.
President Sirisena pointed out the significance of the close cooperation between the Agriculture Ministry and the Commerce Ministry in the programme to strengthen the farmers by getting their produce to the market. Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers Ravi Karunanayake, Vajira Abeywardena, S. B. Dissanayake, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, P.

Country lost a great Buddhaputra - PM
The country has lost a great Buddhaputra with the demise of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera, who engaged in an unceasing fearless struggle for several decades to realise the dream of a disciplined society and a wide democratic administration, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated in a condolence message issued yesterday.
The thera who did not restrict himself to a particular party, community or religion has passed away by leaving the name 'Maduluwawe Sobhita' as a symbol, the message added.
The Prime Minister said the demise of Ven. Sobhita thera was an irreparable loss to the country and its people.
Born on May 29, 1942 at Maduluwawa in Padukka, he entered the order in his young age and completed his education from the Vidyalankara and Vidyodaya Universities. Making the university campus the birth place for the people's struggle for social justice, he worked hand-in-hand continuously with the people for the benefit and welfare of the Buddhasasana, nation and the people with deep devotion and dedication till his demise.
He took the forefront to create a change for the better in the country when ever democracy was endangered irrespective of which ever party was in power.
He worked selflessly for the country's progress and welfare without concern for any personal gain.
At a time when many were reluctant to oppose the authoritative and autocratic administration which engulfed the country in the recent past he took the leadership and played a pioneering role to create good governance by setting up the 'People's movement for social justice'.
He was bhikkhu who performed an outstanding and an epochal service towards literature, arts, environment, Dhamma education as well as the Temperance Movement.
He could be described as a national seal which unifies the Maha Sangha of the Tri Nikayas for a common national purpose.
The Prime Minister said he wished to record with gratitude the strength the late thera offered him for his political path by giving him counsel at various times.
The Prime Minister's message said "when I went to see him before he left for Singapore for further treatment he held a long discussion with a group of people including me and Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya about the current performance of the good governance government and future steps to be taken by it".
Accordingly he wished to emphasise that the prime concern of the present government should be to establish the just society the late thera expected and that the people should rally round to accomplish it.
May the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita thera attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Driverless buses to Operate in Switzerland soon
SWITERLAND: In a first, electric-powered driverless public transport buses will soon be operating in Switzerland which will be able to ferry nine passengers at a time.
The autonomous buses will launch in the canton of Valais, thanks to a collaboration between PostBus and a Swiss startup founded by graduates from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne.
Two new driverless buses will be put in service in Sion during a two-year test period from early 2016, in what is a first for Switzerland's public transport system.
The electric-powered vehicles will be able to carry nine passengers at a time and will be in service in tourist zones in Sion's Old Town, 'The Local' reported.
Installed with technology developed by Lausanne-based start-up BestMile, the distinctive vehicles will be able to navigate roads accurately, identify obstacles and read road signs.
The project is the result of a two-year joint research project conducted by BestMile and EPFL to develop the mathematical algorithms that allow driverless vehicles to deal with different scenarios on the road and be operated remotely.
The technology "offers a solution to control fleets of autonomous vehicles in the same way a control tower does in an airport," BestMile said in a statement.
Following a six-month testing period at EPFL, the company is working with Nayva, a French specialist in sustainable mobility, to install its technology in two Navya Arma shuttles that will roam Sion. - AFP

An enchantress called Esmeralda
This great classic by Victor Hugo was adapted into Sinhala as 'Kudaage Sangraamaya' by the prominent writer late H P Siriwardhane around 65 years ago. It was republished as 'Notradamaya' in 1972 by Lake House Investment Ltd. H P Siriwardhane was no stranger to the then literary circles. His short story collection 'Maaraya Andhuda' published around 70s became an instant bestseller
Vimukthi Sarathchandra
Esmeralda is a fictional character in Victor Hugo's much acclaimed novel 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (or Notre Dame de Paris) which was translated into several other languages across the Europe. Esmeralda was a young gipsy girl who possessed a seductive beauty with a kind and a generous heart.
She is the centre of the attention within the story. Her creator Victor Hugo was revered as a towering figure in literature and was a statesman who shaped the democracy in France. Hugo's advocacy to abolish the death penalty was renowned internationally. This story of the battle of a hunchback is based on the time 500 years ago in Paris well before the French revolution, although the specific period is not all that relevant.
The story depicts the life and experiences of this poor dancing girl, a gipsy, as was known to the society, in a period where the human values were vague, and determined at the whims and fancies of the royalty, rich elite and the powerful clergy. The destiny of the powerless and the poor were at the mercy of a ruling class with unbridled power. Esmerelda constantly attracted men with her seductive dances. She captured heart of many men. However she was unaware of the thoughts of the influential and powerful people who were desperate to possess her. Among those were the high priests of the Notre-Dame Cathedral and
his adopted son Quasimodo, a hunchback by birth and the bell ringer of the same church. The high priest Claude Frollo ordered Quasimodo to kidnap her. But Esmeralda was rescued by Captain Phoebus with whom she instantly fell in love to the point of obsession.
Later she found that Captain Phoebus had no plans to take her hand in marriage as she hoped, but to use her for his own pleasure. Esmerelda's whole life from the beginning to the end was full of tragedies that befell on her mainly due to her beauty and the innocence and the deep rooted injustice prevailing in the society towards the powerless. This great classic by Victor Hugo was adapted into Sinhala as 'Kudaage Sangraamaya' by the prominent writer late H P Siriwardhane around 65 years ago. It was republished as 'Notradamaya' in 1972 by Lake House Investment Ltd. H P Siriwardhane was no stranger to the then literary circles. His short story collection 'Maaraya Andhuda' published around 70s became an instant bestseller.
H P Siriwardhane passed away in 2008 at the age of 92 in Melbourne, Australia. Keeping with the promise made to Siriwardhane, the writer Nihal Sarathchandra Akmeemana has brought an edited version of 'Kudaage Sangraamaya' with a new title 'Aadara Esmeralda' into the literary world for the benefit of Sinhala readers. In his preface to this new edition, Nihal points out the significance of the role played by the Gipsy girl Esmeralda from the outset to the end of the narrative, though the hunchback Quasimodo was considered as the main protagonist in the original book.
The new edition is adorned by a preface titled 'A Man Apart' by Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa and cover page pictorials by Dhammika de Silva. It was published with the courtesy of Niroshana Jayasundera of Stamford Lake (pvt) Ltd.
Nihal Sarathchandra Akmeemana is an old boy of Issipathana and Ananda Colleges. He lives away from our motherland in New Zealand for over two decades. His first literary work was written during his childhood, a novel 'Mara Paashaya'( Death trap) which was published years later in 1972 by Rathnakara Publishers.
After several years of silence, he published a collection of short stories 'Ekthara Katu Satahanak' (Just a Sketch) in 2004. We shall truly admire his efforts for publishing this revised version of the adaptation of this great story for the benefit of Sinhala literary enthusiasts in this isle.

Eulogy to an unsung musical genius
Blow, blow thou winter wind Thou art not so unkind As mans ingratitude...
-William Shakespeare (1564  1616)
In the bewilderingly commercialized global culture of our day, it is not at all surprising to come upon at time, an instance of a bar of high classical music being utilized to promote a tube of toothpaste. Equally a choice excerpt of a pristine musical composition could very well be deployed to hype the tantalizing whiff of a brand of perfume!
This crazed daze and haze of relentless scuffle and sharply competitive of forays to grab the mass mind, spill out overwhelmingly into a headlong torrent, when some societies find themselves in an all - pervading poll-frenzy.
In that kind of chaotic, frantic and delirious communications disarray, perennial spiritual and human values are quite likely to be overshadowed by instant, ephemeral and depressingly narrow impulses. Petty priorities subdue creative achievements that have the potentiality to prove to be of lasting greatness. The memory of exceptionally talented men and women of unparalleled genius pathetically recede into a limbo of overpowering oblivion from where, many such great personalities have only a very slim chance of emerging once again into the limelight of public attention.
A wide-spread social malaise in Sri Lanka is the extensively prevalent predilection to cynically neglect and disregard those personalities of undoubted national and human stature, who so significantly matter to the country. Once they are gone, in a sudden spurt of seemingly high concern, their last rites are ceremonially conducted- at times, with the patronage of the State.
That of course is that.
But, it is salutary and heart-warming indeed, to note, that we still have in this country rare individuals who are fully committed to the idea of remembering those who are worthy of our deference, Adoration and Lasting memory!
The Author of this Work, Veteran Writer and experienced managerial administrator Piyasena Wickramage who focuses upon the late Sarath Dasanayaka, has proved over and over again, that he is profoundly moved by the neglect, that some men and women of genius of our land are allowed to suffer! As a national and human responsibility he has imposed upon himself, Author Piyasena Wickramage, has brought out works on forgotten personalities and also on important social eras that have escaped the attention of the mass memory.
In a recent well-researched tome. Writer Piyasena Wickramage chronicled the intriguing history of the Early Days of Sri Lankan Cinema. It is structurally akin to an absorbing Folk Record, setting down the informal history of the initial decades of our cinema.
In his current effort Writer Piyasena Wickramage, provides a detailed account of the substantial contribution made by late Musical Genius in the Film Music. Author Piyasena Wickramage performs an incredibly noteworthy service, by establishing the multi-pronged services rendered to Film Music in Sri Lanka, without earning the due encomium for such a massive utilization of phenomenal musical talent. Maestro Sarath Dasanayakas blazing contribution in bringing about a harmonious fusion between the Northern Indian Classical Musical theories and the folk rhythms indigenous to Sri Lanka is amply presented by Author Piyasena Wickramage.
Although film-music is presently, an integral element in world cinema, the Film Medium originally came into being as silent visual narration. In the early days at times, a group of musicians performed as an accompaniment to the silent film.
Officially, sound was integrated into cinema in 1927, with Warner Brothers The Jazz Singer in which Al Jolson figured. In Sri Lanka a significant film music tradition was inaugurated by musically erudite Sarath Dasanayaka. As Author Piyasena Wickramage indicates providing all the essential evidence, the distinguished achievement of Sarath Dasanayaka, was not at all adequately recognized and adored-due (as this Author states) to Saraths indomitable attitude of independence, which prevented him seeking partisan patronage.
In terms of the moving biographical details, presented by the Author, Saraths life was not quite a bed of roses. Nor, was it an uninterrupted song of rapture and glee.
Sarath met the ups-and-downs of life with a steady stoic adroitness. Music was the be-all and end-all of his life. He never compromised his faith to the music he committed himself to, as a life long ritual. Author Piyasena Wickramage addresses the conscience of out nation to enquire, Why as an, exceptional community of compassionate clear-sightedness, upholding the human virtue of gratitude, we fail our great personalities.
Sarath Dasanayaka 16th commemoration
Maestro Sarath Dasanayaka's 16th Death Anniversary will be commemorated at Tharangani Cinema Hall of National Film Corporation on November 17 at 4 pm. Prof. Sunil Ariyaratna, who wrote award winning lyrics for which Maestro Sarath Dasanayaka directed the musical score beginning from the seventies, will deliver the guest speech. In parallel, a special research work Maestro Sarath Dasanayaka's thinking on Music - film music in particular  will be launched. The book includes Dasanayakas musical compositions for Sinhala Children's songs of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. These articles were collected materials from Maestro Sararath Dasanayaka's interviews done specially for newspaper articles during his lifetime.
The Book was compiled by film journalist and writer Piyasena Wickramage. Wickramage has earlier compiled three cinema books on Dr. Lester James Peries. A Sarasavi Publication, the book was designed by award winning designer & artist Malaka Lalanajeeva.

Grero reveals alarming statistics in education sphere
It is alarming that of the total number who enter Grade One in school only 17 to 20 percent proceed to Higher Education, Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said. According to statistics, of the students who proceed to primary education, around 87 percent go up to Secondary Education. Of this number, only 50 percent enter tertiary education.
But it is significant that less than 20 percent of the country's student population make their way to higher education.
But in developed countries the rate of students entering Higher Education is nearing 98 - 99 percent. Even in certain Asian countries such as Japan and Korea the amount is similar to developed countries.
"It can be presumed that structure and procedure governing our national examinations, have become a barrier for more students to enter tertiary or higher education."
"Certain mathematics and scientific formulas taught at Ordinary Level are not used or utilised until the end of a student's life unless that student becomes a teacher or an engineer. The examination structure, especially the Ordinary Level and Advanced Level Examinations have created a hindrance for students to go up the academic ladder," Grero said.
The minister stressed that school curricular should be revised so as to adapt it to the modern and advanced world. The curricular should be revised after considering the trends in the education sector and the demands and needs of the modern world, he said.
"This examination system is not suitable to identify the capacity and ability of a student. Certain abilities such as language ability and mathematical ability are not used in his or her lifetime," Grero said.

Sixth death anniversary of legendary Henry Jayasena fell on November 9
He who lived through nature to eternity
Henry Jayasena, the legendary dramatist, renowned actor, lyricist, translator and author was a firm believer of Shakespeare's memorable phrase "All that live must die passing through nature to eternity". He had learnt this in school as, "To every man upon the earth, death cometh soon or late". During the time he commenced his long career, he initially stood tall on the modest unsophisticated Lumbini Theatre in the early 1960's.
He had confessed many times as a much adored artiste that his heart lies in theatre. Henry Jayasena could be easily classified as one, alongside amongst the elite of eminent literary figures in the annals of theatre in Sri Lanka, like Professor Ediriweera Sarathchandra, Sugathapala De Silva, Dayananda Gunawardena, Premasiri Khemadasa and Gunasena Galapaththy etc.
His abundant contributions to the theatre and cinema spanned for almost 4 decades. He called it a day from his stretched acting career in the year 1999 while he was under treatment for the acquired dreaded decease 'colon cancer'. The entire treatment route took around one and a half years. On his personal familiarity and misery he had written distinctively a book titled "Balha Gilano - the story of a cancer patient" merely to alert the masses. Since he had lived for a further period of 10 years leading a normal life. His death was sudden and was shocking to many as he had recovered fully from the dreaded 'colon cancer' was a very unfortunate to have died following a medical misadventure when he was hale and hearty. He was in such a characteristic health state when he possessed the muscle during which time he rejuvenated his famous drama, "Hunuwataye Kathawa" an adoption of Bertolt Brecht's 'The Caucasian Chalk Circle'. He had deployed a blend of experience, talent with novice actors along with a few who were involved earlier in the likes of Nimal Jayasinghe and Chula Kariyawasam.
Henry Jayasena had authored many books in Sinhala and English in addition to have written a series of articles to the national newspaper Daily News under the Artscope column .The English transformation of the book Lazarus revitalized the legacy of Henry Jayasena.The book "Lazarus" was written by Henry Jayasena about 15 years ago. Disappointingly the English version of the book was published after his death. However he had got to study the first sketch of manuscript when he lived.
The role of Judge 'Azdak' is to date ideally portrayed by Tele drama actor Nalin Pradeep Uduwela while that of 'Grusha' by Ruwini Manamperi, a novice.
The original Hunuwataye Kathawa, without a doubt, was his masterpiece. It represented him while at his peak. Bertolt Brecht's Caucasian Chalk Circle had been wildly popular in both Russia and England. In keeping with his style, however, Jayasena refused to slip Brecht's famous "alienation effect", which tried to strip a play of its emotional power, into his adaptation of it. The reason was simple: "I had seen enough of dry, spiritless, and embittered productions of Brecht not to commit the same mistake here". Deliberately and to great acclaim, he included song and dance sequences in Hunuwataye Kathawa, to provoke unprocessed sensation in the audience he sought to accomplish.
He remained as a potential dramatist who was well acquainted and nourished in English, was a bona fide fanatic when it came to the theatre. He followed play after play with gigantic consequence. His reviews on them were speck on, for the obvious impetus that he himself had acted in some of them and hence knew the intact apparatus of a "high-quality" play.
There is a section quoted in his autobiography, The Play is the Thing, where he emphasises to us his first familiarity with dramatization of a play. This occurred whilst he was a teacher at a school in Dehipe. The play, Janaki (based on the Ramayana), was his first endeavour on stage. He had mentioned how difficult it was to get the costumes, actors, and guests for the event. The play was staged, however, and turned out to be triumphant.
He also had a immeasurable repository of understanding when it came to the stage. He was at once securely rooted in his land and with the rest of the world. With a UNESCO fellowship in his arm, he left to Russia and later to England, and from both countries learnt and engrossed a vast deal. He also realised, astutely perhaps, that imitating what he had studied there was not the technique to revitalize his country's theatre, which by then was in pursue of a technique away from Sarathchandra's style of plays.
"There is a kind of sadness that settles over me at the end of every play. I mean, when all that lovely work is over and there is little to look forward to in the evenings."
It is the same kind of sadness we all revel in, whenever hard work is done with and the effort placed into it has been appreciated by everyone. It's a burden for anyone, and for Henry Jayasena it would be a burden he would get used to as time passed by and as he rose higher and higher.
Perhaps Henry Jayasena educated us with a lesson here. He knew the theatre, inside-out. He realised that for all the trends the rest of the world had popularised, he still would have to shape and acclimatize his stories to suit his own people. He understood that we had our individual stories to enrich our theatre with. He also understood that it was not imitation but adaptation which would lengthen our stage. This didn't mean a local playwright should be detached from the issues of his time was proved by his next play, Apata Puthe Magath Nathe. That's the flanking thing to a political announcement Jayasena came up with. It was based on a factual occurrence, was banned, and was later staged to a wider acclaim.
Henry Jayasena was born on in a village called Bendiyamulla in Gampaha in year 1931. He His father Albert Rodrigo Jayasena who was once the Private Secretary to Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike was a well versed person.
His father in the evenings had got all six children in the family to memorize celebrated phrases of Shakespeare although he did not understand the contents of them then. He had quipped that he was brought up in such an environment, where he fostered with no panic of language.

3 Things
I Learned About Writing: Analyzing Stephen Kings IT
This reoccurring column takes the classic writing advice good writers are good readers and puts it to work, by looking at books across all time periods and all genres to find techniques that we can apply in our own work. This installment examines Stephen Kings iconic horror novel, IT.
1. Never underestimate the use of smell.
He could smell the cheery aroma of midway sawdust. And yet
And yet under it all was the smell of flood, decomposing leaves and dark storm drain shadows. That smell was ret and rotten. The cellar smell.
Throughout the novel, this scent of death and decay is always associated with the arrival of IT. This particular description occurs in the first chapter of the novel.
All the reader knows is that cute little Georgie Denbrough found a clown in stormdrain. Odd, but not alarming.
Its this smell that tells the reader to be afraid, that this clown is evil, death and decay incarnate. This smell has raised the stakes. Georgie is in extreme danger and now we know it.
2. Names are powerfulan absence of names is even more so.
The writers woman was now with It, alive yet not aliveher mind had been utterly destroyed by her first sight of It as It really was, with all of Its little masks and glamours thrown asideand all of the glamours were only mirrors, of course, throwing back at the terrified viewer the worst thing in his or her own mind
Names equal identity. If someone is named, theyre important and theyre solid.
The writers woman is Audrey, wife to our hero, Bill Denbrough. IT is never named; Pennywise the Clown is just one identity. When IT takes Audrey, IT strips her of her identity, just like IT has no identity.
If you introduce your reader to a character named Bob, but then he suddenly decides to start going by John, youre signaling a radical identity shift. A complete lack of identity, like we see with IT, makes a character distant and totally separate from reality.
The longer you make the reader wait for a name, the more mysterious and sinister your character becomes.
3. Consistent images are a readers best friend.
The birds tongue was silver, its surfaces as crazy-cracked as the surface of a volcanic land which has first baked and then slagged off.
And on this tongue, like weird tumbleweeds that had taken temporary root there, were a number of orange puffs.
This image of an orange tuft appears in every manifestation that IT takes.
Pennywise will have orange tufts of hair or orange pompoms on his outfit, for example. Because IT changes faces so many times, this visual keeps the reader on track. Without it, its easy to assume were dealing with multiple villains.
The image keeps IT and all of ITs manifestations solidified. Consistent images are extremely useful when the risk of distraction is high and you want to keep your readers on track.

I resigned to prevent split in party - Marapana
Ex-Cabinet Minister Thilak Marapana claims that he was representing the Attorney General (AG) when he made the controversial statement during the adjournment debate on the Avant Garde floating armoury case in Parliament last week, which lead to his resignation on Monday.
Marapana was insistent that he was in-fact informing the House and the general public of the AGs opinion, although during his speech he lashed out at several MPs for disturbing him, claiming that they were slandering and calling the Avant Garde proprietor, N. Senadhipathi a rouge, but were not allowing him (Marapana) to speak for him (Senadhipathi).
The Attorney General cannot come and make speeches as to why he said this. He expresses his opinion; he is not expected to have press conferences. I am a minister and an MP, when I speak in Parliament. It my duty by the public to inform them so that the public could clear any misconception that they have. Why should the AG be blamed It is very unfair to malign a person like that, he explained.
He wanted the public to accept the AGs opinion he insists. I myself know that it is correct, because I have examined these documents myself.
Marapana explained that he had seen the same papers that the attorney General had examined to arrive at the conclusion to give his opinion on the case.
This man (Senadhipathi) was my client; he came to me in January and February. He showed me these documents.
Marapana is insistent that the weapons are legal. One day all those who are having any doubts about these weapons would agree with me, I am confident, he claims.
Senadhipathi consulted Marapana in January to prevent the court from freezing his accounts and to get clearance to travel to Nigeria, following the police raid on the floating Amoury anchored in Galle, he claims.
According to Marapana, the company was negotiating four contracts for the Sri Lanka Navy and he was convinced it was a genuine operation after perusing the documents.
At that time, I was a practicing as a lawyer. So I immediately wrote to the Attorney General, setting out these facts and urged him not to freeze the (Senadhipathi's) account. In view of the fact that it was very urgent for him (Sendhipathi) to travel to Nigeria. I urged the AG's Department to allow him to go and come back.
He is quick to establish that Avant Garde only consulted him to seek legal opinion before he became a Member of Parliament.
I was not even a Member of Parliament. I could not have influenced the AGs opinion which came in June.
The Police raid was staged
Marapana is fiercely critical of the conduct of the police and insists that the raid was conducted for political gains.
According to him, Avant Garde has obtained permission from the Defence Ministry to anchor the ship in the Galle harbour, as they needed to switch vessels. As the company had permission to enter any port in the country, given by the Ministry of Defence, he did not even have to do this, he says. Marapana says he had examined these letters of permission, copies of which have been given to the Navy, Galle Port authorities and the police.
The police was well aware of the floating armoury that was berthed in the Galle Harbour, claims Marapana.
The ship was there since October 6, (2014), this raid was in mid January 2015. For three full months, this ship was anchored in the harbour and these weapons came in and out of the ship to be taken to other ships in the sea. The police is just hundred metres from the habour. So it is wrong for the police to say that they didnt know that there was a ship such as this carrying weapons and wait till after the elections for it to be raided, Marapana says critical of the conduct of the police.
Even if someone made a complaint, they should have said it was a legitimate business.
Marapana also refers to an investigation done by the Police in 2012, when two weapons issued to two Sea Marshals went missing, further establishing that the police was well aware of the floating armoury in question.
Conflict of Interest
However, the police did conduct an investigation and evidence was submitted to the AG based on which the AG concluded the case.
Marapana was appointed Minister of Law and Order, following the August 8 elections, while demands for further investigations into the Avant Garde floating armoury case mounted.
Marapana maintains that he never interfered with the investigations after taking office as Cabinet Minister of Law and Order. He also insists that there was no conflict of interest in him holding the particular ministerial portfolio, while also practicing as a Criminal Lawyer.
I have never, never poked my finger into investigations.
He never thought there would be a conflict of interest in accepting the Ministerial Portfolio, despite Avant Garde being his client as it was only one case. He insists that the ethical conduct as a minister was left to his good self.
I am not going to meddle with the investigations like a fool.
According to him, though he was in-charge of the police, he was only supposed to regulate, supervise the police and look into any delays in the work, not monitor investigations.
Pressure to Resign
However, Marapana decided to tender his resignation to ensure that the public believe there is no biasness in the investigations and to prevent a split in the party.
Even though I made this statement and the AG has given his opinion, some MPs still maintain further investigations should be conducted. There may be a public perception that the investigations may not be conducted properly if I remain in the ministry. I wanted to avoid that conclusion.
The decision to resign was his own, Marapana insisted. The decision was taken to safeguard the government, he claimed.
I went and discussed the matter with the Prime Minister. I realized that it would create a division in the party, if I dont step down. Some people in the Cabinet were adamant that this should be reinvestigated and that so long as I was the minister, it cannot be properly investigated and the JVP was also shouting. So in that situation, I didnt want to create any problems for the party or the government,  Marapana explained.
According to him, the decision to resign was taken to protect the government he helped bring to power.
I took this bold decision to step down to protect the government and the party. I feel that it was a small price to pay to maintain the unity of our party and the stability of our government.
Another Portfolio
Marapana is also insistent that he would not take any other Ministerial post either.
Because then the allegation may be that so long as I am a cabinet minister, the police may be frightened to conduct investigations. Let the police investigate this, it is only a small area under investigation, he explained.
He will continue to support the government and take over any responsibility assigned to him by the Prime Minister. His loyalties are with the UNP and entirely with the Prime Minister, and will
support the President and the Prime Minister on anything they decide.
However, he expressed his disappointment on how those who helped the government to come into power have been treated.
We the National Lawyers Association played a crucial role in the Presidential and General elections. I feel sad that our lawyers have not got the due recognition from the present government. I hope they
would be rewarded in the near future. Their services to the party should be recognized. I have been taking great pains to see that it happens. Unfortunately, I have not been able to do much, he says.
Marapana is also undecided on whether or not he would continue his legal work while remaining in Parliament, he said.
However, he has decided not represent the Avant Garde, in light of the present political situation surrounding the case.
Avant Garde has their own lawyers. He has not come to me since January. He came to me in January as it was essentially a criminal matter" Marapana said.

MARAPANA RESIGNATION quells Cabinet fireworks
The special Cabinet meeting on the Avant Garde controversy, held on Monday, was supposed to be full of fireworks and high drama.
A group of Cabinet ministers, over the weekend, held lengthy discussions to exert pressure on the government calling for Minister Thilak Marapana's resignation over the Avant Garde controversy. They stressed Marapana's conduct with regard to the Avant Garde company amounted to conflict of interest as he was retained as a lawyer for the company, at one point. While making his special statement in Parliament, Marapana also used the term 'my client' to refer to the private security company which is at the centre of a major controversy.
The UNP MPs who gathered at the Temple Trees on Monday for a group meeting did not mince their words about the Avant Garde issue. Apart from Rajitha Senaratne and Patali Champika Ranawaka, regular critiques of the Avant Garde issue, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, Ajith P. Perera and Arjuna Ranatunga also urged the Prime Minister to expedite action against wrongdoers. They repeatedly said they could not face their voters at the grassroots level as the new government came to power on the promise of 'nabbing thieves' and 'taking action'.
Avant Garde issue a political volcano
Minister Champika RanawakaMinister Wejayadasa RajapakshaMinister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne
Meanwhile, another group of MPs representing the UNP looked at Senaratne's efforts with a modicum of suspicion. They were of the view that both Senaratne and Ranawaka were attempting to project themselves as towering figures against corruption at the expense of the reputation and image of the government. While dubbing it as a 'selfish move', they held discussions over the weekend to defend Marapana at the cabinet meeting on Monday. Their main argument was that Marapana and Rajapakshe should be 'defended' as they were the most experienced members in the cabinet when it came to matters related to judiciary.
There were strong indications that the Avant Garde controversy was turning out to be a political volcano for the national unity government formed just three months ago. Although Senaratne and Ranawaka got elected to Parliament on the UNP ticket, they were considered close allies of President Maithripala Sirisena. Some even went on to speculate that the Avant Garde issue would result in a clash between UNP and non-UNP members in the cabinet.
Adding another dimension to this issue, Muslim Congress Leader, Minister Rauff Hakeem, speaking at the Cabinet meeting last Thursday, criticized the government saying the Cabinet was kept in the dark about Minister Marapana's statement to Parliament. He also said those who voted for "good governance" were in a state of confusion over the government's inaction on wrongdoers affiliated with the previous regime.
Therefore, many assumed that the cabinet meeting at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday would be a highly dramatic one. There were also speculations that the cabinet meeting would be postponed at the last moment due to the demise of Most Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera on Sunday. However, it was later decided to hold the cabinet meeting as scheduled as the President and the Prime Minister realized that the Avant Garde issue was turning out to be a matter of crucial importance.
Against this backdrop, Law and Order Minister Thilak Marapana's resignation on Monday morning - just hours before the special cabinet meeting - was nothing short of an anticlimax.
As the meeting started, the President informed Cabinet members that he received the letter of resignation of Law and Order Minister Thilak Marapana. It 'quelled' a lot of fireworks at the outset and the ministers who were planning to push for Marapana's resignation were at a loss for words.
President assures to resolve Avant Garde crisis
President Sirisena also assured the ministers that he would brief the Cabinet in one week on the government's course of action over Avant Garde private security firm. He said he would arrive at a final decision on the matter after discussions with the Prime Minister.
The President also promised to hold a meeting with all stakeholders of the Avant Garde controversy, including members of the security forces, on possible solutions to the current problem. This all-stakeholder meeting will take place at the Presidential Secretariat towards the end of this week.
Another highlight of the President's brief speech at the Cabinet meeting was his position on the 'political impact' of the matter.
The President said it was important to understand that the "opposition" was supportive of Avant Garde company as it had close links with the top echelons of the previous regime.
"The opposition does not want to probe Avant Garde at all. They are silent about it. This is a matter among members of the government. So, this should be sorted out within the government," the President said.
Another important speaker at Monday's cabinet meeting was Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who came under criticism from various parties in connection with the Avant Garde controversy. Rajapakshe defended his position over the issue, saying his stance on the matter was based on the Attorney General's opinion.
"The Attorney General cannot prosecute people based on statements made by politicians. It should be based on evidence. If the evidence suggests that the company is not involved in any illegal business, the Attorney General cannot do anything about it. I am not trying to justify the conduct the company. I am explaining the present state of affairs over the matter," the Justice Minister said.
While Rajapakshe was making his speech, Minister Rajitha Senaratne, quoting Additional Solicitor General Suhada Gamlath, said a powerful politician of the government had influenced the investigations into Avant Garde security firm.
Responding to this claim, Minister Rajapakshe requested Senaratne to summon the official for a meeting and ask him to disclose the names of the politicians who tried to influence the investigations.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, voicing his opinion, said the conduct of the owner of the private security firm should be investigated as his name had been mentioned in connection with various allegations.
Commenting on Avant Garde's operations in Nigeria, Minister Ranawaka said the company could pose a severe threat to the country's national security.
He stressed the government should conduct a full-scale, transparent investigation into the activities of the private security firm and its owners, without any political interference.
Civil Society want action against politicos funded by Avant Garde
Civil society groups, which were instrumental in bringing a new government into power in January, was another party that strongly pushed for Marapana's resignation over the matter.
After Marapana announced his resignation on Monday, it was welcomed by the civil society as a positive move. However, they added that Marapana's alleged involvement in the matter was just a tip of the iceberg.
A civil society group that took a strong stand on the Avant Garde issue was the Purawesi Balaya organization, which played a key role in bringing President Maithripala Sirisena into power. They were of the strong belief that the Avant Garde issue was the litmus test of the new government where its commitment to good governance was concerned.
"Marapana's resignation was a good opening, But the whole issue is bigger than that. It is important to conduct a fair and impartial investigation into the Avant Garde problem. We have enough signs to believe that certain political elements are standing in the way of investigations," senior lawyer J.C. Weliamuna, a front-line member of the Purawesi Balaya organization, told the Daily News.
Meanwhile, several members of the civil society group held discussions on Monday to launch a fresh campaign demanding authorities to conduct investigations into politicians who were on the 'payroll' of the private security firm.
"We all know that some powerful members of the present government went out of their way at times to defend the controversial security firm. It shows they have strong links with Avant Garde and its owners. Such links too should be investigated in the wake of Marapana's resignation. Some ministers had openly claimed that the company attempted to bribe them. Despite such revelations, no action has been taken against the company. This has become a serious concern for the civil society organizations" a member, who was involved in Monday's discussions, told the Daily News.
The Marapana saga
Minister Thilak Marapana is one of the most seasoned lawyers in the country's legal fraternity at the moment. The second son of former District Judge P. Marapana and the brother of President's Counsel Gamini Marapana, Thilak Marapana is an alumnus of S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. Apart from his law degree, Marapana also has a degree in Chemistry - a testament to multi-faceted nature of his character.
Marapana joined the Attorney General's Department as a Crown Counsel in 1968. In 1988, he was made a President's Counsel and two years later he was appointed Solicitor General. Marapana was appointed the Attorney General in 1992, during the tenure of President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Marapana played a crucial role in the country's political sphere immediately after President Premadasa's death on May 01, 1993. He, in his capacity as the chief legal officer of the government, was an important troubleshooter for former President D.B. Wijetunga who was catapulted into the forefront of national politics after Premadasa's death. Marapana retired as Attorney General in 1994 and after the People's Alliance government came to power, he reverted to the private bar.
Under the People's Alliance governments, thousands of UNP supporters across the country ran into various "legal troubles' due to obvious reasons. Marapana was one of their most important go-to persons when it came to legal confrontations. When the UNP was out of power, Marapana rendered a great service to the party as a lawyer. The party leader and other senior echelons of the party held his service in high esteem.
Navigating through troubled waters
Considering his great service to the UNP and UNPers, the party appointed him as a national list MP in 2000. After the Parliamentary election in 2001, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made him the Minister of Defence. Marapana, as the Defence Minister, had to navigate through troubled waters as the government had entered into a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE. While dealing with a notorious terrorist outfit at one end, he also had to deal with complicated legal and constitutional issues at the other end as former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga functioned as the Commander- in-Chief of armed forces while Marapana served as the Defence Minister. Sore relations between the President and the rest of the cabinet plunged the UNP government into numerous problems.
In 2002 , Marapana was made the Minister of Transport, Highways and Aviation, in addition to his portfolio of Minister of Defence, turning him into one of most influential members of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe's Cabinet.
After a hiatus of over 10 years, Marapana re-entered into active politics after the UNP nominated him as a national list MP of the party after the Parliamentary election in August, 2015. He was appointed as the Minister of Law and Order under the current national unity government.
When Marapana assumed duties as the Minister of Law and Order, some sections of the political circles raised concerns as he also functioned as a lawyer of Nishshanka Senadhipathi, owner of Avant Garde, before he was appointed as a Member of Parliament. The Avant Garde issue was already sending ripples across the political fold of the country and Marapana, as the Law and Order Minister, was supposed to deal with it. It is unrealistic to believe that a senior lawyer of Marapana's stature was unaware of this complicated situation when he assumed duties as the Law and Order Minister.
The other important element of the Avant Garde controversy was the statement he made in Parliament. It was this statement that plunged Marapana into a major crisis leading to his resignation. Some political observers said Marapana walked into a trap, unknowingly, by making that special statement in Parliament.
Marapana meets Prime Minister: Telephones President
Before tendering his letter of resignation, Marapana, on Sunday afternoon, had a special discussion with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. At the meeting, Marapana conveyed to the Prime Minister that he wished to resign from his portfolio to make way for a fresh inquiry into the matter. After listening to the Minister's explanation, the Prime Minister allowed him to proceed with his decision.
On Monday morning, Marapana telephoned President Maithripala Sirisena and informed that he had decided to step down from his position. The minister said he did not want to place the government in an uneasy position by clinging to the ministerial portfolio. The President too gave him the green light and appreciated his courage. Soon after the telephone conversation, Marapana sent his letter of resignation to the President.
It is now in the grapevine that Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake is tipped to be appointed as the new Minister of Law and Order. But, Ratnayake may not get the Ministry of Prison Reforms, which was also under Marpana. The Ministry of Prison Reforms is likely to be placed under D.M. Swaminathan. However, highly placed government sources told the Daily News on Tuesday that no final decisions had been made over the matter yet.
AG to hire 31 SCs to expedite action against corruption
A tug-of-war has developed between the Attorney General's Department and the country's legislature over the former's inaction on "32 files" with regard to anti-corruption investigations.
As reported in the Sunday Observer last week, Parliament is to summon the Attorney General Yuwanjana Wanasundera over the files containing criminal charges against individuals on which his Department is yet to take action.
The AG will be summoned before the Judicial Oversight Committee, which will be set up in Parliament in January, under the provisions of the 19th Amendment.
A group of MPs - representing both the ruling party and the opposition- who do not have ministerial and deputy ministerial portfolios will serve as members of the Judicial Oversight Committee.
Government sources said there were allegations that the Attorney General had not taken action on 32 cases of which initial investigations had been completed by the Police Financial Crimes investigations Division (FCID) and other law enforcement authorities.
However, the Attorney General's Department vehemently denied allegations leveled against the department.
Commenting on the matter, a senior official from the Attorney General's Department said, there was no deliberate or intentional delay on the part of the Attorney General's Department.
He categorically denied claims that the AG's Department had not taken action on 32 cases of which initial investigations had been completed and said there have been only 23 cases of which nine have been sent back to the FCID for further investigations.
"Out of the rest of the 14 cases, suspects have not been found in four cases. That's where it stands at the moment," he added.
He also pointed out that most investigations conducted by the FCID into financial crimes had been submitted to the Attorney General without carrying out complete investigations. "They have been referred back to to the FCID to conduct further investigations," he said
"Various aspects which are essential to consider before sending out charges have been neglected," the official added.
"There is a dedicated team, led by a Senior Additional Solicitor General, to attend to matters related to the FCID.There are Senior State Counsel and State Counsel to whom cases have been allocated," he explained.
In addition to the existing staff, the Attorney General's Department is in the process of hiring 31 State Counsels to expedite action pertaining to anti-corruption investigations. The senior official who spoke to the Daily News said the human capital issue is one factor that hinders the department's work.
Plans to summon the Attorney General before Parliament has already earned the wrath of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, the country's largest body of lawyers.
The summoning of individuals before Parliament to explain the legitimacy of their acts could seriously undermine the independence and integrity required of such public functionaries, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka stated in a communiqu released on Sunday.
"Whilst the legislative supremacy of Parliament is respected, summoning persons before Parliament to explain the legitimacy of their work undermine independence and integrity and could result in public ridicule," the BASL conferred.
The stand taken by the Bar Association strongly indicates that the summoning of AG before the country's legislature will open a new battlefront for the government.

Morna Nielsen grabs five wickets as White Ferns rout Sri Lanka
Spinner Morna Nielsen grabbed a five wicket bag as the New Zealand White Ferns women's cricket team cruised to a fourth consecutive win over Sri Lanka.
The left arm orthodox bowler had the hapless Sri Lankans under her spell at Bert Sutcliffe Oval at Lincoln on Tuesday.
Nielsen, 25, took five wickets for 21 runs as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 126 in another ten wicket defeat. The Hamilton-based structural engineer, who plays her provincial cricket for the Otago Sparks, snatched the prized wicket of Sri Lankan skipper and opener Chamari Atapattu, who top scored with 56 runs.
Atapattu, who took over the leadership when tour captain Shashikala Siriwardene fractured her thumb in the third one day international, hit seven fours in her 89 ball innings. Only Ama Kanchana, with 31 off 37 balls, offered any real runs support. While Nielsen was the star of the White Ferns' attack, medium pacer Sophie Devine took two wickets for 30.
New Zealand coach Haidee Tiffin rested regular opener Rachel Priest, who had hit two centuries and a 50 against the tourists earlier, but there was little respite for the Sri Lankan bowlers.
White Ferns skipper Suzie Bates and Canterbury stalwart Amy Satterthwaite reached the 127 run target in the 19th over. They brought up the 100 in 62 minutes off 95 balls with Bates 70 not out at the end after hitting 10 fours and Satterthwaite smiting six boundaries in her 49. stuff.co.nz

KATHMANDU,TUESDAY: A court granted bail Tuesday to Nepal's national football captain and four other players charged with treason over alleged match-fixing in World Cup qualifiers, a lawyer for one of the defendants said.
The Special Court has ordered the players to be released on bail, said Nani Babu Budhathoki, representing former national footballer Bikash Singh Chhetri. All five players, including skipper Sagar Thapa and national goalkeeper Ritesh Thapa, have denied any involvement in match-fixing following their arrests last month in the capital.
Prosecutors have sought life sentences for the five, including defender Sandip Rai and coach Anjan KC, after they were charged on Sunday under a 1989 act against unlawfully jeopardising Nepal's sovereignty, integrity or national unity.

Title: Satin Island
Author: Tom Mccarthy
This book was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2015. "A horrifyingly comic novel of ideas with its fingers jammed into the light-socket of the age." (Guardian). "A Kafka for the Google Age." (Daily Telegraph). Meet U. - a talented and uneasy figure currently pimping his skills to an elite consultancy in contemporary London. His employers advise everyone from big businesses to governments, and, to this end, expect their 'corporate anthropologist' to help decode and manipulate the world around them - all the more so now that a giant, epoch-defining project is in the offing. Instead, U. spends his days procrastinating, meandering through endless buffer-zones of information and becoming obsessed by the images with which the world bombards him on a daily basis: oil spills, African traffic jams, roller-blade processions, zombie parades.
Is there, U. wonders, a secret logic holding all these images together - a codex that, once cracked, will unlock the master-meaning of our age Might it have something to do with South Pacific Cargo Cults, or the dead parachutists in the news Perhaps; perhaps not. As U. oscillates between the visionary and the vague, brilliance and bullshit, Satin Island emerges, an impassioned and exquisite novel for our disjointed times.
Title: Napoleon : A Life
Author: Andrew Roberts
Austerlitz, Borodino, Waterloo: his battles are among the greatest in history, but Napoleon Bonaparte was far more than a military genius and astute leader of men. Like George Washington and his own hero Julius Caesar, he was one of the greatest soldier-statesmen of all times. Andrew Roberts's Napoleon is the first one-volume biography to take advantage of the recent publication of Napoleon's thirty-three thousand letters, which radically transform our understanding of his character and motivation. At last we see him as he was: protean multitasker, decisive, surprisingly willing to forgive his enemies and his errant wife Josephine. Like Churchill, he understood the strategic importance of telling his own story, and his memoirs, dictated from exile on St. Helena, became the single bestselling book of the nineteenth century. An award-winning historian, Roberts traveled to fifty-three of Napoleon's sixty battle sites, discovered crucial new documents in archives, and even made the long trip by boat to St. Helena. He is as acute in his understanding of politics as he is of military history. Here at last is a biography worthy of its subject: magisterial, insightful, beautifully written, by one of our foremost historians.
Title: Mammoth Book Of Jack The Ripper Stories
Author: Maxim Jakubowski
Maxim Jakubowski, together with Nathan Braund, edited the bestselling Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper (1999), which has reprinted several times and was reissued in 2008 in a revised and expanded edition. The book focused on the countless theories that have been put forward with regard to the identity of the notorious Victorian serial killer and offered an extensive 100-page section presenting all the known facts in the case. It included 30 essays written by the most famous, often controversial Ripperologists putting forward their own theories. It remains one of the few titles to offer a series of alternative solutions to Jack the Ripper's identity and the truth behind the Whitechapel murders. But how many new theories and identities can researchers come up with In this wonderful collection of brand-new stories, Jakubowski has compiled an extraordinary array of explorations into the identity of Jack the Ripper - this time unabashedly fictional, unrestrained by history and the known facts. Contributors include Carol Anne Davis, Martin Edwards, Peter Guttridge, Barbara Nadel;Alvaro Zinos-Amaro and Sally Spedding. 'Jack the Ripper' has appeared in a number of novels, as the lead character in some, beginning with Marie Belloc Lowndes's The Lodger (1913), filmed by Hitchcock. Authors as diverse as Michael Dibdin, Lindsay Faye, Philip Jose Farmer, Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Alan Moore, Fredric Brown, Ramsey Campbell and Colin Wilson have all used poetic licence to 'revive' the notorious killer. The varied stories in this fantastic new collection continue this tradition with many possible identities put forward, some already suggested by historians, others more speculative, including famous names from history and fiction. Even Sherlock Holmes is on the case!
Title: The Green Road
Author: Anne Enright
A darkly glinting novel set on Ireland's Atlantic coast, The Green Road is a story of fracture and family, selfishness and compassion - a book about the gaps in the human heart and how we learn to fill them. The children of Rosaleen Madigan leave the west of Ireland for lives they never could have imagined in Dublin, New York and various third-world towns. In her early old age their difficult, wonderful mother announces that she's decided to sell the house and divide the proceeds. Her adult children come back for a last Christmas, with the feeling that their childhoods are being erased, their personal history bought and sold. Anne Enright is addicted to the truth of things. Sentence by sentence, there are few writers alive who can invest the language with such torque and gleam, such wit and longing - who can write dialogue that speaks itself aloud, who can show us the million splinters of her characters' lives then pull them back up together again, into a perfect glass.
Title: The New Threat
Author: Jason Burke
In The New Threat renowned expert and prize-winning reporter Jason Burke provides the clearest and most comprehensive guide to Islamic militancy today.
From Syria to Somalia, from Libya to Indonesia, from Yemen to the capitals of Europe, Islamic militancy appears stronger, more widespread and more threatening than ever. ISIS and other groups, such as Boko Haram, together command significant military power, rule millions and control extensive territories. Elsewhere Al-Qaeda remains potent and is rapidly evolving. Factions and subsidiaries proliferate worldwide, and a new generation of Western Jihadists are emerging, joining conflicts abroad and attacking at home. Who are these groups and what do they actually want What connects them and how do they differ How are we to understand their tactics of grotesque violence and online activism Drawing on almost two decades of frontline reporting as well as a vast range of sources, from intelligence officials to the militants themselves, renowned expert Jason Burke cuts through the mass of opinion and misinformation to explain dispassionately and with total clarity the nature of the threat we now face. He shows that Islamic militancy has changed dramatically in recent years. Far from being a 'medieval' throwback, it is modern, dynamic and resilient.
Despite everything, it is also comprehensible. The New Threat provides what you need to know to make sense of this complex landscape. It is essential reading if we are to understand our fears rather than succumb to them, to act rationally and effectively, and to address successfully one of the most urgent problems of our time.

NLD moves towards big election victory in Myanmar
Vote counting continued on Tuesday with Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition party predicting a landslide victory after decades of often brutal military rule.
The National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Suu Kyi, has won 53 lower house seats in the national parliament out of 62 announced so far.
With predictions of a resounding NLD win, questions are being raised over how Myanmar's long-ruling generals would handle a possible election defeat.
The military government handed power to a semi-civilian government in 2011, but the army still dominates politics after decades in power. Twenty-five percent of seats in parliament are reserved for the army.
At a press conference on Tuesday, Alexander Lambsdorff, the chief EU election observer, said "95 percent of the ratings" the European delegation received about the voting process were "very good".
Still, he said, the election cannot be fully called "genuine" when 25 percent of parliament is not contested and automatically reserved for the military.
Election observer Ana Gomes, an EU parliament member from Portugal, said she was "impressed by the calm and peaceful atmosphere" during voting. But she called on Myanmar to amend its constitution to allow the election of all members of parliament.
Even with a win for her party, Suu Kyi cannot become president, according to the country's constitution as she is married to a UK citizen and her children have UK passports.
The country's first openly contested election in decades on Sunday saw an estimated 80 percent voter turnout.
Yin Yin Htay, 44, a newspaper vendor, expressed happiness over the vote count so far but also concern over the potential reaction from the generals.
"I think the results of the election reflect the real desire of the people in this country," he told Al Jazeera. "We will wait and see if the military and President Thein Sein will keep their promise to transfer power peacefully, as they have been saying in the newspapers that I sell."
Initial results showed the NLD winning seats in its stronghold of Yangon, and even in the capital Naypyidaw, where the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) was expected to win.
Suu Kyi called for the country to remain "calm, peaceful and stable" as it awaited the outcome of the election.- ALJAZEERA

No longer outdated
Historically speaking, Sri Lanka has never grown outdated. On the contrary, this little Isle of our dwelling continues to be historically updated. That has been very much a treasure trove for the men of letters. Sadly though, Sri Lankan English writers seem a bit hesitant to tread that territory. It has a fair share of reasons. History thriller genre demands research - a lot more than its peers. And you need to be well conversant in the island's native language. Ananda Liyanage belongs to this rarely spoken of category. He has authored four voluminous works of fiction: The Legacy, The Deception, The Vengeance and The Prophesy - they cover four significantly controversial periods of history.
Liyanage does not write at a rate. He cannot, for, as he himself admits, that exercise demands a lot of research. That said in repetition, a well researched work keeps history no longer outdated.
Q: Since the release of your fourth novel 'The Prophesy' in November 2012 apart from the short biographical sketch 'Reflections & Reminiscences' in December 2014 you have been silent. What have you been doing during this time
A: I have just finished a collection of detective short stories. The detective did detection in colonial Ceylon during the 30's and 40's. It is now in the stage of being copyedited. Meanwhile I have started writing the next story which is a long story. The detective short stories will be launched in March 2016 the next story in March 2017. The long delay in the release of my books was due to the reason that I realized too late that writing short stories is a different art form altogether and took me about thrice the time that it normally takes to complete a single book of the same size. I made up my mind not to repeat the mistake again of attempting to write short stories unless there was a very strong motive to do so.
Q: Why do you write
A: I started writing for the fun of it. However lately I have been using the print medium to make factual statements about certain historical occurrences which others do not write about as it goes against the preconceived way in which they have been schooled to think.
Q: What is your muse
A: When I wrote my first book 'The Legacy' I did not have any inspiration other than that I received from my sister. I kept on writing for the fun of it. After I finished writing it I did not know what to do with the manuscript. Many people borrowed it and read it.
All of them commented favorably on it. One such friend was an ex colleague of mine at the Commercial Bank who went beyond complimentary remarks and told me how to get it published. He was Prasad Samarasekere a graphic artist by profession and who had acquired a name for himself as a cover designer of books. After release of my first book the favorable comments and reviews that I received became the inspiration for my subsequent creations. So it has been the appreciation of readers which has been my main inspiration.
Q: What kind of books do you like to read most
A: I enjoyed most reading thrillers laced with adventure when I last used to read. This is the genre which I like to write about now.
Q: What are your favourite books
A: By title and author but not exactly in order of preference they are 'Treasure' and 'Cyclops' by Clive Cussler 'Shockwave' by Colin Forbes, 'Tinker Tailor Solider Spy' and 'Smiley's People' by John le Carre, 'Wild Justice', 'The Sunbird', 'Hungry as the Sea' and 'Eagle in the Sky' by Wilbur Smith, 'Breakheart Pass' by Alistair MacLean, 'Landslide' by Desmond Bagley, 'The White South' by Hammond Innes, 'The Holcroft Covenant' by Robert Ludlum, 'Cloak of Darkness' by Helen MacInnes etc. I will stop now as the list is endless. I have only touched on the contemporary writers.
Q: What have you got to tell the worst critic of yours
A: It takes a huge effort to produce a book of the substance and size I write. From start to finish it includes among other things the following. You have to fist design the plot which has to be practical and should fit in to known facts. The plot has to be researched thoroughly to be watertight. Next you have to build the characters to fit into the plot and build up the characters by events and dialog. In all such efforts you have to ensure that the story moves on without stagnation and the reader interest is maintained. The ending of one chapter has to contain enough excitement for the reader to proceed to the next chapter. After the writing is over the finished product will contain close to a million characters with spaces. Then it will go for copy editing to maybe two or three persons. You have to input the corrections made by them and consider the changes suggested by them. In total with these you would have typed over a million characters.
Then there is the printing and launch to supervise. The whole effort might take anything up to from fourteen months to sixteen months. That is a very heavy load of work and responsibility. On contrast the critic has to just walk into a bookshop select the book pay at the sales counter and walk away with it and then sacrifice some of his or her leisure time to read it. What I have to say to them is to be mindful about what the author goes through before you criticize. Remember that an author always welcomes constructive criticism but destructive criticism tends to kill inspiration.
Q: Looking back, do you wish if you could edit your first book
A: Yes. I certainly will copyedit 'The Legacy' before I go for a reprint. I now have three people who do copy editing.
Q: What is your opinion about literary awards
A: I do not want to comment at length on this but only say that I have decided not to make any application for an award or expect any. I am happy when I produce a book that make my readers happy and gives them pleasure in reading.
Q: Out of the award-winning books and popular books, which category appeals to you most
A: In a way none of these categories in itself appeals to me. The story has to contain enough excitement to keep on reading. In my young days when reading was possible I used to read even some large books at a sitting. That is the criteria which appeals to me.
Q: Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating
A: I hardly read now. Even when I do it is to do research for my writing. However I have to sit at a table now to read as I have to rest the book as my hands are too weak to hold it. It was not always like that in the past. In my young days I used to read at every available opportunity. I think my special reading habit was reading while traveling.
I read while travelling by bus to office and back daily. I used to travel a lot mostly by bus as I did not have a car till much later in life. So I let the bus driver do the driving and concentrated on my reading. The shaking of the bus did not bother me and I quickly got used to it.

Obama, Netanyahu hail strong US-Israel bonds after row
US: President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed close US-Israeli ties Monday, during a tightly choreographed White House appearance designed to quiet disputes over Iran and Middle East peace.
Speaking at the Oval Office, Obama admitted it was no secret the two men disagreed on how to counter Irans nuclear program, but both sought to end bitter public rancor and focus on areas of cooperation, including a $30-billion-plus military deal.
The designed-for-television display of cordiality signaled Obama and Netanyahus willingness to avoid unnecessary drama in the last 12 months of working together.
Obama -- who leaves office in early 2017 -- offered the combative Israel Prime Minister a lengthy handshake and hailed the extraordinary bond between the two countries.
Obama said Israels security was a top foreign policy priority for his White House.
Officials told AFP the deal will include the sale of advanced US weapon systems, perhaps including hi-tech F-35 jets, precision munitions and V-22 Ospreys.
The deal will only come into effect after a current accord expires in 2017.
We have closer military and intelligence cooperation than any two administrations in history, Obama said.
Netanyahu reciprocated by trying to bury suggestions -- fuelled by his own re-election campaign comments -- that he does not support the creation of a Palestinian state.

Pakistan, Sri Lanka need to diversify trading patterns - Pakistan Federal Minister

The Commerce Minister requested the Prime Minister to ease visa facilities and issue multiple visas to Pakistani businessmen and investors to facilitate their travel to Sri Lanka on regular basis.
The minister also informed the Prime Minister that Pakistan, with more than 50 sugar mills and ability to produce sugar machinery, is in a position to invest in Sri Lanka to develop its sugar sector.
The two sides also agreed to further strengthen the bilateral economic cooperation between the two countries especially in cement, sugar, higher education and pharmaceutical sectors.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe expressed the commitment of his Government to further strengthen the already strong relationship between the two countries.
While appreciating Pakistan's support to Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister said that Pakistan has been extending all out support to Sri Lanka at bilateral and international forums.

A poetess's plight
Gajaman Nona was a famous Sinhala poetess who lived during the Dutch and the British Colonial periods. She was born in 1746 in Kollupitiya. Her real name was Dona Isabella Cornelia. Her father Don Francisco Senaratna Kumara Perumal was a government servant and he predominantly worked in Matara District. Therefore she grew up in Matara.
From very young age Cornelia showed her aptitude in poetry. She had the ability of reciting impromptu Sinhala poetry in appropriate occasions. She studied under the famous Karatota Dhammarama Thera in Weragampitiya Temple in Matara. Cornelia was a bright student and she had exceptional talents in language.
During that time period girls' education was not very much tolerated, also co-education in temples was prohibited. Therefore young Cornelia had to disguise herself as a boy to receive the education from Dhammarama Thera. However later she revealed her true identity and asked for forgiveness from Dhammarama Thera.
According to Mahagama Sekara the modern Sinhala poetry began from Matara era and Gajaman Nona (Dona Isabella Cornelia) was one of the pioneers. She is best remembered as a romantic poetess who had outstanding language skills and poetic ability. Her talents were profoundly appreciated by Sir John D'Oyly- the British Colonial Administrator. Sir John D'Oyly bestowed a land in Ambalantota to Gajaman Nona's in appreciation of her poetry. This land became known as Nonagama.
Gajaman Nona wrote narrative poems. One long narrative poem titled Dedi Soka Malaya contained 206 verses. In addition Denipitiye Nuga Ruka Vanuma (the banyan tree in Denepitiya), Poetical petition to Sir John D'Oyly became popular among people. The poetry of Gajaman Nona is characterised by human emotions, romanticism and eroticism. Also women attitudes were marked in her poems sometimes challenging patriarchy.
In a way Gajaman Nona was a revolutionary who challenged the Victorian society. She had liberal ideas and Gajaman Nona was advanced than the women of her era.
She was beautiful and intelligent, also had a charming personality. She dressed elegantly and the aristocrats adored her. Elapatha Mudaliyar of Ratnapura District wrote to her constantly in attractive verse. She became the brightest star among the Matara poets. Poetesses Ranchagoda Lamaya and other poets were envious of Gajaman Nona's glory and started spreading rumors about her. Gajaman Nona replied them with witty and sardonic poems.
She got married in very young age to Thalpe Merenchegei Garadiya Arachchi but he died within two years. She became a widow at about twenty two. After a few years, again she was married to Hendrick Siriwardena Wijaya Wimalasekera. Less than eight years her second husband died leaving young Cornelia with four little children. Gradually life became an immense struggle for her.
In 1801 her father Don Francisco Senaratna Kumara Perumal succumbed to an elephant attack. It was an unbearable devastating event in her life. However her poetic activity did not come to an end. She used poetry to express her grief and emotional pain.
In later years Gajaman Nona was stricken by poverty. The premature deaths of her children left her immensely sad and destitute. She became isolated. Probably she suffered from Major Depressive Disorder. Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness started hounding her. She became utterly disheartened and took her own life in 1814. She was 57 years old at the time of her death.

PSYCHO-ANALYSIS OF A TURBULENT MIND
If this is a mind gripped in moral sin, (so says the puritans) then it is a life imbibed in the intensity of ardour to oneself. Or to put it across more meaningfully; the one who is in love with him self that led Dorian Gray not as much to assess to what the end would be.
Look at it more positively;
When a strong evil power force him to be in full control of his life and transit his soul to a 'living' picture where it would take on years he leave behind. The story dose not indicate how he manipulates such a miracle.
Was it a turbulent mind or mesmerizing effects that confronting him as found in the pages. From the offset, the story looks simple but the deep dark secret that lay is incredibly challenging. Whatever the reason is, it is best left for a psychologist to determine the process of a vibrating restless mind; resplendent with the most beautiful physique and charm a man could wish for which a modern psychologist might find incapable of disentangling unless he puts his subjects under hypnotism.
But then what happens when he wakes up 
Much of the story is drawn from ambition to challenge or 'best' life and declare his power above God or Creator or fall partly in line with the theory of evolution as discovered by Darwin that leads to cases like these even if they are fiction in the eyes of psychologists. The story begins in the raw expansive world of tension, chroniclyising the tragedy of young Dorian Gray born a scion to a riches who taste luxury at its best but left with few friends for company. But the vitality and strength of character makes him the ruler of his fate as well as that of a painter and scientist. with telling account of his momentous decisions and growing menace, he becomes a threat to those who love him. Dorian Gray rise to be the man of the moment and the citizen of the world. The confronting years under terrible pressures defining the course of his life, this 'drama' baffles science with his retaining power of age.
How ruthfully he kills ' his love.............. so akine to Hamlet who ruthfully 'drives' Ophelia to her death even though under different circumstances, is a matter of comparison.
Building his personality on the foundation of fantasy, Dorian Gray's story can be anyone's story in different shapes and male ego. With great psychological perception, one can examine the milieu in which he was shrouded, ambition to stay young on borrowed time. The volatile force that scourged his mind was his own seeking in which he wallowed. No where does it state that he attempted to peep deep into the insights that he struggled to achieve, ultimately. He was the architect of his own doing. Many who read his classic will tend to dismiss this as an agonistic visionary in today's context of literary concept that are realistic than those that emerged from perceptive power of idealism contrary to philosophers who cease to believe that this could be achieved during phase of time.
Would you
The greatness they look forward to that Oscar Wilde experienced, never for a moment imagining to what heights this classic would impact the reader with the story he leave behind.
This study of a very normal man in turmoil with his soul given to the devil to dissect while in control of his senses with a magnificent body for post-mortem, and who had the ability to flaunt to incredible imagination which stunned his readers. With a 'Narisscian' quality to wade through life and dominate the few who rotated around his life to what he wanted to be; the people who loved him, became the very people whom he destroyed at the end both physically and mentally.
Dorian Gray is the dream of any young girl but he remained the youth he fell in love with himself and tried in vain to cheat life at its own game at the marathon end and who literary acceded with a grotesque finale.
Ever since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray I was intrigued by human behavior.....to what extent a little mind could cope with and end in explosion. I am still at loss as to how Oscar Wilde handled a repulsive mind seeped in human drama; the pathose, anguish, passion, ardour and intensity imbibed in a painting that he presumed would never grow with age while the rest of the world around his idol, remained blossoming manhood. But the frustration it caused its creator, never did explain to me when I read the book over and over again in the decades that followed.
However, my curiosity did not kill the cat when I re-read it once again a few weeks back after brushing away the dust it had collected on its cover, staring at me, the face could well have been my dream man.
My persuit did not end there but continued to stretch over years to nose-dive into what 'gay' meant that surrounds people, celebrities and in the case of Oscar Wilde, there is a hint of it attached to Dorian Gray who falls in love with himself and reflected in the painting. Later, we were to learn about Oscar Wilde's gay activities that miserably led to his death. I was able to view these bearings more dispassionately. Some where in the recess of my mind I had an abhorance for gay people, especially the famous guys I met globe-trotting officially. I could never open up to them on their subjects. There was always the withdrawing point from where I had to cease even from a world renown literati.
After reading it again just few days ago, I felt miserable at my inability to understand why they are so near but faraway. Oscar Wilde needs to be looked upon as a wondrous human though lost at crossroads of human passion. If he was alive and kicking today and wrote his classics, he would have been hailed in higher esteem as the genius whose texts could have been sold in million because it is the fashion of the day for celebrities to be gay. He was born far behind time.
Dorian Gray was the son of love and death.
The end.
'Francis was pale as a ghost. Still, the coachman and the footman crept upstairs. The policeman and other servants followed. They knocked on the door but there was no reply.... Finally they got on the roof and dropped on to the balcony and kicked in the windows.
When they entered, they found a splendid portrait of the 20-year-old Dorian Gray with all his youth and handsome features intact. Lying on the floor was dead man with a knife in his heart. He was wrinkled and horrible to look at. It was not until the servants examined the rings on his aged fingers that they realized it was their employer.
Dorian Gray had changed places with his own painting (exits the enigma)

Purawesi Balaya Organization take Wijeyadasa and Tilak Marapana to task
Ministers Wijeyadasa Rajapakhe and Tilak Marapana came under fire yesterday by the Purawesi Balaya Organization in view of their conduct over the Avant Garde issue.
Purawesi Balaya (People's Power) Convener Joseph Stalin said Justice Minister Rajapkshe and former Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana have acted out of line and contradicted collective Cabinet responsibility as with their recent statements made about the Avant Garde floating armoury.
As with their statements, both Rajapakshe and Marapana intimated that there has been no evidence to pursue a case against the operations of Avant Garde.
They have stated so amidst an ongoing Presidential probe on the Avant Garde armouries and its operations in Sri Lankan waters. Ministers Rajapakshe and Marapana have undermined an ongoing Presidential inquiry by way of their conduct, said Stalin.
Besides, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said in Parliament in August that the Avant Garde ship did not possess the proper papers to anchor at the Galle harbour. He said that the Defence Ministry did not have any records of the details of the quantity of weapons therein, or about the countries to which they belonged.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe says that a case cannot be filed against Avant Garde, he explained,  However, it is neither the job nor the decision of the Justice Minister to file legal action against Avant Garde.
He has no say in the matter. It is the the Attorney General's job to look into those possibilities as Minister Rajapakshe is well aware,  he said.
Criticizing former Minister Tilak Marapana for stating that the Police created a scene in the Avant Garde incident to impress the current government, Stalin said,  I wonder if he ever took this issue seriously. "We are talking about military hardware that was loaded on a ship that is anchored in our waters,he added.
The people of this country did not bring this government into power to follow a soft approach towards corruption or on the perpetrators of corruption, he said.
Deputy Solicitor General Wasantha Nawaratna had said that legal action can be instituted against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Damayanthi Jayaratna and Manjula Kumara Yapa in connection with the Avant Garde, he said. It is indeed upsetting to observe that ministers, such as Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, are acting in this manner, he added.

Republicans fiercely oppose Obama plan to shut Guantanamo
US: Congressional Republicans launched a pre-emptive strike Monday against a soon-to-be-released plan by President Barack Obama to shut down Guantanamo that would send dozens of detainees to US prisons.
Time is running out for Obama to make good on one of his top national security priorities: closing down the notorious detention facility, a symbol of the controversial counter-terrorism policies of his predecessor George W. Bush.
The administration has spent months working up a plan that would involve the transfer of roughly 50 of the remaining 112 prisoners to US prisons. The others, deemed less dangerous, would be transferred abroad.
Such an act, Republican lawmakers said, would be in illegal defiance of Congress, which since 2011 has passed legislation banning the Pentagon from using federal funds to bring the detainees to US soil.
The Pentagon is expected to soon release its plan assessing various US sites, spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said Monday. We have a plan that helps achieve the president's goal of closing Guantanamo and we are forwarding that plan to Congress very soon, he said.
Clearly the Congress's help is needed in doing this.
The plan looks increasingly unlikely to pass muster in the Republican-controlled Congress, raising the prospect of executive action, which would ignite a political firestorm. At least four sites are under consideration: the US Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth military base in Kansas; a federal prison in Florence and a state penitentiary in Canon City, both in Colorado; and a military brig in Charleston, South Carolina.

Resolving CKDu problem: Who should do what
Would you tell me please, which way I ought to go from here said Alice.
That depends a good deal on where You want to get to, said the cat. - Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Caroll
Chronic Kidney Disease of uncertain Origin (CKDu) is currently the most serious non communicable disease afflicting farming communities in Sri Lankas dry zone. It was first diagnosed in the mid 1990s in the North Central Province (NCP), and has now been positively diagnosed in six out of the nine provinces in the country. Over 25,000 people are estimated to have died from this kidney disease already. Approximately 1000 patients die from the disease each year and about 2000 new patients seek treatment for end stage renal disease each year at government hospitals. Many times that number may be developing clinical symptoms of the disease and progressing towards end stage renal failure.
The Ministry of Health currently spends over 400 million rupees annually in the management of renal disease (on dialysis, transplants etc). Costing the loss to the Nations labour force defies quantification.
The CKDu problem has been much talked about, dissected and debated on many occasions at several fora, but no cohesive plan of action to deal with it has still been formulated.
This should have been the responsibility of the Presidential task force specifically established to deal with the problem, but for reasons better known to itself, it has still failed to live up to expectations.
The magnitude and gravity of the CKDu problem is such that it clearly needs the concerted action of several actors  government departments, universities, nongovernmental organisatons (NGOs), donors, corporate sector and civil society groups. This article attempts to spell out a few key areas which need to be addressed by various agencies.
The Ministry of health has played a valuable role in the treatment of CKDu patients (through dialysis, transplant programmes and medication) as well as screening communities in endemic areas. While appreciating these efforts, it needs to be recognized that screening programmes designed to detect CKDu in its early stages, have a long way to go. According to reliable estimates, less than five per cent of the population in the North Central region has still been screened. What about the rest of the country
Department of Agriculture (DA)
CKDu appears to be essentially confined to areas where rice cultivation is the primary occupation of the people. As such, farming practices of rice farmers have been long suspected to be connected to the disease. Misuse of pesticides by farmers has been frequently pointed out as a matter needing urgent attention. However, the Department of Agriculture has still failed to revitalize its farmer education programme (extension service).
Banning the import of various pesticides appears to have been the DAs major activity to date. Here too, the authority of its key decision making body (The Pesticides Technical Advisory Committee) has been usurped by politicians resulting in some hasty, misguided actions having far reaching negative impact on the islands tea estates.
Detecting pesticide residues in vegetables and fruit has been long neglected. Does the DA have any clear programme or strategy to address this issue
Water Board
All available evidence clearly indicates a strong association between CKDu and drinking water obtained from shallow dug wells. Analysis of water quality in many of these wells shows a high concentration of Fluoride, and dissolved Calcium and Magnesium salts. Yet, not all wells appear to be bad. There is considerable spatial variation in water quality of dug wells. This would indicate a need to analyze water in all wells in CKDu endemic areas and map the locations using the latest GPS technologies. Is the Water Board equal to this task
A recent COSTI (Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation) report has highlighted the fact that many water purification facilities (R.O. Plants) in Anuradhapura area have been established in locations where there was no need for such purification in the first place! Besides engaging in this wasteful activity, the responsible agencies (mostly NGOs), have been charging rupees one to one fifty for each liter of purified water distributed to poor villagers. Had the Water Board been consulted before embarking on such expensive misadventures, much waste and unnecessary costs could have been avoided.
Universities
Universities have been in the forefront of CKDu research contributing much to our current understanding of the subject. However, the aetiology of the disease is still uncertain, and further research needs to be carried out in an effort to pin point the specific cause.
However, there appears to be a need to assess the current status of research programmes, and identify key areas needing further investigation. Would the National Academy of Sciences address this issue
Shift in focus urgently required
With almost 2000 new CKDu patients joining the ranks of those already receiving treatment each year, there is an urgent need to pay more attention to CKDu preventive measures based on available evidence/knowledge. Providing access to clean drinking water, making health education more effective at village level, and farmer education in the rational use and safe handling of pesticides are some such interventions that need to be implemented immediately.
Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs)
Experience all over the world has shown that NGOs can be more effective than government departments in reaching out to people at the periphery. Sadly, government agencies in our country do not seem to realize this fact, and even the NGOs do not seem to be aware of what they could do in effectively dealing with the CKDu problem.
NGO involvement is essential in dealing with issues pertaining to people in CKDu endemic areas. They can play a vital role in CKDu prevention programmes (providing clean drinking water, improving health education at village level, environmental protection, preventing pollution of water resources and farmer education in safe handling of pesticides). All these activities require close interaction with under-privileged people (a subject that NGOs are good at). NGOs could also assist in counseling and providing psycho-social support to CKDu patients and their families. Many local NGOs tend to be funded and donor driven. Perhaps it is lack of donor support for CKDu related issues which prevent NGOs from playing a more assertive role in reaching out to villagers crying out for help.
Donors
Donors- particularly the large international agencies- tend to be looked upon as Cash cows to be milked as and when the need arises. But if donors are to be really effective, they must ensure that their assistance is properly focused and reaches the people in need. Their assistance is best linked to the NGO sector- particularly those with a proven track record. This should also go beyond provision of mere financial resources, but also address issues pertaining to capacity building of NGO personnel.
Donor assistance is frequently sought in purchasing hardware (like water filtration plants). In all such instances, donors must consider the interests of the ultimate beneficiaries  the rural people. They must not forget the social context of dry zone villagers in prescribing solutions.
They need to be aware of the specific rural context- the conditions under which the people live, and ensure that the equipment provided can be maintained and sustained by the beneficiaries themselves. The history of rural development is replete with instances of misguided high cost imported solutions which are beyond rural peoples capacity to maintain and sustain. Most appropriate solutions tend to be those that are technically effective, easy for rural people to understand and implement, and maintain themselves with minimum dependence on outsiders.
Sustaining development initiatives requires beneficiary participation in the decision making process. NGOs have the most experience in dealing with such activities, and donors may do well to ensure that NGOs funded by them have proven skills and experience in participatory development.
Corporate sector
Recent years have seen a marked increase in the growth and prosperity of the corporate sector in Sri Lanka. Some of them take a keen interest in sharing part of their prosperity through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects. Many such laudable initiatives may be directed towards CKDu prevention programmes.
Civil society
Civil society represents a hitherto untapped resource rich in varied skills and resources, besides possessing much good will. We Sri Lankans appear to be weak in harnessing this potential. Lets make an effort to involve them through better information and more effective community education programmes. The print and electronic media need to play a bigger role in galvanizing civil society to address this (CKDu), and other issues of national importance.

Sammy calls for one last effort from his team
West Indies will return to the venue which holds special memories for them when they confront Sri Lanka in the second T20 International at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
Three years ago West Indies stunned the world when they beat favourites Sri Lanka to win the ICC World T20 title.
Darren Sammy, the West Indies T20 captain is mindful of that victory and is urging his team to live upto those memories and try and win at least one match on the tour which has turned out to be a winless one for them so far.
West Indies lost the two-Test series 0-2 and the three-match ODI series 0-3 and trail 0-1 in the two-match T20I series having lost the first game to Sri Lanka by 30 runs at Pallekele on Monday.
We believe we can be victories in Colombo, a place that is very special to us, said Sammy. It is the same scenario - they defeated us here (Pallakele) in the round matches and then we defeated them in the final, we just have to do it again to level the series.
We believe in ourselves just have to come out again and get the basics rights. It will be good to get some form of success on the tour and go home on a winning note, he said.
Sammy said although his team finished on the losing side that it was a good effort coming from a team that had not played together for quite a long time.
We played the no. 1 team in the world and some of us were quite rusty we have not played T20 cricket for almost 8-10 months, said Sammy. We believe if we bat properly we once chased down 236 runs, we can win.
If we had wickets in hand and built batting partnerships like they (Sri Lanka) did we had a chance. You look at the last six overs the last 4-5 overs the tailenders were batting and 30 odd runs in T20 cricket is two big overs, he said.

[Governor TALES]
Sir Henry Monk Mason Moore
We now come to the phase of the last governor who also went on to become the first Governor General of a self governing Lanka. He was born in March, 1887 to a family who priced education and religion. In fact he was the son of an Anglican Clergyman.
He belongs to that genre of White administrators of the island who served it twice in different capacities. Remember, it was See-Saw time for those qualified to go about at random throughout the expanding empire in various capacities savoring vivid experience. No doubt the elders advised the young, GO East, young man and youre your mark.
Moore who succeeded Sir Andrew Caldecott, and gained the epithets of the last Governor and the first governor general had earlier worked here as a member of the Ceylon Civil Service, .that is from 1910 to 1919 including the first world war years.
He became much acquainted with the people of the island, and was aware of the islands keenness to gain independence and the political developments connected to that aspiration. From the days of the Legislative Council the leaders of the country had been hankering after that aim, even when divided racially.
But the gentleman was suddenly appointed as Colonial Secretary of Bermuda. Then he got promotions as Chief Secretary of Nigeria and then of Kenya, then of Sierra Leone.. But it may be no exaggeration to say, that he still loved Ceylon. So the Colonial office did make a wise judgment when it decided to appoint Moore as governor here when issue regarding the grant of independence was coming to a heady tangle
Those at the imperialist end were in favour of another commission to decide things while those at the colonial end were arguing and quite rightly too that it has had a surfeit of commissions. Anyway the last commission was opted for the Soulbury Commission.
All what happened after this is a tangled history of the activities of the Soulbury commission and Monk Mason Morres concurrent administration in the years 1944-48 (incidentally going on to the Second World War too) things are presented here for clarity sequentially.
22.12. 1944----Lord Soulbury and others of the Reform Commission arrive
1945 Sept. The report of the Soulbury Commission is published 1946 ---State council adopts the Whit Paper embodying the reforms 1947 ----Last meeting of the State Council
D S Senanayaka becomes Ceylons first Prime Minister
1948 Formal announcement that February 4 would be appointed day under the Ceylon Independence Act. 1886 prisoners granted amnesty on this day.
Ceylons first Governor General Sir Henry Monk Mason Moore sworn in.
1950 --- The Lion flag adopted as the national flag.
It should be noted that in 1949 Sir Moore leaves and is succeeded by acting Chief Justice Wijewardena and then by Lord Soulbury. Incidentally a long postscript written by Sir Henry Monk Mason Moore and encased at the end of British governors of Ceylon reveals the affection Moore had for the island.

SL ranked eighth in 'World Giving Index 2015'
Sri Lanka has been ranked eighth in the 'World Giving Index 2015' a global view of giving trends conducted by the Charities Aid Foundation.
It was ranked ninth in the top 20 countries in the four year (2010-2014) World Giving Index, with score and participation in giving behaviours. The survey conducted on 135 countries looked into how each country volunteered time and assistance to those who needed it as well as donated money.
Myanmar was ranked first in the survey while the United States was ranked second and
United Kingdom sixth. Sri Lanka received a World Giving Index Score of 56 percent while Myanmar scored 66 and USA scored 61 percent.
However, Sri Lanka came second in 'Volunteering Time Score with 48 percent in the top 20 while Myanmar scored 50 percent, the United States 44 percent while the United Kingdom scored the lowest in that segment with 32 percent in the top 10.
In another segment of the survey, under 'Donating Money Score' Myanmar scored 92 percent while Sri Lanka scored 59 percent.
It was further reported that following a religious philosophy was also a factor in driving donations, with two countries with a Theravada Buddhist community ranking one (Myanmar) and nine (Sri Lanka).
The 2014 survey further reported that "nine out of 10 people in Myanmar follow the Theravada school of Buddhism, eight under which the lives of the Sangha (ordained monks and nuns) are supported by dana (charitable giving) by lay followers of the religion. This clearly translates into a strong culture of charity, with Myanmar ranked first for donating money and 13 percentage points ahead of the second placed country. Sri Lanka, another country with a strong Theravada Buddhist community, nine also ranked within the Top 10 of the World Giving Index (placed 9th).
According to the survey 69 percent of Sri Lankans follow Theravada Buddhism.
It was further noted that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country did not in most part affect the giving behaviour as only few countries with a very high GDP and considered developed nations making it to the top 20.

Stalled Port City project's impact on Colombo Port to be analysed
The Ports and Shipping Ministry plans to analyse the impact on the Colombo Port owing to the initial construction of the Port City Project which is at a stand still now.
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said they had requested the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry for a feasibility study aiming to determine the impact to the Colombo port since the Port City project comes under the purview of the Megapolis Ministry.
A huge quantum of sea sand has been used for the initial construction of the Port City Project. There is a vulnerability of the sand dunes being washed away to the Colombo Port basin causing a severe impact on the smooth functioning of the port after the project was halted with the political change earlier this year.
"Sand used during the initial stages of construction of the Port City Project to reclaim the sea may wash into the port basin. Therefore, we requested a feasibility study to determine the effects of the Port City Project on Colombo Port," Ranatunga said. The construction company of the Port City Project has taken precautionary measures to prevent the sand being washed away by using a metal cover around sand dunes. However, instead of those temporary measures, there is a possibility that the sand would obstruct the shipping routes and the functions of the jetty, he said.

Two overseas players per team for SLC ELITE T20
World T20 champions Sri Lanka will begin preparations to defend their title won in Bangladesh an year ago with the Elite T20 Championship to be conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket in January.
The tournament which was originally scheduled to take place at the tailend of March has been brought forward as a forerunner to the Asia Cup and the World T20 championship.
The Asia Cup normally a fifty-over affair has been changed into T20 matches as a prelude to the world event. It will be held in Bangladesh from February 24 to March 6 with the World T20 scheduled in India from March 11 to April 3.The Elite T20 championship will consist of five teams sans the fancy names used in past tournaments. They will be called Colombo, Galle, Kandy, Kurunegala and Hambantota.
We've got to build on the cities otherwise there won't be affiliation, said interim committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny.
All these bases will have trainers, physios, managers etc and will have facilities similar to what is available in Colombo. We need to make sure those base are as strong as Colombo.
Ninety percent of our cricketers come from the outstations, we must go to them rather than bring them to Colombo, he said. Wettimuny also stated that they would do something novel by enabling the team sponsor to voice his opinion.
We are clustering the clubs in each of the districts so that we can play them in different teams. Selection of these teams will be made by a selection committee comprising one national selector along with three selectors from the respective districts, Wettimuny said.
We will also make the sponsor to have a say in his team like in the IPL. Each team will also be entitled to have two overseas players for the T20 tournament.

Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera CONDOLENCE MESSAGES
Ven. Sobitha Thera rendered unparalled service towards human freedom
Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera gave the correct leadership and guidance to the Movement to Protect the Motherland when JR tried to implement anti-democratic measures through the Indo - Lanka Accord in league with Rajiv Gandhi. He was courageous enough to take the forefront in the face of shooting by the police against students and the Abhayaramaya to suppress the 1987 May students upheaval, states Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka in a condolence message yesterday.
Ranawaka in his message, said he identified and came to know the late Sobitha Thera during his university days in mid 1980s. The advice given by the late Thero was a great source of strength and support to students who staged student struggles a that time.
He was a great Sangha teacher who rendered an unparalleled service towards human freedom.
The late Thero intervened locally and internationally, to suppress the LTTE after the terrorists launched an attack on the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
He continued his national service even after the defeat of the LTTE, by showing the correct direction to bring about the necessary political and social changes.
At all times he acted in a non violent manner, safeguarding and protecting the honour of the bikkhu robe. He was always able to be on the side of the people without allowing his sasanic and social honour and acceptance to be broken or disgraced due to any politics or political party.

A true Bodhisathva who relentlessly searched for social and political justice
The passing away of Ven. Sobitha Thera, Chief Incumbent of Kotte Naga Vihara and Chairman of the National Movement for a Just Society, has deeply saddened me. We Muslims revered him, honored him and loved him. He was a beacon of light that guided us to hope and security. His very presence made us feel safe to be around when our community was under relentless attacks by extremist elements. We looked up to him to guide us and direct us when we the Muslims found ourselves marooned in a sea of hostility. His passing away I fear, may leave a deep vacuum in our national reconciliation efforts.
Ven. SobithaThera made strident attempts to rid the nation of corruption and venality. His audacious enterprise to restore democratic governance and the rule of law, received the support of all religious and ethnic minorities who claim Sri Lanka as their island home.
His selfless and brave leadership helped us dismantle a corrosive regime that held the nation hostage to the machinations of a cabal that preached corrosive nationalism and marched towards a neo fascist autocracy. In this hour of grief, words fail us in expressing the depth of our sorrow.
Whenever I sought his sage advice, he gave it willingly and diligently. He was a leader and a sage. He was a teacher who explained matters in meticulous detail. He was a teacher who demonstrated with example. Above all, he was a teacher who inspired great confidence. He was a true Bodhisathva who relentlessly searched for social and political justice for all.

Thera was an epitome of excellence
The sudden demise of Most Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera has no doubt, gripped the whole nation into unbearable grief and sorrow.
Ven. Sobitha Thera was a firm believer of good governance and was against all form all racism, violence and religious disharmony. He had to face many obstacles in his endeavor to establish a just society. He was an epitome of excellence and Sri Lanka has lost a truly great son of the soil. May this great soul attain Nibbana.

The All Ceylon YMMA Conference is saddened by the news of the demise of Most Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, Chief Incumbent of the Kotte Naga Vihara at a time when his services are very importantly required by the country.
We reckon him as a fearless, straight forward and principled personality who lived in our country, who steadfastly struck to his principles, just and fair play and was instrumental in installing a government to rule under the principles of Good Governance. He eschewed petty differences and above all, was a front line warrior against hatred towards other races based on ethnicity and religious differences. He raised his vibrant voice against the types of sinister elements that were being molded in the country. He was an eminent Buddhist prelate who gained the respect and honour of all people of our country belonging to all races. In recognition of his services to the country, the All Ceylon YMMA Conference bestowed the coveted Y Personality of the Year 2014 at our last Annual Convention in June 2015. The YMMA Conference takes pride that we were able to present this award on behalf of the Muslim community.
His demise is an irreparable loss to the country and we as countrymen whilst mourning, should resolve more than ever, to continue his cause in establishing the just society that he aspired to create. That would be the biggest honour that we could bestow on him after his demise.

Before attain the bliss of nibbana, We need your come back. To re-dedicate your esteem service
On behalf of my motherland. Dear Venerable Sir Sobitha.

He will be remembered with gratitude by the people of all sections of this country for the pioneering and pivotal role he played in the interests of the country and his contribution to establish social justice on this land, which was unique. He always voiced for a just governance for the common good of the people.
We were hoping that he would play a noble role and encourage a speedy political solution to the Tamil speaking people most of whom are Hindus. Unfortunately, destiny has decreed otherwise.

Waiting for Wendt
To have died in your native land - Ceylon in 1944 and be reborn every year worldwide. How could it be possible But before unraveling this mystery lets go back to May of 1907 when the Amateur Photographic Society of Ceylon organized the Islands first ever photography exhibition where Wendt Senior - Henry Lawrence played a pivotal role.
Until the year 1917 the Annual Exhibition was a feature of the Photographic Society organized together with Art Society of Colombo. If he had been around the Society young Lionel born in 1900 must have attended these exhibitions then.
The exhibition of 1917 would have been held just before he sailed to Britain to read Law.
However, it was after he returned to practice that he realized his calling was different and surprisingly it was through him that the Photographic Society and this long running exhibition was to have an enviable future.
He recommenced the exhibition in 1934 once again as an annual feature. Even though he passed away suddenly in 1944, this is how this photographic colossus and doyen of the art is reborn worldwide every year.
This year marks the 60th year as an international Photographic Competition & Exhibition will be held from November 21 to the 22 at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre, Colombo 07. As a National Exhibition it has been held for 81 years without a break.
To mark the event the society has also organized two concurrent events, an exhibition of photographs by much accomplished Indian Photographer Jayati Saha to be held at the Harold Peiris Gallery at the Lionel Wendt on November 21 and the 22 followed by a series of lectures by prominent photographers on topics such as Wild Life, Portraiture, Fashion and Underwater to be also held on the same days at the Lionel Wendt.
PSSL being the oldest photographic society in Sri Lanka has a rich history that can be traced back to the year 1906, when the Amateur Photographic Society of Ceylon was formed by Henry Lorenz Wendt, the father of Lionel Wendt - lawyer, artist, pianist and photographer, the Society has continued to be at the pinnacle of Photographic activities in Sri Lanka throughout. The Society was reincarnated in 1934 as the Photographic Society of Ceylon at the residence of Lionel Wendt, who continued the work begun by his father, along with a small group of enthusiasts interested in pictorial photography. The Society is housed at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre since 1950's, thus becoming the only society of photography in Sri Lanka, having its own studio, office and darkroom facilities. The year it is conducted in a much broader scale with the patronages of FIAP (International Federation of Photographic Art), PSA (Photographic Society of America) and UPI (United Photographers International), and conducted on a fully digital web enabled platform for entry, submission, payment and judging. The competition is conducted under three main categories of Open Color, Open Monochrome and Nature sections open to photographers worldwide. Nearly 400 participants from 42 countries submitted nearly 3000 images for the competition. The quality of images was of extremely high standard making judging an unenviable task to select the final 700 images. A total of more than 70 medals and ribbons will be awarded to winning entries which will include FIAP, PSA, RPS, UPI and PSSL Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals as well as Honorable Mention Certificates. Of the selected and winning entries 225 are to be displayed at the exhibition and a full color catalog with all the selected images was distributed to all entrants and sponsors. This year the catalog will be designed and printed as a hard cover edition in a much larger size than the previous years to mark the 60th year.
Apart from the many international awards the local entrants are eligible for challenge trophies and awards named after prominent members of the Society such as DCL Amarasinghe Challenge Trophy Best of show, Kalabushana LE Samararatne Challenge Trophy for Best Portrait, BP Weerawardena Challenge Trophy for Best Open Color and Dr SR Kottegoda Challenge Trophy for Best Open Mono.
This will also see the launch of the Lionel Wendt Memorial Trophy for most number of local acceptances.
This year too, the elite judging panel was headed by President Photographic Society of Singapore Goh Kim Hui who joined the panel of Sri Lankan judges as an honorary independent judge.
Local judges included some of the most eminent and expert photographers in the country, namely Henry Rajakaruna MFIAP, Bandu Gunaratne, Mithra Weerakone, Priyantha Amarasinghe, Rukshan Jayewardena, Lakshmnan Nadarajah, Namal Kamalgoda and Ranjith de Silva.
All events including the main exhibition will be held at the Lionel Wendt and will be open from 9.30am till 7.30pm. Those who are interested in participating at the presentation to be held at the Society should get in touch with the Administrative Secretary on 2690940 after November 15 and register themselves. Details of the presentation will be posted at www.pssl.lk by November 10.

Will the cricket probe be another eyewash
When former Sports Minister C.B. Ratnayake came out with the startling remark that Sri Lanka Cricket was the third most corrupt institution in the country behind the Police and Education Departments five years ago he was not far from wrong.
The Minister claimed that he would reveal the financial irregularities and those behind it and that he would replace the corrupt interim committee warning the officials that they could end up in court if they are found guilty of any misdeeds.
The Ministers sensational revelation not only attracted headlines but gave the cricketing fraternity who were looking for a change some hope that there would finally be a clean-up.
But lo and behold 48 hours later, the Minister had gone back on his words and appointed the same cricket officials he had earlier vilified. The Ministers sudden change of stance was easy to understand. He was taken to task by the powers that be that ran the country at the time and had appointed the so-called cricket officials and told in no uncertain terms that he was treading on areas which he should clearly keep away from.
While the Sports Minister's intentions were good he eventually turned out to be nothing more than a mere puppet with no authority. It seemed that the evil that was destroying cricket through corruption, abuse of power, and other misdeeds could not be easily crushed for they always gain the backing to plunder the resources from the very top.
Present Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera will be the cynosure of all eyes as he will be under pressure to act on the probe report submitted by a three-member investigation panel into the activities of Sri Lanka Cricket during the past three years. This investigation was instigated by former Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake when he decided to dissolve the elected body on the grounds of corruption and replace it with a nine-member interim committee headed by former Sri Lanka cricketer Sidath Wettimuny.
The main task of the probe committee was to investigate alleged corruption and abuse of power and authority at Sri Lanka Cricket. The committee comprising lawyers Ravi Algama, Jaliya Bodinagoda and Waruna Mallawarachchi have completed their task and handed over the report to Minister Jayasekera.
The report as usual got the necessary wide publicity that follows such investigations from the media. It revealed that top cricket officials like the Dharmadasa brothers Jayantha and Upali and Nishantha Ranatunga had abused their positions in office with deals that benefitted the respective companies they worked for. The report also goes onto highlight abuse of power, corruption, high handed acts and several other malpractices by politicians and administrators during the last three years.
With the Sports Minister calling for elections to Sri Lanka Cricket on January 3 the former officials who have been named in the report could be contenders for the top posts unless the Minister can find a way to stop them.
However at a recent function the Minister went on record to state the probe report had failed to find evidence or proof of any misdeeds and had not recommended action against any former officials of Sri Lanka Cricket.
We read all the ideas and recommendations of the appointed committee. Nine recommendations have been made. But nowhere in those nine recommendations does the report ask to initiate legal proceedings against a person. The report does not call for specific action, take action against a particular person, or initiate a disciplinary inquiry against a person. It does not present any evidence specifically on any charge or allegation, the Minister was quoted as saying.
As a responsible minister, I will ensure the finding of the real culprits and take legal action against them without assassinating the characters of others. We know clearly that there were some problems and irregularities. Some of those problems were beyond the control of SLC. They were helpless sometimes.
With the Minister promising several amendments to the Sports Law which includes lifting of the controversial four-year rule that deprives an official from holding position after four years, virtually all past officials will be eligible to contest.
After all the time and money spent in exposing the offenders who had brought the good name of Sri Lanka Cricket to disrepute in the eyes of the international cricket world, will the probe become just another eyewash

## Title: Woodcarvers' woe

Woodcarvers' woe
It is amazing to watch a woodcarver with a wooden hammer and a chisel sculpt an elephant within few minutes. We found an amazing wood carving artist while traveling along the narrow zigzag path that echos the hammering and chiseling sound of the traditional woodcarving village, Bope-Poddala Nagarukkaramaya situated four kilometers away from historical city of Galle.
"I learned the craft from the elders of the community. They taught me the basics such as how to hold a chisel. When I could hold the chisel correctly I had to seek more experience," says Abeyratne, now a master woodcarver.
"We never look at a sample design when we do woodcarvings. The art of woodcarving takes the carver to a whole new world of amazing self-discovery that includes creativity, technique, imagination and an inner harmony of accomplishment," he said.
R A Abeyratne has been in the woodcarving industry for 40 years. He believes that the carver delights at the process of shaping wood, into a pre-envisaged mental image of the subject being carved.
"Even if we have a clear mental picture or a sample model in our mind, yet we know that as we carve towards that model it will become our own through creative performance," He explained.
Villagers in Nagarukkaramaya have been engaged in the woodcarving for many generations. A wide range of quality products available here bears enough evidence to the skill and dedication of the villagers. They are skilled in the craft of turning wood into beautiful and useful products. You come across amazing statues made out of rough timbers with the craftsman's spirit.
It's easy to understand why woodcarving in Sri Lanka is such a highly specialized skill when you consider just how much complex, detail goes into every item created. Whether it is a tiny wooden elephant or an enormous wooden structure, the sheer professionalism of the craft cannot be faulted.
This rare timber is fashioned by master artisans known as 'Hadakaraya' into even more miniature elephants used as keytag souvenirs. Thinking shadow, Fisherman and various religious effigies like the Buddha statues, Hindu Gods Lakshmi, Krishna and Ganesh are also formed from this sweet-smelling wood that highlights beauty and grace. More than the basic elephant shape, another one called the 'Hada Aliya' is also sculpted with a larger trunk and a broader arch.
Several stages are required in order to carve such masterpieces. The primary stage is skillfully creating the image that is in the mind of the artisan and then fine tuning its intricate details with special tools. Thereafter, sandpapering and polishing is done to display its finer attributes making it attractive. Every stage of craftsmanship is vital in bringing out the best of the masterpiece so that it is a collector's item when it goes on sale, elaborated Abeyratne.
S A Pradeep Kumara, a young wood artisan from Bope, has been in the field since childhood. He explained how they look forward to a good income during the tourist season. However off season brings trouble as the products lack a proper market. "Earlier we used ebony for our carvings. But today we cannot do that, as ebony is rare and expensive," E K D Wimalasiri, the owner of Wimalasiri woodcarving workshop and showroom, said.
"Now we use red and white wood like 'Pare Mara', 'Mahogani' 'Nadun' and 'Alastonia' and some even colour the wood black to resemble ebony as a last resort," he added.
"We have to face various hardships to find a good market for our products. Only the mediators could get a big profit by buying and selling our products. Sometimes they buy a Buddha statue for Rs 40,000 and resell it at Rs.400,000. Earlier we used to give our products to Laksala. But today we do not, as we have to wait for about six to seven months for payments," Wimalasiri noted
When contacted with reference to this complaint, a senior official from Laksala said that it is a self-funded institution and it is really difficult to buy these products for an advance payment.
"We have to maintain a stock of products worth Rs 400 to 500 million. So without selling these stocks we cannot make payments. Woodcarving is a seasonal business. There is a good market for these products during the tourist season. Off season, it's really difficult to sell these products. Market demand is also varied from product to products," the official said.
National Crafts Council Assistant Director (Southern Province) K M G Kamal said that most artisans work from dawn to dusk and try to sell these products daily as it is the only means of living to them. The mediators come and collect their products daily at a low price. The National Crafts Council provides opportunities to sell their products through trade fairs, but these artisans do not participate as they cannot maintain a stock of carvings.
Even today, despite the shortcomings, Galle's woodcarvers are more involved in taking up after their forefathers and the love for this art handed down from generations remains true in their hearts.
