Late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike revolutionised our political culture. A well-educated and intelligent human being, Bandaranaike also rendered a great silent service for our independence movement, making sure that no blood was shed during the struggle. He held our traditions and values in the highest regard. He was the one who established democracy in this country. Late Bandaranaike also toiled to establish communal peace.

Talks to form a new coalition  under Wiggies leadership
Talks are underway between several Tamil parties in the North to form a new coalition under the leadership of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Vigneswaran by next month, according to former TNA MP Suresh Premachandran.
Speaking to the Daily News, he said the new coalition would be formed as an alternative to the Tamil National Alliance, as the people feel that the TNA had let them down. This coalition is expected to get the support of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), All Ceylon Tamil Congress and other reputed Tamil parties.
It is also reported that while discussions with these parties have commenced, there has been favourable response from them for the formation of this new alliance.
This new alliance is to be formed under the total sponsorship of the Northern intellectuals, university student organisations and the Diaspora, it is reported.
It is said that Wigneswaran would take up the leadership of this alliance after the Northern Provincial Council term ends and it is dispersed.
Premachandran said, Talks are taking place but it is still not finalised. I think there needs to be an alternative to the TNA as the people need a new leadership. The people strongly feel that the TNA has let them down and several issues facing the people that have not been sorted out yet and the powers and functions of the Provincial Council and the TNA leadership does not take up these matters in Parliament. Even the day-to-day resettlement and releasing of lands is also not being addressed. We feel that Sampanthan and group are working with the government and not doing anything to benefit the Tamil People. Hence, we feel we need a strong leadership for the North. We hope to see a new and strong political coalition in the near future, he said.
However, he said there are several parties in discussion but did not disclose exactly how many parties would join this coalition.

Trump blasts Iran, praises Kim at UN
UN: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for Irans isolation while welcoming another former adversary, North Korea, in from the cold in an unabashedly boastful speech to the United Nations General Assembly which provoked laughter from fellow leaders.
Hours before Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was due to speak from the same rostrum, Trump denounced the clerical regime in Tehran for sowing chaos, death and destruction as he defended his decision to ditch an internationally brokered nuclear deal four months ago.
But after stunning the global body with his bellicose language on North Korea a year ago, including a threat to totally destroy Kim Jong Uns state, Trump instead praised his one-time arch enemy for his courage as he hailed progress in fragile peace efforts with Pyongyang.
Since Trump came to power, promising that the worlds most powerful country would follow an America First foreign policy, there have been growing fears about the US commitment to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations.
In his speech at the opening of the assembly, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said trust in the rules-based global order and among states was at a breaking point and international cooperation becoming more difficult, without specifically mentioning Trump.
Today, world order is increasingly chaotic. Power relations are less clear, Guterres told the 193-nation assembly.
Universal values are being eroded. Democratic principles are under siege, he added just minutes before Trump was to take the podium.
Trump however robustly attacked the globalist view of the world and vowed that America will never apologize for protecting its citizens.
He said that the UN-backed International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority and said that his administration -- which has recently choked off aid to the Palestinians -- would only support our friends in the future.
Boasting that his team has achieved more than any administration in the history of our country, Trump was met with laughter, highly unusual in the solemn General Assembly.
I didnt expect that reaction, but thats okay, Trump responded.
But the most closely watched passage of his speech came when he turned to Iran.
We cannot allow the worlds leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planets most dangerous weapons, Trump said, in an allusion to Tehrans support for Islamic militant movements such as Hamas and Hezbollah.
We cannot allow a regime that chants Death to America and that threatens Israel with annihilation, to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on Earth, he said.
We ask all nations to isolate Irans regime as long as its aggression continues.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, addressing the assembled world leaders later, sharply criticized Trumps decision to withdraw from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran. He said he had no need for a photo opportunity with Trump and suggested the U.S. Presidents pull back from global institutions was a character defect. Confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength. Rather it is a symptom of the weakness of intellect - it betrays an inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world, he said.
What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfillment of obligations, Rouhani said. - AFP

World Rugby examining models for Test tours shake-up
Sydney, Wednesday: World Rugby said it is "examining models" for the annual Test windows from 2020 on Wednesday, signalling a potential shake-up following reports of a new world league for national teams.
The world body is looking at "ways to inject further significance and excitement into the July and November windows and optimise the commercial model for all", a statement said.
Currently, teams tour rival nations during the Test windows, but World Rugby vice-chairman Agustin Pichot is reportedly pushing for a 12-team annual competition, along the lines of football's just-launched UEFA Nations League.
"I believe that the time is right and the opportunity exists to do something really impactful that injects further excitement, significance and value into international rugby between Rugby World Cups for the benefit of all," World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said following an executive committee meeting in Sydney.
"In line with this objective, we are examining models to maximise the potential of the July and November windows... and create an annual programme of meaningful matches that will unlock new markets, attract new fans and grow commercial revenues for all, while maintaining player welfare imperatives."
All tier-one and "several" tier-two rugby nations will now take part in discussions within a newly convened professional game committee, the statement said.
Any changes could meet opposition, with England's Rugby Football Union -- which profits greatly from hosting internationals -- "perplexed" at the prospect of wholesale reforms, a spokesman told The Guardian.

Yameen resists  freeing Maldives  political prisoners
THE MALDIVES: Outgoing Maldivian strongman Abdulla Yameen is delaying freeing high-profile political prisoners despite calls by his successor for their release, the opposition said Wednesday.
Shortly after his shock defeat in the presidential election on Sunday, Yameen freed five prisoners. But scores of others -- including Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, his estranged half-brother and former president-- remain incarcerated.
We expected president Gayoom to be freed on Monday. Courts brought up administrative issues and put off his release for Tuesday and yet nothing happened, a spokesman for his DRP party said.
We understand reliably that he (Yameen) is mounting pressure on the Correctional Services not to release the political prisoners, the spokesman added.
There was no immediate comment from the government.
The DRP spokesman said Yameen was unwilling to give up power without a fight and appeared determined to hold political prisoners till his presidential term ends on November 17. Yameen, who jailed or exiled most of his rivals during a turbulent five-year term, was unexpectedly beaten by opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Solih, who struggled to gain coverage from a media cowed by Yameen, immediately urged the ousted president to free all dissidents.
Opposition lawmaker and former police chief Abdulla Riyaz and four others were released by the Criminal Court in the capital Male on Monday.
They had been held indefinitely following an alleged plot to impeach Yameen in February that saw dozens detained.
Gayoom, the countrys longest-serving leader, was among several political prisoners brought to Male from their prison on the dreaded Maafushi island to lodge appeals against their sentences. But they were turned back.
Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives for 30 years before its transition to democracy in 2008, was among those arrested during the February crackdown in the Indian Oceannation.
He was sentenced to 19 months in prison for obstructing an investigation into an alleged plot to oust Yameen. Yameen, suspecting a plot to impeach him, in February declared a state of emergency, arresting top judges and a host of others.
The UN called the purge an all-out assault on democracy. Gayoom also faces a separate charge of terrorism, along with Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Supreme Court Justice Ali Hameed. That case is still pending. Solih had the backing of a unified opposition, including Gayooms DRP.
The president-elect garnered more than 58 percent of the popular vote in the archipelago nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims, a popular tourist haven known for its white-sand beaches and pristine waters.
Yameens rule dented its image as a honeymooners paradise and attracted alarm abroad. The US and EU had threatened financial sanctions unless the presidential poll was free and fair. - AFP

DMK, Congress responsible for  violence against Sri Lankan Tamils
The DMK and the Congress were fully responsible for the genocide of a large number of Tamils during the final phase of the Eelam war in Sri Lanka, and should be booked for war crimes, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said here on Tuesday.
Speaking at a protest meeting organised by the AIADMK to highlight what the party alleged was the role played by the DMK and the Congress in the massacre of innocent Tamils in Sri Lanka, Palaniswami said the tragedy occurred only after Karunanidhi, who was then the Chief Minister, ended his fast within three hours, claiming that a ceasefire had been declared in the island nation.
Emphasising the need for reviving this issue, Palaniswami said many were not aware that the then DMK-Congress coalition government at the Centre had played a major role in the killing of innocent Tamils.
The decisive role played by the rulers at the Centre back then came to light only after former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa made public the secrets regarding the assistance provided by the Indian government to his country in the final stages of the conflict, during his recent visit to New Delhi, the CM said.
He said the AIADMK was planning protest meetings across the State with the twin objectives of drawing the attention of the Centre and of the international community to the betrayal of the Tamil community by the DMK and the Congress.
Before the commencement of the protest meeting, AIADMK MPs and MLAs, along with the rest of the gathering, raised slogans against the DMK and the Congress

Abe mulls summit  with N. Korean leader
UN: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a longtime hardliner on North Korea, said Tuesday he was willing to meet Kim Jong Un after the once reclusive leaders historic summit with US President Donald Trump.
Abe, who one year ago warned at the United Nations that the window for diplomacy with North Korea was closing, took a more open but still cautious tone in his latest address to the world body.
But he said that any summit would be devoted to resolving a decades-old row over North Koreas abductions of Japanese civilians -- a deeply emotive issue for much of the Japanese public on which Abe built his political career.
In order to resolve the abduction issue, I am also ready to break the shell of mutual distrust with North Korea, get off to a new start and meet face to face with Chairman Kim Jong Un, Abe said in his UN address.
But if we are to have one, then I am determined that it must contribute to the resolution of the abduction issue. He stressed that no summit was yet in the works -- and appealed to Kim to show his own readiness. - AFP

ADB, HNB partner to provide US$20 mn for Microfinance
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesteray signed an agreement with Hatton National Bank (HNB), under ADBs Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program, to expand local currency lending and provide guarantees of up to $20 million to the microfinance sector in Sri Lanka.
The agreement was signed by ADBs Private Sector Financial Institutions Division Senior Investment Specialist Sabine Spohn and HNB Deputy General Manager - SME & Midmarket Jude Fernando at a ceremony in Colombo.
We are excited to partner with HNB, an established player in microfinance in Sri Lanka, said Spohn. Our partnership will help further expand the Microfinance Program, which has already facilitated more than $846 million in local currency loans across the region since 2012. Together, HNB and ADB will improve access to financial services to even more low-income families and small-business owners, especially in rural and remote areas in Sri Lanka.
Currently, many microfinance institutions struggle to access funds for growth from the commercial market to meet the demands of clients. Only approximately 17% of women have access to formal financial services in Sri Lanka. Through the Microfinance Program, ADB aims to fill market gaps by sharing risks with commercial banks to promote local currency lending to these institutions. This helps mitigate microfinance institutions exposure to foreign exchange risks.
This collaboration represents another key step in HNBs strategy to expand service to the low-income population, build on our in-depth experience in Sri Lanka, and further expand the banks support to the microfinance segment, said Mr. Fernando.
Backed by ADBs AAA credit rating, the Microfinance Program provides risk sharing and guarantees to international and local partner financial institutions. Since 2012, the Microfinance Program has supported more than 4.47 million microfinance borrowers, who are predominantly women, primarily in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Myanmar. To date, more than $440.73 million private sector co financing has been raised through the program.

Give further demonstration of their fast rise in world cricket
Afghanistan tie with Asia Cup champs India
DUBAI, Tuesday  Afghanistan further demonstrated their fast rise as a one-day cricketing nation when they ended their Asia Cup campaign with a thrilling tie against defending champions India in their final Super Four match played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium here Tuesday.
The game was nicely set up by opener Mohammad Shahzads blazing 124 followed by Mohammad Nabis all round performance (64 and 2/40) as Afghanistan fought till the end to deny India a win which at one stage they looked like achieving following an opening stand of 110 between Lokesh Rahul (60) and Ambati Rayudu (57).
Chasing 253 for victory India required seven runs off the final over and Afghanistan one wicket. With Ravindra Jadeja at the crease the odds were heavily on India securing the win. But after the scores were tied off the fourth ball Jadeja mistimed a drive off the fifth ball bowled by Rashid Khan and the catch was held by Zadran at midwicket for the match to end in a tie.
Afghanistan players celebrated as if they had won the match while India were left shell-shocked on how they were deprived of victory. It was a game they should have pulled off but couldnt thanks to some gritty display on the field by Afghanistan who never gave up trying.
Afghanistans captain Asgar Afghan said: It is really a proud moment for me and my team, because we have played super cricket in this Asia Cup, winning the first two games in the first round and then qualifying for the Super 4. Here we finished two close games and we were unlucky we couldnt finish with a win in the last two matches. But the way we have finished today I think I am feeling proud and the credit goes to the players for the way they have played in the entire tournament. It shows the consistency and commitment of our performance that we have shown in this tournament.
I am very happy and satisfied, it is also an important moment in history for Afghanistan because we have never played like this in the Asia Cup before. We were unlucky not to qualify for the final, but we hope we will do that next time.
Afghanistans total of 252-8 was earlier set up by Shahzad the stocky Afghan opener who had never scored an ODI century against an established Test side, but yesterday he put that record straight with a blistering innings of 124 off 116 balls.
Coming to this game Shehzad had four ODI hundreds but against lesser strong opponents  Netherlands, Canada, Scotland and Zimbabwe but yesterday was a special day where he showcased his talent with aplomb to take Afghanistan to a total of 252 for eight wickets against an India side that was sans many of its stars who were rested for this game as they have already qualified for the final.
The Afghan innings was entirely dominated by Shahzad whose batting resembled that of a modern day Duleep Mendis, the former Sri Lanka captain - stocky with powerful arms to execute sixes with panache.Shahzad gave one chance at 49 when Rayudu failed to hold the catch offered at mid-off off Kaul that saw him reach his half century off 37 balls. Then at 93 he won a review after he was given out caught behind off Khaleel when replays showed the ball coming off his shoulder.
Nothing could deprive Shahzad from reaching his century which he did with a flick of his wrists to find the fine leg boundary for his tenth four in addition to hitting six sixes off the 88 balls he faced.
When he finally holed out to long-off Shahzad had scored 124 out of his teams score of 180 and his innings comprised 11 fours and seven sixes. Shahzad dominated an opening stand of 65 with Javed Ahmadi whose contribution was a mere five runs off 30 balls, after Afghanistan had won the toss and decided to bat first.
But once India broke through with Ravindra Jadeja having Ahmadi stumped by MS Dhoni the Afghanistan innings caved in as they lost four wickets for 17 runs. Jadeja and leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav caused the slide by picking up two wickets apiece as Afghanistan slumped from 65-0 to 82-4.
However a 50-run stand between Shahzad and Gulbadin Naib (15) lifted them to 132 before Naib was dismissed by debutant fast bowler Deepak Chahar giving him his maiden ODI wicket. A further stand of 48 followed between Shahzad and Mohammad Nabi before the formers dismissal. But Afghanistans batting did not cave in and with Nabi scoring a rapid 64 off 56 balls (3 fours, 4 sixes) they batted out the 50 overs to set India with a challenging total against their three-prong spin attack.
Afghanistan has been the most consistent team in the tournament with totals in excess of 250 in all their matches except against Sri Lanka when they scored 249.
India decided to test their bench strength by resting key players skipper Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and Yuzvendera Chahal and giving a debut cap to 26-year-old right-arm medium-pacer Deepak Chahar.
Former captain Dhoni took over the captaincy to lead his country in a record 200 ODIs.

BOOMING COLOMBO PORT AND 70TH WORLD MARITIME DAY
It is a delightful fact. The passing of several milestones by overcoming various challenges throughout her rich history, the Port of Colombo has achieved the global standards on safe maritime trade and shipping industry. No doubt, this immense contribution to the maritime trade is enriching the nation. It is remarkable and astonishing.
As we have featured here in this issue the first half of the year, the Port of Colombo has recorded the highest container growth port in the world. This humble and courteous achievement is the result of the collective commitment by all human resources supporting the Port of Colombo utilized and managed through unparalleled professional skills of the current chairperson of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority as well as the governing political leadership on the subject in the country.
At the same time, globally, we are celebrating the seventieth world maritime day on September 27 under the theme of our heritage  better shipping for a better future. Objective of this years day, we as a common community are focusing internationally on, an opportunity to take stock and look back, but also to look forward, addressing the current and future challenges for maritime transport to maintain a continued and strengthened contribution towards sustainable growth for all.
While issuing the statement on the forthcoming occasion of the world maritime day, International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Secretary- General Kitack Lim observed and predicted that IMOs heritage over 70 years has been to drive improvements in shipping to achieve a better world today. Our challenge for the years to come remains  to work in collaboration with all stakeholders to create better shipping  for a better future. What we have learned from history is that the safe maritime trade is all about genuine collaboration and collective efforts in achieving desired goals together. It is all about committed teamwork.
It is needless to explain to us Sri Lankans of this island nation, the importance of maritime and the potentialities we as the centralized nation within the mainstream maritime routes have earned. Being geographically an important strategic location and also the safest from all sorts of threats including weather condition and natural uncertainties, Sri Lanka and her juridical sea area is nuclear to safe maritime trade.
Today, the Port of Colombo is witnessing the genuine path to prosperity of the nation and the paving of the way to understanding the importance of overcoming challenges prevailing due to the high waves of the seas.
As Aristotle Onassis known as Ari, one of the best-known shipping magnates, once said, We must free ourselves of the hope that the sea will ever rest. We must learn to sail in high winds. We believe that the secret behind the achievements that the Port of Colombo gained is because of her genuine commitment in learning and professional capacity in implementing the strategies to sail in high winds for the benefits of the people in the country.
As a country that overcame from one of the most deadly civil wars on the planet, Sri Lanka has stepped forward and is proving the potentiality as the nation in developing and achieving goals aimed towards enriching the general public.
No one can deny that the maritime trade as the lifeline of the nation is playing a pivotal role. Hence, the Port of Colombo as the central port in the island is substantiating the unprecedented caliber in safe maritime trade while deepening confidence in the stakeholders.
The present management of Port of Colombo has affirmed by action the importance of collective collaboration while placing the professional virtue in all concerned, to stand on common ground confidently. This import step has cleared the dark clouds in the sky to make visible the stars of hope in maritime trade in Sri Lanka.
Recently that all three container terminals, Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT), and Colombo International Container Terminals ( CICT), operating in the Port of Colombo committed themselves to a Memorandum of Understanding to act together to aggrandize the common goal towards a vibrant future.
In his remarks about the event, Dr Dissanayake, Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority states that, this is like a shipping alliance. We will compete with each other; but we will also cooperate with each other in order to ensure a better service for clients. So this is moving from competition to co-competition.
Despite all the challenges and the growing competition of the region, the Port of Colombo would be able to achieve historic volumes, he said. As the chairperson correctly predicted, the Port of Colombo is witnessing the growth of container handling by the terminals in the Port while shining in the maritime trade.
Meanwhile, staggering steps have been taken by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in adopting the anti-corruption and zero-tolerance policy aimed at cleaning up the trade. The meeting co-chaired by SLPA Chairperson Dr Dissanayake and Director General of Sri Lanka Customs Mrs P. S. M. Charles, focused on issues like the anti-corruption and zero tolerance policy, and detained containers, introducing a digital signature and electronic delivery order system.
One single step towards vanquishing the bad practices that are tarnishing the reputation of public institutions is not only revolutionary but also the registers a memorable contribution as a lesson to be learnt by generations to come.
Apparently, there is a long route to sail. The prevailing challenges are immense. As an American author John Shedd penned in his work titled, Salt from My Attic, a ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.
Meanwhile, the head of IMO said, challenges in major aspects of international shipping  including ship design, construction, equipment, crewing, navigation, operation, and disposal are adverse in current situation. Challenges prevailing in these areas have to be addressed adequately to be overcome through collective commitment.
Moral and ethical responsibilities for healthy shipping and maritime trade are vested upon every stakeholder from a fisherman who is fishing in the Palk Strait or elsewhere to shipping agent who is the driving force behind the loading and unloading, not millions but billions of containers. So then every nation bounded by maritime trade shall not only engage in healthy and environmental protective shipping and maritime trade but also be the core partner of protecting and promoting each others heritage.
The Port of Colombo is booming while maintaining these notions to enrich not only the nation but also maritime trade as the most important subject on the planet.
Lets protect and promote our heritage while engaging in better shipping for a better future for all humanity.

CBSL must intervene to curb rupee fall - Minister
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) media spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe called on the Central Bank to intervene to stop further depreciation of the rupee.
Although exporters are benefited by the depreciation of rupee, the import sector will be hit hard and increased prices of imported commodities will badly affect the consumer, he said addressing the weekly-press briefing at SLFP headquarters yesterday.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena had also suggested import substitutions for goods and foods that can be manufactured in Sri Lanka. He has instructed Finance Ministry officials to formulate a mechanism to encourage local producers while creating marketing opportunities for their products.
When there was a 12.5 percent depreciation in 2012, the Central Bank intervened and stabilised the rupee using a part of the foreign reserves. We heard now the CB is also taking steps to stabilise the rupee by using at least a part of foreign reserves and it is good move, he added.

China plans to boost $3.8 trillion digital economy to create more jobs
Chinas state planner on Wednesday called for further advancement in the countrys $3.8 trillion digital economy, saying sectors such as big data and artificial intelligence will become drivers of job creation.
The Chinese economy is in the midst of a long-term restructuring that has seen the decline of low-end industries and the emergence of higher-value factories that make robotics and drones.
China will promote the digital transformation of traditional sectors, driving more workers to switch jobs and improve the quality of employment, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said.
In recent months, Chinese government departments and agencies such as the state planner have been affirming their commitment to Chinas long-term development, which Beijing sees as a means to rely less on trade and other external drivers.
An intensifying trade war with the United States, Chinas biggest trading partner, has obscured Chinas medium-term growth outlook and spells uncertainty for millions of Chinese jobs.
Chinese state media has accused Washington of using trade to suppress Chinas development.
China will make further inroads into areas such as the internet of things, big data, cloud computing and AI, and create more high-end jobs, the state planner said.
The country will also actively attract foreign talent to promote the innovation of its digital economy, the NDRC said.
Chinas digital economy rose 18 percent to $3.8 trillion last year, equal to a third of the countrys gross domestic product , according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.
Hundreds of millions of Chinese people use mobile apps for social networking, entertainment, gaming and shopping.
Urban China is also largely cashless, with mobile payments through Tencents WeChat and Alibabas Alipay the norm.
The NDRC said it will also step up financing support to help grow new industries including drawing funds from capital markets.
Earlier this month, it signed an agreement with China Development Bank, a major policy lender, to offer $14.55 billion in financial support for the digital push.
Digital economy is also expected to help boost agriculture, as part of Chinas ambition to revive rural areas, according to the NDRC.

How to Train Your Dragon 3 will end the franchise
The How to Train Your Dragon franchise is sadly coming to an end after three movies. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, which hits cinemas early next year, will be the last in the series, writer and director Dean DeBlois has confirmed.
We thought about it for a long time and came up with what we think is a bittersweet way to say goodbye to these characters, but the right way, DeBlois told Entertainment Weekly.
The films first trailer dropped back in June and featured Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) having fulfilled his dream of creating a peaceful Viking-Dragon utopia. But the trailer also heard him say, There were dragons when I was a boy, a statement which DeBlois says fans will understand once they watch the film.

This was an increase of 2.5 percent compared to 2017 profit margin.
The Board posted a profit after tax amounting to Rs 1209 million during the first half of 2018 and the reason for the decline in turnover of 2017 was the trade union action carried out by lottery sales agents following the increase in lottery price to Rs. 30 from Rs. 20 as a consequence of imposition of excise duty, without raising their commission.
The DLB has achieved turnover of Rs. 7362 million for the year 2016, while the turnover in 2018 was Rs. 8005 million. If the year 2016 is taken as the base year, the turnover in 2018 indicated an 8.73 percent growth.

## Title: Economics of the ever-normal granary
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, September 27, 2018 - 01:00
Economics of the ever-normal granary
Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, was under British Colonial Rule, prior to1948. It was colonized due to obvious economic reasons-with Ceylon being called the Granary of the East for its lush cultivation, export of rice and other economic potential.
At the end of a lucrative period of business entrepreneurship and ruler ship, the British gave so called Independence to a people who were enjoying independence and prosperity, even before these invasions-to an extent that was then feasible-with possible economic fruition eventually, without any external interference.
How prudent is it to free a caged monkey without getting it used to the wilds So it is-the predicament of this country from forties, fifties to the present day!
This, is not to dwell on the justification or otherwise of colonization-as it is best left for the dead past to bury its dead, but to say that, at the point of this independence in the forties and for a period thereafter up to the fifties, the country was emulated for its economic advancement by other Asian countries, that were far behind us in many ways.
What in deed was the reason for this country to have got literally stuck in the mud from fifties onwards
We have to admit the stark fact that the economy, so prevailing at the time of gaining independence, was manned by the British and the so called cohorts of the British-dubbed with much victorious and triumphalist relish as Kalu Suddas!
This is a historical but stark and stubborn fact involving language, race and religious factors - with multiple facets of disputes that seems to be festering over and over again to the detriment of the country-ending with the recent brutal bloodshed.
Frog in the well mentality
Disputing and battling over historical events, which often happen to be probable opinions of historians, will not bring bread to the table, but sadness, misery and economic decline!
We clearly see the youth of the country emerging from the debris of close fistedness and narrow, or frog in the well mentality. They want jobs with bread on the table!
Let politicians of all hues-blue-green-red or maroon see this fact written large and clear on our walls and act before it becomes too late for that Mighty Unleashing of repressed anger-this time with intellectual vengeance: seventy years of waiting tries ones patience!
The economy that prevailed before we were colonized, first by Portuguese, was not a communist or military dictatorship- it was an economy with an iron fist of Royal dictatorship of a sort. It was certainly not a state owned-communist or a mixed economy-in the style of Corporations and Statutory Boards!
With colonization we transformed into a privately owned Mercantile Economy.
This was no mean feat, although it left a disgruntled trail of animosity towards the then rulers and their so called cohorts!
These frustrated feelings erupted in the fifties after the euphoria of independence in the throes of patriotic feelings and new freedom-not in the least wrong by itself-but in retrospect we see to be hurried and wrongly directed.
The dismaying outcome was that the so far luscious economy, that brought in good foreign exchange, and that was manned predominantly by the so called cohorts of the British, were replaced with Corporations and Statutory Boards. The British and some of the cohorts too, gradually left our shores-for greener pastures!
Hooray to that some might say-but what of the present crisis, frustration and the future
Up to independence, the mercantile sector managed businesses that ran the economy-such as-plantations-insurance-shipping-public bus transport-petroleum-fisheries and a host of other businesses.
With the scrapping of the mercantile sector, sprouted Corporations/Statutory Boards such as-plantation-shipping-fisheries-insurance mineral sands and several corporations which were called with much hope as State Ventures: we now see these were never venturesome except in areas of tenders and commissions-contributing much to the present financial crisis.
Historical happenings
These corporations established hastily and with vengeance-in the Euphoria Fifties-like switch to Sinhala Only in 24 hours, have over the years become a White Elephant and a drag to the country - with the language issue leading to dismay and bloodshed-and those Public Ventures owing to the Treasury Billions, whereas the private sector would have earned much needed foreign exchange.
This switch over could have been done with less haste and vengeance by inviting the more accepted indigenous entrepreneurial mudalalis available at that time - such as bus magnates who did lucrative business.
Continuing to dispute over these historical happenings will not fill our larder-it will only bring further battles and bloodshed!
How we can put our economy back on track should be the gripping issue-not wallowing and debating on our pre-colonial glorious past and the repercussions of Euphoria Fifties.
We have to find solutions fast to the simmering language issue linked in a fastidious way to the declining economic issue, festering from as far off as the fifties-nay thirties!!
It is well to find out who among those uneasy with the country did mischief recently with the Japanese Bank Nomura Holdings with intentions to influence the IMF-a rumour effecting flow of FDIs to the country!
There are three broad categories through which an economy can be controlled and developed-these are;
1. Capitalism or Free Enterprise Much has been in circulation to hate this economic system saying that it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer! This is a perfect conclusion in the context of unbridled capitalism that becomes very harsh to the poor-even with the mantra of eventual trickling down benefits to the poor. It has been proved over the years that this mantra preached by world financiers never came true-due to human greed.
Whilst rejuvenating the economy with private enterprise, the poor and marginalized have to be sincerely given dividends and benefits with private sector profits and production-this-the world financiers, bankers and politicians of all hues, must take note of for their own survival!
It would be a good exercise to consider Chinese private enterprise with state control or Private Public Enterprises-with central control, as now envisaged in Sri Lanka-with state laying down policies: this however is a tricky issue presently for us with FDIs, as beggars cannot be chooses-so we say-hold on to the loud drum beats against private enterprise-until our nose is above waters!
2. Communist or Socialist Enterprise
Suffice to say that both China and Russia, the leaders of Communism and Socialism have crashed-although some senior adherents are still beating that distant drum-as in a trance-and some misguided youth yelling loud-but can do much by directing their energies in the right way-towards state driven private enterprise-let this be a loud call for the youthful JVPs!
3. Enterprises managed by Statutory Boards
The writer has spelled out the outcome of these ventures and will not write on this any further-other than to say these are neither fish, fowl nor beef in the context that these do not provide the military fear of communist ventures nor do they have a profit oriented basis to enthuse the workers and managers.
Sri Lanka has paid the price flirting with all the above mentioned economic systems and is on the brink of collapse unless it is fast tracked with one suitable system that will rejuvenate its economy-preferably with all hues of politicians getting together for the sake of the country!
There will be no perfect justifiable system to satisfy all and, of course no good system will prevail and be successful with corruption rampant in a country!

Englands Football Association agrees to sell Wembley Stadium to US billionaire
The iconic Wembley Stadium, known as the home of English soccer, could be sold to U.S. billionaire Shahid Khan for 600 million pounds ($790.4 million)  if the deal gets full support within the Football Association of England, according to the Financial Times.
The association and Khan have agreed to a deal in recent days, the FT reported on Wednesday, citing several people familiar with the matter. The sale needs approval from the associations 10-member board on Thursday to proceed, but a small number of members have yet to indicate support, according to the report.
While the deal makes economic sense, some board members may be voting with pure emotion to prevent the sale from going through, according to the FT report.
The association didnt immediately reply to CNBCs request for comment. The FT reported that the association declined to comment.
Khan has been in talks to buy Wembley Stadium from the association since April. The Pakistani-American billionaire owns West London soccer side Fulham and the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL football team.

The Korean Embassy in Sri Lanka will open the new residence of the Korean Ambassador and host the 2018 National Day reception on September 28.
The embassy will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Korean government, against the backdrop of the 3rd Inter-Korean Summit in Pyeongyang, the Korean Embassy stated in a release.
It is the first National Day reception since Ambassador Lee, Heon began his new post in January. Ambassador Lee, whose first post abroad was in Sri Lanka in the 1990s, came back as the Chief of Mission.
He will open the new residence at Horton Place.
In celebration of the Korean National Day, the embassy invites team Meraki, the winner of the fourth K-pop Festival organised by the embassy in July, to perform, the release stated.

EU, UNOPS, MEPA beach clean-up
Working together to take action against marine litter, the Delegation of the European Union (EU), United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) of the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment cleaned up the Prithipura public beach in Wattala as part of Sri Lankas coastal clean-up week 2018.
International Coastal Clean-up Day on September 15 kick started a week-long series of beach clean-ups in Sri Lanka. Around 1.59 million tonnes of waste is released into the ocean around the island annually.
Every year millions of tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean,10 per cent of which is marine litter made up of derelict fishing gear. It takes hundreds of years for the plastic to degrade and disintegrate into tiny pieces known as microplastics which are unwelcome and dangerous guests in our food chain.
The EUs Plastics Strategy is translating political commitment into bold action at home and abroad, said EU Ambassador H.E. Tung-La Margue. The EU is playing a leading role in ocean governance, and is helping to build momentum for a global call for cleaner and safer seas. EU Delegations around the world have organised beach clean-up campaigns to mark International Coastal Clean-up Day, and we are happy to be doing the same here in Sri Lanka. Immediate and continuous action is vital to tackle ocean plastic waste to ensure sustainable oceans and fisheries, and to support resilient coasts and coastal communities.
Hanna Singer, the UN Resident Co-ordinator, noted that SDG 14 calls for action that will by 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular, from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.
The UN in Sri Lanka, through its many agencies has continuously engaged in activities focused on ocean and coastal preservation. Our commitment, together with the government, to protect marine ecosystems and biodiversity has been further strengthened through the renewed focus on environmental management in the UN Sustainable Development Framework 2018  2022.
MEPA General Manager Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara said, The waste which accumulates in seas around Sri Lanka is not merely from Sri Lanka; it comes from neighbouring countries. Therefore, a sustainable solution is needed to control the release of waste to the sea. Tackling marine debris requires educating peoplethey must be briefed about matters such as encouraging the reduction of using single use plastics and waste segregation, recycling and beach clean ups. In line with this, MEPA has organised almost 100 beach clean-ups around Sri Lanka during coastal clean-up week, and I thank the EU and UNOPS for being part of this programme.

Ex-Sports Minister unmasks Ranatungas hypocrisy
Former Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara took the bull by the horns for the first time like no one has done before to slam former Sri Lanka captain and present Minister Arjuna Ranatunga for his hypocrisy.
Jayasekera said that nobody had run down the countrys cricket than the former World Cup winning captain himself and alleged that he has more evidence to suggest he (Ranatunga) had connections with bookies.
Jayasekera referred to Ranatunga as fitting the age-old Sinhala proverb that says a prawn with excreta in his brain goes looking for the same bog substance in the head of another prawn.
He made these remarks at a heavily attended press conference held at the Nippon Hotel in Colombo yesterday.
Jayasekera said Ranatunga who is now accusing ex-Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala of connections with gambling was hand in glove with him in the past.
I got to know Thilanga Sumathipala only a couple of years ago but Arjuna (Ranatunga) and Thilanga (Sumathipala) were friends from the 1980s. They were good family friends and had night parties at Thilangas restaurants during the late 80s, said Jayasekera.
They were friends from their school days and Arjuna is the one who helped to bring Thilanga as a vice president to Sri Lanka Cricket for the first time and later he became president and Arjuna was the captain. Was he (Ranatunga) that ignorant not to realise Thilangas connection to the betting industry at that time, asked Jayasekera.
Arjuna accuses me of eating (destroying) cricket. It was the Ranatunga brothers and family that ate cricket. When Sri Lanka entered the World Cup final in 2011 against India, he (Ranatunga) held a press conference in India and declared that Sri Lanka will not win the final. He (Ranatunga) wants the Sri Lanka team to be in the dumps all the time so he could always be the only World Cup winning captain in the country, added Jayasekera.
The former Sports Minister further said that when Sumathipala held office at SLC, Ranatungas younger brother Prasanna Ranatunga was vice president and Nishantha Ranatunga was an Executive Committee member while elder brother Dhammika Ranatunga was Chief Executive Office.
The Ranatunga family was all around Thilanga. He now accuses Thilanga of having connections with bookies. It is not about the country but its personal grudges, said Jayasekera.
They (Sumathipala) and the Ranatunga family fell out when Thilanga the then SLC president removed Dhammika Ranatunga from the post of CEO and they also fought over the sale of television rights issues. This was the reason why the two parties fell out, said Jayasekera.
He said that when Ranatunga was captain he had an insurance company called P and A Insurance which handled players insurance matters which was a huge conflict of interest.

Formulate viable pricing mechanism - SLCPI
Following the depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee against the US Dollar, the Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry (SLCPI) issued a statement calling on the Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) urgently to formulate a viable pricing mechanism for the industry, given that over 85% of all pharmaceuticals are imported and hugely impacted by the rupee depreciation.
Today the Sri Lankan rupee stands in a historically weak position against the dollar and the impact of this massive and unprecedented depreciation is clearly being witnessed across almost every facet of the economy.
While some sectors are able to freely adjust and others like the transport industry which are regulated but still allowed to adjust fares based on substantial increases in cost, there is not a glimmer of hope for the pharmaceutical industry. While the Sri Lankan rupee is significantly devaluing, the industry had to face a further price control of 15 molecules where importers have to absorb the loss on the imported inventory. The absence of a viable pricing mechanism has forced different stakeholders of the industryimporters, manufacturers and retailersto absorb huge exchange losses.
SLCPI says, in March 2014, when all pharmaceuticals products were gazetted as essential items, prices of most drugs have remained unchanged despite the devaluation of Lankan Rupee from 130 to the current 167 for 1 USD. SLCPI also notes that the price ceiling of 48 drugs in 2016 was regardless of any currency fluctuation and prices of medicinal drugs were not adjusted then, with the Pharma Industry expecting a viable long-term pricing mechanism as envisaged in the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Act.
However, the 30% reduction on further 15 drugs by the Health Ministry recentlywhile the Sri Lankan rupee is depreciating at an alarming ratehas posed several challenges for the industry to maintain its long-term sustainability. In this context, withdrawing certain drugs from the local market has become an economic imperative, SLCPI says in a press release.
However, in the current situation all reasonable parties can see that these dynamics are totally unsustainable. Hence we urge the authorities to re-evaluate the current pricing mechanisms on a very urgent basis, SLCPI President, Shyam Sathasivam stated.

Wildlife Department officials took into their custody a two and half year-old elephant calf which was found inside the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda on January 28, 2015.
The Attorney General maintained that Dhammaloka Thera had illegally possessed a stolen property, a baby elephant without a valid licence, an offence under the Fauna and Flora Act.

Galle Marina Park
Government must approve  proposal - Chandima
The government will be requested to discuss the proposed Galle Marina Park tourism project encompassing a part of the Galle Port, at the Galle District Development Committee meeting, before going ahead with it, Galle District UPFA Parliamentarian Chandima Weerakkody said.
Although the tourism industry was a positive factor for the development of Galle, it should be undertaken according to a stable economic policy without relying on the private agendas of ministers, he said.
There was doubt as to whether even the Cabinet of Ministers had been notified about the proposed tourism project in Galle.
Earlier, there was an instance where Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara alleged that the Galle Marina Park project was a clandestine attempt to give away a section of the Galle Port to foreign companies.
The Deputy Minister alleged that tenders had already been called for the Galle Marina Park project connecting Galle Port and the Buona Vista beach. Five acres from Galle Port will be vested in the project during the first stage, and the Bouna Vista beach too would be vested in it during the second stage, Weerakkody said.

Growth holding up in Asia and Pacific, trade tensions pose risks
Growth remains stable across most of developing Asia due to robust domestic demand, buoyant oil and gas prices, and a consolidation of Indias growth rebound. But escalating trade tensions will test the regions resilience, underscoring the importance of efforts to bolster trade ties among its countries, says a new Asian Development Bank (ADB) report.
In an update of its flagship annual economic publication, Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2018, ADB maintains its forecast that the regions gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 6.0% in 2018. The growth forecast for 2019 is trimmed by 0.1 percentage points to 5.8%.
Growth in the region has held up to external challenges, helped by strong domestic demand in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and India, said ADB Chief Economist Mr. Yasuyuki Sawada. The biggest risk to continued growth comes from the disruption of international production linkages caused by a further escalation of trade tensions, but Asias growth should remain resilient to the direct effects of the trade measures taken to date.
Strong domestic demand is driving the regions largest economies, while buoyant prices for oil and gas are fueling growth at energy-exporting countries like Kazakhstan. However, emerging headwinds cast uncertainty on the regions future growth trajectory. In addition to escalating trade tensions, tightening global liquidity could further cloud prospects over the coming year.
Industrial economies growth will reach 2.3% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019, maintaining the April 2018 forecast. Consumer spending and job creation is driving strong growth in the United States. However, recovery in the euro area and Japan was sluggish early in the year, prompting slight downward revisions to their 2018 growth projections. The US is expected to normalize monetary conditions further to preempt inflation.
Solid domestic consumption and rapid expansion of services helped to deliver strong economic performance in the PRC over the first half of the year. The growth outlook for 2018 remains unchanged at 6.6% but is revised down to 6.3% for 2019, reflecting lower demand growth and the risk of escalating trade tensions. Supply-side reform supported by monetary and fiscal measures will help to keep growth on track, the report notes.
Indias economy continues on a robust growth path. Its growth forecasts are unchanged at 7.3% for 2018 and 7.6% for 2019 as the temporary effects of the demonetization of large banknotes and the introduction of the national goods and services tax abate as expected.
The impact of rising oil prices is offset by robust domestic demand and rising exports, particularly of manufactures. Depreciation of the rupee and volatile external financial markets pose challenges, as does accelerating inflation though tighter fiscal policy will help quell inflationary pressures.
Growth is moderating in 6 of the 10 countries of Southeast Asia, which is now expected to grow by 5.1% in 2018, a drop of 0.1 percentage points from the previous forecast. Net exports moderated growth in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam as imports surged to support government infrastructure investments. Growth should register 5.2% in 2019, consistent with the April 2018 forecast, though downside risks have intensified.
Higher prices for oil and natural gas, coupled with rising exports and investment are driving slightly higher growth in Central Asia, which is expected to hit 4.1% this year. Conversely, the Pacific is expected to expand by just 1.1%, half the previous forecast, due to disruptions from an earthquake in Papua New Guinea and public spending shortfalls in Timor-Leste.
Risks to the region include financial shocks if the US Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates faster than currently expected to stave off inflation. But the biggest risk is the impact of worsening trade conflict on cross-border production networks as business ties are severed and investment plans cancelled. While some economies, particularly in Southeast Asia, could gain over the medium term as trade is redirected to them, indirect fallout could lower confidence and investment throughout the region. As such, ongoing efforts by Asian countries to forge trade agreements within the region and beyond provide an important counterpoint to rising protectionism. (ADB)

Help resolve problems sans undue influence
President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday urged the International Community to give room for Sri Lankans themselves to resolve the problems facing the country without any undue foreign influence.
Look at Sri Lanka from a fresh perspective and consider the tremendous progress made by the Government towards reconciliation, restoration of democratic freedoms, human rights and the rule of law and extend your fullest support to build a progressive, democratic, free and equal society in Sri Lanka, President Sirisena told world leaders at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
As an independent country we do not want any foreign power to exert influence on us. Sri Lanka is taking action to consolidate peace and forge ahead to develop the economy, and deserves the support and understanding of the international community. We want to appeal to the international community that the right of the Sri Lankan people to find solutions to their problems should be respected, the President said.
The President stated that the Government was committed to work tirelessly to achieving reconciliation by fostering understanding among all ethnic groups, while eliminating mutual suspicion and hatred in order to create a society where all can live harmoniously. My government is committed to creating a fair and just society by strengthening the rule of law, he said.
He recalled that during the last three and a half years, the Government has taken several important steps to consolidate vital pillars such as democracy, freedom, good governance, media freedom and independence of the judiciary. Through such transformative steps, we have laid the foundation to forge national reconciliation, communal harmony and ensure non-recurrence of conflict in our country.
As a country that has suffered from violent conflict for 30 years, we are drawing from experience and lessons learned to strengthen national reconciliation, and are determined to prevent the recurrence of conflict. We have given priority in this context to consolidate freedom and democracy in our country, and through a strong foundation of national reconciliation forged through unity and friendship among communities, the President said.
He said that the Government is working to eliminate fear and suspicion among different communities.
Quoting from the Buddhas preaching in the Sallasutta of Samyuktha Nikaye in Thripitaka, he said if a man is pierced with a dart, he will suffer physical pain. When he worries about it, he suffers more pain. Hence, there are two kinds of pains suffered by the man. When it comes to Sri Lanka, it is the people who suffered pain due to war and they continue to feel pain when they think about it. Therefore, I take this opportunity to call upon your support and cooperation, he added.
President Sirisena pointed out that the most ruthless terrorists were defeated by the Armed Forces and the nation honours the valiant soldiers who made many sacrifices to bring peace to the country and safeguard the unity and sovereignty of the nation with utmost commitment. Full text on page 08

How can Sri Lanka better protect its people against disasters
Sri Lanka has a long history of coping with weather impacts. About two thousand years ago, the country built one of the worlds first irrigation system to control its water supply.
This feat of engineering, which boasted hundreds of kilometers of channels, tanks, and innovative valve pits, helped the great kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa flourish into sophisticated societies and protect their people against hunger.
Unlike these early civilizations, modern social protection programs have sheltered those affected by disaster through financial assistance and other forms of support.
Today, building resilience to natural disasters and other shocks is more critical than ever.
Since 1980, the frequency of natural disasters worldwide has increased by 250 percent, and the number of affected people has more than doubled.
Sri Lanka is no exception. The country ranked fourth most vulnerable to climate change in 2016.
Further to that, a recent World Bank report indicates that nine out of ten of Sri Lankans may live in climate hotspots or areas highly prone to floods or droughts by 2050.
The losses caused by significant shocks like natural disasters have long-lasting consequences.
Children, especially, can suffer permanent damages if they are not educated or fed correctly in their critical early years.
The loss of assets, livestock, and crops can severely hurt small business owners and farmers and further discourage them from investing.
Sadly, natural disasters hit the poor the hardest as they tend to live in disaster prone areas, work in agriculture and usually do not have savings or access to credit.
When a shock hits, wellbeing declines as people cut back on food and other essentials due to their loss of income or the high cost of rebuilding their homes.
While some people gradually restore their standards of living, some never fully recover and get stuck in poverty.
The poor are not the only ones who need to worry about shocks. Today, a third of Sri Lankans are just a shock away from falling into poverty.
Our analysis of the 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey reveals that a 20 percent sudden decrease in household welfareor consumption shockwould more than double the poverty rate: almost 1 in 10 Sri Lankans would be poor.
If the shock triggered a 50 percent decrease in consumption, one in three Sri Lankan families would fall into poverty.
To its credit, the Sri Lankan government already has a well-established disaster management system.
But social protection programs  such as cash transfers, social insurance, and care servicesmust also play a role in the aftermath of disasters to prevent more people from becoming poor.
To achieve that, social protection programs must adapt to reach more people and help them grow more resilient to a fast-changing and riskier world.
This is currently not the case in Sri Lanka, as programs have fixed budgets and rules that prevent them from increasing benefit amounts or enrolling additional households.
Generally, social protection programs provide a regular amount of money or other kinds of support for the poorest.
After a disaster, some may need extra assistance.
Adaptive social protection programs can provide a top-up grant to these people. But some who are not beneficiaries may also need temporary support until they recover.
How can Sri Lankas social protection programs become adaptive
To fully protect its people, Sri Lanka must design its social protection programs, so they assist anyone whenever they need it, rather than serving as an entitlement to a select few.
Program rules and budgets need to be more flexible, to allow new beneficiaries to enroll as soon as their welfare falls below a given level.
The country needs a social registry to decide who needs assistance the most using objective and transparent criteria.
Social registries are standard in many countries and aim to make social protection programs fairer and more effective in reaching the poorest and lifting them out of poverty.

In line with its regional business expansion plans, Shiraz Lye will take the reigns as Managing Director and Vice President Sales for IFS in South Asia. The new appointment will be effective from October 1, 2018 and aligns with the departure of Jayantha De Silva, President and CEO of IFS Sri Lanka.

They have helped sustain a culture that enables IFS to attract and retain talented employees and industry-leading customers. I would like to congratulate Shiraz and wish the whole IFS community the very best for the future.

Ill-laid  conspiracy  of silence
The controversy over an alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa hit the headlines last week and led to accusations and counter accusations from every side of the political divide but even this issue could not hide the cracks appearing between the different factions of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
The controversy erupted when a Police informant identifying himself as Namal Kumara called a media briefing and claimed that there was a plot to assassinate the President and Rajapaksa who is widely tipped to be the next presidential candidate from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
Conspiracy theories abound in Sri Lankan politics but what made this particular claim sensational was Kumara identifying the then Deputy Inspector General (DIG) in charge of the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) of the Police Nalaka Silva. Kumara claimed that he had a tape of a recorded conversation to substantiate his claim.
Presidential candidates
The claim is now the subject of a full scale investigation. With the President and a possible presidential candidate being postulated as potential victims, the government was taking no chances. The orders from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara were for the matter to be probed promptly and extensively.
However, this is where the government ran in to some stumbling blocks. When the claims were first made there was consensus within the government ranks that a comprehensive and independent inquiry was essential. If this was not conducted, the government was mindful that it could be accused of complicity in the conspiracy- and the backlash from the public would be significant.
The government therefore was keen to see DIG Silva out of the equation until an inquiry was concluded, even though the officer has every right to be presumed innocent until any case against him is established. However, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundera had by then issued orders to transfer DIG Silva to the Information Technology (IT) division of the Police Department.
This only created another furore. The opposition, the Joint Opposition (JO) in particular, was up in arms. Claims were made that the government was colluding with the IGP and a cover up of the investigation was underway. Another preposterous claim made by the opposition was that DIG Silva was being transferred to the IT division, so he could tamper with evidence related to the case.
It was then that the government was compelled to act decisively. Law and Order Minister Madduma Bandara had to request the National Police Commission (NPC) to send DIG Silva on compulsory leave. That was because it had been alleged that IGP Jayasundera was resisting calls by the NPC to send the officer on leave. It is understood that the IGP was also cautioned about his actions.
In the meantime, the opposition was having a field day. It was accusing the IGP of being a government stooge and calling for his removal. Much was made of the fact that Gotabhaya Rajapaksas life was allegedly in danger- even more so than that of President Sirisenas. JO stalwart Dullas Alahapperuma was even calling the resignation of members of the NPC.
The so-called rebel group of the SLFP, which is a subgroup among the sixteen parliamentarians who resigned their posts in the government in the aftermath of the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wanted President Sirisena to take over the Ministry of Law and Order. These rebels included S. B. Dissanayake, Thilanga Sumathipala and Dilan Perera.
The matter is now expected to be resolved with the conduct of an exhaustive inquiry. During the debate on the issue in Parliament government leaders were quick to assure the opposition that, if indeed there was evidence against DIG Silva, he would be dealt with as any other suspect would be. The probe however would necessarily take some time, given it has to be a thorough investigation.
If anything, the controversy over the alleged assassination plot further widened the divisions among the various factions of the UPFA. The JO was the most vociferous, claiming there was a government conspiracy while the S. B. Dissanayake led rebels also cried foul. The mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and indeed President Sirisena himself opted for a more moderate approach.
That did not prevent the President from acting decisively against errant SLFPers, most of whom have now, formally or informally, pledged their loyalty to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his adopted political party, the SLPP. Among them were several front-liners and the fact that President Sirisena, at long last, was cracking the whip against them indicated a major change in his strategy.
Electoral organiser posts
Eight out of the sixteen SLFPers who defected to the JO were relieved of their electoral organiser posts by the Central Committee (CC) of the SLFP. Among those were W. D. J. Seneviratne, former UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha, former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena and former Deputy Speaker Chandima Weerakkody.
In a simultaneous move, three heads of the SLFPs District Development Committees in Ratnapura, Galle and Kurunegala, W. D. J. Seneviratne, Chandima Weerakkody, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa were removed from their posts. Their positions were offered to Athula Kumara Rahubadda, Piyasena Gamage and Dayasiri Jayasekara respectively.
The President also appointed nine new electoral organisers. They include Faiszer Musthapha (Colombo Central), Hector Bethmage and G. H. Buddhadasa (Kaduwela), Priyangani Abeyweera and Suranga Prabath (Matugama), Amilaka Harshana Kariyawasam (Bentara), N. D. Susantha Lal Jayaweera (Karandeniya), Thisara Gunasinghe (Habaraduwa) and Dr. Keerthi Fonseka (Yapahuwa).
These measures are extremely significant in that, until a few weeks ago various groups within the SLFP were hoping for and working towards a rapprochement between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa factions of the party. These groups, with S. B. Dissanayake taking the lead among them, fervently believed that a joint ticket for the 2020 national elections was still a possibility.
Indeed, President Sirisena has been delaying taking action against SLFPers who have, for the past three and a half years been openly violating party discipline. The biggest offender has been Mahinda Rajapaksa himself who is addressing meetings and openly consorting with the SLPP, a rival political party while still being a patron of the SLFP. Some even blamed the President for his soft approach.
Now that the whip has been cracked on the SLFP dissidents, they are being given a clear message: they need to decide where their loyalties lie. If they adopt an on the fence approach, they would be taken to task and be at risk of losing their electoral organiser posts in the SLFP.
That is a significant issue because, at the electorate level, the masses still identify themselves with the SLFP.
In the midst of the upheaval in the SLFP, it was not that the United National Party (UNP) didnt have its fair share of problems.
Apart from distancing itself from the alleged assassination controversy, it was the UNP and its ministers that bore the brunt of the public backlash against the fall of the rupee against the United States dollar which sent prices of consumer goods and services skyrocketing.
Thus, both the UNP and the SLFP are in damage control mode, while the JO and its partner, the SLPP are on the offensive, seizing any issue which captures the imagination of the public. Wittingly or unwittingly, the stage is being set for the next presidential and general elections, despite President Sirisenas recent pledge that the presidential polls wont be held a day sooner than necessary.

As September grinds thru Asia, oblivious of injuries from the Hong Kong astro grass leg...heading relentless to Korea...and concluding in Colombo at the splendid racecourse.
Its defiantly an all or nothing theory for those seeking the RWC 7s qualifiers for 2019.
Our bronze finish means a real shot in both remaining legs.
However Sri have an arm long injury list...that just might make us match shy in Korea this weekend.
Despite regular skipper Muthu being match fit again.
Shehan Dias in for Gayan Weerey, and Nischon for Kavindu.
Coach Woods unfortunate with mounting injuries.....and certainly concerns.
Hard to accept but can the team target no 2
Finishing 3 might be fair...but not if we are seeking the qualifying cut for the 7s World Cup.
Natural for all our island rugby fans and that exceptional breed of "deckchair expert" to have the highest hopes this season.
But with reality much much tougher than fiction...Sri will rely hugely on belief, skill, petrol and sheer guts for Sooriyabandara to conjure some unforgiving finishes against the might of Japan, HK and Korea.
Performance under pressure is such a compulsive grey area.
So its the hardest burden and oversized injury baggage for team Lanka.
Targets and reality our Achilles heel for this Asian series.
Legitimate for more time between legs...a bear that Ross Mitchell and his band of skilled administrators need to consider.
Alas this Septimus...the time is upon a new look Sri Lanka to carve up some 7s history.
Blessings for brilliance in the middle to both our men led by Muthutantri, and our women by new captain Sanju Wijeytilake.

IP vital for sustainable  development: Envoy
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is pivotal to a rule-based global order built on sustainable peace and shared progress and prosperity, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the UN in Geneva Ambassador A. L. A. Azeez said.
He was addressing the 58th Session Series of Meetings of the WIPO General Assemblies, recently.
He said we should continue to strive together to make this vision a reality. Sri Lanka looks forward to proactively contributing to the effective realization of that vision, ensuring rich dividends of Intellectual Property (IP) for its people.
Ambassador Azeez stressed the importance of IP for economic development with its potential to uplift the lives of millions.
Referring to reconciliation, peace-building and economic development in Sri Lanka, the Permanent Representative said the continuation of targeted empowerment efforts, particularly since 2015 has resulted in more and more innovations enjoying IP protection while unleashing the potential for innovation among youth and women in all regions of Sri Lanka.
However, while advantages abounded, challenges too remained, he said, highlighting the requirement for a more balanced representation of regions in the composition of the WIPO governing bodies, which is more pronounced today.
Emphasizing the need for a fair and balanced Intellectual Property system for economic development, Ambassador Azeez said sustained efforts in mainstreaming the Development Agenda into WIPOs work are vital for the long-term relevance and success of the organization.

Laboratory for  Chefs and Foodies
Sri Lankas first-ever Food Atrium, set to open on September 19 at Colombos City Centre, is a place for chefs to grow and foodies to indulge, making fine-dining accessible to more people in Colombo.
On a Tuesday afternoon, more than 80 children from the Warehouse Project and the Sri Jinananda Childrens Home ascended the service elevator of Colombos unfinished City Centre. They reached the third floor, where Sri Lankas first ever Food Atrium was being unveiled, and offered a sampling of the Atriums vast menu: fresh plates of dumplings, samosas, Singaporean chicken rice, and large bowls of creamy gelato.
On a picturesque perch overlooking Gangaramaya park and Seema Malakaya temple, the Food Atrium is decorated with wicker chairs, wooden benches, and pear-shaped lanterns that contrast high, industrial ceilings. It opens out onto a terrace with panoramic views of the city, unmatched by most of Colombos restaurants. The walls are painted with rainforests and gems by local artisans, said Lim Tai Toon, Chairman of Food Studio, which finances the Food Atrium, and the furniture is designed by local craftsman too. But nothing too traditional, says Toon, [these are] Sri Lankan concepts in a modern setting.
The Food Atrium is no ordinary food court. Theres no difference in terms of schematics, said Toon,but in terms of the principle behind the product, its a huge difference, the principle being the quality of food the Food Atrium serves. One indication of the Food Atriums principles is its Chairman, Mr. Toon himself, a co-founder of BreadTalk. Toon refuses to acquiesce food-quality for convenience, and takes a hands-on approach to managing the Food Atriums restaurants: I have the right, he says [to] insist on the quality of the food [a chef] is serving, and at the same time to dictate the menu he serves. During a food-tasting on the Atriums launch, Toon made notes on the temperature of each dish, its presentation, the quality of the meats, and the sauces that came with each dish. The ability to cook is, for us, very critical, he says. Toon makes sure that no stall serves the food of another stall, and refers to this replication as food cannibalism, and so his Atrium serves up at least nine different types of cuisine: Japanese, Indonesian, Singaporean, Sri Lankan, Malaysian, Chinese, Indian, Portuguese, and Balkan food.
Another way that the Food Atrium distinguishes itself from any typical food court is its business plan. Rather than renting out space to different chain restaurants, Toon handpicks the chefs and food for the Atrium, and collects a percentage of the restaurants sales. In this way, Food Studio ties its success to the success of their restaurants. Most of the restaurants in the Food Atrium are obscure, and the establishments are family-run, and Toon notes the Midah Sisters restaurant, run by the Wong sisters. The sisters apparently up and quit their jobs to pursue their passion for Singaporean snacks, and specialise in a sumptuous Singaporean Curry Puff, and tender Teppanyaki beef. Toon says that the logo of the restaurant, a modest two storey house, is actually a sketch of the Wongs childhood home in Malaysia.
These local chefs use the Food Atrium as a launching pad for their businesses, and a number of Food Studios restaurant-tenants have now become major franchises. Im proud to say that some of our tenants, quite a number of our tenants, started with one stall, said toon, offering the example of a husband and wife team in Singapore. A wife was cooking some Biryani way back in 1999. Today, the husband and wife team, they have 17 restaurants in Singapore This kind of community development is what we hope to bring, to Colombo, says Toon.
Toon described the long (and delicious) process of determining which chefs and restaurants to choose for the Atrium. We need to test the food. We see how they make the food, and goes through a careful process of selection to determine which chefs and foods to feature at the Atrium. Theres a lot of eating involved, said Food Studio Director Nadeem Rajabdeen describing what it was like to test the Sri Lankan food chefs they chose for Food Atrium. We literally went to taste it in their house, at least three times, and they cooked unbelievable food. The Sri Lankan restaurant, Okra Kitchen, is run by a husband and wife team, Ravi and Sepali, whose son won Sri Lankas first Michelin Star and currently works at the restaurant Botanik. Rajabdeen says they cooked Sri Lankan food, but there is like stuffed cuddle-fish with fish sambol all Sri Lankan food but with fresh ingredients.
Food Studio chooses chefs who make a great product, but may struggle with the branding and business of selling them. And thats precisely the role ofthe Food Atrium, says Toon, to manage the business and branding efforts for the restaurants, so that they can focus on cooking.

Lancashire relegated  to Division Two
LONDON, Tuesday: Lancashire were relegated to Division Two of the County Championship after being bowled out for 273 by Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl.
Nottinghamshires two bowling bonus points against Somerset meant Lancashire needed to pass 300 within 110 overs of their first innings to keep their survival hopes alive. However, after resuming on 123-4, the tail collapsed to the second new ball. Despite their struggles, the Red Rose could at least end the year with a win.
Nottinghamshire avoided relegation from Division One despite an abject batting display which saw Tom Abell take a hat-trick as Somerset built a first-innings lead of 330 on day two at Trent Bridge.
The hosts managed just 133, but Lancashires failure to earn more than two batting points against Hampshire meant Notts have secured safety. Notts fared better after being made to follow-on, reaching 115-3 at the close.
Abell only bowled nine balls but that was all he needed to remove Luke Fletcher, Matt Carter and Harry Gurney in consecutive deliveries without conceding a run. The hat-trick was the 19th in first-class cricket by Somerset and their first since Alfonso Thomas managed the feat in 2014.
Northamptonshire thrashed Sussex by six wickets inside two days to end their Division Two campaign on a high.
Resuming on 4-0, Sussex were all out for 222 - Harry Finchs 63 and Luke Wells 50 in a third-wicket stand of 109 the highlight of the innings. Ben Cotton had figures of 5-48 as six Sussex players made five runs or fewer.
Northants chased down their target of 170 in 37.1 overs as Ben Curran (83 n.o.) and Adam Rossignton (51 n.o.) put on a match-winning fifth-wicket stand of 90.
Centuries from Tom Westley and Simon Harmer helped Essex to a huge lead over unbeaten champions Surrey at The Oval. Westley moved on from his overnight 93 to score 134 in Essexs first-innings total of 477-8 declared. Adam Wheater, who retired hurt with a suspected broken hand on 68, put on 159 for the seventh wicket with Harmer (102 not out) to lead by 410 in response to Surrey being bowled for just 67. Surrey closed the second day on 88-1, still trailing by 322 runs.
Englands Gary Ballance hit 189 not out in a ninth-wicket stand of 171 with Jack Brooks as Yorkshire took an unexpected lead in a crazy turnaround against Worcestershire at New Road.
After adding 21 runs to be bowled out for 340, relegated Worcestershire had the Tykes on the back foot at 193-7. But Ballance and Brooks (82) cashed in on the absence of Josh Tongue to help plunder 203 runs in the final session. Yorkshire ended the day with a 77-run lead after closing on 417-9.
Dom Sibley matched opening partner Will Rhodes century as Warwickshire built a big lead in the Division Two title decider against Kent at Edgbaston.
Resuming on 148-0, Rhodes added just eight more runs before going for 110. But Sibley marshalled their efforts with a six-hour 119, like Rhodes his fourth Championship hundred of 2018. Warwicks totalled 380 but, after surrendering a 213-run lead on first innings, Kent closed on 38-1 for the loss of Sean Dickson, still 175 adrift.
Gloucestershire put themselves in the driving seat to chase down 179 and beat Derbyshire on a day dominated by the bowlers at the County Ground.
The visitors resumed the day on 100-5 but their first-innings 163 all out left them 21 runs short, Luis Reece taking seven wickets for 20 runs. Derbyshires second stint ended for just 157 runs, with last man standing Alex Hughes making a painstaking 55. Glos stuttered, with two more wickets falling in the days final 10 overs. Glamorgan took control on day two in Cardiff as they reached 106-4, a lead of 333 runs, after shooting Leicestershire out for just 132.
They lost three wickets for one before Chris Cooke (41 n.o.) brought stability. Earlier Harry Dearden, ninth out for 48, provided the only real Leics resistance.
Middlesex recovered well after a tough first day in their Division Two game against Durham.
Resuming on 76, Gareth Harte hit his second first-class century before going for 112 as the hosts built up a first innings lead of 189. Middlesex opener Sam Robson was bowled by Paul Collingwood for 36 but Nick Gubbins (90 n.o.) and Stevie Eskinazi (96) put on 159 for the second wicket.

Lankas ageing  population increasing
The elderly population in Sri Lanka (persons over 60 years) will be 30 percent out of the total population by 2050, the President of the Sri Lanka Association of Geriatric Medicine Dr. Padma Gunaratne said.
She was addressing a media seminar on World Elders Day at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo, yesterday.
She said in 1946, the percentage was only 5.4 but in 2012, it reached 12.5 percent which shows a rapid increase in the elderly population. This is similar to developed countries such as Japan.
The average life expectancy of a Sri Lankan female is now 79 years and 72 for males. The country needs trained doctors and special wards to face the future demands of the elderly.
According to Dr. Gunaratne, out of the elderly population in Sri Lanka, 78 percent are between the ages of 60 to 74. By 2041, the elderly population will reach 25 percent of the total population. The adult population should be healthy and active to become a useful community.
Dr. Priyankara Jayawardena said 22.8 percent of the male population in Sri Lanka smoke while 26 percent consume alcohol. A total of 81 percent consume unhealthy meals while 17.9 percent do not get adequate physical exercises. In addition, 19.6 percent have a Body Mass Index (BMI) above 25, which is unhealthy.
Regarding the female population, 83.3 percent consume unhealthy food while 31.7 percent do not get adequate physical exercise. A total of 30 percent have a BMI value above 25, which is unhealthy. The country should be prepared to meet the demands of the elderly when one-third of the total population becomes over the age of 60, he said.

Dr Chris Uragoda turns a nonagenarian
Life well lived, career  well coursed
It was not of men who excelled like in the exceptional calibre of Dr Chris Uragoda that Alexander Pope who wrote: One science shall one genius fit; so vast is art so narrow is human wit .It is a lamentable fact that as Henry Taylor said ( Artvelde , Part 1 , Act 1 Sc. 5). The world knows nothing of its greatest men which impelled us to write on Dr Chris Uragoda the onerous task, as he is an intensely a private  person who made no public pronouncements and did not and do not wish to be in the limelight.
Dr Chris Uragoda
Eminent medical physician, pre-eminent scholar, a prolific writer , an avid researcher and an indefatigable nature lover Christopher Gunapala Uragoda popularly alluded as Chris or CG who carves a niche in the annals of medical history reached his 90th milestone on September 22.
Dr Uragoda hails from Hikkaduwa initially schooled at the local boys school secondly at the Richmond the reputed Methodist school, thereafter at Mahinda and Ananda both leading Buddhist schools. Living adjacent to the sea in Sandfield as the youngest of the three boys where two were destined to be medical professionals and the other a lawyer, would have seen his life through the kaleidoscope of his fathers being a reputed surveyor - from the stock of the Woodward days Mahindian.
Dr Uragoda is not a mere physician of the wilderness who enjoyed a lucrative practice, a rare bibliophile who also aspires to document literary pursuits for posterity on novel themes. His maiden book titled A History of Medicine in Sri Lanka  from the earliest times to 1948 was authored to mark the centenary of the Sri Lanka Medical Association in 1987 which was republished in 2014. This book was later translated into Sinhalese. His second book Wildlife Conservation in Sri Lanka was authored to mark the centenary of the Wild Life and Nature Protection Society in 1994. This book traces the formative days of the Society through other sources as the minutes of the early days which were irretrievably lost in the whirlgig of time.
His third magnum opus, Traditions of Sri Lanka encompasses his Presidential address delivered at the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka (RAS) in 1990 on scientific basis for traditional beliefs and practices in Sri Lanka. Dr Uragoda had the rare distinction of being the second medical professional to hold office as the President of RAS; the first was Dr J Frazer from 1855 to 1869.
Dr Uragoda co-edited with G P S H de Silva the Sesquicentennial Commemorative Volume of the RAS. He also co-edited Jungle Journeys in Sri Lanka - experiences and encounters, A Bibliography of Medical publications relating to Sri Lanka (1981-1988). He wrote his memoirs depicting changes during a lifetime titled Sri Lanka Then and Now in 2008. In 2009 his book on Traditional Appliances and Practices was published. This book was also based as a new theme as his other past publications. Thereafter he embarked on series of books in three volumes titled: Authors of Books on Sri Lanka 1796-1948 Their Short Biographies in Alphabetical Order volume1 1949-1975 volume 2, 1976-1990 volume 3 published in 2011, 2014 and 2015.
In 2013 Camping and Jungle Trips  visits to National Parks before or After Declaration of Status was released. Little Known Wonders of Sri Lanka was published in 2017. He wrote a personal tribute titled Life of Dr Malinga Fernando - By an intimate friend for over 50 years. The book was distributed free of charge amongst friends which is indeed a rare hallmark of a true friend.
As an octogenarian, he published the next book on Elephant Kraals. Presently he is working on another thumbnail sketch or a pen sketch on the medical professionals who have excelled in other fields.
Dr Uragodas whirlwind romance with Padma Rambukpotha bore fruition when they tied the nuptial knot on December 26, 1958. They celebrated their Golden Jubilee in 2008. He sired four children .Dr. Lalith, Neluka, Dianthie and Dishana and blessed with several grandchildren.
Dr Uragodas healing touch as an eminent medical professional is legendary. He treated the then President JR Jayewardene as well as the ordinary plebeians or the coaster in the country.
He was fortunate to celebrate the Golden Jubilee as a medical professional as he entered the profession in 1953 serving the Galle hospital for one week.
In 1985, he served as a member through the distinction of the Faculty of Occupational Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of London claiming as the only Sri Lankan to be appointed to serve so.
Dr Uragoda was awarded the Guinness Award of the Common Wealth Science in 1980, Peter Pillai award and the Sir S C Obeysekera Medal awarded by Lady Hilda Obeysekera of the RAS in recognition of the distinguished services rendered by him, where he over five decades serves as a life member of the society.
Dr C G Uragoda has had won unending accolades from both the medical profession and the public. Naming two orations by the prestigious Sri Lanka Medical Association and the College of Chest Physicians whilst he is alive is an extremely a rare honour which is bestowed on the recognition for his exceptional ability.
Dr Uragoda, a distinguished literati, a medical luminary, an erudite scholar sui generis  above all an unassuming gentleman of par excellence. We wish him Ad Multos Annos!

LP Gas distributors urge revision of charges
The LP Gas Distributors Association (LPGDASL), attached to Litro Gas says that they urgently need a revision of their handling charges.
Sri Lanka will be facing an imminent crisis in LP Gas distribution that could negatively impact the economy unless the relevant authorities take meaningful steps to address their longstanding grievances.
The Association has called for a reasonable increase in the channel margin from the current 7.5% to 12%. They also called for a higher transport margin which is to be amended to a minimum of Rs.7 per km within Colombo district with a sufficient increase in percentage for all other districts. This will result in the increase of around Rs. 70 for a medium size cylinder of gas, said President LP gas Distributors Association, Sathyendra Wijayapura yesterday.
We are asking for a revision of channel margin as costs in fuel, diesel, tyres vehicle spare parts and other overheads have gone up. We must also state that there had been no revision of our costs in the past six years. Since 2007, we have been adhering to the highest of business standards and doing our very best to ensure that there is no disruption whatsoever to the LP Gas distribution in Sri Lanka. We have borrowed from various financial institutions, invested heavily and overcome numerous challenges with the greatest difficulty to make sure that we have safely and efficiently made all our deliveries 365 days of the year for several years, so that both our domestic and industrial consumers are able to function smoothly.
He added that their growing list of financial commitments range from paying loan installments, increasing staff salaries, lease installments on vehicles, regular staff training, periodic marketing and promotions, vehicle insurance, maintenance and spare parts as well as safety equipment for employees. As a result, all 35 distributors find it impossible to continue their operations at this same high level due to the extensive outflow of finances, he added.
Liquid Petroleum Gas (LP Gas) is the most popular, convenient and economical energy source in the domestic and commercial cooking. Additionally, it is widely used in various large-scale industries such as hospitality and agriculture (animal husbandry). At present, over 5.5 million households in Sri Lanka use LP gas as the main source of cooking energy. Litro Gas enjoys over 73% of the market (over 4.25 million households) in Sri Lanka.

Mangala slams disinformation campaign  on alleged assassination plot
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has not made any statement to establish or corroborate the allegations of a plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The minister made this observation in a statement yesterday on the misreporting of the CID Investigation regarding the complaint by A.M.Namal Kumara.
The minister requested the media to exercise caution when reporting on criminal investigations with serious implications to the security of the state.Several media outlets have given wide publicity to false, unattributed claims that the CID had alleged in court that an Indian national had confirmed the existence of a plot to assassinate President Sirisena, Rajapaksa and others. These news reports are false, baseless and inflammatory. The CID has not, at any time, in either written or verbal submissions to the Magistrates Court, made any statement that could lead to the conclusion or inference that an assassination plot has been established or corroborated, whether through Marceli Thomas or by any other means, the minister stressed in his statement.
Journalists are free to observe any court proceedings in person or to apply for transcripts of proceedings and court filings through the Registrar of the Court. Therefore, it is inexcusable to make such serious and inflammatory statements on a matter of public record without citing any sources or mode of corroboration. Responsible media organisations and public figures alike should restrict their reporting on judicial matters to the written and verbal submissions made by parties before the court, the minister said.
The CID is conducting investigations into serious allegations of an alleged conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, amongst others. As of this time, the only source for these allegations is a statement made by A.M. Namal Kumara. While the CID has yet to report any evidence substantiating the existence of such a plot, these allegations are so grave in their implication that CID detectives must take every precaution thoroughly investigate and seek to corroborate their every element, as a matter of national security, the statement explained.
On Monday, CID officers arrested Indian national Marceli Thomas in connection with this investigation. Yesterday, Thomas was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, and an order to detain him in CID custody was sought and obtained. The reason CID officers sought to detain him was to conduct further investigations on a suspicion that he may have violated Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1978 by failing to report information pertaining to plans to commit an act of terror. This suspicion was filed in writing by the CID and stated verbally in open court. Further evidence in support of this submission was shared with the Honourable Magistrate in the Chambers, it added.

Out of form Kusal Mendis has been discarded from the Sri Lanka ODI squad to take on England in the five-match series starting next month. He is only among the standby players. Mendis has however been retained in the Test squad.
Also out are fast bowler Suranga Lakmal along with Angelo Mathews who lost the captaincy after the Asia Cup debacle.
Sri Lanka Cricket officially announced yesterday at a press conference held at their premises the ODI and Test sides against England for the forthcoming series.
The selection committee including chairman Graeme Labrooy, Gamini Wickramasinghe, Eric Upashantha, Jeryl Woutersz and Chandika Hathurusingha who is also the head coach along with newly appointed captain Dinesh Chandimal were present at yesterdays conference.
Before the Asia Cup Kusal Mendis was the pick of Sri Lanka players and virtually irreplaceable but now times have changed. He got two ducks in the two Asia Cup matches, said Hathurusingha.
Angelos cricket fitness is not up to mark. We want him to improve his fitness level thats why we took this collective decision. This is not a sudden change, we have been monitoring his fitness levels for a long time. His fielding fitness and running between the wickets skills are very poor, which affects the whole team, said the head coach cum selector.
Graeme Labrooy said Mathews was left out due to his fitness not being upto the expected level and that he had also failed as captain.
He also said that Danushka Gunathilaka who is nursing an injury will need three weeks to recover and also Asela Gunaratne who is also injured and awaiting recovery.
Labrooy who as chairman of selection committee has been officiating as ICC match referee during the recent womens cricket world cup qualifier matches which many felt was a conflict of interest especially from the sporting fraternity.
Former Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara had said that when Labrooy was appointed as chairman of selectors he had agreed not to involve himself in match refereeing duties.
Replying to Minister Jayasekaras statement Labrooy said if the ICC or SLC didnt have any issues with him engaging in two duties why should anyone bother.
ODI SQUAD: Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Upul Tharanga, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Niroshan Dickwella, Dhananjaya de Silva, Dasun Shanaka, Thisara Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Dushmantha Chameera, Lasith Malinga, Amila Aponso, Lakshan Sandakan, Nuwan Pradeep, Kasun Rajitha, Kusal Perera.

Michelle Obama wows  Las Vegas crowds
US: Former First Lady Michelle Obama stepped into the tumult of Novembers midterm elections with a spirited call for citizens to vote, no matter how busy, discouraged or tuned-out they might feel.
Our vote matters. It always does, she said. But only if we use that vote.
Headlining her first rally for When We All Vote, the nonprofit initiative she launched in July, Obama spoke of her own disappointment with the political moment and criticised efforts to suppress voting by making it more difficult to register or cast ballots.
Obamas event was her first major foray in a busy season that marks her return to the public eye, 21 months after she left the White House. On November 13, she launches her memoir, Becoming in Chicago and starts a national tour of appearances in arenas.
She plans to travel to Miami for a similar rally, capping a week of events by artists, athletes and celebrities recruited to her new cause.
They include NBA star Chris Paul and actor Tom Hanks, as well singer Faith Hill, who will headline a rally in Nashville. The long-term, nonpartisan goal, Ms Obama says, is to change culture of voting.
More than 2,000 people crammed into the gymnasium of Chaparral High School in Las Vegas where Obama, along with several high-profile singers and actors, spoke on Sunday evening and reminded Nevada residents why their votes matter.
When you dont vote, thats exactly what youre doing -- youre letting other people make decisions for you, Obama said. We get the leaders we vote for. We get the policies we vote for. And when we dont vote, thats when we wind up with government of, by and for other people.
While some folks are frustrated and tuned out and staying home on Election Day, trust me, other folks are showing up. Democracy continues with or without you, she added.
Obama also voiced her personal frustrations with the current political climate and called out the nastiness of our politics.
Believe me, I am frustrated, too, she said. I am sick of all the chaos and the nastiness of our politics. Its exhausting and, frankly, its depressing. I understand wanting to shut it all out.
The event marked the beginning of When We All Votes Week of Action, a multi-day effort to boost voter registration in major cities ahead of Election Day in November. Obama, the organizations co-chair, is scheduled to headline a second rally in Miami on Friday.
The organization is nonpartisan, according to its website, and Obama signaled that she wanted everyone to vote, regardless of political affiliation.
Theyre finding all kinds of ways to keep you at home, hoping that when you hear about all those things, youll just give up, she said. Dont let anybody intimidate you from being a part of this process. - ABC NEWS

Milky Breakfast
Serving healthy meals for children, especially picky eaters, is a main concern for parents. Most of the children love milk, so you already have one delicious food on the table.
Creating healthy meals for little ones can be simple and stress-free when you have a plan. Start by incorporating options from a variety of food groups. When planning meals and your childs snacks, focus on offering a variety of fruits and vegetables, adding whole grains, different lean protein choices as well as milk and milk products to deliver vitamins and minerals growing bodies need.
Protein is an integral part of every nutritious meal, including breakfast. A protein-rich breakfast, including milk, helps to start your childs day right. In fact, studies show eating breakfast helps your child concentrate and focus at school. From muscles to hair, bones to teeth, the body needs protein to be healthy and strong.
Protein impacts many different functions, including:
Building lean muscle  Protein supplies your body with the amino acids it needs to build strong muscles. Getting enough protein in your diet, along with exercise, helps build and repair muscle.
Keeping you fuller, longer  Getting enough protein, more than carbohydrates or fats, can help you feel full, and satisfied with your meal which means you may not feel hungry again mid-morning.
Maintaining bone health  Along with key bone-building nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, protein also helps build healthy bones. Milk is a great protein food for kids
With nine essential nutrients, including protein, in each eight-ounce glass, milk is a delicious, simple and wholesome option. Consuming milk and milk products is especially important during childhood and adolescence, when bone mass is being built.
All dairy milk  whether it is fat free, flavoured or organic milk provides essential nutrients. In addition to naturally occurring, high-quality protein, milk contains other nutrients including B vitamins for energy, vitamin A to help maintain a healthy immune system as well as calcium and vitamin D, both that work in concert for bone health.
It is the daily recommendation that toddlers ages 2-3 get two glasses of milk, children age 4-8 get 2.5 cups and 3 cups for adolescents, teens and adults. So just remember, beginning proper milk drinking habits as a child can have lifelong benefits. Milk in the morning is a healthy habit that helps provide kids with nutrients they need for the day and benefits that extend well beyond the morning.

Mushfiqur (99), Junaid Khan (4/19) set up enthralling run chase
ABU DHABI, Wednesday: A brilliant spell of left-arm fast bowling by Junaid Khan coupled with an equally brilliant innings of 99 from Mushfiqur Rahim left the final Asia Cup Super Four contest between Pakistan and Bangladesh nicely poised for a tight finish at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Wednesday.
The winner of this match will play India in the final at Dubai on Friday.
Junaid who was playing his first Asia Cup match of the current tournament showed what Pakistan had missed when he ripped through the Bangladesh top order with two early wickets to have them limping at 12 for 3 and then returned at the death to pick up a further two more wickets to finish with magnificent figures of 4 for 19 off 9 overs as Bangladesh were bowled out for 239 off 48.5 overs.
In fact Junaid replaced Mohammad Amir who has shown poor form in the tournament so far.
Bangladesh recovered from their early loss largely through a fighting fourth wicket partnership between Mushfiqur and Mohammed Mithun who blunted the Pakistani bowling which had their tails up after the early successes to put on 144 runs.
Mushfiqur once again showed what a big game player he was batting according to the situation to rescue his team. He battled through cramps on his right leg to score a brilliant 99 off 116 balls with nine fours before edging a catch behind the wicket to Sarfraz off Shaheen Afridi one short of a deserving hundred.
Mithun who proved an ideal foil to Mushfiqur made 60 out of 84 balls (6 fours) before Hasan Ali provided the breakthrough for Pakistan by having him hit back a tame return catch.
Bangladeshs innings went into decline once the stand was broken and they lost their last seven wickets for 83 runs as Junaid and Ali produced some excellent death bowling.
Bangladesh went into this crucial match without their most experienced allrounder Shakib Al Hasan who was ruled out with a fractured finger.

Nail it!
No matter how refined your choices are and how good your clothes and make up look, unkempt nails are a sign of sloppiness. There is no way to camouflage messy nails unless you hide them from sight. Similar to your face, your nails too need constant care and indulgence. Read on to see how well-manicured and healthy nails can be a joy to behold.

Filing your nails 
Taking down the length with a file can cause too much stress on the nail, which encourages breakage or splitting, especially if you have longer nails
Filing can also weaken nails if you use a back-and-forth sawing motion. Stick to one direction only in this three-step process: File side to center, where you go on the side of nail to the tip at a 45-degree angle, then the other side to the tip, and then finish at the top of the nail. But do not file too much of the sides, which could encourage tears. Use a light stroke and make sure you soften off the corners of nails. Never file just after youve gotten out of a shower or bath. Wet nails break more easily.

Vitamins are good for brittle or weak nails 
Nutritional deficiency is the most likely cause of nail disorders. There are several nutrients that can affect the growth and suppleness of fingernails. Diets that do not include enough protein will lead to weak nails as there will not be a sufficient amount of protein fibers to allow the cells to keratinize. Deficiencies of folic acid and Vitamin C will also cause brittle nails.
Biotin helps the body use carbohydrates, fat and protein and is found naturally in many foods, including nuts, eggs, avocados, meat, fish and vegetables.

Biotin helps the body use carbohydrates, fat and protein and is found naturally in many foods, including nuts, eggs, avocados, meat, fish and vegetables.
Age and nail growth 
Nail growth slows slightly over time. On average, fingernails grow about 3 mm (0.1 inch) per month; toenails only a third of that, or 1mm (0.04 inch) per month. As early as the age of 25, that rate slows by about 0.5 percent per year. So by the age of 85, your fingernails may only be growing 2 mm in length per month.
With age, nails may become brittle and prone to breaking. Repeated wetting and drying, or exposure to harsh cleaning chemicals or cosmetics like cuticle and nail polish removers, can worsen the problem.

Getting rid of the nail biting habit 
Reasons to stop:
* Nail biting wont typically cause permanent damage but it definitely has its downsides.
* It can make your nails grow in a weird manner. If you damage the tissue around your nails, they may stop growing the way they should. This gives you abnormal-looking nails.
* It can spoil your smile. You can chip, crack, or break your teeth when you bite your nails. Over time, nail biting can even cause jaw problems.
* It can make you sick. Hands are a hotbed for germs, and nails are their perfect hideout. When youre putting your fingers in your mouth multiple times a day, it increases your chances of getting sick. Plus, the skin damage you can cause when you bite your nails creates an easy way for germs to get in.

Healthy nail and hand care tips
Soak nails in olive oil
For weak, thin nails, soak them in extra virgin olive oil for 10 to15 minutes a day for a month, then twice a week thereafter. This inexpensive home beauty treatment will help fortify damaged, weak or peeling nails.

Use a cuticle cream
A soothing cuticle cream helps nourish dry cuticles and brittle, damaged nails with vitamin E. Massage the cream into and around your nails nightly before going to bed.

Eat biotin-rich foods
Make sure your diet features food that is rich in biotin such as liver, cooked eggs, whole grains, cauliflower and avocado, among others. In addition to other health benefits, biotin can help strengthen and thicken nails. You can also take a biotin supplement, if necessary.

Stay hydrated
Drinking enough water is essential for health, and nail health is no exception. Without adequate moisture, nails can become brittle, break and peel easily. Drinking enough water helps them to retain moisture and stay strong.

Give your nails a break from polish
Along those same lines, although nail polish looks nice, your nails need to breathe. Constant use of polish, even nontoxic polish, can weaken the nail.

Namal Kumara at Government Analyst
Namal Kumara arrived at the CID at around 9.00 am yesterday to hand over more evidence on DIG Nalaka Silva and to give a voice sample to the Government Analyst.
The CID had notified him yesterday that he had to report to the Government Analists Department to provide a sample of his voice.
Addressing the media, Namal Kumara said that he had brought with him another recorded conversation between him and DIG Nalaka Silva to be handed over to the CID. I will not hand over this CD to the media as Nalaka Silva is a trained expert and he knows how to escape from the law. Hence, there is a lot of evidence in this CD and lets see what happens. If the law was a strong wave, Nalaka Silva is well aware of how to escape without getting wet, he added.
Subsequently, Namal Kumara was escorted by CID officers to the Government Analysts Department in Battaramulla yesterday. Meanwhile, the Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told media that the arrested Indian national Mercil Thomas who was arrested on September 21 based on a complaint made by Namal Kumara that this Indian man had visited his home on several occasions raising suspicion. This Indian national had arrived in the country in January 2017 and lived in several areas in the country. The CID had not got a clear answer from him during investigations on how he receives money for his survival here.
Therefore, the CID is conducting further investigations as to how he received money. However, the Police Media Spokesman stressed that this Indian national had not at any point disclosed any information regarding an assassination plot. Having seen the news regarding the press briefing held by Namal Kumara and the subsequent news reports, he said he had felt that several people were under threat. It was this reason that he had gone to Namals home to find up more information. The CID had also filed a B report at the Fort Magistrates Court regarding the further details of this incident. But even in this B report there was no mention of this Indian revealing anything about an assassination plot, he said.
The Indian national is held in the custody of the CID for further interrogation and investigations,
the Police Spokesman said.

## Supertitle: GHI report

GHI report
One-fifth of  SLs children  wasted
According to the International Food Policy Research Institutes Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2017, with 14.7 percent of the countrys children stunted and 21.4 percent of children under the age of five already wasted, Sri Lanka finds itself among only four countries in the world to have every fifth child wasted. The other countries with over 20 percent wasting rates are India, Djibouti and South Sudan.
The country has not only seen its hunger level stagnating at 25.5 percent in 2017 as it was in 2016, it has also seen a rapid rise in the prevalence of wasting among its children. Over the five-year period 20122016, the prevalence of wasting in Sri Lankan children under five years of age has increased to 21.4 percent, as against only 13.3 percent in 20062010.
No chronic child wasting
The Health Ministrys Nutrition Coordination Unit Director Dr. Rasanjali Hettiarachchi said that Sri Lanka has issues pertaining to undernourishment, but she does not think the percentage could be as high as mentioned by GHI.
The research can include low weight-for-height (wasting) or low height-for-age (stunting) or a combination of both. But in Sri Lanka, there was no chronic wasting reported. It was usually due to insufficient food for daily requirement, she said.
Wasting is sometimes referred to as acute malnutrition because it is believed that episodes of wasting have a short duration, in contrast to stunting, which is regarded as chronic malnutrition.
However, according to UNICEF, nearly one-third of children under five in the developing world are stunted. Wasting, or low weight for height, is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five. It is usually the result of acute significant food shortage and/or disease.
Dr. Hettiarachchi said that child wasting has stagnated at 15.4 percent over the past 20 years and added that that percentage is comparatively high in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.
However, she emphasised that no chronic wasting was reported.
No improvement despite initiatives
Even though Sri Lanka has performed well on several indicators like affordability (54.8), availability (52.8) and quality and safety (49.5) of food, the same GHI also found alarming rates of wasting among the children of the country. Therefore, according to the report, Sri Lanka is both food secure and has a high wasting rate at the same time.
According to GHI, nearly 21.4 percent of children fall through the safety net into malnutrition and wasting, while Sri Lanka can be performing well on affordability and availability of food.
Dr. Hettiarachchi, however, agreed that the country did not have a good position pertaining to child wasting.
The Health Ministry has taken several measures to deal with these issues, but we are yet to see a productive result, she said.
She further said Thriposha is given to all children with low weight and special programmes were initiated at the estate level to improve the health of children there.
Dr. Hettiarachchi explained that only two percent of the whole child population has been diagnosed with severe wasting and the remaining 15.4 percent have mild wasting.
There is only a difference of 400g from the marginal level to the average level and the two percent of severe wasting can be due to a disease. Wasting due to disease cannot be considered as chronic wasting or due to insufficient food, she said.
Paradox of food security
The data available further complicates the issue: the paradox of food security in the face of such high figures of wasting is further evidenced by the poverty profile of the country. According to GHI reports, many children seem to go to sleep with empty stomachs despite the country doing much better than its neighbours even on poverty estimates.
The government listed only 4.1 percent, or 843,913 people, as poor in 2016, down from 6.7 percent in 201213. In contrast, India, the only other country in the region with wasting among children over 20 percent, still has 21.92 percent of its total population officially living in poverty. Wasting among children in Colombo is still a high 12 percent, down only one percentage point from 2006.
Dr. Hettiarachchi revealed that wasting of children is high in the Western Province as well, especially in the coastal and slum areas.
She said the highest figures were reported in Moneragala, Hambantota, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura and Nuwara Eliya, but the population of each is low compared to the Western Province.
We are yet to find the reason why the percentage has stagnated for years without an improvement and the Health Ministry is working on it, she said.
However, she said that even the children who are identified as wasting, are very active and healthy and added that they do not have any other disease.
Wasting is widespread
Further, though one still struggles with data, the demography of hunger in the country suggests it to be widespread and not confined to remote, underdeveloped parts of the country.
According to the Census and Statistics Departments demographic and health survey of 2016, 17.3 percent of children below five years are stunted and there has been no change in the data for the past 10 years. Yet, there was a slight improvement in the measure of underweight children (down 1.5 percent) and wasting (down 0.4 per cent), compared to the 2006 figures.
The prevalence of wasting in the Colombo district which was 13 percent in 2006, has reduced to 12 percent. Wasting in the past 10 years has remained high in most districts with a record high of 25.5 percent in Moneragala in the Uva Province. In the Puttalam and Anuradhapura districts wasting is at 19.5 percent.
In the past 10 years with a 6.5 percent to 15 percent drop in the numbers, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Ampara have shown a considerable improvement. In the Trincomalee district that had the highest percentage (28 percent), it has declined to 13 percent in 2016.
Nutrition Society of Sri Lanka President Dr. Renuka Jayatissa said that the data should be more accurate while addressing the issues concerning nutrition.
Dr. Jayatissa said that the Health Ministry alone could not handle the issue and added that all ministries should take necessary measures so that the country could witness a remarkable improvement in childrens nutritional status.
The nutritional level of children depends on the availability, accessibility and affordability of the food as well. Prevention is more important than curing the disease, she said. Dr. Jayatissa noted that the health system in Sri Lanka was different to that in many other countries. She said community health status is maintained by and nutritional advice is given by the Medical Officers of Health.
She further said that the people have enough knowledge about nutritional health and added that the problem was that healthy practices are not implemented.
However, health authorities must take note of the fact that although the government spends billions of rupees on health services, it has not been able to address malnutrition effectively.

OPA focuses on challenge of digitalization
The Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) has identified digitalization as the most challenging phenomenon, currently affecting the humanity and its future. Digital technologies are radically changing our lives, young and old, our workplaces and our communities. It is re-shaping the world of work and in the process dramatically changing the ways we manage and interact within organisations and in the society, President, OPA, Lalith A, P. Wijetunge said.
He was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the Annual Conference of OPA at the Cinnamon Lake Hotel last evening.
He said, It is a mega change which the environment has become volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous combined with the opportunities and challenges brought about the 4th industrial revolution becoming the new norm of the society.
Digitalization is the integration of the Digital Technologies into everyday life by digitalization of everything that can be digitalized. The literal meaning of digitalization gives an apparent idea of development of a technology dependent world
Even though Prof. Clayton Christensen of the Harvard University termed this change as disruptive, we believe that the change should be positive. Therefore, OPA appropriately selected the theme Innovative Digitalization.
He said the professionals are of the view that as a nation we should focus our attention on, How Sri Lanka would face the immediate challenge of Digitalization. As a nation we need to adequately prepare ourselves to face this inevitability, successfully and optimize the benefit that would accrue from this Technological Revolution. In this mega change the world is confronted with, the government of Sri Lanka should possess a clear policy and formulate and implement a comprehensive action plan covering all critical sectors of the society such as Education, Health, Engineering, Finance and Banking, Transport and Logistics, Science and Technology. Such proactive and visionary approach by the government will save our nation from a technological disaster or calamity.
It is sad to say, that our country lacks such guidance. If this situation continues, it will adversely affect our economy, quality of life and the progress of the nation. Sri Lanka will be less competitive and continued to be a lesser developed or under developed country. In this context, we professionals and the OPA urge the government not only to prepare this blue print of a national action plan on digitalization covering critical dimensions such as Objectives, Policies and Strategies, Resource Mobilization, Expected Deliverables or Outcomes and Delegation of Responsibility with specific Time frames. More importantly, ensure its implementation to achieve desired results.

Pan Asia Bank Credit Card - An effective tool to manage personal finances prudently
Credit card has become a tool that those who dont have one fancy having one and those who already have one, want to come out of it but unable to do so as they are virtually trapped in it.
Over time a credit card has become a near indispensable tool in ones life and it has also made it quite challenging for consumers to resist the temptation of enjoying all those eye popping discounts and offers that carry with it.
Needless to say credit card comes in handy in a financial emergency but indulgence in it can also trap oneself in a vicious debt cycle which is often hard to come out.
In this context, Pan Asia Banks Deputy General Manager for Marketing & Personal Banking, Nalaka Wijayawardana tells how their credit card can become a true personal financial management assistant which in fact can ease off ones debt burden than a one which buries you in a quicksand of debt.
Here are the excerpts of the interview;
Q: Credit Card is often viewed as an incentive to live beyond ones means. This is not a healthy situation because there will not be an end to ones debt as he/she will be trapped in a personal debt pile. This is what we often see in every market where a credit card is used irresponsibly by the card holder. In this context, how does Pan Asia Bank inculcate a culture of responsible spending by the card holder
A: As with any other tool, credit card use also depends on the user. One can use it wisely as a convenient, cost effective and secure payment tool or simply as a tool to go overboard with indulgence and end up under a mountain of debt. So, as a responsible organization, we make it a point to not to promote our cards to entice oneself to live beyond ones means. On the contrary, what we have always done was to give the knowledge and tools to customers to manage their personal budgets and cash flows in a responsible manner.
For example, even if cardholder has to incur a necessary yet unexpected expense, such as a hospital bill, we have provided the option to convert such transaction into an installment payment plan (IPP) thereby giving them a tool to manage their monthly cash flows.
Had such an option not been available, such customers might have had to resort to expensive short term borrowing methods which could unwittingly get them trapped in a vicious debt cycle.
In other words, we provide the necessary financial tools for the card holder to meet the emergency financial requirement without taking away their peace of mind.
Similarly even through our Balance Transfer (BT) services we have enabled customers to switch their existing Credit Card debt under a much lower interest rate and pay it off in monthly installments.
Q: Can you elaborate how a Pan Asia Bank cardholder could better manage his/her finances through its Balance Transfer (BT) facility and easy installment schemes
A: Our BT and the IPP facilities help the user in numerous ways.
Firstly cardholders can drastically lower their interest cost by transferring existing credit card balances to Pan Asia Bank Credit Card. For example these days the average credit card interest rate hovers around 28% per annum while our Balance Transfer interest rates are starting from as low as 16% per annum. While the interest rates are higher for longer tenures, even the 48 month BT installment plans are offered at relatively lower interest rate of 18.5%.
In addition to lowering the interest cost, our BT Installment Plans empower cardholders to get rid of their credit card debt within a specific time period as their monthly installment is designed to pay off the capital as well.
Our Installment Payment Plans, for which we charge a handling fee, enable customers to incur substantial expenses with minimal impact to their monthly budgets since they can pay off such transactions over a longer period. Take the case of an unexpected hospitalization of a loved one. Nowadays, private hospital bills can run into many hundreds of thousands or sometimes millions. With our Installment payment Plans one can meet that expense immediately and stretch the repayment period up to four years. Could there be better financial support one could have in an emergency
So, what we offer is a more prudent personal financial management solution to put you in full control of your finances.
Q: Up to how many months or years can a card holder stretch its repayment of transferred credit card outstanding and what interest rate brackets that is available
A: We have introduced a range of options starting from 6 months to 48 months to suit ones budget and requirements.
Q: You call it a Personal financial management tool but one can also argue that what you try to do is clandestinely stretching the repayment period up to four years keeping the card holder in debt for longer when he/she actually is required to settle outstanding in earnest. How would that become responsible banking and how could you counter those allegations
A: This is exactly why we offer range of tenors or options for a one to choose from depending on the size of debt outstanding and his income. We do not attempt in any way to influence customers to opt for longer tenures because selection of a suitable tenure is a personal choice that depends on each customers requirements.
What we have seen is that generally for smaller transaction sizes customers tend to choose 6 month to 12 month repayment plans and if its a larger amount they opt to stretch it over a longer tenor such as 24 months, 36 months or 48 months. This flexibility gives one the financial headroom and the time to get back on his/her feet. 
So you can see that our core strategy to grow the business is to focus on providing much needed tools and awareness to cardholders to help them manage their personal finances better.
Q: How does Pan Asia Bank make a difference in this highly competitive marketplace which creates unfettered consumerism and how can you get them in to responsible spending
A: Offering discounts is not a bad thing. In fact it helps people get value for money. We also offer various discount offers to our customers on a continuous basis.
However, our main focus remains on educating cardholders through constant communication. If you look at our advertisements and promotional materials, major part of our resources are directed at creating awareness of the solutions and tools we offer to reduce interest cost and get oneself out of credit card debt as opposed to luring him/her to spend more.
By doing so, we take pride in ourselves that we as a responsible corporate citizen are discharging a duty to the society by trying to inculcate a culture of financial discipline.
Q: Another often heard criticism against most banks is that card issuers place some hidden charges in the monthly statements. How could you counter these allegations and what exactly are the charges one could expect to bear apart from the overdue interest in their statement
A: While we also have the fees and charges that are generally practiced in the credit card industry, cardholders can avoid almost all of them by adopting a disciplined approach to use of credit cards.
For example, if a customer settles the full outstanding on or before the payment due date, he/she will not be charged any interest or late payment fees.
Also, we need to understand that Credit Card issuers need to charge interest in order to compensate for the cost of funds and high risk they take by extending unsecured credit.
A: We still have credit card products that offer one of the lowest interest rates in the market. Our Black Cards interest rate is only 25.75% which is lower than the 28% charged most Credit Card issuers. Our balance transfer Interest Rates are still ranging from 16% to 18.5%.

Passion for pachyderms
It is always a thrill to encounter elephants, says Tharindu Muthukumarana. The 24 year old has penned a book about the gentle giants with extensive research done over a period of 10 years. Titled `The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants the book recently won him the Best Miscellaneous Work (Social Sciences) award in English medium at the State Literary Awards Festival 2018 which was held recently at the BMICH.
When in front of an elephant, you and I would probably stand in awe of its trunk, size and overall magnificence. However these intelligent beasts embody great memory powers and many diverse skills. Now and then we get news about elephants extraordinary feats. Some have become globally famous and have engraved their names in world history.
One of the most famous elephants in the country during our times, Parakrama aka Siyambalangamuwa tusker is on the cover of the book. He used to roam the North Western Province and terrified the villagers who accused him of having killed one of them. He died during his translocation when the truck he was being shifted in gave away, blocking his respiratory system, Tharindu added with emotion.
The other tusker who adorns the cover of Tharindus book is the African elephant named Satao from Kenya. He too died at the hands of men who shot him with a poisoned arrow.
Tharindus elephantine passion emerges from his ambition to become a zoologist. Fascinated by these majestic creatures the young lad used to read everything which came within his sight about these fascinating beasts. Armed with information he soon came up with an idea to put all the information together and compile a book. Much like an encyclopedia, `The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants comprises of everything and anything to do with elephants.
I began work on the book when I was 11 years old. I never imagined that it would take such a long time to complete this project! There were many interesting facts connected with the elephant. I traced the evolution of the elephant in the opening chapter and then moved onto the relationship between the elephant and man, the old boy of Royal Institute, Nugegoda, notes on how he began his mammoth project.
There are two types of elephants in the world: the Asian elephant and the African elephant. Tharindus book concentrates on both species. He has read a lot of materials written about the animals and had ventured into elephant infested areas and sanctuaries to study the beasts.
Though it seems like a simple task, you need a lot of determination and courage to engage in this kind of project. The most challenging aspect is finding the time to complete the book, Tharindu added with a smile.
Tharindu has also studied the behaviour patterns and moods of these pachyderms as well as their anatomy. He has allocated the last chapter to the conservation process and had pinpointed the threats faced by these beasts.
Elaborating on some of the facts he unearthed in his research Tharindu says that the Sri Lankan subspecies is the largest and also the darkest of the Asian elephants, with patches of depigmentation on its ears, face, trunk and belly.
Initially the Asian elephant too evolved from Africa. Elephants are considered as sacred beasts in many religions, he noted. Flipping another page in his book he points out a picture of Major Thomas William Rogers who massacred the most number of elephants in the country during colonial times.
He was killed by lightning in Haputale. They say that lightning still strikes his grave, he explained.
Receiving the Best Miscellaneous Work (Social Sciences) award in English medium at the State Literary Awards Festival 2018
He sees enough cause for disquiet in the way elephants stay chained in places of worship throughout the country. Cultural it may be, but it cripples the beautiful creatures, he says.
His manual for elephants in captivity is to let them loose in a space like a sanctuary. They are born to move freely, he says.
At Wildlife museum in Yala
They need some exercise so it is essential to put them into a place like a pen. There needs to be a law in which these elephants can be put in a sanctuary and if anyone is interested in fostering an elephant, then they can do so while the elephant is in a sanctuary. Setting them free into the wild is not practical since they have been use to humans, Tharindu expressed adding that much like humans elephants are also interested in their own reflection. Elephants even embody traits like visiting the body of a dead elephant to pay homage to their own kind.
The life span of an elephant is almost 60 years. An adult elephant consumes 250 to 300 kg of food and 150 litres of water a day. They are picky eaters and eat only certain kind of foliage. If their corridor is blocked off, then their area of movement shrinks and along with it, their feeding options. Trouble arises when estates, dams, plantations and tourist resorts, encroach upon this corridor. These majestic mammals that roamed throughout the country in the days gone by are pushed into limited areas due to the development process which result in clearing forests and disrupting their ancient migratory routes. Thus these pachyderms are forced into conflict with humans.
At Wildlife museum in Yala
`The Life of Last Proboscideans: Elephants was launched on August 13 last year to commemorate the World Elephant Day. Tharindu hopes that the information included in the book will create awareness and make people appreciate elephants more. He also aims to encourage his readers to work towards developing conservation programs to prevent elephants from going extinct.
With the right information and action, we can protect these beasts, he quipped. One of his goals is to establish an organisation to develop elephant corridors (narrow strips of land that allow elephants to move from one habitat patch to another). He also hopes to do a PhD on publication.
Tharindus father, Nimal Muthukumarana, is a lawyer while his mother, Anusha Muthukumarana, is a Magistrate. His brother, Chathura, is a Software Engineer.
Tharindus message to other youth is to be ready to face any though challenge if you are determined to follow your passion.
Believe in yourself and think you can do it. You can get there eventually, he concluded.

Pope Francis gets Estonian e-residency
ESTONIA: Pope Francis on Tuesday became an e-resident of Estonia while on a visit to the cyber-savvy Baltic country known for being one of the worlds most wired nations.
Pope Francis is the 37,647th e-resident, the Estonian presidency said in a statement after the pontiff received his own digital ID.
Estonia began offering e-residency in 2014 to provide people around the world with a secure digital identity and online access to Estonias public and private services, it added.
Other notable names from among the thousands of e-residents from 157 countries are German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Touted as a trans-national government-issued digital identity, e-residency allows users to open a business in the EU and then run it remotely with the ability to declare taxes and sign documents digitally.
It does not provide citizenship, tax residency, physical residency or the right to travel to Estonia.
The country dubbed E-stonia has made a name for itself as a trailblazer in technology, notably having pioneered e-voting in 2005 and playing host to NATOs cyber defence centre.
Pope Francis has been on a tour of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania since the weekend.- AFP

Pradyun completes 1,000 runs in U-17 cricket
Teenage batting sensation Pradyun Saikia of the British School in Colombo had the unique distinction of completing 1,000 runs during the Inter-Schools Under-17 Division Three Cricket Tournament.
The Indian-born elegant left-hander finished with an aggregate of 1,442 runs from 14 innings while becoming the first batsman to achieve this feat in the current Under-17 Cricket Tournament.
Saikia joined the British School at the age of 10 and since then he has turned out be a prolific run-getter in junior and senior cricket tournaments under the guidance of coach Aruna Batapolaarachchi.
Saikia started his campaign in the most spectacular manner as he smashed an unbeaten 300 in the opening fixture against Science College Mount Lavinia.
He followed up this with back-to-back centuries against Hindu College (120) and Presidents College Maharagama (102 n.o) respectively.
He then completed the first-round stage of the tournament in grand style by compiling an unbeaten 228 in the match against Rajasinghe Central College, Hanwella.
He of course started the second-round of the tournament with a duck but made amends with contributions of 48, 58 and 84 in the next three innings.
He then came into his own while scoring two successive hundreds against Subarathi MMV (188) and Raddoluwa Central College (109) respectively.
He continued his outstanding form with useful contributions of 28 not out against Tzu Chi National School Hambantota, 35 against Dudley Senanayake MV Tholangamuwa and 84 against Lyceum International School.
Saikia eventually reached his milestone by scoring a solid 58 in their last match of the tournament against Kadawatha Central College.

President calls for augmenting Paris Accord
President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday called for further strengthening the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.
Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York, President Sirisena said the whole world is facing challenges posed by severe changes in climate. I would like to propose that the community of nations must focus on implementing the Paris Accord that the world reached in 2015, by further improving the unity that we reached by signing that accord. We must remember that the Paris Accord is critically important to the future of the entire biosphere and humanity, the President said.
He emphasised the imperative need to adhere to the Paris Protocol on Climate Change for the sake of the future of human beings as well as flora and fauna. Referring to Sri Lanka, he said the vision of the government is to ensure sustained economic development through the increase of domestic agriculture and industry under environment-friendly policies and programmes.
The President said that the exodus of refugees is a major issue in international politics and urged the United Nations to play a bigger role because of the paramount importance of the issue. Sri Lanka is following a non-aligned policy. In fact, Sri Lanka hosted the Non-Aligned Summit in 1976 and it was the most successful summit. Sri Lanka has a policy of friendship with all and the country does not have any enemy nation in the world, he said.
President Sirisena said that Sri Lankas Executive President had been vested with more powers than any other leader in the world, and he had curtailed those excessive powers of the Executive Presidency and transferred those powers to the Parliament. He also stressed the need to eradicate poverty. At present, the whole world is engaged in an attempt to free itself from poverty and the United Nations must play a bigger role in the endeavour, he said.
He called on world leaders to take collective action to eradicate the problem of narcotic drugs and illegal pharmaceuticals. He said he wanted to draw the attention of the General Assembly of the United Nations to the problem of drugs that poses a serious threat to society and asked the world body to play a bigger role in eliminating this problem.
The President said that in international politics, the issue of Palestine is very important and reiterated Sri Lankas support to the people of Palestine.

Reaping tourisms benefits
Over the past six decades, tourism has experienced continued expansion and diversification, and has become one of the fastest growing and most important economic sectors in the world. International tourist arrivals have grown from 25 million in 1950 to nearly 1.3 billion today. Similarly, tourism revenues earned by destinations around the world have grown from US$ 2 billion in 1950 to US$ 1,260 trillion in 2016. The sector represents an estimated 10% of the worlds GDP and 1 in 10 jobs globally.
Tourism is expected to grow at an average of 3 percent annually until 2030. This growth reflects the progressive expansion of access to tourism thanks to the decline in the price of air transport (with the rise of Low Cost Carriers) and the growing middle class. The availability of holidays and disposable incomes has also contributed. The sector has experienced uninterrupted growth despite challenges such as the global economic crisis, natural disasters and pandemics. Tourism cannot be treated in isolation  it relies on and also affects sectors such as infrastructure, energy, transport, sanitation, health, education, literature, hospitality and retail. It has a huge impact on job creation. Tourism also plays a pivotal role in advancing cultural understanding and bringing people from different continents together.
Today (Sept 27), the world celebrates the contribution made by tourism in various ways on World Tourism Day. This years theme is Digital Transformation for Tourism. From online ticket purchases to Instagram, the digital revolution has transformed tourism in an unprecedented manner. It is possible to take a Virtual Reality (VR) tour to a given destination before going there for real. Instead of risking your life for a selfie (itself a staple of travel), one can use a drone to capture astounding travel images. Had a good or bad experience while travelling Just head over to one of the message boards on travel to sound off. Such digital technologies have brought positive momentum to societies and economies around the world. They have connected us on a global level. Digital technologies can transform the way we travel, reduce the ecological burden of tourism and bring the benefits of tourism to all.
Sri Lanka is poised to take advantage of the latest trends in tourism, having already become one of the most instagrammable destinations in the world. Sri Lanka has been ranked in the top 10 or 20 of most must-see destination lists published by many leading online newspapers and magazines. Tourist arrivals have increased drastically since the end of the war in 2009 and Sri Lanka is well on its way to attract 2.5 million tourists per year. But for more tourists to come, there should be several more requirements.
The first is a more welcoming entry process. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a task force to study the possibility of granting visa free entry to visitors from certain tourist-friendly nations in order to boost arrivals. Some of the countries under consideration are India, China, and some European and West Asian countries. This proposal is aimed at encouraging more people to visit Sri Lanka and avoid the chaos at immigration counters, which will also be countered by installing more E-Gates at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for passenger processing, as seen in Dubai and Singapore.
Another problem is the projected shortage of airline seats into Colombo, in the backdrop of plans to bring in 2.5 million tourists. Prior to 1983, most of the worlds leading airlines flew into Colombo, but the majority withdrew citing security concerns amidst a sharp drop in tourism. Now only about 35 airlines (including SriLankan) operate flights to Colombo. We must attract more airlines to Colombo (and Mattala) to meet the goal of 2.5 million tourists in the short term.
Fortunately, more airlines are planning to operate flights to Colombo. The Russian airline Aeroflot will be flying to Colombo from Moscow five times a week using Airbus A330 planes from October 28. Among the other airlines planning to launch regular services to Sri Lanka in the next two-three months are Edelweiss (Switzerland), Thomas Cook (UK) and Vistara (India). Also waiting in the wings are Biman Bangladesh, US-Bangla Airlines, Royal Nepal Airlines, Lion Air (Indonesia) and several other airlines. All these extra flights will boost tourism and other inbound travel. Sri Lanka must also make use of existing and new bilateral air services agreements (some of which have not been properly utilized) to get more airlines into Colombo. Moreover, the BIA will be able to accommodate many more airlines and passengers when the current expansion is completed sometime in 2020.
The country also needs more hotel rooms for the anticipated higher numbers of arrivals. In this context, the entry of several renowned chains such as Shangri La, Ritz Carlton, JW Marriott, Sheraton, Next, ITC, Cygnett and Inter-Continental will be a boon for the tourism sector. Moreover, the sector has the potential to generate around 100,000 new jobs. The authorities must also develop domestic tourism. In keeping with the Tourism Day theme, the latest digital tools and social media should be extensively used to promote our resplendent isle.

Remembering Kandys two gifted sportsmen
Memories of the death of two gifted sportsmen - a Royalist and a Sylvestrian are still fresh in the minds of the local community in Kandy two decades after their passing away. Royals first Bradby captain, a fine cricketer and sports promoter Dr. C.D.L. Fernando passed away on 22nd September 1987 which marked his 31st death anniversary and the other M.E. Marikar, well known sportsmen, promoter and sportswriter and first Sylvestrian to play division I cricket died on 19th September 1996, 22 years ago.
DR. C.D.L. FERNANDO was a versatile sportsman, sports benefactor, philanthropist and above all a gentleman par excellence who left this world in 1987. CDL, as he was known by everyone, started his schooling at S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia and later crossed over to Royal College where he excelled in cricket, rugger, and athletics and also was in the ring as a fine boxer.
To think or write of CDL is difficult as one does not know where to start and where to end for he had such a multifaceted character as a sportsman. Sports promoter, doctor and social worker and above all a trusted and loving friend of everyone. His devotion to sport needs no elaboration. He played cricket for Royal, later for Medial College, SSC, Health Department, Kandy United CC, Up-Country and Central Province. At Cricket, CDL was an all-rounder. An aggressive batsman, a medium pace bowler and a brilliant close in fielder. He played cricket for Royal in 1944, 1945 and 1946. In his last game for his school in 1946, that was the Battle of the Blues, he had a match-bag of nine wickets for 54 runs, in 23.2 overs, out of which seven were maidens. He took five wickets in the first innings, and four in the second. His first year was under George Rajapakses captaincy, second under Vivian de Kretser and in 1946 under Mahes Rodrigo. He was also a Public Schools athlete, and was placed in the Putt-shot. He also boxed and was a cadet.
CDL was one time, president of the Kandy District Cricket Association and he did a wonderful job for number of years and some of the committee members during his time were Dr. M.S. Uduwella, Z.M. Jahuffer, D.H. de Silva, Raja Abeyanayake, Shaw Wilson, Deva Amunugama, Malcolm Perera, Aubrey Kuruppu and H Marikar. He was also manager of the Sri Lanka Cricket team against New Zealand in 1984.
CDL led the Medical and George Rajapakse the Law team at the annual Law-Medical game in 1949. CDL played rugger for Royal from 1943 to 1945, and had the privilege of leading the side in 1945 in the first Bradby Shield match. Royal won the first leg 3-0, and lost the second 6-0 to Trinity. After leaving school, CDL played as a front row forward for CR & FC and later for the University. CDL became president of the Kandy Sports Club in 1978.
M.E. MARIKAR was a senior journalist attached to the Times Group of newspapers while doing the rounds for the Daily Mirror, Evening Times and Sunday Times. In Kandy, he was known as Daily Mirror Sir. He later worked for Wijaya Group of newspapers. Mariks as he was popularly known was a well known personality in the country, he was known to everyone.
He began his education at St. Sylvesters College where he excelled as a top class sportsman in boxing, hockey, football and Cadeting. He first worked at the Marketing department and later joined the Army before he took up to journalism and became a leading sports writer.
He was a fine pace bowler who played for Kandy United SC, Kandy Lake Club, Sinha Regiment, Up-Country, Kandy, Times of Ceylon, Government Services, Moors SC and Sri Lanka Press XI teams. Cricket fans will recall his fast in-swing bowling. He also delighted crowds, hitting the ball to all parts of the field batting as a middle order bat.
CDL and ME are no more, but their memories in the sporting and political field will remain forever etched in the minds of all those who knew them.

Renovation work on Galle bridge to re-commence
Higher Education and Cultural Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe instructed Road Development Authority officials to proceed with the restoration work on the ancient bridge near the Galle Railway Station without impairing its archeological and heritage value.
The minister went on a tour of the bridge on Tuesday to inspect the work in response to media reports alleging that repairs to this historical bridge is being carried out causing harm to its archeological value. Owing to the allegations, the bridge renovation work had been temporarily terminated pending further directives from the relevant authorities.
A group of officials and regional politicians including Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana , Archeology Director General Prof. P.B.Mandawala, Road Development Authority Chairman Kamal Amarasooriya, Southern Province Assistant Commissioner of the Archeology Department Wasantha Alahakoon, Galu Urumaya Foundation Project Officer Tharanga Liyanaarachchi and Road Development Authority Galle District Engineer K.Krishanthi joined the minister in his visit.

This bridge is regarded as one of the oldest bridges in Sri Lanka with a stone plaque which contains Dutch characters together with the year 1768 engraved on it. Following the media reports over potential threat on the heritage value of the bridge the renovation work on it had been provisionally stopped.

Samarasinghe lauds Presidents brave stance at UN
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Media Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday that all Sri Lankans should be proud of the brave stance taken by President Maithripala Sirisena during his speech at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday.
The President has categorically said that Sri Lankan people can solve their problems on their own without foreign interference. He urged the international community to allow Sri Lankan people to solve their problems on their own without any foreign power exerting influence on them as Sri Lanka is an independent country.
He said that Sri Lankans suffered a lot as a result of the 30-year-long war and the people of the country know better of its cruelty and brutality. Therefore, the people of the country should be allowed to solve their own problems and move towards reconciliation.
The Presidents reply is also the correct reply to allegations made by certain parties that the present government has betrayed the Security Forces. The President has clearly spoken on behalf of our Security Forces and he thanked our brave Security Forces personnel who sacrificed their lives and limbs for the freedom we enjoy today, Minister Samarasinghe said.
The President also categorically stated that the government is committed to working tirelessly to achieve reconciliation by fostering understanding among all ethnic and religious groups while eliminating mutual suspicion and hatred in order to create a society where all can live freely and harmoniously, the Minister said.
The President had been vested with more powers than any other leader in the world under the Executive Presidency. But he had curtailed the excessive powers of the Executive Presidency and transferred those powers to the Parliament. We have been able to pass the 19th Amendment due to the tremendous support and commitment of the President. He was personally involved in obtaining SLFP members support as there were only 47 UNP members in Parliament when the Amendment was passed, Minister Samarasinghe said.

Serving beyond just banking for 30 years
A founding member reminisces a journey delivering heartfelt customer experiences
Serving the people with innovative value added propositions together with exceptional customer service are the two key values Seylan Bank has focused since its inception.
For the past 30 years, the Bank has shaped the financial industry with many industry first novelties. Being the pioneer of many trendsetting initiatives, Seylan Bank, this year, marked a monumental milestone as it completed 30 years in the local banking sector. Over the years, Seylan Bank has transformed millions of dreams, supported the growth of vital industries and illuminated the local banking sector to new heights with its motto The Bank with a Heart.
The robust growth of Seylan Bank is a collective effort of its committed staff and their valued customers who have been with the Bank through it all. Among the trailblazers who have been with Seylan Bank since its inception to date; Chitral De Silvas journey with Seylan Bank, as a banker and a founding member, has played a pivotal role in establishing Seylan Bank as The Bank with a Heart. De Silva, during a recent conversation, reflected on his journey with Seylan Bank and reminisced on its milestones and growing foothold in the country.
Embarking on the amazing journey
Chitral De Silvas journey with Seylan Bank began in 1988; when he assumed duties as a Junior Officer at the City Office, foregoing a career in a leading foreign bank. With an ambitious plan to expand its operations, Seylan Bank acquired the Indian Overseas Bank in Matara to setup its first branch outside Colombo in 1989,where De Silva was appointed as the Assistant Branch Manager. Having exposed to versatile business milieus in the banking industry, De Silva was then transferred back to Colombo in 1990 to drive the operations of the newly established Seylan branch in Nugegoda assuming duties as the Branch Manager.
Subsequently, De Silva also held several Key Corporate Managerial positions in the Development Banking and Recoveries Departments. With a strong track record and experience as a Zonal Deputy General Manager, in 2015, De Silva took seat as Deputy General Manager Branches to oversee operations of the entire branch network of Seylan Bank and to drive its business growth. Being a visionary thinker, De Silva focuses on creating a unique culture and the right mind-set among the Branch workforce.
He believes the workforce must embody Seylan Banks persona of being The Bank with a Heart, by instilling the values and required talents to resonate with the pulse of its customers and deliver exceptional customer service.
Elaborating on Seylans venture in developing a multi-faceted workforce, De Silva noted; To provide our clients with tailor made financial solutions that meet their needs in terms of pricing, service and the value Seylan Bank consistently focuses on evolving with technological advancements to provide the required industry training and knowledge refresher sessions for our staff. By arming our frontline and back office staff with proper technical know-how and expertise, we have not only been able to deliver exceptional customer service for the past 30 years, but also set a precedent benchmark in the banking industry for being the bank that is living up to its promise of being The Bank with a Heart.
Explaining further, De Silva noted Our focus is to identify entrepreneurs and groom them with proper knowledge and skill-sets which will fuel their passion to set high service standards and deliver exceptional financial services.
Recalling the high points in his journey with Seylan Bank, De Silva said, It is amazing to witness the transformative growth of this bank and it gives me utmost pride and satisfaction to sustainably grow with Seylan as one of the founding members and a citizen of Sri Lanka.
It has not been an easy road, yet we as a family have overcome numerous challenges both internally and externally by introducing strategic measures to continue our journey to be The Bank with a heart to fulfil our customer aspirations. It humbles me to note that as a banker, I was able to nurture many individuals and small businesses who began as start-ups with Seylan Bank and have become valuable enterprises to the nation today.
30 years in retrospect
It is impressive to see how technology has compelled banks to evolve with innovative financial solutions. As The Bank with a Heart, we have always focused on providing the best in class banking services to our valued customers. With Sri Lanka moving into a middle income economy, Seylan Bank wants its reach expanded and visibility established to cater to diverse economic segments and towards this we have upgraded our systems, processes and property assets to enable our customers to carry out their day to day banking needs at their comfort in a hassle free manner
The future outlook
As the Banks infrastructure physically and digitally undergoes an overhaul to bring banking to the customers fingertips, Seylan Bank maps out its service offerings to satiate its customers hearts content bringing an all new customer experience De Silva Said.
Elaborating on the future of banking and how Seylan is gearing up to serve its customers better, De Silva revealed; As a Bank that has been laying the foundation to many Sri Lankan lives and business entities, Seylan believes that Digital banking is the future and we are working towards offering the best service to our customers.
Towards providing the latest advancements in the digital space in banking that enables our customers to perform real-time transactions, we are exploring new avenues that would give us the right armour to facilitate our customers banking needs be it locally or internationally.

Shorter route  to Worlds End soon
A shorter access road to Worlds End escarpment in Horton Plains will soon be opened to the public, Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake said, during an observation tour of the present access road to Horton Plains recently.
The Worlds End escarpment situated in Horton Plains National Park in Nuwara Eliya, located at 4,000 feet, is a major attraction among local and foreign tourists. Today, it takes almost three hours for tourists to reach it by travelling through Ohiya, she said.
Recently, a private television station announced the availability of a much shorter route to this attraction from Balangoda via Nonpareil Estate, which is only about two-and-a-half kilometres in length.
A team led by Governor Ekanayake conducted an observation tour of the proposed route.
This route established during the period of British planters is still usable . However, the management of Nonpareil Estate had blocked it by erecting a gate at the estate side entrance.
Governor Ekanayake asked the estate authorities to dismantle the gate before the group on the observation tour. She said she would take steps to legalise this shorter route to help boost tourism.

Six yards of elegance
I am a teacher with 50 years experience and while living in Sri Lanka worked in an educational establishment. At times I acquiesced to the expectation that female teachers wear a saree to work. These are my observations and opinions.
The fabrics of sarees are beautiful and allow for artistic expression. The historical development of styles is both part of the culture and an indicator of the cultural adherence of the women of Sri Lanka. It is therefore very important to the nationhood of the country. I often used an admiring statement as a starter to conversation and as a way of developing a personal relationship with colleagues. Some would describe this as gossip or informal chatting and while there was no forethought or planning to talk about their saree, it is the most obvious thing to notice on meeting a woman.
As I came to know better the women I was talking to daily, conversations about the wearing of a saree became more forthright. Not all of their comments were positive. Consideration of both their comments and my own experience are included herewith.
I felt unsafe and in danger of tripping over large amounts of fabric in a saree. I was admonished by colleagues to be careful as I left the office while wearing a saree. We teachers are entrusted to the care and safety of our students. Over the many years of teaching in schools I have often had to move very fast to prevent hurt, outrage or damage to self or property. There is no way I could do this safely in a saree. In addition, fashion opines that high heeled shoes be worn with a saree. This compounded my feelings of discomfort and threat to safety. Further hazards to safety are the multiple flights of stairs to be climbed in many schools and other education establishments of Sri Lanka and the uneven walking surfaces of nearly everywhere I walked in their grounds. I chose days I would not be walking far to wear a saree.
I am old, overweight and of European descent. A bare midriff, nearly bare back and a low neckline is neither dignified, in my opinion, nor comfortable. I heard stories from my colleagues and students of being groped while travelling on crowded public transport. Men who choose not to control their behaviour obviously see the bare skin as an invitation. I chose to wear a saree rather than an osari because the osari design wraps even more tightly and covers less of the upper body.
From an educational perspective, positive relationships with students are of extreme importance to successful teaching/learning. I have noted over the years that the teachers who stay at their desks or move very little in the classroom are less successful then those who move around the room and engage face to face with individual students.
My point is that the additional width to the body when wearing a saree makes moving between desks in a crowded classroom extremely difficult.
I was dressed by others each time I wore a saree. It took nearly half an hour each time. If my clothing is a pair of slacks or a skirt and a blouse, I can bathe, dress and pack my lunch in half an hour. Other customs, habits or expectations make women of Sri Lanka time poor. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines hobble as, to fasten together the legs (of an animal, such as a horse) to prevent straying. This came to mind on two occasions. The first was when I was climbing a mountain path with some women friends and I walked much more quickly than them. Their comments included, we are not used to walking so fast and you take bigger steps than us. Anatomically we are the same and they were wearing leggings or jeans. Something had caused them to habitually use smaller steps. The other occasion was when walking between classroom and office, with friends, along a path that sloped uphill. They expressed an opinion about my not moving like they expected people of my age to move. Only on reflection did I realise that my clothing, in comparison to theirs, made this possible.
Through history and in many different countries, styles of clothing have subjugated women. The lotus slippers in China had women bind their feet. Foreman (2015) comments, As the practice of foot binding makes brutally clear, social forces in China subjugated women. Following the invention of the bicycle it also became clear that womens clothing of the times did not suit the pastime or mode of transport of riding a bicycle. Bifurcated garments such as bloomers or knickerbockers were chosen by adventurous women as being safer and more suitable than the multi-layered, long, voluminous and heavy skirts that were current fashion. The furore this caused began in approximately 1895 and continued well into the next century. Dr J.B. Hawthorne, pastor, (in Cripps) denounced from the pulpit, those of the New Womens Movement who wore bloomers or split skirts with knickerbockers, as being born of infidelity. These are strong words for an ephemeral notion like fashion. Unless, there was an ulterior motive such as subjugation within the words. In the same era, the Board of Trustees of College Point Seminary banned women teachers from riding bicycles to and from school because Cycling[was] conducive to the creation of immoral thoughts (Neejer C., 2011).
In the 1960s I listened to final advice before finishing my training and beginning teaching. We were told by the Womens Warden to always wear skirts and stockings to our classrooms. The price of stockings in comparison to our meagre wages (already proportionally less than the wage received by men teachers) was exorbitant and they needed constant replacement because they snared and ran so easily. It was the era of the miniskirt so there was nothing demure or dignified about the constant tug at the hem for modesty. This length of skirt definitely limited being closer to the learning environment discussed earlier. Rather than lengthen my skirts, I chose to ignore the advice received and I wore slacks.
These comments range widely but as an addition to the current discussion on the wearing of a saree in the classrooms of Sri Lanka, it is hoped they provide an indication of the scope of points to be considered unemotionally in the debate.

SLFP:  BORN TO  PROSPER
At Cabinet meetings, DS used his nephew (Sir Jons mother and DSs sister-in-law happened to be sisters)Sir John Kotalawala to persecute Bandaranaike; if the trick boomerangs astute Bandaranaike would act cautiously for DS to put the blame on his loyal colleague Lionel [Sir John] to avert a poor reflection on his authority. Though artificially created by the Old warriors political skills, the hostility between Senanayake and Bandaranaike became worse as the Grand old mans health condition deteriorated. He was grooming, as any father would do, his son, young Dudley Shelton to take over the wheel after him
Young Solomon West, Solla to his close acquaints founded a new party called the Progressive Nationalist Party [PNP] at the age of 27. His new party forwarded a programme advocating a Federal type power devolution for strengthening the system of rule in the island. The young Barrister in a further extension of his argument premised a Confederation of South East Asian nations headed by India. Writing a four-part article to Ceylon Morning Leader in 1920s Bandaranaike enlightened the readers on his unique political theory.
Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike came from the aristocratic privileged class of the low country. He was able to identify himself with the average oppressed man in a surprising way; the moderate liberal ideas which he fascinated as an Oxonian helped him to swiftly recognize himself with the desires and aspirations of the ordinary folk.
SWRD soon came to be linked with the islands foremost political body of the Colonial period, the Ceylon National Congress [CNC] but had suspicions about CNCs consumerist and reformist strategies which were unacceptable to him. In order to rest his thinking on political affairs of the nation before the people, and inspired by the Indian political model, he created the Sinhala Maha Sabha [SMS] in 1937, which, afterwards became the precursor to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Purpose of SMS was to promote Sinhalese culture and provide a platform for echoing community interests. At a Meeting held in Madampe in 1951, the Working Committee of the United National Party led by D S Senanayake rejected the proposals of the Sinhala Maha Sabha. This was one of the reasons for SWRD Bandaranaike to leave the UNP. Bandaranaike led nationalist factions within the government.
In the early 1950s, Prime Minister Don Stephen Senanayake astutely exploited the limitations of political forces unfavourable to him to transform his government into a stable entity from its weak combination a couple of years before. The main opposition, led by strong Marxists was divided into ideological clashes and personal differences.
Senanayake-Bandaranaike Cold-War
At Cabinet meetings, DS used his nephew (Sir Jons mother and DSs sister-in-law happened to be sisters) Sir John Kotalawala to persecute Bandaranaike; if the trick boomerangs astute Bandaranaike would act cautiously for DS to put the blame on his loyal colleague Lionel (Sir John) to avert a poor reflection on his authority.
Though artificially created by the Old warriors political skills, the hostility between Senanayake and Bandaranaike became worse as the Grand old mans health condition deteriorated. He was grooming, as any father would do, his son, young Dudley Shelton to take over the wheel after him. SWRD by this time rose to the position of the Leader of the House and UNPs second in command; but in reality, he was not satisfied, knowing that the Boss was conscientiously manoeuvring to promote the son to take over. SWRD demanded that he be appointed the Deputy PM, a position not provided by the Constitution, but if unofficially adopted he would automatically guide him to be the heir apparent. DS rejected the idea quoting the Constitution and that he would not grant. The writing was on the wall; the brilliant Barrister from Oxford soon realized the tragedy and what is in store for him.
In mid-1951 he finally made up his mind to leave the Party to which he contributed in a big way carrying his powerful Sinhala Maha Sabhas [SMS] when DS sought to disband Ceylon National Congress [CNC] led by him and form a new political Party in 1946, mainly, for the purpose of preserving the minority support. DSs CNC, Bandaranaikes SMS and T B Jayas Muslim League [ML] agreed to join hands under the banner of UNP on September 6, 1946. However, SWRD never disbanded the Sinhala Maha Sabha identity but preserved it intact as a precautionary measure in readiness for any mysterious future developments. Bandaranaike quit the government of UNP, crossed the floor of the house with a few faithful colleagues creating the first major rift in the government and the UNP and used his SMS strong pedestal in launching a new political party just a day before President Maithripala Sirisena was born and named it Sri Lanka Freedom Party on September 2, 1951.
Sri Lanka Freedom Party is considered as having initiated in 1951 on a socialist economic programme at a time when the political landscape of Sri Lanka was marked by success and economic well-being. SLFP was customarily associated with Sinhala nationalist groups.
Crown Prince syndrome
It is an innate desire of every politician in the region to make his/her off-spring the crown prince. Senanayakes suffered from it in 1940s 50s, Bandaranaikes in 1970, 80s and Rajapaksas in 2010s and  Apart from this inherent craving, DS Senanayake had other aspirations as well in attempting to frustrate the Siyane-Korales ancestral feudalists.
Since the formation of the new party in 1951, SLFP platforms stressed on appealing to the emotions of the Sinhala/ Buddhist nationalists masses in rural areas. On the sensitive issue of language, it adopted a Sinhala only policy in the mid-1950s though the party initially promoted employing Sinhala and Tamil as national languages. Bandaranaike relied upon the influential Buddhist monks to communicate its sentiments to the Southern villages. SWRD Became a champion among Sinhalese/Buddhist middle class, who disliked alleged minority domination of the civil service, Professions, Banking sector and commercial establishment since the British occupation. His disagreement with the free market policies of the UNP, nationalization of main enterprises, non-aligned foreign policy, the establishment of welfare measures, and equitable distribution of wealth helped him in winning the common man.
SLFP wins East LG polls
In a remarkable similarity to its victory five decades ago on February 18, 1968, the party succeeded at 2018 Local Government polls in East on February 10. At a by-election held to decide on an MP for two remaining years for Kalmunai seat in the Parliament with the disqualification of Mudaliar M S Kariapper, (who was found guilty of accepting a bribe) a senior politician in the East, SLFP nominated M C Ahamed, a Brother in law of Kariapper to contest it.
M S Kariapper who held the seat since 1947 on different parties was returned four times in the Muslim dominated town [68 per cent Muslims; 28 % Tamils; 2 % Sinhalese]. In 1947 M S Kariapper, Chairman of Kalmunai Town Council won by contesting under UNP. He lost in 1952, but regained it in 1956 with Federal Party. In 1960 March he chose Dahanayakes LPP and lost with only Daha winning out of 100 seats his party contested. Kariapper lost again in July 1960 under All Ceylon Islamic United Front, his own new party. He was back as an independent candidate in 1965 to beat both his rivals from UNP and FP. With 23,300 voters at the by-election, Kalmunai went to polls in 1968, where Kariappar being deprived of Civic rights for seven years, his relative from SLFP created history by winning with a clear majority.
Political parties may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.

Special train, a disaster
The special train targeting tourists from Mount Lavinia to Rambukkana became a non starter with the high price tag put by the Railways Department.
The price for a one way journey was announced at Rs 3000 per head. The inaugural trip was done with no passengers on board except for the driver, assistant and the guard.
The Railways Department said it had decided to cancel this train. Regular travellers said it would have been prudent if the train had plied to either Kandy or Badulla with a second class fare that could have attracted a much better passenger load.

President Maithripala Sirisenas speech at 73rd UNGA Session
Sri Lanka has a more inclusive and humane society today
Address by President Maithripala Sirisena at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 25,2018. The full text of the Presidents speech:
May the Noble Triple Gem bless all of you !
Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary-General,
Distinguished Heads of State,
Distinguished Delegates,
Friends,
I am extremely pleased to participate in the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly representing Sri Lanka for the fourth consecutive occasion. Sri Lanka, as a Member State of the United Nations, is fully committed to adhere to its Charter, Conventions and Agreements and their implementation.
As Head of State, I am pleased to note the progress that has been made by Sri Lanka and my government during the past three-and-a-half years. When I was elected by the people of Sri Lanka as Head of State in January 2015, the Executive Office that I hold today, had excessive powers, which were comparable to those of a king, or even an emperor. I am pleased to state that I was able to relinquish these emperor-like excessive powers and transfer them to the Parliament of Sri Lanka, fulfilling the utmost duty of an elected leader.
During the past three-and-a-half years, democracy has been strengthened in my country. In addition, human rights, freedom of the people and the media as well as the independence of the judiciary have been strengthened. Therefore, the Sri Lanka of today is not what it used to be three-and-a-half years ago. I can clearly state that the Sri Lanka of today is a society which is more inclusive and humane.
We, as Member States of the United Nations, must consider it as our duty and responsibility to comprehensively study and reflect upon the contemporary political developments, economic disparities, and common challenges faced by humanity.When speaking of international political developments and trends, we must in particular focus our attention on refugees that have become a global issue as there are a large number of refugees all over the world. Therefore, I believe that the efforts of the United Nations, its Member States and other organizations dealing with the issues related to refugees must be broader and more effective.
Sri Lanka is a country that follows moderate policies with regard to the exercise of its foreign policy. We are a senior member of the Non-Aligned Movement. The 1976 Non-Aligned Summit, which is considered one of the most successful, was held in Sri Lanka. Within the framework of non-alignment, we consider all nations of the world as friends. I am glad to note that Sri Lanka does not have adversaries in the contemporary world.
When discussing international political issues, we must especially mention the issue of the Palestinian people. I believe that the United Nations and the world powers should approach this issue with greater understanding and attention. Successive governments in Sri Lanka have supported the liberation struggle of the Palestinian people. I believe that the United Nations and all Member States should adopt a more humane approach when advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people, and taking into account the inhumane conditions they face and approach this issue in a broader manner.
We all know that poverty is one of the fundamental problems affecting the world. I am of the view that the United Nations can do more to address the issue of poverty. We know that today, hundreds of millions of people across the world suffer from hunger. Climate change, income disparities, and certain shortcomings of governments to fulfill obligations towards their citizens, are among the key causes of poverty. The negative effects of climate change on economies have further exacerbated this problem. Therefore, it is essential to assist and support countries which are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. I must mention that just as poverty plays a central role in many problems that plague the world, trafficking in weapons, illicit drugs and narcotics have also become grave threats to humanity.
In this context, I am pleased about the agreement reached under the auspices of the United Nations and the leadership of the US President Donald Trump on a Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem, yesterday. It is necessary that all countries do more towards combating illicit drugs with the assistance of the United Nations, as a matter of priority.
Within the framework of action of the United Nations, we must all work at national and international levels towards the implementation of the agreed outcomes of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, finalized under the guidance of the former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for the benefit of humanity as well as other living beings, our streams and rivers, and planet Earth as a whole. I must state that Sri Lanka, as a UN Member State, gives utmost priority to these endeavours.
Speaking of internal matters of my beloved motherland, as I stated earlier, we have broadly strengthened democracy, human rights, fundamental rights and media freedom in the country. We must reflect on the situation of our country that prevailed forty years ago, and on the conflict that lasted for nearly thirty-years. It has been almost ten years since terrorism and armed conflict ended. During these ten years, we have undertaken a broad range of reforms. My government in particular, has implemented several important steps in the post-conflict context.
We have implemented, and continue to implement many programmes aimed at fostering national harmony and reconciliation, and ensuring non-recurrence of conflict. As a country that has fulfilled and continues to fulfill our human rights obligations, we respectfully request the United Nations and all other countries to continue to assist us in our endeavours.
Sri Lankas Security Forces defeated one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world. As a result, Sri Lanka remains an undivided country that enjoys sustainable peace.
Therefore, I must respectfully recall the yeoman service rendered by our Security Forces in defeating a dreaded terrorist organization, and I take this opportunity to thank our Security Forces for their great sacrifices in ushering peace and ensuring territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. At a time when almost ten years have passed since the end of the conflict, I call upon the international community to look at my country from a new perspective with new ideas.
I call on you all to refresh your views on my noble motherland and assist us in our efforts towards achieving economic development, prosperity, and a secure future as a country at peace, following a deadly conflict; as a country that is strengthening national reconciliation; as a country where national harmony prevails; as a country that has taken and continues to take every possible step to prevent recurrence of another conflict; and as a country that protects and upholds human rights.
I respectfully request you to allow us the opportunity to resolve our own issues. The independence of a country is of paramount importance. I seek your support in our efforts, including in strengthening democracy and enhancing human development, while respecting our sovereignty.
The sacrifices we have made and the initiatives we have taken in this regard are important for us in resolving our issues. As an independent country, we do not require foreign interference or threats. As a strong nation, we request all of you to allow us space to resolve our problems and to progress as an independent country.
In this context, once again, I wish to reiterate our request for your assistance and support for us to resolve our own issues as Sri Lankans. I further request your support in the efforts of my government to alleviate fear and suspicion among the communities living in our beloved motherland, and to build greater harmony.
As I stated before, it is imperative to accord priority to address the issues of people in Sri Lanka and the world over, who are poverty-stricken. We must find solutions to their problems, taking into consideration the ideas and thoughts of the younger generation.
Considering all of the above, I wish to finally reflect on what The Buddha stated in the Salla Sutta of the Samyuktha Nikaya in the Thripitaka, where it is said that a man pierced by a dart suffers twice: firstly, the physical pain caused by the dart and secondly the mental agony caused in recollecting the act. Similarly, the people of Sri Lanka have suffered both the physical pain of the prolonged conflict as well as the mental agony caused by the recollection of those unfortunate experiences.
Therefore, it is no one else but the people of Sri Lanka who need to be relieved of this pain. In conclusion, I respectfully request all to extend support to my people and country to progress towards a just, fair, equitable and humane society with economic prosperity, alleviating the pain that my people have endured.
Thank you. May the Noble Triple Gem bless you.
