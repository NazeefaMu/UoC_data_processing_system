Development ongoing while correcting previous govts faults
Plans are finalized to develop Mawanella, Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Addressing a meeting following the inauguration of a number of roads in the Mawanella electorate, he said the Pohottuwa party is preoccupied with blaming the government on baseless grounds, citing the sale of crown lands, dividing the country and risking the countrys sovereignty.
On the contrary, the UNP is the only party that fosters democracy and protects sovereignty. It cannot be forgotten that UNP leaders even sacrificed their lives to safeguard the countrys sovereignty and democracy, the minister said.
Mahinda Rajapaksa earlier, before the Presidential elections, said he is unable to travel abroad as he might have to face the electric chair. This was because democratic countries disliked him. As a result, Sri Lanka was marginalized and ignored. However, with this government, that has changed, he said.
It was Mahinda Rajapaksa who sold state land to foreigners, friends and relatives when cronyism, corruption and nepotism were rampant during his period. The sale of the most valuable Army headquarters land to a Chinese hotel project is a good example among many. We have been in power for three years, whereas they held power for over 20 years. Yet, they are trying every trick and treachery to oust us. We are undoing all the past wrongdoings. The government is repaying the debts which Mahinda Rajapaksa plunged the country into. Repayment will last until 2025 or even thereafter. Our government is paying for their sins, the minister said.
While shouldering the legacy of problems of the Rajapaksas, this government is still forging ahead with its development projects. Our government is still progressing on its infrastructure development projects for which the government has allocated funds. They are the construction of roads, distributing lands and houses, providing drinking water etc. being expeditiously carried out in the Mawanella and Kegalle districts, the minister added.
Mawanella Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Anura Chandana and former PC Council member Upul Shyamal Bandara also addressed the meeting.

Commentary on Gananath Obeysekeres Doomed King
Doomed King  doomed
Professor Gananath Obeysekeras book entitled Doomed King has been the ripples of concern and the centre for controversy in recent times. One point that the truth needs to be elucidated is that there were 12 streets together with the Swarna Kalyana street and (vide: page 136 and f.n., 75 at page 147- 8) 2017 Doomed King; Nerapu Raja 2017 Sinhalese translation of the same book as page 135 and f.n.81 sarasavi publishers) in the last days of the Kandyan Kingdom.
In both books apart from Lionel Saraths Ingresi Hatana Vimarshanaya 2017 Godage where eleven streets are enlisted. Nihal Karunarathnas Kandy Past and Present CCF 1999 pages 199-207 has provided twelve streets as enlisted therein.
P. M. P. Abeysinghses Udarata Viththi (1957) Godage revised edition 2017 (book written in Sinhalese) where the author has cited in the list of references, nineteen are enlisted as streets from pages 237- 8 of the book. The same nineteen are enlisted with an identical account in Madyama Lanka Purawurtha (The medieval lankas lore) by Nawulle Dhammananda (1969)2016 Godage second edition. Both these accounts are overlooked by the learned Professor.
However, a more authoritative article written by L. J. B. Turner titled: The town of Kandy about 1815 published in the Ceylon Antiquary and the Literary Register 1918 October Vol. 4 Part 4 Page 76 to 78 has enlisted twenty two streets. The streets that are overlooked by the learned Professor are : Udnuwara Street, Waikuntha Street, Kandhe (Hill) Street, Ashtawanka Street, Maha Dewala Street, New (Aluth) Streets not now in existence, this street was added by the last king of Kandy Dewa Street, Eth (Elephant) Street, Kommutti Street (the present cross street).
An interesting cartographical details depicting these streets of the yore are furnished in a map (Plate 53 facing page 172) drawn by T. B. Keppetipola titled: Map of Kandy town about 1815 A.D. is found in the Lands Maps and Surveys by R. L. Brohier and J. H. O. Paulusz Volume 2, 1951.
All these cogent evidence amply demonstrate that Gananath Obeysekeres Doomed King is not an eye opener. It is an account to be re-checked, to go into the veracity of the contents written by the learned Professor.

Independence, no path to Opp. Leader post
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday categorically stated that the Joint Opposition (JO) cannot acquire the Opposition Leaders Post by becoming independent in Parliament. He was responding to a question by a journalist regarding the Joint Oppositions decision to become independent in Parliament at a media conference held at the SLFP Headquarters.
The Minister said that the Speaker has clearly noted that only six political parties are recognised in Parliament. So he has not accepted any independent group. Though the JO claims that they will act independently in Parliament, the reason for this decision is not clear, he noted.
Anybody can act independently in Parliament whenever they wish by making a statement.
Even I can. But soon after the announcement, my party can remove me from the party and also take a decision on the MP Post and a new member can be appointed instead, said the Minister.
As the leaders of the SLFP we are always attempting to bring JO members back to the SLFP in order to strengthen the party and not to remove them from the party.
The Minister said that around 80 percent of the restructuring and reforms process has been completed and they hoped to complete the process before the anniversary celebrations.

PUCSL, a pawn of lobby groups
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has become a pawn of lobby groups, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera alleged while steadfastly defending the decision to extend the power purchase agreement with Ace Power Embilipitiya Ltd. The State Ministers remarks came in the wake of the PUCSL refusing to approve three Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) including that of Ace Power.
Responding to a question by a journalist at the end of the press conference at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday, the State Minister noted that ACE Embilipitiya supplies power at the lowest rate, adding that due Cabinet approval has been granted to extend the Power Purchase Agreement.
The PUCSL is not practical in this matter. It has become a pawn of interested parties in the power sector which is no doubt a multi-billion dollar business in the country. Unlike the CEB and the Ministry, the PUCSL is not answerable to anybody. We consulted the opinions of energy experts and specialists and they were in agreement that purchasing power from retired thermal power plants was the best option for the Government.
Sate Minister Perera said the power purchase rates with the Independent Power Producers have been brought down through fresh negotiations carried out by a high level committee comprising ministry secretaries. He said it was the recommendation of the Technical Evaluation Committee to go ahead with purchasing power from ACE Power Embilipitiya and Matara as a short term solution for the looming power crisis.
The State Minister said the CEB has signed Letters of Intent to have joint venture projects with India (500 MW), Japan (500 MW) and China (400 MW) to construct new LNG power plants.
He said the proposed coal powered plant in Sampur had to be cancelled as the President disagreed with it.

Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin dead
Aretha Franklin, the queen of soul who became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, has died in Detroit at the age of 76.
The legendary singer was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and announced last year she was retiring from music. Known for hits like Respect and Think, she had more than 20 US number ones over a career spanning seven decades. She gave her final performance last November at a gala in New York held in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation. Born in Memphis to a gospel singer/pianist and a celebrated Baptist preacher, Franklin was tutored from an early age by such gospel stars as Mahalia Jackson and Clara Ward. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush in 2005, when she was saluted for capturing the hearts of millions of Americans.
Ten years later she reduced President Barack Obama to tears when she sang (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman at a Kennedy Center Honours ceremony, having previously performed at his inauguration. - BBC

Found this little family on the road while passing Colombo 2. At first I wanted to rescue the puppy and try to rehome her but then I felt so sorry to separate the mother from the puppy as she was very concerned of her baby. I was so sad to see her with only skin and bones. The other pups have been taken away and according to the workers close by she had been crying all night in search of the rest.
I met the momma doggie for the very first time that day and was so surprised to find her so loving and extremely gentle with me. I know its a long shot but I dont want to give up hope, and thats when I thought of at least appealing for a home for both of them.
I will vaccinate both for rabies, pavo and dhl, deworm and will also take over their sterilizations. I will also arrange transport. Is there anyone who can open up their hearts and home to this little family
They are currently on the streets with no proper food.
A poor lady who cleans the streets feeds them with whatever she can manage but other than that they have no proper food or shelter. As you can see the mother is really thin. If you can even foster and or adopt even one of them or help them in any way please contact Sahana on 0777567122.

Apple MacBooks and iMacs from Abans
The Mac vs PC debate has been raging ever since both types of computers hit the market in the early 1990s.
Abans has the following reasons why switching to a Mac will give you better bang for your buck than a PC.
The only characteristic that sets PCs apart from Apple Macs is their universal usage of Microsoft Windows. This, however, means that the quality of the hardware used in each PC can vary based on the manufacturers preference, which often results in lower-quality, more fragile components. In stark comparison, Apple has designed Macs to function as single cohesive units by incorporating superior software and parts. Since all segments are solely developed by Apple, Macs tend to be more durable and less prone to breakdown.
PCs have long been reputed for their easy customizability. Yet, users usually have to install several required apps and software programmes manually, which can be a tedious process. On the other hand, Apple Macs are equipped with a set of useful built-in apps, including Mail, Safari, Pages, iTunes and more, that automatically appear on your Home Screen. Plus, the latest editions of Apple MacBooks come with Touch ID, a revolutionary feature that enables you to set system controls; answer iPhone or FaceTime calls; conduct fast logins; purchase apps from the App Store; and enact function key capabilities, without having to move the cursor across the screen.
With the introduction of Continuity in OS X Yosemite, Apple has further strengthened the ties between Macs and iOS devices, something that has carried through to OS X El Capitan. Thanks to the innovative Hand-off feature, you can start an email, note or document on your iPhone/iPad, and continue the same task on your Mac without syncing or saving anything to a cloud drive such as OneDrive or Google Drive. Also applying to web searches, reminders, map searches and calendar adjustments, this seamless integration means that all your devices work in perfect cohesion to help you complete your tasks without experiencing stress or frustration.
Coupled with weak anti-virus controls, PCs are also susceptible to the proliferation of malware which can slow downoperating systems. Unlike PCs, Macs are already outfitted with standard safety features that constantly monitor, encrypt, and update the devices macOS to guard against malicious software.
Apple is the best for you, visit your nearest Abans-Apple iStore, Apple authorized dealer or Abans Elite Showroom and select from the latest lineup of Apple MacBooks and iMacs.

Cashwagon which provides digital financial services and working to simplify the complex and often long financial processes of clients in Sri Lanka completed their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program. Under this the Weherawatte Junior School, located in a low income and difficult area in the Kalutara District was selected to donate school equipment and other educational materials.
It was found that the children in the school had a great need for an activity room in the primary school. So the main purpose of the CSR project was to provide an activity room for the primary classes with equipment and materials for it, an official from the company said. In addition the company also donated books and educational equipment to students of the Weherawatte Junior School for their studies. This was greatly appreciated by the teachers who worked in this school.
The Cashwagon company on this occasion was represented by; Cashwagon Sri Lanka Head, Samila Fernando, Operations Manager, Supun Sangadasa, Customer Services Supervisor, Janani Ferdinando, Quality Control Manager, Jithmi Fernando and several others.
An activity room for the primary school children was a great shortcoming in the school and the principal thanked Cashwagon for their contribution.

Cat owners unaware their pet is carnivore!
Cat owners are unknowingly feeding their pets poor quality food as well as often handing out scraps of their own meals, including chocolate and cheese, research has found.
A study of 2,000 cat owners revealed many are oblivious about what foods could be harmful to their cats health  with some even sharing takeaways and leftovers. A fifth of owners dont even know their cats are carnivores  with one in 10 feeding them raw vegetables and another one in 20 serving up salad leaves.
The research, commissioned by Lilys Kitchen, also found nearly four in 10 cat owners never check the label when buying cat food, with 64 per cent baffled about what they should look for.
One in 20 simply buy the cheapest cat food on offer, and a further 15 per cent swap from brand to brand depending on whats the best value. But leading veterinarian Rodney Zasman has warned that serving up some of the cheaper cat foods available could be no better than feeding your cat a daily dose of McDonalds.
He said: Its alarming that many of the nations cat owners are oblivious to what constitutes a healthy diet for their pets, particularly when healthy eating plays such a big part in modern day living for the owners themselves.
One of the biggest dangers to our cats health is actually poor quality, mass produced pet food.
In some instances these foods contain as little as four per cent meat and, as a result, cats arent getting the nutrition they need to keep them healthy.
"But many cat owners are largely unaware of this fact and only find out when they take their poorly or overweight moggy to the vet.
Four in 10 Brits give food items to their cat despite not being sure its healthy for them while almost a quarter still give their pet treats knowing it wont do them any good. A further 40 per cent are happy to share their own meals with their cats; with a third of pet owners giving them cheese without realising large amounts can be dangerous.
One in 20 have offered it a piece of chocolate and almost a fifth are happy to let their cat lick from a bowl of cream, which can be unhealthy for moggies. One pet owner even claimed their cat loves nothing more than to nibble on a piece of leftover fruitcake, which could be harmful to the animal.

Chinese MH370 relatives ask to meet Mahathir
CHINA: Chinese relatives of those who disappeared on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on Thursday asked to meet the country's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad when he visits China this week.
The plane disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people -- mostly from China -- on board, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
Amid a heavy police presence, about a dozen relatives gathered outside the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing where they handed over a letter addressed to the Malaysian government.
We ask that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, or other representatives (of the Malaysian government) meet with Chinese relatives of those on board MH370 during the official visit, the letter read.
Mahathir, who became Malaysia's premier for a second time after a shock election victory in May, will arrive in China Friday for a five-day visit, including a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday.
Other requests include resuming the search, a monthly meeting with airline and Malaysian officials, as well as for investigators to thoroughly explain the recent investigation report. A similar letter was also given to the foreign ministry.
We're holding out hope that on this visit to China, (Mahathir) can quickly resolve the issue with MH370, said Gu Xiu Fang, whose son and his family were on the plane.
We don't know anything about the situation. Our lives have stopped at March 8, 2014, she said.
Relatives had earlier this month expressed frustration that the long-awaited official report -- totalling some 1,500 pages -- had no new clues about the missing airliner and had not been translated into Chinese.The investigation team wrote that it was unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of the plane.
The vanished airliner sparked the largest hunt in aviation history but no sign of the jet was found in a 120,000-square kilometre (46,000-square mile) Indian Ocean search zone and the Australian-led hunt was suspended in January 2017. US exploration firm Ocean Infinity resumed the search in a different location at the start of this year on a no find, no fee basis, using high-tech drones to scour the seabed.- AFP

Kudos to Gemunu Wijeratne
The All Ceylon Private Bus Workers Association was expected to launch a strike as of midnight on August 15 to express their opposition against the new fines imposed for violating road rules.
However, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association LPBOA President Gemunu Wijeratne said his association will not engage in the strike. He requested the LPBOA not to go-ahead with the strike action because of the ongoing GCE  A/Level examination.
It is very unfair for the bus workers or the railway workers to launch a strike at a time when the GCE O-Level or the GCE A-Level exams are ongoing.
Bus workers or the railway workers should not harm or harass the children of this country. These innocent children are not in any way responsible for your disputes, mismanagement or fights. Education is a very basic human right. We should not do anything that will deny the human rights of children.
Gemunu Wijeratne has advised his union members not to support this brutal and cruel strike.
This bouquet of flowers is to Gemunu Wijeratne for his noble decision-- not to harass children by launching unfair strikes.

Coffee waste could help power future battery
Millions of us drink coffee for its energy kick. But researchers in Taiwan say it could one day help power our smartphones, laptops and even electric vehicles. Tsai Hsing-yu, a student at Chung Yuan Christian University, has created a coin cell battery that draws its power from discarded coffee grounds that she sources from coffee shops around campus.
Liu Wei-jen, associate professor at the universitys chemical engineering department, had the initial idea for the project after noticing the amount of coffee consumed by the Taiwanese public. He said graphite, the conventional source material, is much costlier, possibly making this researches a viable start-up business in the future.

Come home, refugees told
National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Deputy Minister Ali Zahir Maulana yesterday made an impassioned appeal to all remaining Sri Lankan refugees in India to return home without delay. Peace has been restored in Sri Lanka. There is no fear and suspicion anymore. You are all welcome to return to the Motherland, was the message the Deputy Minister delivered at a gathering at the Jamal Mohammed College in Trichy, Southern India.
The Deputy Minister said the Government has taken all necessary steps to facilitate those who want to return to their homeland, especially to the Northern and Eastern provinces where mine clearance has almost ended and most lands have been released back to the original owners.
India media reported that the Deputy Minister allayed the refugees concerns regarding the military presence in the region, saying the military was limiting recruitment and adjusting its operations in accordance with peacetime requirements. He said he understood the reluctance of some refugees and migrants who are living with their relatives in other countries to return. However, all possible steps will be taken to help returnees to re-establish their lives in Sri Lanka.
The Government had already provided assistance to those returned and had helped them to reintegrate into society while also providing them transport and financial assistance to purchase household appliances and equipment for their new homes. The Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry will facilitate the provision of lands and livelihood assistance to the returnees. The Government plans to construct 50, 000 houses in the North while another 25, 000 houses will be built thereafter for the resettlement of refugees.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently informed Parliament that 9,509 Sri Lankan refugees who were in refugee camps in Tamil Nadu had returned to the country since 2010 and that another 3,815 people had expressed willingness to return. He also confirmed that the Indian government had agreed to provide naval assistance to transport the refugees and their belongings to Sri Lanka. According to official statistics, there are 65,000 Sri Lankan refugees in 110 camps in Tamil Nadu and another 35,000 are living outside the camps.
The Deputy Minister noted that arrests of Indian fishermen by the Sri Lanka Navy takes place only when they enter Sri Lankan territorial waters after crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line. However, he called for renewed talks between the fishermen and authorities of both countries to settle the ongoing disputes with regard to fishing in the region.
The Minister also handed over a letter expressing condolences of the people of Sri Lanka over the death of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and eminent poet M. Karunanidhi.

Convicts indulging in drug deals within prison should be dealt with: CBCSL
The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka (CBCSL), making a statement with regard to the issue of the death penalty on Tuesday, said the recent incidents of those convicted continuing to indulge in drug dealing from within the prescient of prisons, should be prevented at all costs.
The Bishops Conference called for the urgent attention of all sections of society including family members, education institutions, religious leaders and politicians to take preventive and curative measures and design the effective rehabilitation of victims with a supportive social system.
The statement:
"We the Members of the Catholic Bishop's Conference in Sri Lanka wish to make the following statement with regard to the issue of the death penalty. The supreme Pontiff Holy Father Francis has approved a new revision of number 2267 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. We wish to reiterate the following teachings given by the Universal Shepherd on this matter.
Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following fair trial was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.
Today however, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the State. Lastly, more effective systems have been developed which ensure the due protection of citizens but at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption. Consequently, the Church teaches in the light of the Gospel that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide.
Pope Francis calls drugs "a new from of slavery, a new wound in our society, a venom that corrodes, corrupts and kills and this evil must be fought; must be expelled. It must be told no. Therefore, we earnestly call for the urgent attention of family, education system, institutions, religious leaders, politicians and support of the civil society, International organizations, NGOs and INGOs and finally the Legislative, Judiciary and the Executive to take preventative and curative measures and design effective rehabilitation of victims with a supportive social system.
The recent incidents of those convicted continuing to indulge in drug dealing from within the precincts of Prisons themselves, should be prevented at all costs. Stringent security measures are to be taken in this regard.

Dealing with Jaffna Universitys Communalism
August 15 was Indias day of Independence. The Consulate General in Jaffna organised a function at India House. The programme was simple and elegant. The Indian flag was raised promptly at 9:00 am  something that we in Jaffna can learn from. A speech by the President read out by the Consul General S. Balachandran, followed by the latters own separate speech. Then a dance-drama by Jaffna Universitys Ramanathan College, and the vote of thanks. All this was culminated by a scrumptious brunch of thosai, ittaly, masala thosai, kesari and coffee/tea. Catering was by Jaffnas famous and elegant Green Grass Hotel.
Many of us look to India for leadership in advancing a secular, caring polity. President Shri Ram Nath Kovinds speech did not disappoint us. Even more exciting was Balachandrans vision for the North. Correspondence may be in Tamil he said. International flights from Palaly with Indias help are in the offing. Equipment for Jaffna Universitys engineering faculty has been provided, etc.
Culturally too Jaffna folk look to India for many things  medical treatment, universities, musical and cinematic entertainment, and temples and even churches like Annai Velankanni and the seven and a half churches built by St. Thomas for pilgrimage.
Perhaps most importantly and very current is what Mr. Balachandran mentioned about the help to fisherfolk in the Mullaitivu area  boats, fishing nets etc. One hundred and fifty fishing boats are already being built. Although he did not mentions these, refugee housing, railway tracks, etc. have already been gifted. His speech was met with a lot of applause in gratitude.
Nayaaru
Help to fishermen is a lively and current topic. The disturbed milieu among Mullaitivu fishermen flows from the relevant central government ministry giving fishing licences to fishermen from the Negombo area to fish in Mullaitivu while the resident fishermen had been displaced by the war. Now they are back. There is a lot of tension. Few Lankans are aware of the fishing rights problems in Mullaitivu.
What makes the Indian offer of boats and equipment timely and relevant is that on Monday evening there was a dispute in the Nayaaru area. The Fisheries Minister had prohibited fishing using lights because of the depletion of ocean life. However, when about 50 Sinhalese fishing boats set out with generators and lights, Tamil fishermen had stopped them. That night, Tamil fishermen had their homes set ablaze at a loss estimated at Rs. 50 lakhs by their unions (and 35 lakhs by the Disaster Management folk who used current second hand value rather than replacement value). Nine houses and fishing equipment of the residents had been destroyed.
In fear, about 50 fishermen have ceased work. The fishermen live in fear. MP Charles Nirmalanathan who drove all the way across from Mannar has stated that only 2 policemen had been provided as guards when he got there at 5:45 am on Tuesday although many more had been present earlier. No report had been recorded by the police at that time.
Only Mr. Mano Ganeshan and MP Charles Nirmalanathan have shown interest so far. The police are hiding behind fears of stoking communal fires, whereas when victims are Sinhalese the police act with full force, complains a TNA representative.
We need more generous help from India since our government seems not interested.
The Consulate Generals Carte Blanche
Mr. Balachandran arrived recently and cannot be up to speed on everything. However, he is learning quickly the situation in the North because the Tamil newspapers generally keep us well informed on that score. However, where we are all kept in the dark is the anti-Christian communalism and peninsular nationalism that have been unleashed since the end of the war. I have written widely on the former, especially at Jaffna University, and need not repeat myself here. As for the latter, suffice it to say that even R. Sampanthan from the East is fearful of exercising his leadership saying I have left Jaffna matters to my Jaffna MPs. The peninsula is a dangerous place to navigate for those who do not know us.
The Consulate gave Jaffna University a carte blanche over the dance drama, without knowing what the university is.
The Communalist Dance Drama
I do not blame the Consul but his senior officers should know full well the anti-Christian propaganda carried out in Jaffna recently about not voting for Christians, the fall-out from Indian entertainer Solomon Paapaiah being brought by the consulate for a secular event but was hosted at the Keerimalai Temple, that other religionists would not have been comfortable attending, etc. Yet, for the one entertainment item today, Jaffna University was given carte blanche.
Here is how the universitys sung-play went that lasted about an hour. People are suffering under White rulers assisted by a Tamil-Hindu Kangaani. They are beaten as they work. Then two priests, each in a Catholic/Anglican priests garb (black suit and dog collar), come with Bibles and tell the people as they happily worship in a Hindu temple, Give up your culture. Throw it away  It is wise to obey the Europeans and take on their culture. As a result some convert to Christianity and begin to dance the western ballroom dance. The girls are in knee-length frocks, conveying a deracinated image. The common people watch with worried faces. This is like in a Tamil movie I have seen  but I expect more from the Indian Foreign Service than from Kollywood.
Thereafter, Gandhi comes along and does a sit-down protest. As the protestors get walloped by Europeans and their agents, Gandhi runs away without receiving even a single shot. Then the Tamil poet Bharathiyaar comes along and sings his nationalist songs. The converts and the two priests revert to Hinduism. Barathiyaars effectiveness juxtaposed by Gandhi running away, seems one more element of peninsular nationalism.
The Chief Secretary of the Northern Provincial Council, seated on my right and a Christian, it seemed to me, was squirming in his seat. Hindu friends behind me gave me embarrassed smiles knowing what I would say.
Much of the imagery in the dance-drama is historically questionable, and is at least exaggerated if not untrue. Whether true or not, however, there is no need to insult Christians and our priests and faith. Are cultural sensitivity and accurate history being imparted at University of Jaffna
Recently there was controversy when Kampan Kalaham Jeyaraj, a man of solid reputation on matters of Tamil culture, in a newspaper interview stated that Jaffna Universitys fine arts people have retarded Tamil fine arts. Although the music and rhythms were far improved over things I have seen as a boy, I now understand what he meant. The University of Jaffna has failed as a multicultural, modern institution open to and catering to all communities, and has demonstrated that through this musical extravaganza.
Duty of the Indian Foreign Service
I do not blame Mr. Balachandran in any way for this fiasco. I believe he understands exactly what I am saying. For, this June, when the Election Commission had a parade carrying the Nandhi flag at the Jaffna Kachheri, he was shocked. He remarked to me, What is this It looks like a Hindu procession! Obviously, he did not get the support he needed from his staff. At the time when he made this remark, I was so elated think what a different country ours would be if every SLAS officer could think like him.
Does the Indian consulate and the Indian Foreign Service in general have any business undermining Indias secular ethos They should have at least previewed the play. If they did and still passed it, they would deserve a bigger indictment.
As I said, India has much to offer us. Their legacy is huge. They have friends and admirers here, both Tamil and Sinhalese. That legacy has to be safeguarded and not frittered away by giving carte blanche to communal elements, licensing them to speak unfettered for India, spreading their venomous message in the name of India.

Frolicsome  school days
I was ten years old in 1950. I clearly remember a particular incident to this day of course with sadness, because the characters in the story have passed beyond the veil. My friends and I were studying in a prestigious Jaffna College, Vaddukoddai, funded and maintained by American Missionaries.
It was my favourite past time to visit my friend Thamo Thurairatnam, in the evenings, to play with him and his relations. My friends father had just returned from the States. A trip to the States was a rare occurrence in the fifties. His father had brought with him some very colourful running shorts, at a time when running shorts were worn only by athletes and that too, only while they were running or practising. But these running shorts were meant for casual wear and the lot of them came to play with me in those colourful running shorts, much envied by me, especially when the shorts had something called a zip, unheard of those days. They would zip it up and down just to show off!
We often played rounders, if the girls were around. One evening, when the girls were nowhere to be seen, all of us climbed a Mango tree, not to pluck fruits, but just for the fun of it. Each one of us was perched on a different branch of varying heights. The one who was on the highest branch was the late Selvan Wadsworth. He thought of playing a practical joke on Thamo, who was on a lower branch. What he did was to manipulate his loose running shorts, pass a few urine drops and then shout, Adey Thamo, It s going to rain, while looking askance at the skies of passing white clouds. In that instant, Daya, Thamos younger brother, who was on a lower branch, shouted back, Yes, yes, a few drops fell on my arm just now displaying his arm as he did so!
I was the one who laughed out loud, because I had witnessed both Wadsworth in action and also Daya displaying his arm! The actual fact was never disclosed to them by Wadsworth. To this day, if somebody says in Tamil that it is going to rain, my mind goes back to the year 1950 , when it rained on Dayas arm! Later on in life, he became such a dear friend of mine and I used to call him Words worth less, which he took up with a smile!
Episode 2; The College where I studied was co-educational. For a long time, about a third of the students were girls, a good number of them being from upper and middle classes, some of them being strikingly good looking. Since our College was a prestigious one, with a famous library, impressive buildings and producing excellent exam results, it served as a show piece College and all the important visitors to the peninsula were taken to our College. To this College came a distinguished guest by name of Garret from Australia. While he was on stage, the Principal introduced him and he stood up and smiled at the audience of schoolboys and girls. When he smiled, it was followed by an automatic wink of the left eye. To us smaller boys, a wink at the other boy was a convenient and silent way of wishing him Good Morning or just Hi. But to the bigger boys it meant something more. The assembly went on and the Principal was lavish in heaping accolades on Garret. He smiled for each of the compliments and each time it was followed by an automatic wink of the left eye. At first there were only some chuckles, but the chuckles became laughter after each and every accolade. The more he smiled, the more he winked and the laughter become louder and louder. The humour of it was that there were lots of pretty girls to wink at! Once he realized that his winks were the cause of the laughter, he stopped smiling and the winks came to an end.
I for one, felt sorry that the guy had come all the way from Australia to get humiliated like that.
The Principal was clueless as to the cause of the laughter and that way we escaped a shelling from him, a strict disciplinarian that he was! This episode happened in the early fifties and dont be surprised, I still remember his face!

## Title: Gharasarapa Love Vs the Supernatural

Gharasarapa Love Vs the Supernatural
In local lore, there are a few ghosts that lurk among us. You can apparently see them if you are unfortunate enough to cross their paths. Among them are Maha Sona, Mana Mohini, Kalu Kumaraya and Reeri Yaka. My grandmother and my father were expert ghost story tellers and kept my brothers, sister and I recoiling in fear late at night. These characters figured prominently in their stories. I have read many stories that incorporated elements from these ghostly characters, but one movie I saw last week convinced me that there are many ways of looking at them.
Black Prince concept
That movie was Gharasarapa (The Lurking Serpent), another innovative outing from renowned director Jayantha Chandrasiri, who wears another hat as a senior journalist. It is a unique take on the legend of the Kalu Kumaraya (Black Prince), who generally possesses female souls. (On the other hand, Mana Mohini likes to invade male souls). Without giving out any spoilers, the story in a nutshell: Vidya and Sandares (played by Kavindya Adhikari and Devnaka Porage) meet on a pilgrimage and their love blossoms. But the Black Prince (Jackson Anthony) wants to claim her heart. However, the Black Prince cannot break through the intense human love between Vidya and Sandares. As often happens with ones first love, the duo has to go their separate ways, but the Black Prince is everywhere, even when you dont want him. Our Black Prince is not as bad as he seems to be, as Sandares discovers. You have to see the movie to discover what happens.
Chandrasiri is known for crafting movies that touch on different aspects of our lives. Each Jayantha Chandrasiri is different from the earlier one. While this is not the first time he has tackled supernatural elements on film or television, Gharasarapa is not a horror movie in the conventional sense of the word. It is actually a love story with an all-pervading sense of the supernatural. No one is likely to be scared while watching Gharasarapa which however reminds us that there is a world that we cannot see or explain.
It is a pity though that Jackson Anthony, in the titular role, gets only a little screen time to express his acting prowess. But he exploits his brief appearances to the fullest  there are also voice-only tracks where he does not appear. This is perfectly understandable, given that he is a ghost. Kamal Addaraarachchi excels in his role as the adult Sandares, whose artist wife Frankie (Ameesha Kavindi) is possessed by the Black Prince. Sangetha Weeraratne is the adult Vidya, though she also has a very limited screen time. I though the final scenes where the two adult characters meet sounded contrived  this might sound like a spoiler but Sandares should have been instantly able to identify Vidya even after 37 years if their teenage love was that strong. Nevertheless, your mileage on this scene may vary. You must see the movie to find out how and when the Black Prince comes into the scene here.
Sriyantha Mendis is a good fit for the role of Rev. Fr. Camillus Dabare, who is one of the few people who can tame the Black Prince. My only gripe about the cast is that Yashoda Wimaladharma has been totally miscast as an athuraya (patient) at a Thovil ceremony  the script should have given her a bigger role, even from a cameo perspective.
undercurrent theme
The movies timeline begins in the 1980s. Since the movies main protagonists belong to the Sinhala (Sandares) and Tamil (Vidya) communities, they cannot escape the effects of the conflict. Chandrasiri does not portray the horrors of war on-screen, but it is the main undercurrent that drives the movie. At one point, Vidya mentions that her father is fed up of paying ransom to the Boys, an euphuism for the Tigers (LTTE) and hence his decision to migrate to Canada. Sandares, of course, has no such inhibitions and yells Koti (the Sinhala word for Tigers) loud enough for everyone to hear. Vidya instantly recoils in horror at this very public uttering of the dreaded word. One wishes the movie explored this narrative a bit more, though.
Multi-ethnic storyline
This is a movie for all communities. In fact, at the Roxy (now renamed Savoy Premiere) Wellawatte where I saw the movie, there were members of every community, with a couple of foreigners too in the mix. I want to make two points here. It is a pity that the movie has so far not been subtitled or even dubbed in Tamil for exhibiting in the North and the East, given its multi-ethnic storyline. I am sure it will be well received in those regions. The English subtitling is average, with a few glaring mistakes as well. For example, when Vidya says mata oyawa nethiwei kiyala bayai, the subtitle translation is I am afraid I am going to loose you, whereas the correct word is lose. If the producers wish to do a DVD or Blu-Ray for sale abroad, primarily in countries with a large Sri Lankan Diaspora, they should re-do the subtitles and add a few other Asian and Western languages as well. The film also needs a good English dub using the same cast or even a different voice acting cast if that can be managed.
The producers deserve kudos for maintaining an authentic 80s look during those sequences.
They have been careful not to include any modern vehicles, cell phones etc for that era. For vehicle lovers like me, the well-maintained Volkswagen campervan is another highlight of the movie. The only sore point I noticed was that in one sequence, Vidya is dressed in Jeans, which were not very popular among girls back in 1980.
The cinematography is uniformly excellent. The opening scene of the lorry and VW van racing each other has been staged and photographed extremely well. The effects shots too have been done well, though not up to Hollywood standards. But in the context of the film, they do a good job.
The film has been shot digitally as far as I can tell and it shows. Some purists may mourn the absence of film grain, but for me what matters is the story, not the medium. You must see this movie in a cinema with a state-of-the-art projection and sound system to fully appreciate it. The 5.1 surround mix is good but there is room for improvement. Again, if the producers do a Blu-Ray, they should go for a full Dolby Atmos mix (theatre - 64 speakers, home - 12 speakers) that is much more immersive.
There are only two songs in the movie and they are both excellent. Hema Deyak Pene is an outstanding song penned by Chandrasiri himself and sung by Samitha Mudunkotuwa (coincidentally, young Vidya  Kavindi Adhikari is her daughter) and Bachi Susan. This song is played on two occasions in different timelines. Kalu Kumara the other song, sung by Dumal Warnakulasiriya, features Jackson Anthony on-screen.
Gharasarapa is a must-see movie. Once again, Chandrasiri has delivered an out-of the-box experience to moviegoers. Like every movie, it does have shortcomings and plot holes, but movies are not necessarily about real life. It is a thought-provoking way to spend two hours of your time and your eyes and ears  especially the ears  will thank you for it.

Going Independent
The Joint Opposition, having failed to secure the post of Opposition Leader in parliament, for a second time, has devised another strategy by which it hopes to achieve this end. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, at the very outset, gave a ruling that the JO cannot legally claim the post of Opposition Leader since it was elected to parliament on the SLFP/UPFA ticket. By virtue of the SLFP/UPFA joining hands with the UNP (which secured the majority seats at the General Election) to form a unity government, the JO, which is part of the SLFP/UPFA alliance is, therefore, excluded from claiming the Opposition Leader's post which rightfully went to the TNA which is the party with the next highest number of seats in parliament (after the SLFP/UPFA - UNP combine).
However, after a long interval, the same issue was revisited by the JO, occasioned by the exit from the government of 16 SLFP/UPFA parliamentarians, after the February LG election to make common cause with the JO, although this did not change the status quo. This bid too was shot down once again by the Speaker based on the earlier premise. Having been thwarted for the second time in its bid to secure the Opposition Leader's post, the JO members have now decided to sit as Independent MPs in parliament, believing that this would be the remedy for their interminable quest.
However, not all JO MPs will be enthusiastic about the fresh ploy. With the UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera broadly hinting about the fate that awaits the JO clique, should they decide to go Independent, panic buttons are already being pressed in the JO camp. Apparently as a face saving device, the JO has decided to appoint a committee, to decide on this whole matter of going Independent, headed by Prof. G. L. Peiris. But even the former Law Professor will know that the attempt is bound to flounder.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself is not sold on the idea, telling a group of journalists, the other day, that since it was the Speaker who had the final say, going by his (Speaker's) earlier ruling not much hope could be laid in the bid succeeding.
However, more than the Speaker, opposition to the move to go Independent is bound to come from the first time entrants to parliament from among the JO MPs such as Prasanna Ranaweera, D.V. Upul and a host of others. With disciplinary action that is bound to follow their contemplated move to go Independent and the inevitable expulsion from parliament, all the young Turks in the JO, having not yet completed five years as MPs would automatically forfeit their claim to a pension. Hence, the fresh ploy is bound to meet with fierce resistance. Not only that. The exit of the JO from parliament would see the entry of a new set of SLFP/UPFA MPs, next in line in the preference votes, who, no doubt, will be forced to toe the line of the party hierarchy. This means the new entrants will be made to join the unity government, leading to the strengthening of the Yahapalanaya regime with the addition of 70 more members to its ranks.
This will be the most likely outcome which will not be lost on the likes Prof. Peiris, who is entrusted with the task of going into the nitty-gritty of the post Independent scenario.
This is doubly so because this time the Sirisena faction of the SLFP/UPFA means business. For the JO members to leave the alliance under which they were elected they have to communicate their decision in writing to the General Secretary. Minister Amaraweera has already made his intentions clear. Speaking to the media, at a function, he said that once he receives the letters he would send them to the Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya announcing the vacation of the parliamentary seats of all the signatories. Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senartne too said that the dream of the Joint Opposition to elect their own Opposition Leader replacing incumbent R. Sampanthan would never come to fruition because they will lose their parliamentary seats immediately after they resign from their SLFP membership. He told the Cabinet news briefing on Wednesday that the government was rubbing its hands in glee waiting to see how the JO would get about the task of accomplishing its mission after the Speaker placed a tight lid on the whole matter.
Like the Minister said, JO members elected to parliament under the SLFP/UPFA umbrella and then attempt to form a majority in the Opposition, by resigning from the party, to claim the Opposition Leader's post will be sacked by the General Secretary from the party and evicted from parliament. This reality though has not dawned on the likes of Udaya Gammanpila who is all gung ho about the JO going Independent to claim the Opposition Leader's post.
What step will the JO take next to bag the coveted post, no doubt, is being eagerly watched by the public.

Good Governance Government at 3
Exactly three years ago to this date the people of Sri Lanka decided to reaffirm their commitment to democracy by giving a mandate for the formation of a National Unity Government based on the principles of Good Governance.
This marked a turning point in the countrys history as the two main parties  the UNP and the SLFP - opted to govern together for the first time. Two statesmen deserve the credit for this unprecedented transformation  President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The National Unity Government has many achievements to its credit, but the main achievement is ending the atmosphere of fear and suspicion.
The Government has ensured the freedom of expression, media freedom and the right to live without fear. One of the salient features of good governance was that President Sirisena as pledged in his political manifesto took measures to prune down the powers of the Executive Presidency while the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution helped re-establish independent commissions which function outside the influence of the Executive and handle key areas of governance like elections, public service, Police, judiciary and others. In addition, the Government fulfilling yet another long felt overdue appointed members to the Constitutional Council. However, as much remains to be done, the incumbent Government which assumed office in August 17, 2015 has taken several praiseworthy initiatives to ensure good governance in the country.
President Sirisena contested for the presidency in January 15 elections which would bring political stability to the country and embark on a much-needed reconciliation process among political and ethnic groups. The Government has already achieved remarkable progress when it comes to freedom and good governance. Under the National Unity Government, Sri Lanka has improved many places in the world media freedom index and it was a clear testimony of the democratic space enjoyed by citizens at large. The Government has shown that it is willing to listen to the citizens collective on controversial matters. The Government had adopted a tough stance on corruption  a Presidential probe was conducted into the Bond issue while another Presidential Commission is probing SriLankan and Mihin. Special courts were recently established to expedite the hearing of pending corruption cases. An anti-graft campaign is on islandwide.
The Government during its span of three years has been able to make comprehensive constitutional reforms in the country. The enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and Right to Information Bill have facilitated to make significant changes within the country's socio, economic and political fabric.
The Parliament adopted the 19th Amendment to the Constitution on April 2015 by two-thirds majority. With the enactment of 19th amendment, the powers of the Executive President were reduced and the task of making key Government appointments was entrusted upon the Constitutional Council. The 19th Amendment ensured an independent judiciary. Under the 19th Amendment, the President cannot dissolve Parliament by using his power. It brought a two-term limit for a President.
The new political culture also created an environment conducive for the journalists to perform their duties in a free and fair manner. State-orchestrated attacks on journalists and white van abductions have come to an end and the journalists have been provided with the opportunity to engage in a balanced media reporting. No journalist has been subjected to harassment since January 2015. This is bolstered by the Right to Information laws that foster a culture of transparency and accountability in public authorities by giving effect to the right of access to information and thereby promoting a society in which the people would be able to more fully participate in public life through combating corruption and promoting accountability and good governance.
The Government has also embarked a massive development drive during the last three years. The government had very rightly decided to continue with the Colombo Port City programme with a new favour as a financial hub. The Hambantota Port and Airport will be developed with overseas assistance. Colombo and the suburbs will soon be connected by a Light Rail Transit (LRT) project under the Megapolis programme. The Central Expressway linking Colombo, Kandy and later Dambulla is nearly complete. The biggest Mahaweli project, the twin Moragahakanda-Kaluganga project was recently commissioned by the President. The Governments new Grama Shakthi and Gam Peraliya programmes will herald in a rural transformation.
The Government is on track to achieve ethno-religious reconciliation. The minority ethnic groups enjoy freedom compared to the situation under the previous Government when extreme nationalist forces threatened the multi ethnic and multi religious character of our society. There is also an improvement in the field of democratic atmosphere of the country.
The National Unity Government that came to power on January 8, 2015 has taken a genuine interest in achieving reconciliation among all communities and religious groups in the country. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have been personally committed to fostering reconciliation among all communities from day one. Both of them have visited the North several times, meeting the ordinary people and solving their problems.
In fact, this Government has taken upon itself the task of implementing most of the LLRC recommendations which were either neglected or ignored by the previous one.
Its commitment to reconciliation and lasting peace has never been in doubt. Unity among different communities will be one of the main planks of the new Constitution which is slowly but surely taking shape with the participation of all Members of Parliament and other stakeholders.
The Government has allocated vast resources for health and education. In the health sector, the prices of many medicines were reduced, cancer patients get treatment for life, stents and cataract lenses were reduced in price and more facilities were given to all hospitals.
There has also been a dramatic decline in tobacco consumption in the last three years. The Government is allocating more resources to the education sector and there is a programme to provide tabs to senior students. The Government has also done a lot for the countrys labour force and targets one million jobs for the youth, which is likely to end the problem of unemployment.
The Government also ended the countrys international isolation, gaining victories at the UN Human Rights Council and fostering good relations with all friendly countries.
The Government is not flawless and there have been disagreements among the two ruling parties from time to time. It is still a new experience for the country, but we must admire the commitment of the President, the Prime Minister and many others who have been unwavering in taking the National Unity Government forward. Politics has often been described as the bane of national growth and development  hence we should strive to continue this political unity for the sake of the nation.

Indias envoy who spoke for Sri Lankas Tamils
Even as The Hindu was printing Meera Srinivasans dispatch from Colombo about Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe handing over India-built houses to 400 tea plantation worker families of Tamil origin in Sri Lankas central highlands, life ebbed out of the architect of Indias ameliorative attention to that segment of Sri Lankas population.
Veteran diplomat Thomas Abraham, who died at age 91 on August 12, 2018 in his ancestral home in the sea-board village of Kadapra, Kerala, was Indias High Commissioner in Sri Lanka from 1978 to 1982.
He was a quintessentially Nehruvian diplomat, having joined the Indian Foreign Service in the golden dawn of our first Prime Ministers first innings, and representing Morarji Desais post-Emergency government gave him little pleasure, personal or professional. Delhi does not understand the south of India, he often bemoaned to some us working under him in his Colombo office or (as in my case) in its outpost among the plantation workers in the hill-town of Kandy. Delhi sees no difference, he would say, between the Jaffna Tamil whose ancestors came here over a millennium ago bearing arms and the plantation Tamil whose forbears came just over a century ago, bearing an indentured labourers ticket. And he would then remind us of Nehrus famous statement, when told of Colombos ideas for the Tamil labourers repatriation: These people are or should be citizens of Ceylon.
A five-year stay is enough for an Indian to apply for permanent absorption in any European country, he said, But look at these plantation workers They have been here for more than a century, toiling and moiling for Ceylon, helping it earn precious foreign exchange through tea exports and now they are to be sent back to India, to a country where they have no roots left, no land, no work Sent back, virtually, to destitution, for no fault of theirs except for being were lured by the prospect of a better wage. Atrocious!
Till Nehru lived, Abraham maintained, no one could pressure him to accept their repatriation, but once he was gone, India capitulated. (Lal Bahadur) Shastri could not say No to Sirimavo and signed the Indo-Ceylon Agreement in 1964 for repatriation. Lamenting Delhis north-centrism Abraham would say Thank God, South Block has this good luck: a sound south Indian, Eric Gonsalves, in charge of its Sri Lanka policy.
Diplomats can have their opinions and interpretations of history but as diplomats they have to implement policy and Thomas Abraham did that, impeccably. The agreement on repatriation was a fact and he, like his predecessors, did all he could do carry it out in letter and spirit but with a nuance: Every Tamil family being repatriated under the agreement must get its full due in terms of gratuities, provident funds, wage arrears and until they have got those, they will not budge And they will, as prospective Indian citizens of India, countenance no harassment, no humiliation They have the rights of any Indian passport holder and we will protect those rights. In co-extensive time, he told Delhi and Madras that the rehabilitation of the repatriates was not to be left to the tender mercies of cash-grabbers and middlemen in Dhanushkodi or Rameshwaram but should be monitored closely by the authorities.
Colombo heard him
On more than one occasion, when ethnic riots broke out in the hill region, Indias plenipotentiary came into his own. He said to Colombo unequivocally that prospective Indian citizens and some who had already become Indian citizens in the highlands cannot be menaced. And Colombo heard him, with President Jayewardene personally reassuring him that nothing untoward would be allowed to happen. And though he made no secret of his historical interpretation of the Shastri-Sirimavo pact, the Grand Old Lady and he enjoyed the most cordial of relations.
Why and how did Colombo respond so positively to Abraham For this reason that Colombo also knew that in him, India-Sri Lanka relations had a true friend, Sri Lanka itself a true well-wisher and one who believed with all his mind and heart in Indias declared policy, that Sri Lankas geo-political integrity was sacrosanct.
He said in Jaffna, on a visit to the islands Tamil hinterland, that India was and always will be sensitive to the aspirations of its Tamils but only within the islands indivisibility. Saying this in Jaffna, right beside the Nallur Temple, was no small matter.
Soft-spokenness in a diplomat is about manner. Frankness in a diplomat is about substance.
Two outstanding future Foreign Secretaries of India worked under, and could be said to have been, in less or more degree, moulded by Abraham in Colombo at the time  Ranjan Mathai and Nirupama Rao, who has described him as one of our wisest and most principled diplomats.
History buff
Abrahams strong style came from having been born to a family of Syrian Christians that had been at the forefront of the national movement. The Madurai-based nationalist George Joseph (1887-1938), a close friend and colleague of K. Kamaraj was his uncle and a great influence. Abraham spent formative time with Joseph in and around Madurai, Tamil becoming virtually his alternate mother tongue.
Generating trust was a corollary of his outspoken-ness, as with Kamaraj in India and Singapores patriarch Lee Kuan Yew when Abraham headed Indias mission there. Lee refers to his conversations with Abraham in his The Singapore Story and Sunanda K. Datta-Ray gives more than a clue about it in his Looking East to Look West. One of Abrahams closest friends was P.N. Haksar, from much before PNH became all-important in the earlier phase of Indira Gandhis prime ministership. Jairam Ramesh gives crucial vignettes of this relationship in his just-published biography of PNH.
Through PNH, Mrs. Gandhi sounded Abraham for responsibilities post-retirement, including (predictably) governorships, all of which Abraham declined. One has to put a stop to office-holding, I say, he replied when I (predictably) asked him why he said no.
History fascinated Abraham, South and Southeast Asias particularly. China was an attraction, the writer Han Suyin becoming a close friend during his ambassadorship in Berne. This was due in no small part to his being married to the extraordinary and extraordinarily under-stated historian, Meera Abraham.
He was a friend of the historian Sarvepalli Gopal, with whom he shared also an instinctive commitment to Nehruvian secularism. I have lost all hope, he said to me in a recent phone call, about Indias future as a secular Republic. And then asked the uncomfortable question, Do you see any hope
I said we cannot lose hope and pointed to recent indications of democratic consolidation. I dont know I hope you are right People like me and my community the minorities those who feel religion is ones own private business and the Indian state should have nothing to do with it We are completely demoralised I see no hope Anyway I will not live to see a return to the Gandhi-Nehru-Ambedkar ideal Okay now I am tired and must turn in.

India the latest  to pay for  lack of tour  preparation
LONDON, Thursday: When India won their first series in England in 1971 they had eight first-class matches in the run-up to the first Test; this year India had one and are 2-0 down with three to play.
The 1971 India side, captained by Ajit Wadekar, whose death was announced on Wednesday, played county teams between the Tests and ended with a 1-0 win in a three-match series when, after two draws, they beat England at The Oval.
In 2018, Virat Kohlis men scheduled a solitary four-day game against Essex, which, on the eve of the fixture, was cut to three days at the tourists request.
India head into this weeks third Test at Trent Bridge with no other tour games in which players can either rediscover their form or make a case for being called-up.
Only once have a side come from 2-0 behind to win a five-match Test series, when a Don Bradman-inspired Australia beat England back in 1936/37.
For all that teams say they cherish away wins, they agree schedules that work against that goal in a sport where local conditions play such a large part.
The decline of the draw has also led to a greater number of lopsided series.
According to figures compiled by the ESPNcricinfo website, from 1960-1989 there was a 45 percent chance of a draw in Test cricket; since 2013 that figure has slumped to 18 percent. The rise of limited-overs formats, including Twenty20, means there is less incentive to learn the skills required to force a draw -- no-one gains a lucrative contract in the Indian Premier League because they can bat defensively.
Time lost to poor weather and bad light used to make draws more likely, but modern drainage and floodlights makes play possible where once it would have been halted.
Englands home Test win ratio has increased from 23 percent in the 1980s to 62 percent this decade; the corresponding figures for India are equally stark, a soaring rise from 19 to 70 percent. It may be that even if India had enjoyed more county games leading into the current series, an unusually hot and dry summer prior to last weeks second Test at Lords would have still left them ill-prepared for the classically English overcast and swing-friendly conditions their batsmen failed to cope with in an innings and 159-run defeat.
Yet it is not as if they were unaware of the potential problem.
In January, after India had lost the first two of their three Tests in South Africa, coach Ravi Shastri said: Conditions back home, we are familiar with. Here, conditions are different.
In hindsight, I would say another 10 days of practice here would have made a difference.
It is perhaps no surprise that Pakistan, whose players are effectively barred from the IPL on political grounds, have, with great credit, drawn their last two Test series in England, including a 1-1 result in a two-match contest this season.
Their lack of involvement in the IPL allowed time for training camps and several warm-up games, while this year Pakistan may well have proved pioneers in facing Ireland, for whom it was an inaugural Test, in similar conditions in Dublin prior to a tour of England.
Australia have used English-made cricket balls, which are reckoned to aid fast bowlers more than their own, in domestic matches in a bid to help them prepare for playing in England.
The proof will come in 2019 when Australia bid to end an 18-year wait for an Ashes series win on English soil.
International Cricket Council chiefs have recognised the problem of modern touring schedules but are not about to impose conditions on the number and quality of warm-up games, which are rarely money-spinners.
The simple fact is teams like Australia, India and England play so much cricket, said England coach Trevor Bayliss after the second Test.
We (England) go away and its the same, the Australian added. We play the practice matches that we do and get asked the same questions: Was your preparation right
Well, wed love to have a few more games. But there arent ten days in a week. - AFP

India mourns cricket  renaissance man Wadekar Sir
MUMBAI, Thursday: Indian cricket heroes on Thursday paid tribute to Ajit Wadekar, who led the country to their first series triumphs in England and the West Indies, following his death at the age of 77.
He will always be remembered as the renaissance man of Indian cricket, said Board of Control for Cricket in India chief executive Rahul Johri, after it was announced that Wadekar had died in hospital in Mumbai following a long illness.
The West Indies and England were two extremely strong teams and beating them in their backyard was almost impossible.
The batsman led India to their famous victories in 1971 and overall scored 2,113 runs in just 37 Test matches, including one century.
Wadekar was the first captain of Indias one-day team and he went on to become a powerbroker as coach, manager and chairman of the Indian selectors and mentor to future stars.
Indian legends from Sachin Tendulkar to Mohammed Azharuddin and Anil Kumble all paid tribute to Wadekars influence in Indias rise to become a cricket superpower.
He was someone who was instrumental in bringing out the best in us during the 90s. Well always be grateful for his advice and guidance, said Tendulkar.
Wadekar Sir, as he was known, was manager of the Indian side in which Tendulkar flourished as an opener. Azharuddin also thrived as Indias captain from 1993 to 1996 under Wadekars guidance.
Azharuddin said that Wadekar had been iconic and a father figure for me .. May his soul rest in peace.
Kumble, who made his comeback to the Indian team in a 1992-93 tour of South Africa, said that Wadekar was more than a coach to the entire team -- a father figure and a shrewd tactician.
Thank you Sir for the confidence shown in my ability! Kumble added.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Wadekars efforts for leading Indian to some of the most memorable victories in our cricketing history.
India coach Ravi Shastri paid tribute with a Twitter photo of Wadekar during his heyday as a cricketer.
Sad moment for Indian cricket to lose one of its most successful captains. Shrewd to the core. Condolences to the entire family #TeamIndia #RIPAjitWadekar, Shastri tweeted.
Bishan Bedi, the spin bowler and contemporary of Wadekar, admitted that he had differences of opinion with the great batsman but hailed Wadekar as a fine batsman who served Indian cricket with aplomb.
Wadekars funeral is to be held in Mumbai on Friday.  AFP

Wadekar was a very dear friend to me - Leo Wijesinghe
NCC stalwart and former Sri Lanka cricket official Leo Wijesinghe said that he was very sorry to hear about the death of former Indian captain Ajit Wadekar who passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday. Wijesinghe and Wadekar formed a close liaison that extended beyond four decades.
When he came with the State Bank of India team side in the seventies thats how I got friendly with him. Our friendship extends beyond 40 years, said Wijesinghe.
Ajit had a very nice personality and we were always together through good times and bad times. Whenever I wanted something from India he would send it to me. His wife and family are very close to me. I am very unhappy and very upset about his death, he said.

INDRAJIT COOMARASWAMY   Classy ruggerite, cricketer, economist and banker
Few will be more deserving to join the *Hall of Fame of SPORTS LEGENDS than INDRAJIT COOMARASWAMY.
His scholastic pedigree can be traced to our own Royal College and then to the hallowed portals of Harrow and Cambridge. An all-rounder of class he is a renowned
international economist, a stylish cricketer and a leading rugby player. And then committed to doing National Service as Sri Lankas Central Bank Governor in what one can describe as a thankless , unenviable job!
COOMARASWAMY was not only a wonderful cricketer being an all rounder,right hand batsman who had the ability and the strokes to get on top of any attack, but also a left arm spinner who could breach any opposing batsmans defence.
Jewel in his rugby crown
When it came to rugby, he was a brilliant leader and a flashy and tactical wing forward. He captained the Ceylon Rugby & Football Club (CR & FC) at a time when there were many outstanding ruggerites, but he was the chosen one for his unequaled leadership qualities.
The jewel in his rugby crown was when he led the country to glory to emerge second to mighty Japan in the 1974 Asiad played at Longden Place in 1974 before a wildly cheering full house of rugby fans.
Gallant Sri Lankan ruggerites
At the end of the game, the rugby crazy rugby fans while hailing the victory of the mighty Japanese who played like a war machine, reserved their loudest cheer for the gallant band of the countrys ruggerites led by the mercurial INDRAJIT COOMARASWAMY whose team were gallant losers in being second best in Asia.
COOMARASWAMY was hailed and respected by his club and the countrys mates for his dexterity in leading them by example--- fair to all but tough in setting a code of conduct and uncompromising when it came to quality of play. The gutty band of tough as nails epoch making ASIAD squad was  INDRAJIT COOMARASWAY (C), Nizar Hadji Omar, Alphonso Rodrigo, Jeyer Rodriguesz, Lanil Tennekoon, Dr. Maiya Gunesekera, Jeffrey de Jong, Anton Benedict, Hanzil Samad, Hafi Abdeen, Reginald Bartholomeusz, Didacus de Almedia, Omar Sharif, Mahes Sabaratnam, Shafi Jainudeen, Jeffrey Yu, Charles Wijewardena, G.B. Gunadasa and M.F.Fernando, the cream of the countrys game and truly a gutty set of rugby warriors.
COOMARASWAMY led the team to remain unbeaten with victories over Malaysia, Laos and Singapore in Group A. Group B comprised Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and South Korea.
In the first outing against Singapore, the visitors led 4-3 with 10 minutes for final whistle and with excitement mounting Lanil Tennekoon who played second rower bulls eyed a penalty from a near 40 metres.
That put Sri Lanka in the lead. Then COOMARASWAMY, in the last minute scored a try which unfortunately went unconverted to give the home team victory 10-4.
Crunch game against Malaysia
Then in the second game COOMARASWAMYS side went on a scoring spree to push aside Laos 39-3. Next came the crunch game against Malaysia which was going to be the decider of Group A. Malaysia drew first blood when Frankie Wong put right a penalty. 3-nil. Then king Charles Wijewardene that fullback for all seasons equalised with a penalty 3-3.
With half time beckoning Jeff de Jong scored a try. Wijewardene goalled the difficult looking conversion with ease to put Sri Lanka in front 9-3. After lemons a second penalty goal was scored by Wong- 9-6. Wijewardene then won the game for his country with another penalty 12-6 and a slot in the final against favourites Japan.
Although Wijewardene scored first for SL with a penalty, the Japanese bombers dominated the rest of the game to score 44 points  4 goals and 5 tries  to SLs 6  2 penalties. But Sri Lanka was not disgraced earning the resounding cheers from the full house in appreciation for gallantly
fronting up to their opponents and savoring their greatest moment in rugby.
Sri Lanka rugbys best moments
Being runners-up to Asias rugby powerhouse Japan in 1974 has been the only instance where the countrys rugby enjoyed its best moments. Although the Rugby Asiad is now matured in years, Sri Lankas rugby has not got anywhere near that sniffing distance of the 1974 Asiad. COOMARASWAMY and his rugby warriors, looking back can bask in that glory which has since not been achieved.
From rugby we move on to COOMARASWAMYS excellence in cricket luverly cricket. His ability in cricket was such that at the age of 14 he played first eleven cricket for Harrow at the holy land of cricket Lords against rivals Eaton. It did not take long for him to be appointed captain of Harrow and in the 1968 against Eton he steered his team to a 7 wicket triumph. He had a match bag of 12 for 92 with career best figures of 12 for 92  7 for 42 to skittle out Eton for 210 and 141 in the second with figures of 5 for 50 with his biting left arm leg spinners. He could manage only 34 and 8 with the bat, however.
Heroics at Tamil Union
Coming home COOMARASWAMY played for the Tamil Union which club his uncle Sathi shone. Playing in division one cricket for the Lakspray Trophy as vice captain to S.Skandakumar the cricketer of Royal repute, the Tamil Union were unfortunate to lose that final to Bloomfield on a technical point in 1983.
Skandakumar is now Sri Lanksa High Commissioner in Canberra also overlooking Papua New Guniea. Once in a Sara trophy game on their home ground COOMARASWAMY and Skandakumar put on a stand of 154 to win the match against CCC after being in a precarious situation. COOMARASWAMY hails from a distinguished pedigree of achievers . He was born on April 3, 1950. His father Rajendra Coomaraswamy  famously known as Roving Raju was a civil servant of class. That class does not exist in that service any more.
INDRAJIT has one sister Deshmanaya RADHIKA who was the Under Secretary-General of the United Nation, Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict until July 13, 2012. Kofi Annan, then Secretary General appointed her to that position in April 2006. She was nominated to the Constitutional Council Sri Lanka  as a civil representative on September 10, 2015.
Going down the family tree his grandfather C. COOMARASWAY was a civil servant. His uncle Sathi Coomaraswamy was a devastating swing bowler who played for Royal College and All Ceylon under the captaincy of Mahadevan Sathasivam and later captained All Ceylon was a Tamil Union stalwart.
The Tamil Union club has rightly honoured Sathi with a stand in his name at the Colombo Oval. Sathi served on the committee to select the Schoolboy cricketer of the year for many years when I was Sports Editor of The Times of Ceylon. Sathi also served as a selector of the countrys cricket and headed that committee.
He learnt from books and men at Royal
INDRAJIT at Royal College, before joining Harrow School in England, showed his initial prowess in cricket when he captained Royals junior team and then proceeded to lead Harrow School in 1967 and 68 and sported the schools rugby colours for three years. Joining Emmanuel College, Cambridge University he excelled in studies where he obtained BA Hons and a degree in MA. He was a standout cricketer at Cambridge University in 1971 and 1972. After finishing up at Cambridge he joined University of Sussex where he obtained a DPhildegree.
COOMARASWAMY has many feathers in his cap as ruggerite, cricketer, brilliant economist and banker. The County could not have found a shining star of such calibre to captain the CENTRAL BANK. Meritocracy at its best.
COOMARASWAMY is married to Tara de Fonseka and blessed with two children Imran and Arjun.

## Title: Magic with Mermaids

Magic with Mermaids
One might think mermaids were mythical creatures created by children and the imaginations of great writers, but not so in Sri Lanka, where numerous sightings have been claimed over the centuries of half-woman-half-fish-like characters. Do a bit of digging and there are even some interesting unexplained photos of fishy human-like creatures lying on rocks - even one or two sightings far out to sea - if you talk to the coastal fishermen. One hotelier, who probably also loved the 1980s film with hotter than hot Daryl Hannah playing the mermaid in Splash, decided to create a beautiful property, overlooking the ocean, in the holy of holies, Kalutara, with two swimming pools, with a separate fantastic games area, including water polo, croquet and pumping daily water aerobics. For those of you who do not want to pump up the action, you can also relax and enjoy the SPA treatments, which include having your face covered in green tea and, henceforth, looking years younger as it puts the elasticity back into the skin.
Here at The Mermaid Hotel by Jetwing, staff, some of which have been with the property for 26 years, pride themselves on repeat bookings because here relaxation is a way of life and mermaids do really exist. Well, if you believe the barman who serves up a lethal mermaid cocktail at sunset, with floating fruit pieces that look like coral the colour of a mermaid - greeny blue and totally delicious. The barman, Prasanna, with the cheekiest of grins, also has the power of magic at his finger tips and, with a well-worn Sports Direct stack of playing cards, will have you bewildered as to how he does it. Pick a card anywhere in the pack, he says cheekily. He then names every single one of the cards, even moving the pack to different places and shuffling them several times. Suddenly, I realised I was in the world that lies between the known and the unknown. The magical journey of tricks includes a cocktail shaker, which you can bang on anything you like to see if it has a concealed compartment inside - once checked a coin vanishes from the bar and seconds later is found inside the sealed container.
Is this real magic or the result of drinking the arrak-based coconut cocktail with fresh passion fruit juice, blue syrup and fresh pineapple, mixed with a bit of sliced mango to make it refreshing It is hardly surprising, after a couple of these delicious drinks, that people have claimed to have seen mermaids on the beach, and part of the fun of being at the hotel is trying to find one. Twice a week, a local artist takes master classes, for the kids, in drawing and painting in the main pavilion, which they love, as they get to sketch and paint mermaids or passing whales - another theme popular with those staying at the resort.
Every morning, after a delicious breakfast overlooking the pool, one can check the board for the days activities and events, along with using the gym and all the other facilities managed by the hotels three energetic motivators. I do an energetic water keep-fit session at 11 am and can see, as I jump up and down, what fun it all is. I realise, talking to people in the afternoon tea snack area, that this is just one of the many reasons that the place has so many repeat bookings, along with great food, and staff like to have a giraffe laugh as they put it in cockney rhyming slang.
The hotel also organises excellent city and temple tours and, on your return, they love you to indulge in the in-house The Sahana Spa, where you can have an energizing massage or full body treatment for removing the days impurities and opening up any blockages caused by stress in the body. The SPA team has also worked together for more than eight years and, even travelling long distances to and from work, cant imagine working anywhere else, as they love the spirit of the place. It is like an extension of their community, which the guests feel when they are doing yoga overlooking the beach or bending it like Beckham with a spot of tropical football. Kids love the way the staff get them treats, let them run free and are always on hand to teach them fun new activities while mum has a manicure or a romantic candle-lit dinner of lobster on the beach or by the main pool before heading to the in-house disco.
The Mermaid Hotel by Jetwing loves to do creative things whether it is one off dinners, weddings, birthday parties with a twist or group hires. I am amazed, with so many hotels to pick from in the area, that so many people have returned ten, twelve and, in one case, fifteen times. That, in itself, speaks volumes about the personality of this stand-out holiday destination.
So, you have fun, get fitter, eat great food, and see mermaids  well, if you are prepared to do one of the master art classes twice a week.

Manufacturing  Sector PMI dips
The Manufacturing Sector PMI decreased to 57.2 index points in July 2018 from 57.6 index points observed in the previous month.
The marginal slowdown observed in manufacturing activities in July was mainly driven by slowdown in employment due to the difficulties in replacing unskilled employees to account for high labour turnover especially in the Food and Beverages, and Textiles and Apparel sectors.
Moreover, new orders in July 2018 slightly slowed down. However, production and stock of purchases show some improvement, especially in manufacturing of chemicals and pharmaceutical products with the expected positive outlook for the next three months.

Mega Pharma launches Dengue Combo Kit
In a bid to curtail the increasing number of dengue victims in Sri Lanka, Mega Pharma (Pvt) Ltd, launched the CareStart Dengue Combo Kit with Dr. Byoung Don Han doing the introductory to the local doctors.
The CareStart Dengue Combo Kit will be the ideal solution to detect if an individual is diagnosed with dengue at a very early stage with results guaranteed in a matter of 20 minutes.
The project in Sri Lanka was initiated Mega Pharma headed by Shirantha Peries. The establishment announced its newest product which entered to the companys portfolio, the Access Bios CareStart Dengue Combo Kit. The launch ceremony held at the Waters Edge Hotel in Battaramulla, was graced by the representatives of both organisations as well as local doctors.
The dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and more than one-third of the worlds population is at risk for infection. With no vaccines available to prevent infection with the dengue virus, early diagnosis and prompt supportive treatment could substantially lower the risk of medical complications and even death.
Wells Bio CEO Dr. Byoung Don Han explained that the CareStart Dengue Combo Kit provides a qualitative rapid diagnostic test that can simultaneously detect dengue virus in all clinical stages using both dengue NS1 antigen and anti-dengue antibodies (IgM/IgG) with one device.
The kit also provides a diagnosis of dengue infection from acute to convalescent stage, and the detection of all four dengue serotypes from serum, plasma, or whole blood, Dr. Byoung Don Han stated.
Chairman and Managing Director of Mega Pharma (Pvt) Ltd, Shirantha Peries explained:
The Mega Pharma Group of Companies has registered the CareStart Dengue Combo Kit, since it detects two parameters, that is the primary infection and the secondary infection at the same time. Therefore the chances of missing dengue fever whether, its primary, secondary or even mixed infection, is very remote and almost not possible, but through that the amount of lives that will be saved in this country is our objective.
Formed in Somerset in New Jersey, USA in 2001, Access Bio Inc conducts research, development projects, manufacturing process and trades vitro rapid diagnostic tests, biosensors, and molecular diagnostic products throughout the globe.
With its Korea-based division, Wells Bio Inc, which possesses state-of-the-art research and development facility, Access Bio Inc manufactures over 120 million rapid diagnostic tests annually for the detection of a range of infectious diseases, including malaria, dengue and HIV.

The TEJC mango is the worlds largest mango, with an average weight of 600 grams. This mango variety was created by Ellawala and the late Dr. Juan Carlos from the Philippines.
With the help of the Agriculture Department and late Dr. Carlos, Ellawala was able to register the mango as TEJC.
Currently, there is a huge demand for TEJC mangoes, both in the local and international market.
The tree yields fruits throughout eight months of the year, and unlike other native species, it is a regular bearer of fruits.
TEJC has been recommended for the Dry and Intermediate Zones of the country by the Agriculture Department.

Exactly three year ago, the people went to the polls to reaffirm the mandate given to the two major political forces in the country to work together. President Maithripala Sirisena who won the Presidential Election in January 2015 had already appointed UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister.
The agreement between the two major political parties in the country following the 2015 August General Election is unparalleled in the countrys 70 years of post-independence politics.
This Government did have a 100 day programme which managed to accomplish many promises made during the election period. They thus urged the people to give them a bigger mandate on August 17, 2015.
The public did reaffirm their faith in this Government of Unity and Consensus, also known as the Yahapalana (Good Governance) Government. In essence, the new Government had pledged to reverse the dictatorial course of the former Rajapaksa Government and grant freedom to State institutions whose freedom had come under attack, save Sri Lanka from international isolation and develop the economy which had reached abysmal depths.
The Government soon after assuming office embarked on a process of accountability, restorative justice and reconciliation and repairing its damaged image internationally. As a result of these endeavours, Sri Lanka has now become a respected member of the International Community.
The Government has also largely succeeded in restoring public confidence in State institutions including the judiciary and the police. The key to this change was the 19th Amendment, which was one of the key pledges of the new Government. It set Presidential term limits, pruned certain powers of the Executive Presidency and restored the independence of Government institutions. The Government delivered on its core promises. The Independent Commissions were established, Right to Information Act came into effect, established an Office of Missing Persons etc.
The proposed new Constitution will enable Sri Lankans to project one identity under one nation. Development has not been forgotten.
The Megapolis Initiative in the Western Province is a major project that will make an overall resurgence in the province. After a thorough review, the Port City project initiated by the former Government with Chinese funding has been totally transformed as a Financial City to attract more investors. The Government also announced a new economic policy that will augment the development process.
Recent initiatives such as the Gamperaliya programme to develop villages and Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme proposed in the 2018 budget to create entrepreneurs and boost domestic private investment has been much appreciated by the public.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at a public function last week said the government has stabilised the economy and managed the countrys debt burden systematically. Also the government has pledged to establish 2,500 Uda Gammana villages by 2020 to address the housing needs of the people and the results so far show it is well on course to achieve it.
Also investigations and legal proceedings into acts of fraud and corruption alleged to have been committed by prominent members of the former regime have been accelerated and already some have been punished for their misdeeds.
Three years is a relatively short time to make a proper assessment of a new governments record in office. Usually, the first year is devoted to consolidating power while the second and third year is the time when it gets down to business in earnest.
Considering this, there is a lot to be happy with the turn of events and the changes wrought that has impacted positively on the citizenry. There can be no doubt that there is a discerning sense of freedom and an air of well being among the general public during the past three years.
The Yahapalanaya government in the short span of three years under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has displayed the will to succeed. While settling the mountainous debt, left behind by the Rajapaksa administration, it has taken determined strides to rebuild the economy and also usher in prudent development that would bring beneficial returns to the country.
The President and Prime Minister have already declared that the next two years will usher in a development revolution in the country and the Yahapalanaya government is unshakable and would run its full course.

New drug testing agency aims to restore trust in sport
Lausanne, Thursday: The new International Testing Agency will regain the trust of athletes and fans who lost faith in the fairness of sport after a series of doping scandals, the bodys director-general told AFP.
The idea to create the ITA was conceived at the height of the Russian doping scandal that saw evidence emerge of egregious cheating orchestrated by Moscow during the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.
Under intense pressure, the International Olympic Committee insisted the sporting world needed a fully independent testing agency that could back-stop federations and national anti-doping labs, which had proven vulnerable to manipulation.
The ITA started operating in Lausanne just over a month ago and it is, managing-director Benjamin Cohen said, already providing services to 30 federations and would strive to build its portfolio -- including testing responsibility for the next World Cup, if FIFA agrees.
We are coming out of a rather complicated period, since the Sochi Olympics, Cohen told AFP at the agencys headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The ITA will be there to regain the trust of the athletes and the fans if they have lost it, he said, adding that the body will work to earn trust, respect and loyalty of our partners.
But the ITAs ability to attract partners was, at the outset, an open question.
Some federations indicated a desire to keep control of their own testing in collaboration with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which does not conduct tests but is tasked with ensuring that national labs comply with global doping protocols.
Cohen said partnerships with the boxing, judo and table tennis federations demonstrated the ITA is gathering momentum. He also highlighted the decision by United World Wrestling, which governs amateur wrestling, this week to hand over its full anti-doping programme to the ITA. But big fish like FIFA, athletics governing body IAAF and cycling federation UCI -- which manages a sport devastated by high-profile doping -- have not yet signed on.
I havent heard (FIFA, IAAF and UCI) saying they dont need the ITA, Cohen said.
But he noted that the battle against doping pre-dates the ITA and some federations remain confident in their internal systems.
We have to respect that, but I believe that they will see by themselves that the ITA will be a trusted expert partner on which they can count, he added.
Im hoping, that in the short term or mid-term, well be able to work for UCI, athletics or FIFA.
He stressed that the ITA would be delighted to handle testing for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, as it would give football fans the guarantee that there is a totally independent (anti-doping) programme in place for the worlds premier sports event.
The ITA will face its first major trial at the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires in October, before focus will immediately turn towards enforcing drug-free Games in Tokyo in 2020. AFP

Bus strike a flop:
NEW TRAFFIC FINES TO STAY
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva stated yesterday that the new fines aimed at reducing road accidents will not be changed or removed under any circumstances.
Briefing the media in Colombo yesterday, Minister de Silva said that the traffic fines were amended after 13 years, along with the introduction of several new categories of traffic offences. Even though the new fines were effective from January this year, several bus unions are opposing them only now.
The Minister said that all road users need to maintain discipline and those who wish to get the new fines revoked actually want to escape punishment after committing traffic offences. There will be no fines for anyone if the road rules are followed, he pointed out.
We gave a time period for private bus associations to submit their objections. Most of them agreed with the new traffic rules. After it has become a law of the land, no one can raise objections. It is not possible to change any Act after being passed in Parliament, he said.
The strike which was launched on Wednesday by a certain private bus association against the new traffic fines is completely unsuccessful, he added. We are ready to face any strike launched by any bus or railway trade union. It is only the bus crew who are involved in the strike and not the bus owners. It is reported that the strike is being held in only two provinces. If the private bus strike causes further inconvenience to commuters at rush hour, we will deploy the Army to run the buses, he added.
Meanwhile, ACPBWA Co-Convener U.K. Renuka said the strike action was successful. He said only 20 per cent of the private buses were operated, mostly by bus owners themselves.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday thanked the private bus operators including drivers and conductors who did not join in the bus strike yesterday, because of the ongoing Advanced Level examination.
He said certain trade unions with vested interests are launching strike actions inconveniencing the public during the Advanced Level examination period.
We are ready to give an ear to the grievances of trade unions who are working for the betterment of the country, Kariyasam said. The Minister was of the view that the trade unions are trying to gain a political mileage by launching sudden wild cat strikes causing inconvenience to the public.
Certain groups have become a cats paw of bankcrupt politicians, he said.

No room for renewed conflict in North - Governor
There is no room for the recurrence of an armed conflict in the North even though a weapon or two may be detected from time to time, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray said.
He added that there wont be another war in the North like in the past which wreaked havoc in the country. Nobody will be ever allowed to create a war situation in the North again.
The Northern Province Governor made these remarks while addressing a public welfare programme at the Mullaitivu public grounds recently.
It was organised by Security Forces Headquarters in Mullaitivu under the guidance of Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha Thera. Women and differently abled persons engaged in self-employment projects in the Mullaitivu district were provided material aid by the Bodhiraja Padanama of Mullaitivu Security Forces Headquarters under this programme.
It has been reported that a few firearms have been detected in the Rameshwaram area of Mullaitivu by the Security Forces recently. No room will be left for another armed conflict even if a weapon or two is detected from time to time in the North and East, Governor Cooray said.
He added that finding a weapon is nothing new to an area that was subjected to a 30-year terrorist war.
The Security Forces have been maintaining a peaceful atmosphere and a cordial rapport with the Northern people after eradicating LTTE terrorism. The Blood Banks of the hospitals in the North and East are filled with the blood of Tri-Forces personnel and Police officers. These personnel are predominantly Sinhala, the Governor said.
The Governor asked the Northern politicians whether there is any issue when the blood of two ethnic groups is mixed. He added that several ancient Sinhala kings got married to women who came from Madras. Moreover Muslim merchants who came to the country had married Sinhala or Tamil women and stayed here. When considering these historical happenings, it is observed that the blood of Sri Lankans have been mixed from ancient days. He further said that Sinhala Police officers are providing security to all the Tamil politicians living in the North. Regardless whether these Tamil politicians are represented in Parliament or at the Provincial Council, Sinhala officers are providing them security, he noted.
The Governor further said that Security Forces personnel are holding an Olive branch instead of a weapon now.

One year for Singapore-SL FTA amendments
People should not be anxious about the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and Singapore since there is a one year period to bring any necessary amendments, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
There is a specific clause in the FTA which says that both parties can propose any amendment to the agreement within one year, the Minister said. Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, Minister Samarasinghe said that some groups are trying to gain political mileage by levelling baseless criticisms and allegations.
Claiming that the local industries will face serious consequences as a result of the FTA, they asked the Government to abolish the current agreement.
But, there is no need to abolish the FTA since we can bring the necessary amendments, the Minister said.
We have to wait for two months to take any decision with regard to the FTA since the report of the Independent Committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to carefully study the FTA is scheduled to be submitted to the President within the next two months.
As mentioned by Development Strategies and Internal Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, the FTA has already come in to force. But there is a chance for both parties to bring amendments to it.
So, if Sri Lanka feels that the agreement needs to be amended in some way, we can propose that. That is an agreed provision. That is why the President has appointed a committee to carefully study the agreement and submit a comprehensive report comprising proposals and recommendations, he added.
This decision has been taken after considering the diverse views being expressed by various groups regarding the agreement. In doing so, the President has again shown that he is a sensitive leader who respects public views, Minister Samarasinghe said.
The Committee is chaired by former Colombo University Vice-Chancellor Deshamanya Professor W. D. Lakshman and also consists of former Professor of Economics at the Open University Prof. Sirimevan Colombage, former Professor of Economics of the University of Kelaniya Prof. Ajitha Tennakoon, Economic Consultant Dr. Sanath Jayanetti and former
Central Bank Assistant Governor R.A. Jayatissa.
Responding to a question by a journalist, Minister Samarasinghe said that there is no legal barrier to sign a Free Trade Agreement without presenting it to Parliament. But, all MPs received a copy of the agreement and they can propose any amendment to the agreement. All the MPs cannot be in the Cabinet.
According to the Constitution, it is required to get a two thirds majority in Parliament to sign some agreements but not for the FTAs. But it is better to include FTAs to the category of agreements required to be presented to Parliament in the future when bringing amendments to the Constitution, the Minister said.
This FTA is not a personal agreement of Minister Malik Samarawickrama. It is unfair to criticise him since as the subject Minister, he has followed all the legal procedures when signing the agreement. Therefore, the entire Cabinet is responsible for this FTA, Minister Samarasinghe said.
Singapore and Sri Lanka signed the FTA on January 23 seeking to deepen economic ties and facilitate greater trade flows between the two countries.
The Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) was signed by Singapores Minister for Trade and Industry S. Iswaran and Minister for Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama. Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and President Maithripala Sirisena witnessed the signing in Colombo.
This agreement was approved by the Cabinet on January 16, 2018 after receiving the Attorney Generals opinion and was signed within a week on January 23.

Patali challenges JO MPs to resign from UPFA
Although members of the Joint Opposition tried to display heroism in public by pledging to resign from UPFA membership and remain independent within Parliament, they are afraid to do so fearing they may lose their Parliamentary membership, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. No one can realise the dream of becoming President without obtaining more than fifty percent of the total number of votes cast, he said. Minister Ranawaka was addressing a meeting after laying foundation stones for several development projects at the Sri Dalada Maligawa Complex in Kandy on August 15.
Ranawaka said Singapore or any other country could not dump radioactive waste in Sri Lanka because the Atomic Energy Authority had blocked it by fixing detection equipment at the Colombo Port 10 years ago.
The Atomic Energy Authority had wide powers to take action against radioactive substances within the country. Referring to the clinical and other waste dumped in India that had washed ashore in Mannar, Minister Ranawaka said Sri Lanka should take diplomatic action with India to resolve this issue.
A people environmentally friendly waste disposal system was urgently needed for both India and Sri Lanka he emphasized, pointing out that a large amount of clinical waste disposed in Kandy found its way into the Mahaweli River through the Meda Ela (Central Canal).
He said that even though the Rajapaksa family members knew how to spend money by obtaining even commercial loans from abroad they did not know to properly manage a single government department or institute profitably.
Their knowledge of financial management is evidenced by the Hambantota Port, Mattala Air port and the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka which had turned out to be white elephants.

Pre fabricated terminal for BIA
A pre fabricated terminal will be set up at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) soon, an official from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said.
He said there was a mega plan to build a terminal at BIA but it had to be suspended due to many reasons. Due to the high cost of a permanent terminal and time duration it takes to built it, the authorities opted for a pre fabricated terminal which would be around Rs. 400 million.
The Ministry has now decided to shoulder the financial burden of building the new terminal. The tender process in this connection is yet to be finalized.
Once the tender procedure is finalized the new terminal would be installed in less than six months, the official said.
Currently the BIA has around 300 aircraft movements per month and delays are being experienced due to insufficient facilities some times. With a new terminal the passenger movement issues can be eased out to a greater extent. It would also support for domestic operations from BIA, the official said.
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation has reopened the Batticalo airport with a new terminal and better facilities. In a bid to promote tourism, the government has taken steps to develop domestic airports. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently said there are plans to set up a third International Airport that will be constructed in Hingurakgoda as part of the development plan for Trincomalee.
Trincomalee would be re-positioned as the Eastern Tourism Hub with increased regional connectivity realized through the Colombo-Trincomalee economic corridor development and the proposed Hingurakgoda International Airport, the PM said.
The premier also said that both Palali and Iranamadu Airports too would be redeveloped with better facilities to accommodate more domestic flights.
Local domestic airline operators including - Cinnamon Air which operated scheduled domestic flights, Simplifly -Sri Lankas most experienced domestic and domestic airline that operator, FlySouthern, IWS Aviation and Sakurai are planning to increase investments to develop the domestic air travel in the future, the official from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said.
He said that they have also received more inquires on operating licenses from local companies.
Chairman Simplifly, Suresh Mirchandani said they have brought down a brand new 10-seater Kodiak aircraft.
We want a better commitment from the government with regard to facilities that are being offered for domestic airlines before we commit on a scheduled domestic airline operation.
Hayleys PLC Chairman and Chief Executive Mohan Pandithage lauds any effort to boost travel and tourism in Sri Lanka however the group clarified that they were not currently exploring any form of investment in a domestic airline at this time.

President provides sustainable solutions to Wayamba water issue
A mega development project is being implemented at present to fulfill the water needs of the people in the Wayamba Province, ending a long-term water shortage, under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Even though various irrigation projects were implemented in the country, the people in the Wayamba Province had faced difficulties as the past governments failed to provide a solution to their water issue, the Presidents Media Division stated in a release.
The living standard of the people in the region decreased as farmers suffered from the lack of water for their cultivations and the drinking water shortage led to the proliferation of kidney diseases.
President Sirisena, as a leader who understood the pulse of the people, took steps to re-implement the abandoned projects, the release said.
In 2016, the Wayamba Ela project was launched under the guidance of the President to provide a solution for the water shortage for irrigation lands during both seasons.
Eight large-scale tanks and 353 small tanks would be developed under this project to facilitate irrigation for 12,500 farm lands in both seasons. The project will provide direct dividends to 13,500 farmer families and indirect benefits to another 80,000 farmer families.
Fifty percent of the first stage of the project, costing Rs. 16,000 million, implemented under the Mahaweli Water Security and Investment Project, was successfully completed. The second stage of diverting Mahaweli river water of the Eastern province to the northern region will commence under the Presidents patronage on August 24.
The surplus water of the Nalanda reservoir is being diverted towards the Wamadilla reservoir. Under the first stage, infrastructure will be provided to carry water towards the Wamadilla project and Devahuwa reservoir, and to carry Mahaweli water and the Nalanda reservoir water to the Kurunegala district.
Under the second stage, it is expected to build facilities and infrastructure to construct canals to channel water of the Kurunegala district towards the small river systems of Polpitigama, Ahatuwewa, Galgamuwa and Mahawa, and to send the water of the Mahaweli River towards the Bowattenna reservoir towards Dambulu Oya and to channel this water towards the canal systems built at the first stage.
Meanwhile, under the mega plan to renovate 2,400 tanks in the rural areas under the Ellanga system, the reconstruction of 353 tanks in the North Western province will also commence under the patronage of the President.
Thus, 91 tanks in the Ahatuwewa Divisional Secretariat division, 119 tanks in the Polpitihgama Divisional Secretariat division, 107 tanks in the Mahawa Divisional Secretariat division, 30 tanks in the Galewela Divisional Secretariat division, one tank at the Palagala Divisional Secretariat division and five tanks in the Dambulla Divisional Secretariat division will be developed.
The people appreciated the programme initiated by President Sirisena to provide a permanent solution to a bitter experience they faced for a long time regarding the water shortage, the Presidents Media Division stated in the release.

Dutch artists Maico Arts and Ben Jonkman teamed with Danish builders Klaus Hansen, Lasse Deleuran, Brian Soholm Larsen and Elena Dimitrova to build the Rube Goldberg-esque contraption, which takes 40 minutes to carry a single ball all the way through, at Lego World Denmark in Copenhagen.
The great ball contraption, defined by Guinness World Records as a device made of Lego Technic components that carries a ball through a series of modules, was awarded the world record after it was recorded functioning properly with 259 modules. Building just one module can take from a few hours to several weeks, or even month depending complexity and size, Arts said.
Everyone who builds great ball contraption modules builds them on their own and at home, and then we put them together in one circuit.
Arts has held the record four times, most recently reclaiming it from a 197-module contraption constructed by Dalian Boca Education & Technology Co. in July 2016.

We have to admire the service of SLTB workers. They worked hard even sacrificing their lives during several unjustifiable strikes launched by some other services.

Sri Lanka to be Indian Oceans principal focus: PM
The Mahavihara Conservation Project had been launched under the supervision of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and under the guidance of the Maha Sangha, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
This is in keeping with my pledge as Prime Minister in 2001 and the subsequent election pledge during President Maithripala Sirisenas election campaign, he added.
He was addressing a daham hamuwa to mark the opening of a parapet wall and stone pond at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and the laying of the foundation stone for the Lovamahapaya renovations in Anuradhapura, on Tuesday.
The governments objective was to transform Sri Lanka into the focal point of the Indian Ocean in the same manner Anuradhapura became the focal point of the Indian Ocean in the past, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the main objective of the Maha Vidharaya Conservation Project was to revive and protect Sri Lankas heritage. Anuradhapura was not only a Sinhala or Sri Lankan heritage, but also a world heritage. The number of tanks in and around Anuradhapura was testimony to its ancient glory as a centre of Buddhism and trade in Asia.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government had spent Rs.500 million on the Mahaviharaya Project. Another sum of Rs.2.5 billion had been set apart for the Central Cultural Funds activities, including Buddhist and Archaeological activities, while the Prime Ministers office had spent an additional Rs.500 million on Buddhist activities.
The Presidents Fund, as well as the Buddhasasana Fund, had also spent similar amounts for the same purpose. No other government in the countrys history had spent as much as the present one had for the development and propagation of Buddhism, he said, adding that it was everyones duty to strive towards making Sri Lanka the centre of the Buddhism in the world again.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the proposed Trincomalee Development Plan was handed over to the government by the Singaporean company Subana Jurong, about one-and-a-half months ago.
The project would take another decade or one-and-a-half decades to be completed. But we should undertake the job as a must, the Prime Minister said, adding that in place of the Mantota Port, the government was developing the Colombo Port.
The Central Highway was being built up to Kandy and it would be later extended to Trincomalee. The government was undertaking the work by taking the ancient Anuradhapura city as an example, he said.
The country would be developed by making use of the ports situated around it. International trade should be established on the lines of the trade which flourished during the Polonnaruwa period. Sri Lanka had to keep pace with other Asian countries in the development field, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said that the country had overcome its most difficult times during the past three years. The government had to manage the economy, ease the debt burden, and create employment avenues during that period.
There is no point in talking of Sinhala and Buddhist identities merely for political purposes when canvassing votes. Every Sri Lankan should be able to understand our origin, he said, In the same way countries such as China, England and France speak about their past, we too, should be able to portray our ancient civilisation to the outside world.
He said that a group of persons, including university dons, had submitted a report regarding the setting up of an institute of history at his request, adding that after further discussions with them, he would take steps to set up the institute by an act of Parliament.
The Prime Minister also praised the services rendered by late President J. R. Jayawardene, late Minister E. L. B. Hurulle and former Central Cultural Fund Director-General Dr. Roland Silva, for laying the groundwork for the Mahavihara Conservation Project.

Strength of togetherness
The destiny of Sri Lanka is being wrought by its households and school rooms even though insufficient attention is being paid to this important fact.
The Prime Minister has stated that the government is intent on providing a basket of goodies that could be covered by the family budget of working-class families. It is indeed laudable that a Family Budget Unit will be of help in the sphere of the home economy of families to look into solving the economic issues faced by families in the country and look into a familys expenditure, income and the ways in which the countrys economy impacts individual families as the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said speaking at the new Family Budget Unit of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs which would look into the family economy which held its inaugural meeting at Temple Trees some time ago.
As the Prime Minister pertinently observed the cost of living, while needing to emphasize on essential food items, today, home expenditure includes not only essential foods, it includes many other expenses: transport, clothes, tuition fees, telephone bills, rent, pre-school fees, etc And some families spend more money on these than food. The Prime Minister had further said, We have prepared a developing economy for the people so that they can live. We have given them many concessions and we will take a look at these once again and the government will adjust these subsidies according to the available finances. This will be important for the new unit. (Daily News, Friday, February 9, 2018).
Sense of family responsibility
Yet, it needs to be understood that a seemingly solid economic base to ensure solving the economic issues faced by families will only lend itself to the possibility of solving some issues faced by families. That means that the financial cover alone will not ensure a secure, socially viable and civically and physically healthy family. While the financial cover needs to be provided, the person/s handling the finances should be able to see to its proper expenditure on the various objects and matters for which the finances are meant.
Many families that have financial and economic security yet break down because of other factors, relationships breaking down and illicit, immoral, selfish intrusions creeping into stable marriages. The rotten fringes of the decadent middle and upper classes and the rich blindly accept these illicit alliances and approve of them.
There are also not only familied couples with children but also widows and widowers who earn three hundred thousand rupees and more a month who are so miserly that they do not even spend for the clothes needed by the children. They are worshippers of mammon who do not know their parental duties nor the values of life to live by. Such people are also least concerned about a poor relative or a neighbour in dire need. These have to be brought to their senses that they may live humanly.
It is very vital that there be a solid sense of family and moral responsibility on the part of the husband and wife, for the initial, young and growing family so that the available finances will be properly apportioned and spent while a portion is systematically set apart for an unexpected and unavoidable contingent expenditure and for the inevitable rainy day. As the children grow, some of them even in childhood reach a sense of responsibility.
There was a very poor widow with two girls of eleven and nine years of age. When the children who were in a Convents small orphanage of fifteen girls managed by nuns went back home for the holidays, they found that thieves had robbed the meagre belongings of kitchen utensils they had. The two poor children saw that their mother was in a dilemma; even the iron disc on which the roti was roasted had been robbed. The two children went out of the small hut, huddled together for a while and came back and told the mother, Amma, dont be sad about not being able to give us a roti to eat. We will be satisfied with a cup of plain tea without sugar. The children had imbibed some values of life from their poor mother and from the nuns of the orphanage.
Many mess-up marriage
Not all getting married are inwardly equipped, psychologically, emotionally, morally, spiritually and economically, and ready to responsibly handle the varied situations and eventualities that crop up in married and family life. While many consider the breakdown of a marriage and family life as a sad event which could have even been avoided, some highly educated people in the highest echelons of their professions and highly placed politicians who have been abysmally unprepared for married and family life, go to endless lengths to justify their irrational and despicable actions.
Among these are also legal luminaries to whom self-evident values need further proof. They make a mess of their own marriage and family and destroy that of others. Funnily and tragically they become socially insensitive and irresponsible that their indifference to moral values is appalling.
Those getting married should be helped to find meaning in a loving partnership in life with a spouse and in raising a family through procreating and the upbringing of children. In finding meaning one gets energized and motivated in that forward flow of inner energy to achieve goals that one sets with great sobriety for oneself.
Indifferent agencies of state
The situations of life with children add burdens on the married couple. The enfeeblement or death of ones spouse, when the children are young, could even turn out into a problematic situation to be handled alone without any help. If the State would intervene to help in such situations, the lives of children will not only be saved from many a trauma, they could positively flourish and benefit society. The agencies of the State and those at their helm have thus far remained indifferent and not yet matured enough in their social conscience to positively intervene to nurture the lives of children fallen into an unexpected tragic situation.
Therefore it is here that the State could insist that those intending to enter married life undergo a compulsory pre-marital preparation and come to an awareness of the responsibilities incumbent on initiating a life in partnership and be ready to face the challenges of blooming into a new family, societys basic nuclear community. Such a preparation should also include among other things, the wise and economic handling of finances and avoidance of wasteful expenditure.
Failures due to unpreparedness
Due to lack of proper preparation, including the inability to responsibly handle the family income, many marriages fail. The government could take steps to prevent that. Presently, it is easier to get a license to marry than to get a license to drive a three-wheeler!
In 1981 at an International Seminar on Family Services convened by the late Fr. Mervyn Fernando, recommendations were made to the government to institute a compulsory pre-nuptial instructions programme of at least 12 to 15 hours along with a six month paid leave of absence to those who give birth to children as such care of infants was of utmost importance. Nissanka Wijeratne, a very knowledgeable minister, was the chief guest at the concluding sessions. Subsequently, three months paid leave came to be granted to child-bearing mothers who were working. However, the equally important pre-nuptial instruction programme has not got off the ground. Perhaps governments do not know how to go about it.
In any case, the Catholic Church and a couple of other Christian Churches are preparing their faithful before they enter into a life partnership in marriage. Christians intending to get married know that they are obliged to undergo this pre-nuptial preparation. If the others too get to understand the many benefits that could be gained from such a preparation, they would willingly participate in such a preparatory programme.
Let the government see that those who handle the family budget are indeed in every possible way equipped to do so and that money intended for family welfare is not squandered in other ways by people unprepared to handle family finances. Those who have more than enough need to be educated about values, in other ways.

Summer camp in post-war Kilinochchi
On the playground of Tharmapuram Tamil Vidyalayam, a government school some 20 kilometres from Kilinochchi town, 12-year-old Sankavi was avoiding her grandmother. The grandmother, Prasanna, sat off to the side, silently watching Sankavi and the other students playing. Prasanna contrasted sharply with her granddaughter: Sankavi was dressed in a tidy skirt and blouse and Prasanna wore a tattered nightgown. Sankavi was reticent, while Prasanna, with her easy, near-toothless smile, eagerly spoke to the Daily News about the familys troubles. I have no strength, she said, no strength to even walk or talk because I am so hurt.
I am worried, said Prasanna, I cant sleep because of my worries. Recently, the familys roof collapsed, adding to the stresses that kept her up at night. Prasannas son-in-law (Sankavis father) left them soon after the war ended. Since then, said Prasanna, Sankavis mother supports the family, working as a labourer in Jaffna.
Prasanna often stops at this school to bring Sankavi food, on her walk to the post office, where she collects a Rs. 250 government pension. But that Monday, there was no need for Prasanna to be there, as Sankavi was given a free lunch. Sankavi was keeping her distance from her grandmother and the old womans worries, wanting, instead, to participate in something completely removed from the devastation of almost 30 years of armed conflict: the districts first-ever summer camp.
Twelve-year-olds like Sankavi make up the first generation of children in Kilinochchi without first-hand memories of the war, and yet they remain tied to the conflict by the struggles of their families.
At two government schools that were damaged extensively during the war, and have been rebuilt since then, an international NGO has launched an annual summer camp. The Chinmaya Organisation for Rural Development (CORD), which was founded in India in 1953, facilitates the camp at the Kallaru Maha Vidyalayam and Tharmapuram Tamil Vidyalayam.
CORDs summer camp is their latest innovation for making education and games accessible to children like Sankavi. At the summer camp, children play games with proper sports equipment, attend English lessons, watch videos on large projectors in their classrooms, and eat free meals every day of the programme. At the end, each child receives a gift package of coloured pencils and notebooks. Opportunities like this one allow children to aspire beyond what their parents or grandparents may have thought possible.
The days of Kilinochchis summer camp were marked by joyous laughter, screaming, dancing, and games. The children played volleyball, cricket and football outside, despite the oppressive dry heat. The organisers brought power tools and helped the children make a pillory, a wooden framework with holes for the head and hands. Students took turns locking themselves into the pillory, while the other children threw wet sponges at them. There was something remarkable about this, because historically, pillories were used to imprison criminals and subject them to public abuse. In a more contentious atmosphere, the device would have looked malicious and threatening at the school. But at the summer camp, it was one of the childrens favourite activities.
Kilinochchi after the war
When CORDs Executive Director in Sri Lanka, Amirtha Gowrie Mahenthiran, first visited Kilinochchi after the war, in 2010, It was like a haunted city. It was frightening. It was completely shattered, she said. Kilinochchis buildings, houses, and roads had been destroyed in the fighting that reclaimed the district. It was full of debris and the walls were bullet-ridden, and there were no roofs on the houses. People looked really sad. They looked very miserable, said Mahenthiran. They were lost, because they didnt know where to start life.
Mahenthiran describes how, after the war, women became the primary breadwinners of their families, and even if men were present, many of the men became alcoholics. Women had to earn to support their families, and in some cases, their alcoholic husbands. That was a very sad story, said Mahenthiran. Some women couldnt handle it, and they committed suicide. About five of the women from CORD groups committed suicide.
Mahenthiran says that it is too late to give some women the help that they need because women dont want to admit that they have issues. They feel counselling is a stigma, she says. So we have to address it in an indirect way. That is done through female empowerment.
A number of sources in Kilinochchi were under the impression that psychological counselling for women affected by the war had been banned for a period of time. However, Chairperson for the National Committee on Women in the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Swarna Sumanasekara said that counselling has never been banned in the Northern Province. The Womens Bureau has their own counselling officers who provide counselling and they have Tamil language counsellors, she said.
For the seven years that the LTTE held Kilinochchi as their administrative capital, they embedded themselves deeply within its civilian population. There, the LTTE offered employment, ran their own court system, had their own police force, banks, and political administration. They also provided civilians with vital infrastructure such as housing and water.
Losing the city was one of the heaviest blows suffered by the militant group in three decades of armed conflict. The Sri Lankan Army captured the city on January 2, 2009, sealing the LTTEs fate in May.
People like Sankavis grandmother have lived through varied iterations of Kilinochchi, a territory that shifted hands between the Sri Lanka Army and the LTTE numerous times during the war. Prasanna says, We were displaced between ten and fifteen times, but she doesnt know for sure, she lost count.
Sankavi, on the other hand, has memories of living in one home all her life, though apparently as a toddler, she spent time in an IDP camp. She is on the edge of a generation whose knowledge of the war is second-hand. Sankavis proximity to conflict is rooted in her familys memory, as well as in their present circumstance.
Over the nine years since the war ended, Sankavis family has gradually built a home made of corrugated metal sheets. Recently, the governments rehabilitation projects made it possible for them to lay the concrete foundation of a house, and they are slowly saving their money to build further.
Sankavi is not only connected to the war, at home. Her school, Tharmapuram Tamil Vidyalayam, also serves as a daily reminder of Kilinochchis post-war context. The school was built with funding from the Indian government and the World Bank after the war, but has neither working water nor washrooms for its 57 children and five teachers. For the first time this year, the school got electricity, after saving several years of government aid.
Sasikda Visagalingam, a teacher at the Tharmapuram school, says that when the Army was there, they provided water for the school with their own water tanks, but in 2013, when the Army left, the water stopped. There is no water in the well, she said, no water in the tanks. All of us bring water from home.
Sankavi recently passed through the Tharmapuram Primary School, where the students are almost exclusively the children of labourers. Sankavi is one of CORDs sponsored students, meaning that the cost of her tuition as well as her school supplies is covered by the NGO. In addition, Sankavis entire family receives dry food rations to supplement their meals, and a yearly medical examination is arranged for Sankavi to make sure that her BMI stays within a healthy range.
The opportunities and special status given to Sankavi by CORD empowered her in ways that her mother and grandmother had never been. When we met her, Sankavi said that someday, she wants to be a doctor. While her grandmother suffers from insomnia, and her mother comes home once a month from Jaffna, Sankavi has a luxury that neither of them had: the possibility of a normal life.

Sustainable Resettlement in Sri Lanka:
UK Government extends partnership with UNDP
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka, recently entered into a partnership agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, to extend support for sustainable resettlement at lands recently released in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
The GBP 1,000,000 (US$ 1.3 Million) project would support more than 2,500 people returning to their homes in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa Districts. Under the agreement, UNDP Sri Lanka would work in close collaboration with the government, to facilitate sustainable return, resettlement and integration of conflict-displaced persons, while strengthening institutions for equal and transparent access to services.
The overall intended impact is to improve the well-being of conflict-affected communities in line with the Sri Lanka Peace-building Priority Plan, agreed by the Government of Sri Lanka and the UN, to support long-term peace-building and reconciliation, as well as the National Policy on Durable Solutions for Conflict-affected Displacement.
The project would help those returning to their homes in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Batticaloa by supporting livelihood opportunities in fisheries, agriculture and livestock, and facilitating access to local government services.
It would also help families to rebuild their lives by promoting entrepreneurship through training in small business management, and by assisting in re-establishing community support structures and local civil society organisations.
British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka James Dauris said, The UK is pleased to support the return of families to their villages. This is a crucial element of addressing the legacy of the conflict, and contributes to the steady progress being made. There remains a lot to do and, as a partner with a firm commitment to working with Sri Lanka, the UK is supporting the rebuilding process as well as encouraging the government to deliver its commitments to the people of this country and to the international community.
The Sustainable Resettlement project would prioritise empowering women and youth, promoting diversity and inclusion, and reaching vulnerable and marginalised communities.
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen said, The UNDP is pleased to join hands with the UK Government, to support families to resettle and reintegrate back into their communities. Through this project and beyond, we remain fully committed to help build a more inclusive, peaceful, and resilient Sri Lanka, to advance sustainable human development.

## Title: Understand healthcare  supply chain in a changing market

Understand healthcare  supply chain in a changing market
The manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical devices is becoming increasingly complex. Companies are expanding their product portfolios to meet rapidly changing markets and lengthening product life cycles. Emerging economies want more affordable products. Quality and compliance issues are rising because products are more complex and regulatory scrutiny is stricter. The number of drug recalls is increasing. Yet the supply chain remains fragmented and incomplete, with weaknesses that put patients at risk, cost billions in value, and lessen the health-care sectors ability to take on the challenges it faces.
The good news is that models do exist to strengthen and improve the health-care supply chain. We believe that by learning from the experience of industries such as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), the health-care sector could cut production lead times and obsolescence, while manufacturers, distributors, hospitals, and pharmacies could carry significantly smaller inventories. Improving the health-care supply chain also could give millions of people around the world access to safer and more affordable health care, reduce costs, and provide new revenue sources for manufacturers.
In this we identified five specific capabilities that can have a dramatic impact on performance and bottom lines:
better segmentation of products, markets, and customers
greater agility, to reduce costs and increase flexibility
measurement and benchmarking
alignment with global standards
collaboration across the health-care value chain
Now, we recognize that transforming supply chains isnt easy. In our experience, limited improvement efforts yield poor results, while comprehensive, integrated efforts are complex. But the payoff can be significant. Supply chains now account for nearly 25 per cent of pharmaceutical costs and more than 40 percent of medical-device costs.
Industry research, together with our own experience serving clients, has revealed opportunities to boost profitability throughout the value chain. The improvement from better-performing supply chains would range from about 6 percent for retailers to 20 percent for hospitals and producers of devices and medical supplies. The cost of the shortcomings of todays supply chain is substantial. In the meantime, drug shortages have nearly tripled in the Europe and added more costs for hospitals worldwide. Supply issues also create opportunities for counterfeiters and gray-market vendors, threatening patient safety and cutting into the revenues of legitimate companies. Supply-chain security breaches are increasing every year, rising not only in emerging markets such as China, India, and Brazil but also in the developed world. A typical Asian laptop manufacturer can accept an order on a Monday and deliver a pallet of freshly assembled customized computers to a European customer little more than a week later. In contrast, a typical pharmaceutical manufacturer has a lead time of about 75 days. How can medical-device and pharmaceutical manufacturers close the gap Of the five comprehensive transformations we have identified, three can be accomplished internally. Two othersalignment and collaborationare potentially the most powerful but require a company to work together with its customers, suppliers, and even competitors. Heres what must be done.
Internal factors
1. Segmentation. Many pharmaceutical and medical-device companies come close to running one-size-fits-all supply chains. In practice, however, there can be significant differences in profitability, value per unit of weight, demand, the importance of a drug or device to patients, a customers cost to serve, and service expectations. Forcing products with such varied characteristics through a single set of supply-chain processes creates multiple inefficiencies, such as high inventories for some products while others are in short supply, the use of expensive air freight when slower surface modes would do, or a need to reschedule production campaigns hastily to meet urgent delivery requirements. Leading companies tackle these problems by intelligently segmenting their supply chains according to the characteristics of products and the requirements of customers. They then develop forecasting, production, and distribution strategies for each category.
2. Agility. This means more than just being fast when theres an emergency; it means building an operating model that can better respond to demand shifts and customer wishesat the same or even reduced cost. As we mentioned, the replenishment lead time from pharmaceutical plants to distribution centers is 75 days, on average. But leading companies in sectors such as fast-moving consumer goods take a fraction of that time, often without additional investments. Companies must better align the production cycle with the patterns of patient demand and increase the low frequency of their manufacturing processes. The average stock-keeping unit (SKU) is packaged every two to three months; only about 10 per cent are packaged every two weeks or less. An agile supply-chain model also requires stability in production, replenishment, and visibility. Many health-care companies need to make deliveries from third parties and in-house plants more reliable and to upgrade their sales- and operations-planning capabilities to the standards of the fast-moving-consumer-goods industry. The necessary improvements include a more disciplined cross-functional process, a better understanding of demand-and-supply scenarios and of underlying assumptions, more effective communication, and transparency on potential supply issues and bottlenecks.
3. Measurement. Health-care companies need to increase the transparency of their costs, including manufacturing, transport, warehousing, inventory holding, staff, and obsolescencemoves that could cut operational costs and optimize route-to-market approaches and product portfolios. Improvements are also needed in structural drivers or capabilities: responsiveness, manufacturing frequency, reliability of supply, and stability are mostly not systematically measured or managed across the network. Consumer-goods companies are clearly more advanced: they watch metrics such as the manufacturing-frequency index to measure the share of SKUs that are produced with high frequency. Finally, companies must standardize metrics across countries and plants. Commercially available benchmarking tools and approaches provide rough guidance for high-level opportunities in services, costs, and inventories, but not fully comparable results or tangible recommendations on how to capture value.
External factors
While internal optimization can deliver better service at lower cost, companies have even more to gain from optimizing externally. To do so, they must align processes and improve collaboration.
4. Alignment. Manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods use point-of-sale information from retail customers to build production plans. The grocery industry, for example, has created billions of dollars in value by adopting standard barcodes. To build a cost-effective supply chain, the health-care sector could align around a single set of global standards that support data interchange, processes, and capabilities. Doing so may increase efficiency and patient safety by making it harder for counterfeiters to operate, by reducing medication errors, and by improving recall processes.
5. Collaboration. While the use of common standards is part of the challenge, supply-chain partners must find ways to collaborate more effectively to reap the full benefit. Barriers to improvement are often cultural rather than technicaltransactional relationships must be transformed into something more ambitious. In our experience observing successful collaboration projects, six essential steps can make the difference between a productive collaboration and a frustrating one: companies must collaborate in areas where they have a solid footing; agree on sophisticated benefit-sharing models; select partners for the potential value of the collaboration, as well as their capabilities and willingness to act as a team; dedicate resources to the collaboration and involve senior leadership in it; jointly manage performance and measure impact; and start out with a long-term perspective.
At a recent meeting of senior supply-chain executives in the pharmaceutical and medical-device industries, we asked attendees which of these five supply-chain changes offered the greatest opportunity. More than 70 per cent specified improved collaboration. Transforming the health-care supply chain can do much more than improve the bottom line. By embracing the challenge of supply-chain leadership, pharmaceutical and medical-device companies can provide safer, more affordable access to products that enhance or even save the lives of people across the world. .As reform continues to force hospitals to find new ways to cut costs and increase effectiveness, many organizations forget about the processes and supplies needed to keep the business moving. Getting a better grip on managing a healthcare organizations supply and demand will save tons of money to the organization while also increasing positive patient care. Supply chain is also a key to creating better end-to-end visibility about all of the products, devices and supplies used in healthcare  critical to running businesses better. Logistics companies can help save time and provide better visibility within the supply chain. The supply chain management in healthcare is not only about medical-surgical supplies anymore, but complex in nature involving more technology, consolidation and partnerships within the supply chain community. With supply chain management being the second most expensive cost under labor, hospital authorities are looking for a better way to save more money and still be efficient at the same time. In the meantime five ways that healthcare organizations can utilize supply chain management to reduce the rising costs and run efficiently in light of all the constant healthcare reform changes.
Automating manual processes
By automating requisitions, purchase orders and invoices, providers and suppliers are able to remove manual, error-prone processes from the supply chain  these often lead to higher cost. Healthcare organizations, whether supplier or provider, looking to recoup these missing costs should consider e-commerce solutions for automating manual processes. E-commerce solutions like expense management software save both time and money when implemented correctly. These solutions would create critical connections across organizations and functions, providing visibility to data and enabling better management of data that are messaged daily. Accurately capturing data at the beginning is key to reducing costs; these include accurate charge capture, inventory management, demand forecasting, recall management and comparative effectiveness research. According to The Case for Global Standards in the Healthcare Supply Chain, there has been significant interest in developing standardized information that leverages automatic identification (Auto-ID) technologies to convey the information up and down the chain. These technologies can provide system benefits that are maximized when standardized and interoperable. Hospitals can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.
Establishing efficient trading partner relationships
With the ability to connect with trading partners through a supply chain community, the frequency of accurate and efficient e-business transactions grows throughout the industry. Suppliers, partners and customers should form relationships with one another with each party performing a role in the supply chain, contributing to the movement of products, data or information and funds. Relationships are vital with distributors and getting the product to the end-user, the patient. Having these great alliances with major players will keep cost down and profits up. Flexibility in contracts will allow for movement amongst these key players to continuously look for better options or a lower cost solution to high-ticketed or needed items. Changes required to create efficient healthcare supply chain cant be the result of one single person or entity, it must be a collaborative effort for everything to work. .It seems that the healthcare supply chain can look to retail supply chain models to get a head start on how to effectively foster these relationships. According to the industry found that the retail supply chain has done a better job in the critical area of collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment, which involves suppliers and retailers or healthcare providers working together to adopt order forecasting and inventory planning to create an integrated supply-chain network. There is much to be done at this level to move in the right direction of having a more effective healthcare supply chain model.
Reducing waste/excess product
By taking supply chain data and turning it into information on supply levels and use, providers and suppliers can get a better handle on how much product is needed and when, leading to a decrease in loss due to wasted, lost or expired supplies. Thats money going down the drain. Healthcare organizations cannot afford to waste or not use all supplies or products needed. By utilizing streamlined supply chain programs, healthcare organizations and players can effectively track and monitor inventory of products by having instant access to product, pricing and order information, as well as enhanced inventory visibility and tracking, therefore reducing costs, improving customer satisfaction and better meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.
Capturing data for business requirements
In the future, the supply chain will serve a growing role as a key component of the technology infrastructure to help capture and share much-needed data to drive greater efficiency and compliance. As provider organizations stride toward new business requirements, they can consider the supply chain as a backbone a key component of technology infrastructure  that can help capture and share the data they need. For example, an organization thats capturing data about all of the medical devices and products used during a patient procedure can then use this data to populate the same information in other locations, such as the electronic health record. In the future, a one-time data capture for a multitude of uses can drive much greater efficiency and compliance,
This can be achieved by identifying products a provider is frequently purchasing and at what prices; what products are being purchased off-contract; identifying like-products and determine whether they can be grouped onto contracts for future purchases; and assimilating those items onto group purchasing organization (GPO) or supplier contracts. With correct data capture, healthcare organizations can achieve significant savings from reduced errors, lower costs from better contract alignment and improved revenues through the use of more accurate, up-to-date data helping the business run much more smoothly.
Enabling automation amongst regional care networks
Regional hospitals and sub-acute care networks are underserviced by healthcare technology. There is an opportunity for scalable solutions, like supply chain automation tools, to serve these networks and allow them the efficiencies, data visibility and cost savings they need to survive. According to a Supply Chain Best Practices were observed over where there were a number of problems associated with limited investments surrounding not having enough funds invested in automation and IT services and solutions were found. It also provided a strong business case for reversing that trend, noting that healthcare providers that make greater investments in back-office automation and process improvement enjoy operating cost ratios that are 2 to 4 per cent better than those of their peers. Specifically, it called on providers to increase investments in tools to enable electronic order exchange with suppliers (including the use of order acknowledgements and advanced ship notices) and automate processes around procurement, invoicing and catalog price updates. An e-commerce infrastructure, for example, creates connectivity and linkages that enable supply chain partners to share data with one another, building both trust and visibility to drive many of the improvements in supply chain management. Automating the pricing synchronization process acknowledges and recognizes efficiencies by all participants in the contracting process, where all parties involved can share information electronically. Some multinational companies recommends investing in solutions that automates the pricing synchronization process with a collaborative platform that enables all parties to a contract to agree on key terms and conditions.
This would allow all parties to a contract generate an electronic letter in real time and can then have the contract integrated with a distributor on the same day it is executed, in turn activating new pricing with all parties in less than a week. Without the platform, it can take up to 60 days to synchronize contract data. This makes it easier for trading partners to share accurate information related to factors such as tier pricing and commitments, customer eligibility and price activation dates. With the increasing number in costs and supplies, healthcare organizations would definitely benefit from taking a look at their current supply chain and making some of these changes with healthcare spending consuming almost higher amount today.
Healthcare has two choices: dig in or embrace change. Supply chain leaders must adapt to the changing healthcare environment to help lead their organizations forward. Strong leaders should continuously look ahead at what patients and providers need to ensure the best quality of care.

Yala National Park
Motherly love and care is extended in equal measure to the offspring by humans and animals alike as exemplified by this she-elephant who blocked oncoming vehicles to allow her baby elephants to cross the road at Kotigala in the Yala National Park the other day. Foreign tourists who were among those present enjoyed the spectacle, notwithstanding the 30 minute delay they encountered. Picture by Ambalantota Group Corr. Rahul Samantha Hettiarachchi
