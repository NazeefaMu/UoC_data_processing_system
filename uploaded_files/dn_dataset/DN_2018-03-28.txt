More policy initiatives  needed to attract FDI
Sri Lanka had missed many opportunities to transform itself into a developed nation and there is a need for robust policy initiatives to improve the countrys investment climate to attract and retain FDI in Sri Lanka, Ravi Abeysuriya, Group Director, Candor said.
Although the government has recognized this need, the political will, commitment and the speed at which policies are being implemented leave much to be desired. Most importantly, if Sri Lanka is to achieve this, changing the mindset of the public is also essential.
Abeysuriya expressed these views at the recently concluded LAMUDI Re-Connect: Property 360 event held in Colombo.
According to Abeysuriya , limited fiscal space, tax-based funding by the government is not adequate to meet the pressing needs for infrastructure and it is important for the government to attract private investment for the provisioning of infrastructure through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Commenting on the countrys competitiveness and factors affecting investment decisions, Abeysuriya emphasised that it is essential to make necessary changes in regard to macroeconomic stability, inflation, exchange rates, fiscal deficit, public debt levels, doing business ranking and competitiveness to attract FDI.
Abeysuriya also noted that Sri Lanka needs to make infrastructure an attractive value proposition for FDI to flow especially into the real estate sector while taking immediate measures to create a low tax regime, consistent tax regulations and legal framework for enforcing contacts.
Sri Lanka needs to adopt consistent long term national development policy with strong commitment to woo FDI flows to Sri Lanka, Abeysuriya said adding that it is essential that these policies be implemented swiftly with consistency in order to attract higher levels of FDI to the country, particularly in the backdrop of relatively higher FDI inflows to emerging market economies such as India and Vietnam.

MINISTER ERAN TO GIVE EVIDENCE AGAIN
Accused collapses in Toy pistol case
There was high drama at the Hambantota High Court yesterday, when the first accused Pemasiri Paranamanna in the case involving the attack on a group of UNP MPs who were on a fact finding visit to the new Airport and Port in Hambanthota
in April 17, 2014 fainted and collapsed on the dock when Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne began to give evidence.
The case famously dubbed as the Toy Pistol Case against five suspects including the former Hambantota Mayor which came up for hearing before Hambantota High Court Judge Thamara Tennakoon yesterday had to be postponed till May 15 after the first accused in the case fainted and collapsed.
In this case former Hambantota Mayor Eraj Raveendra, Premasiri Parnamana, Tuan Ramzan, Madusha Nilan and Bindu Sri Warnasinghe are charged on 29 counts for attacking on a team from Colombo including UNP Parliamentarians Ajith P Perera, Ajith Mannapperuma, Nalin Bandara, Eran Wickremaratne and R. Yogarajan.They were on an inspection tour of the South and as they were leaving the Hambantota Port Complex stones and eggs were hurled at them on April 17, 2014.
The case was to be heard on a daily basis on March 26 and 27 with the agreement of both parties involved in the case. Accordingly State Minister Ajith P. Perera and R Yogarajan gave evidence on Monday 26.
When hearing began yesterday State Minister Eran Wickramaratne began giving evidence,the first accused who was in the dock collapsed in the dock and hearing was postponed for 30 minutes. When hearing began around 1 pm. Defence Counsel Thusitha Aluthpatabendige informed court that the first accused Premasiri Paranamana was ill and receiving indoor treatment at the Hambantota hospital after being admitted there.The High Court Judge inquired about it from the Court Sergeant who confirmed that Paranamana was hospitalised after checking with the Hospital Police Post. Thereafter Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Pieris who appeared for the petitioners requested the High Court Judge to issue order to submit a medical report about the condition of the first accused on the next date of hearing. The High Court Judge who ordered the Hambantota Hospital JMO to submit a medical report on the first accused, postponed hearing for May 15. The High Court Judge also ordered Minister Eran Wickramaratne, Ajith Mannaperuma and Nalin Bandara to appear in Court to give evidence on the next date.
A team of Attorneys led by U. R. de Silva and Thusitha Aluthpatabendige appeared for the accused in this case while Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Pieris and State Counsel Jehan Gunasekera appeared for the petitioners.
A group of then opposition UNP MPs in 2014 during President Rajapaksas rule came under attack from goons when they were on a fact finding visit to the new airport and port in Hambantota.
Subsequently, photographs showed the Mayor of Hambantota, Eraj Ravindra Fernando chasing the UNP MPs with a pistol in his hand, closely followed by members of the goon squad.
Subsequently the mayor claimed that he was only acting to protect the MPs and that too with a toy pistol.

Armys 22 Division distributes 6,000 saplings
Giving fresh impetus to the Armys Ranaviru Haritha Arana project, the Eastern Province-based 22 Division launched its own scheme, Ranaviru Saviyen Haritha Ratak by distributing more than 6,000 saplings in Trincomalee, recently.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake distributed the saplings to more than 70 students, principals and teachers from 15 Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim schools in the district as well as troops of the 22 Division, at the 22 Division Headquarters in Trincomalee.
Saplings of cashew, jak, kumbuk, kohomba, siyambala, mahogany and madan, which are of environmental and economic value were distributed.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, as the chief guest on the occasion, symbolically planted the first sapling and inaugurated the 22 Division programme, together with Security Forces - East (SF-E) Commander Major General Santhusitha Pananwala and 22 Division General Officer Commanding (GOC) Major General Aruna Jayasekara, who is the brains behind the project. Officials of the Ministry of Environment, District Forest Office and a host of senior officers of the Security Force Headquarters - East (SFHQ-E) who were present for the inauguration either received saplings or contributed to the programme by distributing saplings. The Army-initiated Ranaviru Haritha Arana programme which is consistent with the ongoing national Wana Ropa project initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena in accordance with the Haritha Gammana concept, got off to a formal start a few months back at the Army farm in Kandakadu, Kantale, with the planting of some 1,500 saplings of rare species. Lieutenant General Senanayake, taking a personal interest in this regard, encouraged all island-wide Army formations to use their additional land space inside their camps for this cause of national importance. Accordingly, many formations across the country took to tree planting. The project was sponsored by the 57 Division Headquarters and the District Forest Office in Trincomalee providing the saplings.
The days ceremony at 22 Division Headquarters began with the traditional drive-past salute. The programme organized under the auspices of Major General Aruna Jayasekara, was attended by senior military officers, school principals, teachers and several other senior state officials.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, after religious observances at the shrine in the 22 Division, offered Atapirikara to Ven. Ahungalle Siri Sila Visuddi Nayake Thera and received his blessings before other military formalities were performed.
The Commander ended his visit by speaking to 22 Division troops.

Army awaits clearance for dispatching troops to Lebanon
The Sri Lanka Army is currently awaiting clearance from the Human Rights Commission, to dispatch a Lebanon-bound contingent of peacekeeping troops numbering 101, following new procedures set up by the United Nations (UN) Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO).
As planned, one more contingent of 150 soldiers of the Army earmarked for deployment, were set to leave for Lebanon in batches as replacements, beginning February, this year. Accordingly, the first batch of 49 troops left Sri Lanka for Lebanon on February 18 and 19.
However, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) had insisted that Sri Lanka should seek feasible clearance for such deployments, directly from the Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission (SLHRC), by vetting respective overseas-bound UN candidates before their departure.
As a result of this change in procedure, the Army was compelled to refer the remaining batch of 101 Army personnel for necessary screening, as advised by the UN DPKO.
In view of those new UN procedures, the Army had sought clearance from the SLHRC, in order to dispatch the remaining contingent for deployment in Lebanon, the Army Media Unit said.
Sri Lanka, as one of the Troop Contributing Countries (TCC) to the United Nations, had been in the practice of sending troops of large numbers for UN peacekeeping assignments since 2004, after the country was qualified to do so.
At present, Sri Lankan troops, majority being from the Sri Lanka Army, have been deployed in Lebanon (UNIFIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), Mali (MINUSMA), Abyei (UNISFA), New York (UNHQ), Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and Western Sahara (MINURSO), either as military observers, staff officers, staff officer assistants or general contingent troops, the Army Media Unit added.

Axe looms for Australia coach and captain in cricket crisis
JOHANNESBURG, Tuesday - Australia coach Darren Lehmann and skipper Steve Smith faced the axe Tuesday with cricket chiefs holding crisis talks in South Africa to deal with an escalating cheating scandal.
Cricket Australia (CA) boss James Sutherland, under mounting pressure to come down hard on what Australian media has dubbed a rotten team culture, has arrived in Johannesburg and is expected to give a press conference later Tuesday.
Sutherland is holding talks with Cricket Australia's head of integrity, Iain Roy, who is probing the ball-tampering scandal during the third Test match against South Africa on Saturday.
Reports say they could ban both Smith and vice-captain David Warner for 12 months and send them home in disgrace.
Smith has already been suspended for one Test and docked his entire match fee by the International Cricket Council for his role in a plot that saw teammate Cameron Bancroft use a piece of grit-encrusted sticky tape to change the condition of the ball.
It means Smith will miss the fourth and final Test in Johannesburg starting Friday.
LEHMANN SILENCE
Lehmann has remained silent, but Britain's Daily Telegraph said he had decided to quit.
Lehmann took over the coaching reins in 2013 when predecessor Mickey Arthur was sacked, with Justin Langer considered a frontrunner as his replacement although Ricky Ponting will also be in the mix.
We understand the strong interest everyone has in this situation and we are following due process to properly address all of the relevant issues involved, Sunderland said in an email.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Tuesday it had been a shocking affront to Australia and Cricket Australia must act decisively and emphatically.
Former Australian coach John Buchanan, who led the team from 1999 to 2007, said Smith must resign as captain and urged cricket chiefs to be fully transparent in their investigation. It is a very difficult time for members of Australian cricket; however, I believe there is a golden opportunity to reset the dial around player and staff behaviours, actions and decision-making, he told reporters.
NATIONAL OUTCRY
There has been a national outcry over Smith's admission that the leadership group within the team decided to cheat.
That group of senior players usually includes fast bowlers Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, but they are reportedly furious at being embroiled in the saga.
The ramifications of the scandal have been far-reaching with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the guardian of the laws of the game, calling for a major shift in attitude to preserve the game for future generations.
Former South African captain Graeme Smith has hit out at the ICC's handling of the scandal, saying it had missed an opportunity to really handle this properly and lead our game.
They haven't done that. You have had two players, who have admitted guilt for cheating. I think that's huge.
ASHES ACCUSATION
Bancroft used a strip of yellow sticky tape he had covered with dirt granules to illegally scratch the rough side of the ball, thereby facilitating more swing for bowlers.
He was filmed not only rubbing the ball with the dirtied tape but concealing the evidence down the front of his trousers. The ICC fined him 75 percent of his match fee and slapped him with three demerit paints, but he escaped a suspension.
Former South Africa captain Fanie de Villiers has described how he tipped off the TV camera crew that caught Bancroft in the act after he noticed the ball behaving unusually for the conditions. We actually said to our cameramen: Go out. Have a look, boys. They are using something. It's impossible for the ball to get altered like that on a cricket wicket where we knew there is a grass covering on, De Villiers told Australian radio station RSN927.
Smith insisted it was the first time his team had cheated in this manner, but former England captain Michael Vaughan claimed he is pretty sure Australia were ball-tampering during their 4-0 victory in the Ashes, which finished earlier this year.
I look at the amount of tape some of the fielders have worn, particularly during the Ashes series at mid-on and mid-off. You don't have to name names, they know who they are, he told BBC Sport. - AFP

Decision on further extending Interim Order regarding former Defence Secretary:
CA reserves order for April 5
The Court of Appeal yesterday reserved its order for April 5 to decide whether the Court further extends its Interim Order preventing the police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrate's Court inquiry.
Meanwhile, Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne yesterday further extended until April 5 its interim order preventing the police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over a complaint that the D. A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing on behalf of the Attorney General raised objections for the extension of the Interim Order since it had been issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa moved Court that an Interim Order be issued until the final determination of this application and fixed the matter for argument.
The Court of Appeal yesterday announced that it will issue an appropriate order in this regard on the next date.
On November 29, 2017, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding.
The Court had upheld Rajapaksas version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
President's Counsel Romesh de Silva under the instructions of Counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake and Senior State Counsel Udara Karunatilleka and SSC Nirmalan Vigneshvaran appeared for the Attorney General.

Some have asked that the ban be lifted as it is needed for agriculture whilst others have pointed out that there are more safer alternatives to glyphosate which can be used, the Minister said. The President has asked the two ministers to send him names of experts so that they can be appointed to the cabinet sub-committee to study the matter.
The cabinet sub-committee is to also have inputs from Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Rajitha Senaratne and Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, a strong advocate against glyphosate.

China and N Korea confirm Kim Jong-un visit

After days of speculation, it has been confirmed that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has visited China.
The visit, confirmed by China and North Korea, was Kim's first known foreign trip since taking office in 2011.
Kim held "successful talks" with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, sources said.
China is North Korea's main economically and it was thought highly likely it would consult Beijing before planned summits with South Korea and the US.
Kim is due to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April, and US President Donald Trump in May.
The Beijing visit is considered a significant step in North Korea's preparation for the proposed talks.
During the visit, Kim assured his Chinese counterpart he was committed to giving up his nuclear weapons, but with conditions.
"The issue of denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved, if South Korea and the United States respond to our efforts with goodwill, create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realisation of peace," Kim was reported saying.
Ties with Beijing
North Korea's KCNA news agency called the visit "a milestone" in improving bilateral ties with China.
"It makes sense for North Korea to explain their positions and co-ordinate with China, their most important partner," Andray Abrahamian, research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS told the BBC.
"Relations have been extremely strained the last five years and China has been sidelined in the diplomacy of the last several months," he said.
"From Beijing's perspective, this is a visit that should have happened some time ago."
To some extent, this is a "symbolic visit of courtesy" to China, Fyodor Tertitskiy of North Korea monitoring site NK News said.
"They have two upcoming summits - one with Seoul and one with Washington - and they are probably interested in hearing the Chinese position as well."
KCNA also said Xi had accepted an invitation to return the visit.

CID fabricated case:Duminda Silva
Former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silvas lawyer yesterday informed Supreme Court that the Criminal Investigation Department (CIC) had fabricated a case against his client.
Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva appearing for Duminda Silva who had been convicted of committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra made these remarks when the appeal filed by five accused including Duminda Silva challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court was taken up for argument.
The Presidents Counsel stated that the omissions and contradictions of the evidence had not been taken into consideration by the High Court Trial-at-Bar.
He said the Trial-at-Bar bench had issued the judgment without considering defences version.
When the appeal came up before the five-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, further argument was fixed for May 8.
Five accused including former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva who were sentenced to death by Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra had filed appeal petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court.
At a previous occasion, Duminda Silva, the eleventh accused in the murder case filed an acceleration petition in the Supreme Court requesting that the hearing on the appeal be accelerated on medical grounds.
Through his appeal, Duminda Silva stated that he was seeking the jurisdiction of Supreme Court to review and set aside their conviction and the death sentence imposed by High Court on September 8, 2015.
Five accused including former MP Duminda Silva were on September 8, 2015 sentenced to death by Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011. However, the verdict was divided two to one with judges Pathmini N. Ranawaka and M.C.B.S. Morais finding five accused guilty for ten charges including committing and conspiring to commit murder of four people while Justice Shiran Gunaratne the President of Colombo High Court Trial-at-Bar found the thirteen accused not guilty of all seventeen charges.
The five-judge Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Vijith Malalgoda.

As management accountants we know this rings true. Were the human face of numbers. Algorithms underpin the internet, sent men to the moon and help scientists save lives every single day. But numbers arent everything. Because the challenges we face, theyre also people problems. They come from people. They affect people. And they can only be solved by people.
 As the CIMAs of today and tomorrow, you have the power to make this a better world.
Youll do it with the support of us in CIMA and the Association. We care about this profession  and about increasing trust, opportunity and prosperity for everybody.

Commercial Bank wins three  at Asiamoney Banking Awards
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been conferred three prestigious international awards, being adjudged the Best Bank, Best Bank for Premium Banking Services and the Best Bank for Corporate Social Responsibility in Sri Lanka by Asiamoney, considered the most authoritative voice for the banking industry in the Asia Pacific region.
The most prestigious award of the ceremony, Asiamoneys Best Bank award recognises Commercial Banks profitability in 2017, its growth, relative outperformance of peers, and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and client needs.
The award for Best Bank for Premium Banking Services is a tribute to Commercial Banks wealth management operations in Sri Lanka, with an emphasis on how its offering has outperformed competitors over the review period.
The Banks strategy in winning net new assets and client acquisition related to business gains, initiatives in areas such as relationship management and digital services, and testimonials from clients contributed to winning this award.
The award for Best Bank for Corporate Social Responsibility recognises the Banks CSR initiatives, achievements and milestones reached in the previous year.
Although charitable and philanthropic initiatives were considered, the award also focused on the Bank providing financial or market solutions to its customer base.
Commenting on the three prestigious accolades from Asiamoney, Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Mr Jegan Durairatnam said: These awards highlight the balance Commercial Bank maintains between being a financially-sound institution and a service-oriented bank while also contributing generously towards the pressing needs of the society it operates in. This equilibrium is an affirmation that we are on a stable and sustainable trajectory. Commercial Bank is the largest private bank in Sri Lanka in terms of its assets (Rs 1.143 Trillion as at 31st December 2017) and is positioned as the Bank with the Highest Market Capitalisation, all of which contributed to the Best Bank award.
In the sphere of CSR, Commercial Banks largest contribution is towards IT education in Sri Lanka.
To date the Bank has donated 175 fully fledged IT laboratories to schools island wide, benefitting over 200,000 students.
Alongside these initiatives, the Commercial Bank has also invested in uplifting healthcare services and funding research related to preventing and mitigating Chronic Kidney Disease.

Creating new security architecture for  Indian Ocean
Transportation systems play a key role in a countrys economic well-being, development and prosperity. As more and more countries develop to be middle income countries in South Asia and BIMSTEC regions, they will need to produce and trade more. Incidentally, the Indian Ocean is becoming the key ocean together with the Pacific Ocean in the 21st century, which is also referred to as Asian Century.
These views were expressed by Director of the Pathfinder Foundations Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives and Center for the Law of the Sea, Dr. Jayanath Colombage in India recently.
Following is an an extract from his presentation.
The unprecedented rise of economic power of China and rapid growth of India are two key factors impacting the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean now account for 70% oil, 50% containers and 35% bulk cargo of the world. This ocean is also called the Energy super highway of the world. As the countries develop, their energy requirement also grows and these now become net-importers of energy. The Persian Gulf, a marginal sea of the Indian Ocean, is the worlds main oil producing region. Many developed and developing countries are deeply concerned about energy security in the Indian Ocean.
The Bay of Bengal connects the Indian Ocean with the Western Pacific Ocean. This is relatively a peaceful ocean region with no maritime boundary disputes. Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka are located in a vital triangle covering the entire Bay of Bengal region. Sri Lanka has the unique advantage as the connector to the Western Indian Ocean. Maritime commerce has been a cornerstone of the history of these three countries that are members of the BIMSTEC as well. People of these three countries have been seafarers and travelers since ancient times. They have also welcomed foreigners to trade, learn and explore. The three countries have been well-connected across the Bay of Bengal long before the arrival of colonial powers and colonized the region. They have traded in spices, Elephants, Jute products, Timber and there were plenty of raw materials available for building and repair of wooden hulled sailing ships.
The seaborne trade in the Indian Ocean underwent many changes with the advent of European colonial powers. The Portuguese in the 16th century, and subsequently the Dutch, to French and finally the British dominated seaborne commerce in the Indian Ocean.
Sustainable Transport
As per the United Nations high level advisory group on sustainable transport, sustainable Transport is defined as provision of services and infrastructure for the mobility of people and goods advancing economic and social development to benefit todays and future generations in a manner that is safe, affordable, accessible and efficient and resilient while minimizing carbon emissions and environmental impacts. Transport is a key development issue in many countries and a major driving force behind a growing demand for energy. Transport and mobility are vital for sustainable development. Without sustainable transport, there will be no lasting progress on climate action and hence Sustainable Development Goals.
Belt and Road Initiative, is a planned transport network of overland road and rail routes, oil and natural gas pipelines and other infrastructure projects that will stretch from Xian in central China, through central Asia, and ultimately reach Moscow, Rotterdam and Venice. BRI covers 63% of global population and 29% of the global economy. Hence, emphasis must be put on the sustainable use of transport in this initiative, which should include Equity, Efficiency, Safety and Climate responsiveness.
Shipping can be considered a least carbon emitting mode of mass transport. Ships are becoming more energy efficient and less polluting with better emission controls. We also witness that mega container lines merging and bigger and bigger ships entering the service. This will be the new trend in shipping and we need to be prepared for it.
Sri Lanka and Port of Colombo
The Port of Colombo has been a must stop destination connecting the shippers of west and east. This port has become the South Asias main hub port. Worlds top 20 shipping lines call on port of Colombo and play a huge role in Global trade taking as 87% of global shipping is handled by these. This is a huge advantage for the port of Colombo. As per the world shipping council ranking, amongst the top fifty ports in the world, Shanghai rank as number one whilst Singapore is at number two. Jabel Ali in Dubai is at number nine and Port Klang in Malaysia at number twelve. The Port of Colombo rank number twenty-eight and JNU, India is at thirty-four. This is a clear indication that the Port of Colombo is the life line of South Asia and part of BIMSTEC region. As these regions are developing fast, hub ports will have to play an increasingly important role. Some of the advantages for the port of Colombo are, the centralized location in the Indian Ocean; halfway in the Singapore-Rotterdam 10000 nautical miles trade route, Highly competitive logistic costs, strong and continuous air connectivity and reliable and efficient telecom and IT connectivity.
The Colombo port city or Colombo International Financial Center (CIFC), which is under construction on a 236 hectares land being reclaimed adjacent to the Port of Colombo to be a special zone along the line of Dubais International Financial Center. This is the biggest FDI project in Sri Lanka.
It was started at an initial cost of US$ 1.51 billion and will rise to US$ 8.29 billion when it is completed. Financial backing and development is provided by the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC) and China has asked India to participate in order to alleviate strategic concerns. This offshore project aims to attract more than US$12.8 billion from investors, banks, hotels and malls. This project too will benefit maritime connectivity across the Indian Ocean.
Two major components of the shipping industry are ships and cargo. Ports and Terminals and other maritime services come next. Shipping agency and freight forwarding are minor component of shipping industry but are considered major components in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka neither has a large shipping fleet nor a large volume of local import and export cargo to boost a shipping industry by any standard. Sri Lanka, however, has a sizable maritime industry with ports and terminals as the primary part of the maritime industry. This currently thrive on transshipment cargo.
Hence, re-structing of the shipping industry is necessary to promote ease of doing business, to remove non-applicable regulations, and clear archaic regulations with current industry needs. Further liberalization of the shipping industry is needed with a view to attract large ships owners or operators to set office here like in Hongkong or Singapore. Sri Lankan ship registry must be made attractive for such ships to register under the flag of convenience or flag of opportunity. Port of Colombo presently handle about 70% of transshipment containers from India.
Port of Trincomalee, which is a huge deep natural harbour in the region, should be developed to cater to enhancing connectivity in the Bay of Bengal region. The coastal trade between ports in eastern coast of India, Bangladesh and Myanmar should be enhanced to improve trade connectivity.
Trincomalee can also be used as a sea port for land locked Nepal. Trincomalee can be the petro-chemical hub of the region with the availability of 98 large tanks built by the British and largely unused since their departure. Ports of Trincomalee and northern parts can be linked to the Sagarmala project of India to enhance maritime trade connectivity.
The Port of Hambanthota, which is now run by a joint venture between Sri Lanka ports Authority and China Merchant Port Holding Company, can play a crucial role in the BRI or AAGC.
Lanka and Bangladesh Maritime Connectivity
Exports of textiles and garments will be the principal source of foreign exchange earnings for Bangladesh. To be competitive in the apparel industry, Bangladesh will have to look for more cost effective and time efficient transportation methods. Transshipment efficiency and flexible supply chain solutions such as sea/air and air/sea would be vital to remaining competitive in this dynamic industry.
Colombo and Hambantota would be preferred transshipment ports for Bangladesh exporters due to a few factors.
As the Apparel Industry relies on speed-to-market, savings in transit time will have a significant impact on the supply chain. For example, shipping cargo westbound from Bangladesh via Singapore would involve at least four days of sailing from Bangladesh to Singapore and a further four days of sailing from Singapore to cross Sri Lanka.
However, shipping the same cargo via Colombo would instantaneously reduce four days of sailing time since it only takes four days to get to Colombo from Bangladesh. This would also reduce the carbon footprint which can appeal to eco-friendly customers in the west. Both Colombo and Hambantota can provide flexible supply chain solutions such as sea/air and air/sea due to the proximity of the airport to the seaport. Bangladesh exporters will also have the opportunity of consolidating cargo in the South Asian region which will provide consolidation benefits to both the shipper and the consignee.
Myanmar and Bay of Bengal Connectivity
Myanmars economy is growing. Growth is supported by investor optimism following policy reforms, the reinstatement of Myanmar in the EU Generalized System of Preference (GSP) for duty free and quota free market access, and gradual easing of restrictions on financial institutions. Myanmar is changing from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented system.
The IMP predicts that Myanmars GDP would quadruple by 2030. Countrys urban population is expected to double in the same period.
China and Singapore have invested heavily in Myanmar. China constructed a deep-sea port in Kyaukphyu and a pipeline from Kyaukphyu to Kunming in the Yunnan province. This pipeline can transfer roughly 400,000 barrels of oil per day. China has drilled seven gas blocks since 2007 and is building a rail line to connect the two countries. Singapores investment was aimed at bringing Myanmar closer to the level of ASEAN countries.
China has all along maintained warm economic links with Myanmar, even allowing Myanmars government to overcome western economic sanctions. India too, keeping in mind geopolitical realities, has close political and international links with the Myanmar government to gain maritime access to its land locked north-eastern states and to fight against terrorism.
India developed a port in Sittwe, situated at the mouth of Kaladan river to accommodate ships with displacement of up to 20,000 tons to dock.
This project was handed over to Mynamar and expected to be fully operational by 2019 with inland waterway links to Peletwa in Myanmars Chin state and Mizoram in India.
In the process of Sri Lankas enhancing economic engagement with Asian neighbours, Myanmar can play an important role. The two countries have an added advantage being majority Buddhist countries. Imports and exports between the two countries have great potential to improve for the sake of mutual benefit. Sri Lanka needs to identify what to import and what to export.
The two countries can even think of a FTA. Myanmar can be a big source of cheap staple food such as rice and onions. Bangladesh and India import these commodities from Myanmar.It will be a very economic proposition. Myanmar is a member of ASEAN and AFTA and that could be exploited to then benefit of Sri Lanka. Both are members of the BIMSTEC as well.
Conclusion
South Asia was overshadowed by the rapid growth of world trade integration of national economies. Strategic competition among the major powers in the Indian ocean region is hampering the economic progress of countries in the region. Maritime security due to state rivalry and presence of non-state actors is a great vulnerability in the region. There is a risk of Cyber-attacks against ports and facilities as well.
There is a need for a new regional security architecture or a Code of Conduct to ensure that collaborative efforts are taken by the states in the region and outside players. A rule based maritime order and a peaceful environment are essential for the region to flourish. Trade and investment, transport, energy, tourism are some of the key areas in which collaboration is possible. In a highly competitive world economy, transport cost is a significant determinant of competitiveness.
An integrated and efficient environment is an essential element for economic integration at any level. Countries should work together to address the issues of tariff barriers, customs regulations, out dated and restrictive and discriminatory shipping laws and documentation process to ensure that maritime trade continues freely and efficiently.

Cuckoo Collector !
If you think it was annoying losing an hours sleep this morning, just spare a thought for this guy.
It takes brothers Roman and Maz Piekarski more than 12 hours to change the time on all 700 of their cuckoo clocks.
The pair have been collecting the clocks for four decades, and established Cuckooland, the worlds only cuckoo clock museum, in Cheshire.
All the clocks were made in Germanys Black Forest, some are very rare and the oldest is more than 230 years old.
The brothers, who both trained as clockmakers in Manchester from the age of 15, are constantly fending off approaches from German enthusiasts to sell up but say they would rather die than retire.
Instead, they dream of finding a rich benefactor to house the collection when theyre gone.
Cuckoolands main income comes from the repairs the two brothers can do, reports the i.
But as the popularity of cuckoo clocks dies out, Roman said he worries that the specialist skills they have learnt will die out.
He said: I dont know what will happen in 30 or 40 years when people want clocks repairing. There wont be so many skilled repairers left. Im disabled now, and have to do the Museum tours with a stick. But well never retire. Metro

Getting electricians qualified for safe and quality wiring:
Electricians vs. Electrocution
In 2012, there were 180 deaths from electrocution, most of them owing to poor safety and quality of wiring, revealed the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) last week as it held its public consultation on establishing a licensing framework for electricians in the country at BMICH.
The licensing system is expected to come into effect on 1 October.
There are close to 21,000 electricians in the country with a majority not being qualified to operate as electricians. The new licensing system developed by the PUCSL together with the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL), the Tertiary Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA), the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA), the Ceylon Electricity Bard (CEB) and the Lanka Electricity Company (PVT) Ltd, will certify electricians based on an assessment of their skills and whether they have the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) certificate for the job.
Electricians qualified with NVQ 3 and above can obtain a permanent license from CIDA, after proving their knowledge at an evaluation facilitated by the evaluation panel, stated PUCSL whilst others will be given a temporary license for three years to allow them to get the certificate.
Those who are not professionally qualified but have hands on experience, will be given the opportunity to prove their competency and to qualify for NVQ levels through a process facilitated by CIDA, said the PUCSL.
Advantages of licensing for the electricians
Permanent licenses will also allow electricians to design, wire and test the installation of domestic wiring (30amps Signal phase) and issue a certificate to get the electrical connection needed by CEB and LECO. These electricians will also be allowed to wire, test and install three phase 30amps and 60 amps installations, subject to the design by a chartered engineer.
The new system proposed by PUCSL will also be mandatory in future to produce the certification of an electrician with the permanent license, stating that the installation was designed, wired and tested in order to receive a domestic electrical connection (up to 30A, single phase).
University of Moratuwa, Program Coordinator-Post Graduate Unit, Senior Lecturer, Dr Asanka Rodrigo voicing his opinion at the public consultations also noted that the licensing system would also have to look at skills of electricians for buildings in the future which would need to look into Mechanical and Electrical and Extra Low Voltage (ELV) systems. And thus the licensing system would also need to specify the skill levels of the electrician and their limits from the apprentice level to the utility electrical worker stage.
The present licensing only speaks of Low Voltage from 0-1000V, said Dr Rodrigo.
More importantly, he asked that professionals with appropriate qualifications and experience be included in the licensing evaluation board, so that they know what to look for.
Additional General Manager, Distribution Division 1- CEB, Chulanie Perera adding to the consultations said the CEB would look into having a standard testing system for electrical installation soon to ensure uniformity in installations.
Introducing professionalism
Everyone is an electrician these days and they try to do their own wiring but more often than not, they do not know what they are doing and that is dangerous, said Kosala Kamburadeniya from IESL as he explained that the Institute would in the next six months release an electricians manual.
Kamburadeniya also asked that regulation also be introduced to test buildings twice a year and have proper standards implemented for Moulded Case Circuit Breakers (MCCB) and Residual Current Circuit Breakers (RCCB).
In addition he also proposed that a minimum age be prescribed for electricians, the licensing process should be simple with limited red tape, testing and certification to be set up in the provinces not just in Colombo, information on it to be made easily available, only a moderate fee be charged for licensing and to include a specialization for electricians in the licensing system for industrial work. This licensing programme could also be a means to introducing professionalism and sense of dignity to the electrician. Dr Chandana Jayalath from the Institute of Quantity Surveyors welcomed the decision to certify electricians as he explained that it would fill current vacuum of not having skilled workers in the market,
There has been a deficit in trained electricians in the country and instead of training our people, there have been political moves to bring down Indians to fill that gap, said Dr Jayalath.
He further explained that the licensing system would introduce a system of accountability and occupational recognition.
Dr Jayalath also asked that the PUCSL in future work with other partners to introduce an insurance scheme, prepare statistics (there is no clear database of these professionals), provide training and every year ask that they get a medical test.
Most specifications and manuals today only come in English and this is problematic because our electricians do not understand this. Such material needs to be translated into Tamil and Sinhala, he added.
Dr Jayalath further took the opportunity to highlight one of the main problems and risks for both electricians and customers in the industry - the lack of contractualization of work.
Without the presence of signed contracts, both the customer as well as the electrician is at risk - be it the case of the customer not paying him/her the agreed amount for the work or that the electrician does not perform the job as expected, there is no way of getting what is due, if there is no signed agreement between the two parties.
We as an institution can make a simple agreement detailing charges, times, quality of goods used, etc. At present we dont have such an arrangement so we dont have trust in the workplace and more often than not people are disappointed. Trust can be won back through contractualization. Have a standard format, said Dr Jayalath.
Finally, he asked that the PUCSL also hand out Identification Cards to all electricians with their class clearly mentioned.
Enforcing the law
Sri Lanka Police Organized Crime Division DIG Kamal Silva who also addressed the forum in the meantime observed that most electrical accidents tend to be reported in rural rather than urban areas.
This is where you get many of the unauthorized users, for example an electrical fence they have put up without proper expertise or an electrical extension they try to set up on their own, he said.
The other area of risk is their own homes when they try to install their own wring without proper knowledge. We have certifications for wiring of commercial buildings but this system is not present for peoples homes. So most accidents occur here. They also use electrical appliances which do not match with their given voltage and if someone else has done the wiring, they would not give the owner the plan to keep him aware of the things he can and cannot use.
The policeman volunteered to work with the PUCSL and the CEB to increase awareness, especially in the rural areas regarding the risks of faulty wiring. The DIG further stated that they were working on releasing a Police Circular which would instruct all officers to take strict action against officials and electricians (or the person who installed the wiring) for negligence, if he/she is not the victim, under Section 298 of the Penal Code, which carried a jail sentence of five years.
The law will be enforced more rigidly, CEB engineers who pass such unsafe wiring are also liable for negligence under the law, he added.

EU, FAO conduct seminar on nutrition improvement
A two-day seminar under the theme A recipe for change  Improving nutrition through agriculture and food systems in Sri Lanka, hosted by the European Union (EU) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), was held recently in Colombo.
The seminar focused on creating wider awareness on the current nutrition conditions in Sri Lanka. It provided a platform for mutual exchange of critical knowledge on the relationship between nutrition, agriculture and food systems.
In addition, the seminar highlighted the need to re-evaluate how nutrition is addressed, both in terms of planning and implementing activities, while emphasising the key role of agriculture and trade.
The seminar also highlighted the expertise of certain key participants such as the Agriculture Ministry and the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, to assimilate data on the best methods to address nutritional challenges in Sri Lanka. Recent data from Sri Lanka, state that improvements in the nutrition status of the population do not reflect the economic growth experienced over the past decade.
The prevalence of obesity and non-communicable diseases are on the rise, while malnutrition and micro-nutrient deficiencies persist. By focussing on food systems and improving methods of food production; collected, stored, transported, transformed and distributed; greater results on improving diets and health, could be achieved.
Nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems is an approach that seeks to maximise agricultures contribution to nutrition.
Speaking on the occasion, Head of Cooperation of the Delegation to the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Libuse Soukupova said, The seminar is just one example of the efforts of the FAO and the EU in Sri Lanka, to promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems. We will continue to foster linkages, create partnerships and develop capacity to support Sri Lanka in overcoming the challenges it faces in this regard.
The importance of nutrition in human development was also highlighted by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 2; end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.
Nutrition is unfinished business from the Millennium Development Goals and must be addressed if Sri Lanka is to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and reap the full benefits of its economic development, said FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Nina Brandstrup. Agriculture and well-performing food systems are key components of the solutions to Sri Lankas nutrition challenges," she added.
The Seminar was a part of the Food and Nutrition Security Impact, Resilience, Sustainability and Transformation (FIRST) programme, which is a policy assistance facility by the European Union and the FAO.
FIRST Policy Officer for Sri Lanka Itziar Gonzalez, highlighted the importance of finding integrated solutions to combat malnutrition, emphasising that the food and agriculture sectors are uniquely positioned to provide solutions that are based on an understanding of the multi-sectorial causes of malnutrition.

Fall from grace  Aussies caught with their pants down
Australia has been renowned over the years as a great sporting nation and many countries have made them the benchmark to emulate if they want to become successful in sports.
Cricket is a game that Australia has reached zenith heights. It is a game they play with a lot of passion with no quarters asked or given. Australia is also well-known for their sledging of opponents and for trying to put them off by making false accusations to distract them from their main priority that is to try and compete and beat them.
The ball tampering incident during the third Test against South Africa at Cape Town, involving Australian captain Steve Smith and team mate Peter Handscombe that has shaken taken the entire cricket and sports world is nothing new to a nation like Australia who have been getting away with almost similar kinds of tactics in the past.
Sri Lanka has been the victim of three such incidents starting with the cunningly devised plan to get legendary off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan banned from international cricket. The cricketing world knew that Muralitharan with his unique bowling action was going to be a threat to any cricket nation and that he would end up with a pile of wickets if he is allowed to continue playing. The Aussies tried to nip it in the bud by having one of their umpires call Muralitharan for chucking during the Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne in front of a large audience. From that point onwards it was a battle for Muralitharan as well as Sri Lanka Cricket to try and defend his bowling action. Having failed in their first attempt the Aussies again got their umpires to call him when Sri Lanka made a tour there four years later in 1999. Many years later, one of the Australian umpires who called Muralitharan for throwing, Ross Emerson admitted that he did it on the instructions of a Cricket Australia official whom he did not name. Muralitharan however with his conscious quite clear that he was not resorting to any methods of cheating to obtain his wickets fought against all odds carrying the stigma of being branded a chucker throughout his career to eventually succeed and become the most successful bowler in the history of Test and One-Day International cricket.
Five years later in 2004 during the third Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at the SSC grounds Justin Langer committed some very questionable sportsmanship and got away scot free with only a warning from ICC match referee Chris Broad whose judgment of incidents on the field varies like the English weather.
Langer appeared to knock one of the bails off the stumps as he walked past when changing his fielding position in mid over. After the next delivery the Aussie team en mass made a hit wicket appeal against batsman Hashan Tillakaratne after one of the bails was spotted on the floor by captain Ricky Pointing. It was turned down after TV replays appeared to show Langer knocking it off as he walked past the stumps. There was a lengthy hold-up while the third umpire scrutinised footage of the incident and gave Tillakaratne rightly not out. Langer insisted he had "no idea" the bail had fallen off, saying: "I'm glad common sense has prevailed." He added: "It goes without saying that had I known, I would have picked it up and put it back on straight away." However a few questions remained unanswered. Why was Langer running so close to the stumps when moving to a different fielding position As anyone who has played cricket at any level knows, you shouldn't go anywhere near the wicket if you are not batting, bowling or fielding the ball. Why didn't wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist notice one of the bails was missing as he focused on the delivery after Langer had 'accidentally' dislodged it Isn't it the job of the wicketkeeper to stand behind the stumps and follow the flight of the ball and to watch the movement of the batsman Surely he should have known Tillakaratne had not dislodged the bail. Finally and most importantly, would another team apart from Langer's Aussies get away with such a crude act of gamesmanship Langer was charged under level one, clause two of the ICC Code of Conduct that states that players should not "engage in conduct unbecoming to their status which could bring them or the game of cricket into disrepute". He could have been fined up to 50% of his match fee if found guilty. But match referee Chris Broad said Langer had given an "honest and succinct" explanation and had been "reminded" to avoid any such incidents in future.
The third incident involves Gilchrist himself when he slaughtered the Lankan bowlers for 149 off 103 balls to win the Cricket World Cup for Australia in 2007 in the Caribbean aided by a squash ball in his left glove to help him with his grip.
Gilchrists stupendous innings left the cricket pundits wondering how legal was his innings and how authentic was Australias World Cup triumph Can a batsman carry an object - in this case, a squash ball - not connected with cricket to help him on the field Did he secure the prior permission of the umpires Was the fielding side captain aware of the use of the squash ball and did he approve of its use
And, above all, did Gilchrists hidden ball give him an unfair advantage in knocking the daylights out of the Lankan bowlers Hypothetical questions that left cricket haters plainly mystified but keeps cricket lovers breathlessly debating the whys and wherefores till kingdom come.
Law 3 (6) (c) (i) specifically prohibits a player from using equipment other than that permitted which is a helmet, leg guards (pads), hand gloves and, if visible, forearm guards. Gilchrists squash ball was, therefore, neither a piece of protective equipment, nor a clothing item, and was most certainly not visible to either side or the umpires. And nowhere in crickets 42 laws is there a mention of a squash ball as a permitted item. But MCC who are the final authority on matters to do with the Laws ruled that: "It is no different to wearing inners, etc." The matter ended right there and Gilchrist got away with it.
Having got out of so many escapades of this nature the past finally caught up with the Australians with the ball tampering affair that has left the entire nation humiliated and ashamed.
The words of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on the incident speaks for itself: "We are usually the nation that fights against corruption in sport, but here we have the captain of the Australian cricket team involved in cheating. We see ourselves as a great sporting nation and this has really tarnished that image. It is a big shock when our heroes do something wrong."
The bigger they come, the harder they fall.

Girl not expelled from school  asserts Gampaha Zonal Education Director
Gampaha police intervenes to settle issue, girls mother fails to turn up

The alleged expulsion of a girl suspected to be HIV+ from her school has once again drawn much public outrage and criticism, mostly on public officials and on the school for not being supportive of a studious student despite the false accusations.
The Grade 5, school girl who was studying at the Gampaha-Ganemulla Kudabollatha Sri Sumangala Vidyalaya, was allegedly expelled from school over fears that she maybe HIV+. Her mother along with a relative staged a sit-in protest outside the Zonal Education Directors office in Gampaha since Monday, accusing the department for their failure ensure that the school permits the child to study.
The Daily News however contacted the Zonal Director of Education, W. Mallika who emphasized that the school had not made any decisions pertaining to the student and it was the student who failed to turn up at school.
The school has not expelled nor suspended the child. We checked with them and there have been no issues, as those suggested by the childs mother, the director said. The student has not turned up in school at all. Neither have parents persuaded the child to attend school.
The director added that the Gampaha Police also intervened in the matter and arranged for the Principal to meet with the child and her parents in the presence of police. We requested them to come and discuss their issues and although the principal of the school turned up, the child or her mother failed to attend the meeting.
The Director drawing empathy on the child said that that it was up to the childs mother to realize that their efforts such as these protests would have far reaching consequences on the childs future. It is up to the childs parents to realize the extent of damage their actions would have on their child.
The Director went on to add that the childs mother was a member of a movement for those with HIV+ and it was unclear if the mother was intentionally trying to draw public ire and attention so that they may benefit financially from the organization and its international partners.

Gift-wise New Year
The common belief is that the god of the sun begins his journey in the month of April. Bak alludes to prosperity in Sinhala. That connotation led to the genesis of the months name. The Sinhala Buddhist community celebrates the dawn of the month with a new hearth boiling new rice.
And the National Library Services Board has much to offer on the occasion.
To coincide with the 28th anniversary of the National Library and Documentation Services Board (NLDSB), a book exhibition titled as Bak Mahe Poth Mangalya 2018 will be held at the National Library premises from April 4 to 8 from 9 am to 8 pm under the theme Gift a Book for New Year under the supervision of NLDSB Assistant Director Kusala Sajivani.
The real education is not confined to towers, buildings, cities and vehicles. A real education creates a citizen instrumental in the societal growth. On the contrary, the current education system is manifesting a generation of generation as against the rich tradition of Anuradhapura civilisation. Education must fulfil not only the worldly, physical and mental growth but also the spiritual growth of the humans. It is not only the teachers who are responsible to this, but also the parents, the elders, the government as well as the media. Education must succeed in resolving the conflicts as well as revolving the internal human knowledge. To achieve this end, the most practical end is to persuade the child to read books, Sajivani said.
Reading is a vital factor in order to build a proper society. It will be a vital step in listening to the other, bearing, reconciliation, understanding the others mutual feelings, utilise the literature and achieve the challenges.
NLDSB is geared to make arrangements to gift a new book to introduce a noble concept. Inculcating noble habits are not so easy. As the National Library has taken on that initiative, Sri Lankas pioneer book publishers will take part in this exhibition with the objective to show how important this whole project is. Reading is an essential factor whether the education is proper, indirect, lifetime or self. We lived in a righteous society in the past.
We have reached the information age thanks to the unique revolution of the information technology. But we are lost in the whirlpool of information without being able to decipher the accurate information from the fake. What is the use of physical development if we are yet to achieve the ethical development Sajivani questioned.
The National Library has offered the stalls for a reasonable price. A series of lectures has also been arranged for schoolchildren who face Scholarship examination, O/Ls and A/Ls. This series is aimed at proper entertainment beyond the subject matter. Athula Ransirilal is also scheduled to deliver a special lecture on the art of dubbing to the university students and mass media students.
Still looking for the perfect gifts in the forthcoming New Year season True, people are hard to please. Dont worry. Step into the National Library premises, close to Independence Square, between April 4 and 8, and browse the books available for reasonable prices.
Here are 10 top reasons to make sure there are lots of books under the auspices of New Year!
1. Books are easier to wrap than football.
2. Books dont need batteries.
3. Books dont hurt when you step on them in the middle of the night.
4. Books never come in the wrong color or size.
5. Books dont irritate your allergies.
6. Books are easy and cheap to mail.
7. Books never need ironing.
8. Books dont need to be assembled before being given.
9. When you are finished with a book, it is not empty.
10. A book is a gift you can open again, and again, and again!

Girl claims expulsion
The schoolgirl who stated that she was expelled due to an HIV AIDS fear, held a protest opposite the Gampaha Zonal Education office from March 24.
The girl, who attended the Gampaha - Ganemulla Kudabollatha Sri Sumangala Vidyalaya, claims she was stopped from attending school from February 20 due to the actions of education authorities.
Incidentally, the girl who was due to sit for the Grade 5 scholarship examination this year, had excelled in her studies coming first in the class from Grade 1 to Grade 5 continuously. This girl who lost her opportunity to attend school in February last year too was given the opportunity to restart schooling due to the intervention of the Human Rights Commission.
According to the girls guardians, although the principal had promised the opportunity for her to attend school without hindrance, he had allegedly prevented her from attending school from March 20, citing the incidents which occurred last year.
The guardians alleged that even though the principal was summoned to the Zonal Office for a discussion on the matter, he had arrived at the Zonal Office and left unnoticed after leaving behind his motorcycle.

A harebrained order
Politicians have never had it so good. Not only do they live on the fat of the land but have now got to be pandered to and waited upon by the most unexpected quarters. According to the main story of an English daily, the Colombo Zonal Education office has issued a letter directing Principals of Colombo schools to invite parliamentarians and PC members, who represent the area, for all special school functions. In a letter dated February 20, sent to all schools within the territory of the Colombo Zonal Division, the Zonal Education Director had said the principals are bound to give members of parliament due respect when they attend such events. He has also attached the names of Provincial Council members representing the Colombo Zonal Division, for good measure. It is not clear if the practice is going to cover all the schools in the island.
The directive, naturally, has drawn heavy flak from the trade unions attached to the education sector. According to Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin, the move was an insult to the Principals. He charged that such a move could lead to schools too to be entirely politicized.
But there is a graver risk involved. More than being politicized, schools could be devalued by the move and in the case of elite schools, in Colombo, lose their prestige. One recalls how a powerful minister in the Rajapaksa regime stormed into an elite school in Colombo with his security contingent and intimidated the Principal for taking disciplinary action against the son of this politician. The school official concerned succumbed to pressure in the end. This is why politicians should be kept out of bounds from school premises.
It is often reported that one third of our honourable members of parliament have not passed their GCE (OL) examinations. Included among them, no doubt, would be MPs representing the Colombo Educational Zone. Leave alone their educational qualification, the conduct of our parliamentarians, the kind of abuse they hurl at each other, the all too frequent wrestling matches in the Well of the House, fleeing with the Mace, that is the symbol of authority of parliament, are certainly not the stuff that could inspire school children to be exemplary citizens.
It was only a few months ago that an MP, and a Deputy Minister to boot, was seen making a spectacle of himself, pretending to commit suicide by placing a rope round his neck, that was attached to a ceiling fan, while another government MP was seeing conducting a death fast on the middle of the road, demanding the transfer of the OIC of the local police station. Another MP, known for his garrulity, staged a death farce while in hospital, due to the denial of bail for one of his several offences that are being heard in court, committed during the heyday of the former regime.
These are but a microscopic representation of the antics of our erstwhile people's representatives, who, school principals and their charges now have to genuflect before, after compulsorily inviting them for school functions, if the directive explicitly asking them to show respect is to be literally taken.
What about our MPs in waiting, in the Provincial Councils, who, too, are eligible for the same respect, as per the Zonal Director's directive These are but the kith and kin of the MPs, already mentioned, waiting to take over the baton, some day, from their mamas and papas and, who are, no doubt, made of the same stuff. Are these the examples that our younger generation is going to be exposed to at a tender and impressionable age
What is more, most often these young students are made to kneel before these PCs, most of whom have criminal cases pending against them in the courts. On whose instructions did the Zonal Director issue these instructions Are all the leading schools in Colombo going to follow this edict
It is time that sanity prevailed and someone in higher authority gets this order rescinded immediately. Schools have enough issues to contend with without their Principals being forced to wait on politicians with questionable pedigree, at their school functions. Not only that, school children should not be used to bolster the ego of politicians. Today, these MPs and PCs are taken in procession to the accompaniment of school bands to the venue of the school functions. This should strictly be confined to the President, Prime Minister, the Minister of Education, religious dignitaries or philanthropists by whose largess the school concerned may have benefited.
Schools are sanctified seats of learning, and, should always maintain this facade. It should not be made to be blotted by the presence of run of the mill politicians, certainly not the types we have in our midst. True, in the past too politicians attended school functions. But this was a time when our parliamentarians were not viewed by the public with a jaundiced eye. Those were also the times when mass communication was not what it is now. Today the public, including schoolchildren, view the conduct of politicians on TV and form their own opinion about their representatives.

Iconic  dishes reimagined
Its no secret plenty of shoppers go to IKEA just to eat the meatballs - but the furniture giant has announced some more bizarre cafeteria creations.
The Dogless Hotdog, a creation made with dried baby carrots and a bun made of micro-algae, The Bug Burger - a burger made from mealworms and the Neatball, also made from mealworms are a few of the new items added to the menu.
The company announced a secret lab in Copenhagen known as Space10 which develops new dishes.
The Dogless Hotdog, The Bug Burger, The Neatball - both a variety made from mealworms and another from vegetables, the LOKAL salad made from microgreens and Microgreen ice cream are the dishes they tried.
The lab posted an update on blogging site Medium saying theyd re-imagined five dishes.
They wrote: At SPACE10, our research is rooted in an important principle. Dishes shouldnt just be healthy or sustainable. They must be delicious, too.
To change peoples minds about food, to inspire them to try new ingredients, we cant just appeal to the intellect - we have to titillate their taste buds.
Which is why weve been working with our chef-in-residence to come up with dishes that look good, taste good, and are good for people and planet.
Its time, then, to put some of those dishes on the menu - starting with a playful take on our favourite fast-food.
They added to the post the dishes were fresh from the test kitchen, so to not expect them on IKEAs menu any time soon. Mirror

The enhancements to IFS Applications empower IFS customers with important capabilities that facilitate compliance with the new regulation, which comes into effect on May 25, 2018. A similar update for IFS Field Service Management will be released in Q1 2018.
GDPR compliance is supported by the new functionality that is included in IFS Applications 9 as of update 10 and onward, which is available now. Similar functionality will support IFS Field Service Management 5.7 from update 3 and onward from late Q1 2018.
The new functionality will support compliance with GDPR requirements through all the key processes related to personal data management.
These include, Lawful collection, ( According to GDPR, personal data is to be collected solely for specific defined purposes and only stored for as long as necessary for such purposes.) Secure storage, ( Personal data must be entered and stored securely within systems used for its processing and in accordance with the access permissions necessary for the purpose for which it has been collected.) Secure recall/relay, (having the ability to recall and relay the data is an essential component of GDPR compliance.
The new functionality facilitates this by introducing a new standard report which can be run for a specific data subject recorded within IFS Applications or IFS Field Service Management.) Secure maintenance and removal (Three of the key requirements under GDPR are to maintain up to date records, the right of the data subject to be forgotten, and the need for the data controller to retain records for lawful purposes other than consent.) and Lawful usage (Holding personal data in the system and being able to recall, report and remove data when required is essential and all of it relies on correct setup, maintenance and usage of personal information which in turn is reliant upon ease of access, visualization of data and the ability to be informed.)

The expenses of the Audit Service Commission, which has been inactive due to non-passage of the National Audit Act in Parliament, totalled Rs 33 million in 2016, the Commissions Annual Report revealed. The report was tabled in Parliament last Friday.
The Audit Service Commission was set up in November 2015 following the passage of 19th Amendment to the Constitution, but it has been unable to carry out its functions due to the absence of Audit Act.
The report further said the Commission has been unable to make any appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control, dismissal of the members belonging to the Audit Service due to the non-establishment of the Sri Lanka State Audit Service. Till the Act is passed, the Public Service Commission exercises those powers of the Audit Commission.
Out of the Audit Commissions total expenditure of Rs 33 million in 2016, Rs 26 million had been spent on recurrent expenditure and Rs 6 million on capital expenditure. The Commission had paid salaries and wages, overtime and holiday payments, and other allowances to the tune of Rs 11.5 million in 2016.
According to the report, the Commission had spent Rs 9.4 million as rents and local taxes. This amount includes the rental for the office building which was shifted from the Auditor Generals Department to No 35 A, Dr. N.M. Perera Mawatha, Colombo 8 in April 2016.
The Commission had spent Rs 5.9 million to buy furniture and office equipment. It had spent another Rs 1 million for stationary and office requisites, Rs 1.5 million for fuel, Rs 266,000 for electricity and water, Rs 300,000 for vehicle maintenance, and Rs 96,000 for diets and uniforms.
The report indicated 51 percent vacancies existed at the Commission against the approved cadre as at December 31, 2016. The total number of existing cadre was 21 against the 43 approved cadre of the Commission.
The report said a financial allocation of Rs 35.5 million was received to the Commission from the Treasury for year 2016.
The Audit Commission is chaired by Gamini Wijesinghe (Auditor General) and comprises members Nihal Sunil Rajapaksha, I. Gamini Abeyarathna, V.Kandasamy and W. A. Somapala Perera. The Commission had conducted 16 meetings in 2016 and had repeatedly brought the attention of the relevant authorities of the need to pass the Audit Act for the Commission to execute its full powers vested under the Constitution.

Indias new GST system to  cut import, export costs
Indias new GST system will bring down the cost of imports and exports for Sri Lanka from and to India.
The traders based in Sri Lanka will not have to bear the cost of any indirect tax except the basic customs duty and Social Welfare Surcharge, as applicable. Traders in India can now claim GST paid on imported goods as tax credit from Government of India, The High Commission of India said.
Launched in July 2017, GST is hailed as Indias biggest tax reform since independence. GST has resulted in economic integration of India, by subsuming more than a dozen State and Central levies into one tax. GST has unified 29 states of India into a common national market for the first time. [One nation, One tax]. GST has also substantially increased ease of doing business in India. GST has mitigated cascading effects in taxation as well as ensured transparency, certainty and simplicity.

Indian telecom sector to create 10 mn jobs
The telecom industry, which has been witnessing job losses due to consolidation, is expected to create over 10 million employment opportunities in the next five years, as per the education skill development body for the sector.
"There are 4 million people employed in the telecom sector and by the end of five years, 14.3 million people will be employed in telecom as well as telecom manufacturing," Telecom Sector Skill Council (TSSC) CEO S P Kochhar told PTI in an interview.
According to a CIEL HR report, since last year the telecom sector has already lost around 40,000 jobs and the trend is likely to continue for the next six-nine months, with the total figure expected to reach 80,000-90,000.
Kochhar said TSSC, under the National Skill Development Corporation, expects major demand for employment to come from emerging technologies like machine-to-machine communications, followed by telecom manufacturing, infrastructure and services companies.
"We are increasingly seeing manufacturing line coming to India. That gives us a lot of hope in the telecom sector as far as skilling is concerned. There we have huge amount of potential and the projections that are made by telecom manufacturing industry is that 14.2 lakh people will be employed in this sector," Kochhar said.

Inspiration is the  key
Head Boy of British School in Colombo Darren Halls vigour and vision are inspirational. Perfect Prefects features Darren Hall who feels the urgent need for powerful change in society and sees himself as part of this change.
The well- known scientist Stephen Hawkings intellect was astounding. Hall is very much inspired by this great mind. Halls ability to be inspired by great minds is certainly one of his great strengths. This inspiration is a key factor in his leadership.
Take Stephen Hawking, he had a disease leaving him unable to walk or talk. They thought he was going to die in his 20s and he still lived into the 70s. He never gave up and achieved many of his dreams. He did not let the disease stop him from doing what he wanted to do. If there is something bothering, remember you can always get through it.
Inspiring technology
Science-based things really interest me, such as what Elon Musk is doing. He wants to make Mars habitable, so we can reduce earths population. He really inspires me doing incredible things with technology. It makes me feel like everyone on this planet can really do something and impact the world through their efforts through science and technology, said Hall.
In addition to having vigour, compassion is another trait Hall possesses. He feels for those who suffer and feels that helping them is his calling in life.
When I see things like what is happening in Syria and even in the States, I would like to be there for those children who are really suffering. I want to make sure that they are ok, even if it is something as small as a donation, or visiting somewhere nearby so I can help them out. I want to make sure I can do that.
One thing I want to do is to make sure that we help the people who are most in need. I believe we are in a privileged position to do that. We need to make sure that we help those who are not as fortunate as we are. Even if I have a company which makes a lot of money, what is important is how that money is re-distributed around us and if it goes into the hands of those who really need it. Once I have enough capital, confidence and experience I would like to have my own company. However, that is just a plan. I am still very young and cannot say what will happen in the future, but I can only hope for the best, explains Hall.
High School shootings have become somewhat of a routine in America. Just seven weeks into 2018, there had been eight shootings at US schools. Cowardly though they are, they are carried out by mentally unstable teenagers.
I think America needs to abandon the old gun laws, where it states everyone in America has the right to own a gun. They need to say only certain people have the right to have guns, perhaps policemen and army officers. Normal citizens should not have access to guns. In the States, you are allowed to have a gun before you are even allowed to have a drink. It is too easy for these children to have guns, and they come to schools and start shooting innocent people.
Innocent community
We need to help children who do have these mental health issues and make sure that they have someone to talk to, so they will avoid trying to kill innocent people. Even if he or she cant use a gun, he or she can still use a knife. So if you really want to solve the issue you need to go to the root of the problem which is the persons mental problems. There needs to be some sort of institute or guidance counsellor to help those people. There must be some way to distinguish between those who need help and who do not, elucidated Hall.
British School in Colombo is a great place because everyone there is very friendly. It is a very close community. The teachers make sure that everyone is very safe and comfortable. They are also very good teachers. You never get bullied or anything of that sort. The new ones who come in can get comfortable easily when it comes to the social and academic aspects of the school.
I am very privileged to get this position in the first place. I dont think it was a particular individual characteristic that helped me to become Head Boy. But I think it was simply helping everyone around me and making sure that teamwork was the number one priority. And that was what lead me to become Head Boy.
I think what it takes to become a leader is knowing when to rely on others and when to rely on yourself and follow your gut instinct. You need to know when to avoid doing what everyone else thinks is right and do what you think is right. You need to be close to everyone around you but not too close when emotional factors get in the way of what you have to do, added Hall.
Halls advice to anyone who wants to be a leader is not to try and be someone they are not. At the end of the day being your original self will suit you and the entire world for the better. You need to make sure that you dont try and control everything and become a dictator.
I want to head to university, after finishing my A/Ls, in Dublin or in the UK. I think I will be doing engineering as a degree and hopefully I will become an engineer. I would like to join a firm, perhaps the Middle East would be the best. So once I settle down I would like to form my own company, said Hall.
Leader admired
Obama is a leader in history that Hall admires and World Wars I and II are events he says we can learn something from.
I like Barack Obama because he was very laid back and relaxed and did not go over the top, he didnt try to create problems and start a war, but he did what he had to do, such as trying to change the gun policy but it did not work out. He was compassionate and showed the people that he was human as well like everyone else.
The events in history that grab my attention are World Wars I and II. It is amazing how many people suffered and what they had to go through. A World War III would be far worse because now there are nuclear weapons. It would be very frightful and terrible. World War III might very well be the extinction of the human race, stated Hall.
Hall was born in Abu Dhabi and lived there for 15 years. He went to school there for 12 years and came to British School in Colombo in 2014 where he has been there for three and a half years. His mother is Sri Lankan and his father is Irish and has been visiting Sri Lanka every year.
I have been doing Football and Athletics since year 10, and I am also part of a group called Educo which helps people in need. So we have visited an Orphanage once a week and teach them different things like mathematics and how to draw. I was also part of Badminton for a little while.
When playing Football, the key is teamwork, so we need this not only in football but in life as well. You need to work well as a team and to support one another. So if you do not do this on the pitch and in life as well you will not succeed in both situations. You need to be relaxed and be confident. I play golf as well in my spare time, I would go to the golf club maybe two or three times a week and take part in tournaments. I have played a few junior tournaments as well. I also love to play table tennis at home at the apartment complex where I live. So I play table tennis quite often with my neighbours. So unlike Football, these are individual games, so you just need to be confident which will help you do your very best, summed up Hall.

IPM President presents leadership skills for professionals
IPM Sri Lanka President, Director of PIM and a leading management thinker, Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri recently conducted a special evening seminar on Essential Leadership Skills for Professionals organized jointly by IPM Sri Lanka and the Seminars, Workshops & Programmes Committee of the Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA). The seminar was held at the auditorium of the OPA headquarters in Colombo which was filled to capacity by the professionals representing OPA as well as IPM Sri Lanka.
I am glad that I am talking about essential leadership skills with professionals because professionals can make a critical contribution to the countrys progress at this critical juncture amidst the numerous challenges that we are facing. This I believe is the correct forum to be involved in a discussion on leadership. Leadership is the most vastly researched but least understood phenomenon on earth said Prof. Dharmasiri addressing the professionals. He shared a refreshingly new way of presenting a leader, as a servant, synergist and a strategist with global and local examples.
There are leaders at every layer of an organization and every sphere of life. Leadership is all about taking right decisions at the right time in the right manner achieving right, required results. In different situations, leaders need to adapt and play the role of dealers in hope to take the organization forward he added.
After an interesting question and answer session where members were able to clarify their thoughts, the evening seminar was followed by networking and fellowship which gave an opportunity for members of both professional bodies to exchange ideas, expand and forge new relationships for the benefit of the industry. The OPA comprises of over 48 professional bodies.
IPM Sri Lanka keeps pace with new trends and concepts in HR by engaging continuously with the business community to share experiences, thoughts and insights in order to enrich and enhance the HR profession. It actively encourages and promotes members participation at international conferences and forums to provide exposure, build networks and conduct research into areas of interest to the HR profession in Sri Lanka. IPM was founded in 1959 and was subsequently incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1976.
IPM is affiliated to the Asia Pacific Foundation of Human Resources Management and also to the World Federation of People Management Association.

journey  not so joyful
Madhura Charika is a simple tale but craftily shot, adding drama and poignancy to a narrative that shows a small child actor, contained and confident, paired with an old veteran. Although the entire movie is understated, a particular strength of presence pervades the film, through the roles of the actors. The actors rarely display grand emotion and the scenes are not over dramatised; if at all, they are underplayed, adding a sophisticated touch of irony. Its power is derived from the audiences unconscious desire to see this old actor gaining his just reward in a final curtain call of glory, which never materialises. Equally compelling is the compassion of strangers on the streets  a prostitute and her pimp assist the dying man  making for an unlikely but welcome ending that restores our faith in the essential goodness of man.
For a moment we fall in love with Wilson Godamanna the octogenarian grandfather settled down with his family in the lush hill country. The trivial stubble does not disturb his pleasing outlook. Godamanna is anyway portrayed as an elder, tidy and neat.
Yet what is not pleasing is what he has to endure towards the last stages of his life.
In Sri Lanka there is one certainty to which all the filmmakers have arrived in unison: there is no cinema industry in the country. For some, the industry is still in nascent stages. For some, it's still in teething stages. Apparently, the industry is not born yet for some.
Udayakantha Warnasuriya toys with the irony of his own career when he allocates a few scenes to portray how Sri Lanka's cinema functions. The same old crowd frequents the Tharangani Hall, the contemporary Mecca whenever the National Film Corporation chooses to organise or collaborate a film fest. The crowd is treated to a sumptuous feast.
An ageing Wilson, happily settled in a hamlet off Nuwara Eliya with his son's family, journeys to Colombo to watch a film with his pre-teen grandson in tow. The cultural big shots in Colombo, in the meanwhile, look for at least one actor in the antique film shown to celebrate the 68th anniversary of Sinhala cinema. Following a series of unexpected adventures, Wilson finally reaches for what he deserves.
At the moment we are surrounded by more buttonholes who keep on talking about the predicament of Sri Lankan cinema than those who actually try to fix it. We need buttonholes. That's no issue. But we need more people to work on making the Sri Lankan cinema an industry.
Warnasuriya employs a new trope: inserting old scenes from the films. They do not hurt the flow of the movie. But it does not add much colour to the flow, if not for occasional humour. But what Wilson remembers comes as a flashback truly bringing forth his atavistic desires.
More than cinematic beauty Warnasuriya takes us to the philosophy with the plot outline. He deals with what most of his contemporaries have been coughing up for years and decades. [Spoiler alert] Wilson develops an interest in going to Colombo from the moment he set eyes on the newspaper item about the festival. But his son is more interested in plucking yams. That's fair by him. His father's chosen career has not bequeathed him any wealth. He has to earn a living and leave his father to his own artistic devices. While the cinema professionals finally hit the bed, satisfied that they did something worthwhile, a sex worker and her facilitator (euphemism intended) gets active towards midnight to offer a helping hand to dying Wilson.
As the mystery unfurls things get clearer, or so we can imagine, and Warnasuriya spirals his plot into a dark conclusion. Madhura Charika may not be Warnasuriya's masterpiece, yet it is an atmospheric feast of visual beauty. With the green scenery in the background, there lurks a tragic present and a buried glory. Warnasuriya methodically sets up his characters and introduces Wilson's past veiled in the vintage scenes. It is a subtle exploration of Wilson Godamannas secret passion for glory. Udayakantha Warnasuriya meticulously manages the film and its direction, controlling its pace, raising and lowering the intensity of the rise and fall of Wilson Godamanna.
To check the quality of our own cinema as an industry we need to weigh its score against Hollywood, Bollywood, Kollywood or at least Nollywood. But sadly we have no criteria to measure the quality. And worse, the industry does not rake in enough money to ventilate some decent professionalism to the industry.
Udayakantha Warnasuriya (director, scriptwriter and producer) Dayawansa Jayakody (co-producer) and Kumara Wanduressa (co-producer) deserve much kudos for introducing an insightful cinematic work to the local audience.

LG Bodies: An unfinished business
The good men of the Good Governance government will have to consider various obstacles before developing the nation. They include political interference, additional cost and political influence. The general public needs to ascertain just and fair attention on utilizing public funds to meet the community needs without misappropriation.
The general public entertains diverse opinions on ongoing functions of local government authorities and their existing management. Perhaps it is opportune to determine how effective certain measures could be improved with, or without political interference through elections. Over one and half years, the municipal and urban councils, and pradeshiya sabhas functioned without political interference.
Following great effort and time framework of regulation of terms and conditions laid down by the respective ministerial authorities, the local government elections were held in February 2018. But still, it remains a question as some areas are supposed to commence the functions of respective authorities with the newly elected members. This will put an end to various problems within the respective political parties. Through media, we come across confusions of the political parties.
Provincial council administration
With all those commotions, whatever said and done, the local authorities used to function as usual with approved statutes and regulation through secretaries appointed with the permanent staff - either commissioner, state management service (supra grade or class I officers). This was under the guidance of the provincial council administration without much complication and other overhead expenditures such as emoluments and various allowances like fuel, maintenance of vehicles for council members, meetings and relevant expenses.
With the appointment of council members, there will be a change of administrative role. The commissioners and secretaries who run the present administration will have to hand over that power to the appointed political heads. This is where the political interference begins with the office staff and decisions taken on certain routine matters. This may or may not affect beyond the rules and regulations based on the academic and experiences of the appointed members.
As per media information, many instances of corruption and fund-misappropriation have occurred before dissolving the previous authorities. The corruptions and misappropriations of government funds on procurement, procedures and other relative development work for the benefit of the communities has become something inevitable. Besides, whatever work involved at local authorities, implementing the accepted procedures to scrutinize any submissions received from the general public by entrusted the respective officers qualified special areas in the local authorities (administrative, technical, engineering, valuation, health, construction, waste management, water supply, and other community services) is essential.
Political supporters
We must go back more than five decades and observe how the functions were carried out at Gam Sabha offices with local appointed staff with Gam Muladani system. Now there are more academically qualified personnel. We must make use of their services to fulfil the tasks of the local authorities instead of political movement. At this point, the appointment of political operators for local authorities seems to be in nursery stages.
Costing is a vital factor in local governance. The regulations need to be followed on the local government level by considering the economic situation of the country. The general public should be given a free hand to walk into any local government office without any disturbance. If the public had to approach the council members through political supporters, lackeys and brokers that situation has to change now. The council members should be more approachable to get the work done.
Time is now ripening to consider and come out with necessary suggestions. The respective authorities must step into a progressive way to offer a peaceful and uninterrupted service.

Microsoft revealed how rapid advances in emerging technologies have created new ways to turn data into iterative insights at a recent C-level conference titled Manufacturing in the Digital Era. The event, which took place at Cinnamon Grand Colombo, revealed how data and the advent of connected devices and platforms are driving the persistent digitization of manufacturing.
The pace of digital transformation is accelerating, and we expect by 2021, at least 60 percent of Asia Pacific's GDP will be derived from digital products or services. This will have a positive and measurable impact on Sri Lankas manufacturing sector, said Hasitha Abeywardene, Country Manager for Microsoft Sri Lanka and Maldives.
From quantitative to qualitative data, the concept of data plays a critical role in todays current trend of automation. And no one knows this better than manufacturers. Not only do they use data to make thoughtful business decisions, but they also use it to streamline their processes.
Chandrima Rodrigo, Head of IT, Ceylon Biscuits Limited; Samath Fernando, CIO, Hirdaramani Group; Dean Shaw, Industry Solutions Director, Microsoft APAC
Dean Shaw, Industry Solutions Director for the Asia Pacific Region, delivered a key note on manufacturing in the digital era or how manufacturers were leveraging cloud computing, augmented reality, artificial intelligence and IoT. According to Shaw, integrating such technologies has helped manufacturers like Rolls-Royce and Deschutes Brewery identify new revenue streams and extract deep insights from data to optimize business outcomes and best practices.
With emerging technologies starting to enter the manufacturing mainstream, organizations must establish new metrics and realign organization structures to utilize the sheer volume and velocity of data. Last year, Hirdaramani Group deployed an internal QMS system built by Microsoft partner H One, to digitize data collection and improve the end-to-end quality of apparel using Microsoft Azure and Power BI.
Microsoft partners at the event then showcased their own industry solutions to help manufacturing organizations in their transformation journeys.
A representative from nCinga presented an industrial IoT based solution developed on Microsoft Azure called nFactory to assist decisions makers with actionable insights by capturing events in real time and contextually streaming it via Power BI.
Similarly, JustAnalytics showcased its ability to integrate unstructured and structured data for agile data discovery using customizable Power BI dashboards, while Microimage showcased how HCM Cloud is helping manufacturing organizations manage their largest assetpeople.
The event concluded with a panel discussion featuring CIO of Hirdaramani, Samath Fernando and Ceylon Biscuits Limited Head of IT Chandrima Rodrigo, initiating a conversation over the benefitspredictive-analytics, machine learning, and a view related content featureMicrosoft Azure and Power BI have across multiple manufacturing segments and how manufacturing leaders can prepare themselves given the importance of data in the digital era.

GOVERNMENT WILL DEFEAT NCM - MP
Ministers', MPs' foreign tours cancelled
Foreign tours of all Government Ministers and MPs have been cancelled from April 2 to 6 in view of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister.
Speaking to the media at the Sirikotha UNP Head Office, UNP MP Ashu Marasinghe said all Government MPs currently overseas have been asked to cut short their visits and return to the country by April 1.
The NCM is not only targeting Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but also the Government. We will definitely defeat it and turn it around as a confidence motion on the Government. The Joint Opposition at the Party Leaders Meeting wanted to delay the NCM and asked that it be taken up only after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The Government decided to give priority to it, Prof. Marasinghe said.
He said no member in the Government ranks has the moral right to support the NCM, adding that those who signed the motion must resign from their portfolios before April 4. After the NCM, we will start a new journey with new vigour. Those who dragged the Government from its feet have no place in it, the MP said.
He said a decision on extending the Memorandum of Understanding between the UNP and SLFP would be taken after the NCM on April 4. We hope that many SLFP members will continue to work with the UNP he added.
He also said the UNP Working Committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide on party reforms, adding that those changes could be expected before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The MP was confident of defeating the NCM even if the SLFP decides to vote in favour. We have contingency plans. It is a good opportunity to expose and expel the Government members with double-standards.We can clean-up the Government and go ahead, he said.
UNP backbenchers Wijayapala Hettiarachchi and Prof.Ashu Marasinghe were of the view that the JOs NCM against the Prime Minister and Government invariably applies to the President as well because he is the Head of Government as per the Constitution.
Quoting the Constitution, they pointed out the President is a member of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. This is a conspiracy and it will not end by removing PM Wickremesinghe.The next target would be the Speaker and the President, they said.

Mobitel launches DengueFreeChild app
Mobitel introduced a mobile application (app) called DengueFreeChild, during a ceremony held at the BMICH in Colombo, yesterday, to help control dengue fever in the country.
It was launched with the aim of helping parents to report cases of dengue or any other type of fever, while being updated about dengue hotspots. The app grants separate access for government officials and school authorities, in addition to the use of the general public to share and access information about dengue.
Addressing the launching ceremony, Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel Chairman P. G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena said that launching the app is another social service performed by the company. The communication technology of the company had been used for various social welfare services during recent disasters.
"The company has a higher number of connections than the total population of Sri Lanka. Time would be allocated through PEO TV 365, for dengue prevention. What we need today is to work according to the requirements of society, without limiting ourselves to rules and regulations," he said. Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi said that according to the latest statistics, dengue outbreaks at schools had declined from 30 percent to five percent. Information is often withheld when it comes to dengue patientseven at schools. But with this new app, the public would be able to obtain the latest information regarding dengue patients, instantly.
Health Ministry Deputy Director-General (Public Health) Dr. Sarath Amunugama said over 99.3 percent of child dengue patients had made full recoveries. In January, this year, about 2,000 dengue patients had been reported, but at present, the numbers have dropped to 500. However, those numbers could rise again with the ongoing rain, he added.

Muslim Ministers call for justice
Nearly 20 Muslim parliamentarians handed over a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting his intervention on the continued hate campaign, adding that those who have been arrested on charges of spreading hate and inciting violence have been granted bail when they can be tried under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
The document signed by Ministers A. H. M. Fowzie, Rauff Hakeem, Rishad Bathiudeen, Faizer Musthapa, M. H. A. Haleem and Mujibur Rahman among others have requested the President to provide a permanent solution to the protracted problem within a period of 30 days.
The recent incidents in Ampara, Digana, Teldeniya and Kandy are not spontaneous reactions to any particular issue, but an organized strategy to destroy the Muslim morale and economy, the letter reads. We suspect there are bigger forces handling these perpetrators of violence.
The Ministers added that violence was unleashed in the presence of the police and armed forces, allowing mobs to move freely even when curfew was enforced and the country was in a state of emergency.
Adding that there is ample evidence to convict the extremists, the Ministers state that many of those who were initially arrested have been released on conditional bail leading to a continued hate campaign and mayhem across the country.

Performance without barrier
The East Indian state dance Manipuri gained worldwide recognition. Manipuri originated in the East Indian state of Manipur. The word Manipuri is also often used for Manipuri saris. The excellent Manipuri saris are also manufactured in the Manipur state of India.
In the Manipuri dance the Rasa Lila, dances are deeply linked to devotional worship and were earlier performed in the temples. The dances were performed at the Nat Mandapas in the temples of Manipur.
The Manipuri dance as all other Indian classical dance forms has its roots, in deep devotion, and spiritualism. King Bhagaya Chandra was a famous king who ruled Manipur during the period 1759 to 1798 AD. He was deeply involved in culture and religion.
Traditional art
He excelled in prose, poetry, philosophy, dance, drama, and music. The kings and the queens were very much involved, with the traditional art forms, mainly dance and music.
The common masses were not restrained from seeing the performances. Generally, the dance was common to all; there was no barrier for caste or creed.
The dance was not practised merely for entertainment. But it was deeply in Hindu religion and devotion. After the era of King Bhagaya Chandra, the kings in his lineage gave their support and patronised the dance and other art forms.
Even the development of Thalas in Manipuri dance is still identified with the rule and period of individual kings. The male dancers play an equally important role with female dancers.
Large cymbals
The male Manipuri dancers generally carry a different variety and shapes of drums, when they dance. Sometimes while dancing they carry large cymbals (which are called Kartaal).
The male Manipuri dancers generally wear white dhotis and often wear white turbans. It is a distinct feature of the Manipuri male dancers as compared to male dancers of the other Indian classical dances.They hardly wear any ornaments and not even ankle bells. The Manipuri dance form is entirely different from the other classical state dances of India.
The female dancers wear beautiful, specially designed costumes. Long, stiff embroidered skirts are worn by the female dancers, and round stiff bamboo sticks are kept in place to keep the skirts firm and stiff. The costumes are of an extraordinary pattern as distinguished from the other Indian dance costumes.
The movements of the Manipuri dance are smooth and free flowing, though the thandava and Lassiya aspects could be seen in this traditional dance form. Bengali and Manipuri languages are used in the Manipuri dance.
The poetic verses are derived from Jayadeva, Vidyapathy, and Chandidas and other well-known Manipuri poets.
Comparative study
The Manipuri dance is performed individually or by a group of individuals. It also uses the hastas to some extent but not as in other classical Indian dances. A comparative study of the Manipuri with Bharatha Natyam reveals that the Manipuri like the Bharatha Natyam uses thandava and lassiya together.
In Bharatha Natyam Angika Abinaya, (communication of movements through body limbs such as Anga, Upangas, and Prathiangas), Akariya Abhinaya (usage of dresses costumes and make up), Vaachika Abhinaya (interpretation of the songs through words), and Sathvika Abinaya (expresses the emotions through Abhinaya with involvement, or expresses through the inner feeling) are equally used.
But in the Manipuri, Angika Abhinaya and Akaariya Abhinaya are equally used. But there is little scope for Vaachika Abhinaya (interpretation of the songs through words), and there is no scope at all for Saathvika Abhinayas (expresses the emotions through Abhinaya with involvement, or expresses through the inner feelings). Like the Kathak and Kathakali, male dancers play a major role in the Manipuri. Dolki a special drum is carried by the male dancers while dancing.
Female dance
Female dancers allow the hands to flow freely and gracefully, but the usage of hand gestures are limited. Like the Bharatha Natyam, Manipuri is also based on Hinduism, including Sivaism and Vishnavaism. The Manipuri is a unique and graceful dance form as compared to other Indian classical dance forms.

Nelka Shiromala, a women Inspector of Police attached to Kollupitiya Police station will create history by becoming the first Sri Lankan boxing referee to officiate at a Commonwealth Games when the big event commences in Gold Coast, Australia next April. She represented the Police boxing team in 2002 as the first woman Police boxing team member. She is also the first lady Police officer to represent Sri Lanka in boxing at international level.
In 2009 she took up to the refereeing and in 2011 became the first Sri Lankan women referee to officiate at an international event when she was invited to officiate 2011 London Olympic test event where she was awarded with a two star qualification just within six months of international refereeing.
Later she advanced as a 3 star referee and World Series Boxing (WSB) referee affiliated to the world boxing governing body, Association Internationale de Boxe Amateur (AIBA).
She also has the honor of being the first WSB women referee in the South East Asia. She has referred in four World Championships, four Asian Championships, Asian Olympic Qualifying event, six Professional Boxing events, Youth Commonwealth Games and many more international events during the last six years. She won the Best Referee in Asia award for 2017 becoming the first lady referee to win the prestigious award in Asian boxing history.
Her credentials have brought honour to Sri Lanka in the international scene, but sadly not appreciated with due recognition by the local sports fraternity and the Police Department.

Premier outlines plans for Development Finance Bank
The government will re look at some of the regulations in the new Inland Revenue Act, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the induction ceremony of the new president for the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Ruwan Edirisinghe, founder and head of the RN Construction Group.
We will talk with the private sector and fine-tune some of these regulations and brining in amendments if needed, he said.
The premiersaid that today entrepreneurs need access to capital at better terms and he is in talks with the DFCC, NDB, Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank to create a Development Finance Bank.
This will be a separate bank that will assist development and emerging business ventures.
Wickremesinghe said that unfortunately only the apparel and ICT sectors have made major impacts in the global arena representing Sri Lanka and the other industries too should look at emulating these two segments.
We found that there are many issues concerning ease of doing business, which could have been resolved by bureaucrats, but were dealt with politicians instead. A mechanism is needed to remove obstacles and enhance the ease of doing business in Sri Lanka. The worlds future trade is bound to revolve around this region and Sri Lanka must try to exploit this, he said.
The Prime Minister also said that the true potential of the SAARC too is yet to take off and the nationals within the region should look at more inter regional trade. One must remember that there is a fast growing middle class and a huge two billion population.
He said that there are lots of multi talented youth in the region and steps should be also taken to offer them better employment opportunities and education should be focused in that direction.
The new head of SAARC CCI Ruwan Edirisinghe, said that the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industries would be elevated to be one of the top world chambers by 2030. The outgoing President, SAARC CC Suraj Vaidya, said that the region must unite and form a common export processing zone and do regional value addition and re export.
He also said that more visa free travel should be encouraged. Its true that there is terrorism in the region but one must remember that terrorists do not need a visa for their activities.

President, the real target of NCM - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said the real target of the No Confidence Motion (NCM) was the President.
In an interview with ITN, he said this NCM was not against the Prime Minister but a means to come into power through the back door by politically bankrupt forces that have been defeated in elections twice. Though the NCM is against the Prime Minister, the real target is the President.
The President is protected by the UNP and the PM, and those who are against the President know this very well, he explained.
He stressed that the NCM tried to remove that protective layer, bring in a new Prime Minister, they can manipulate, change the Speaker and finally make Mahinda Rajapaksa Prime Minister though the back door.
Thereafter, they will bring in an impeachment motion against the President-that is their true aim, Minister Samaraweera said.
This is what they are attempting to do but this attempt too will be defeated and it will only remain as just another attempt, he added.

The 14th edition of Raigam Tele'es had enough grounds to dazzle a cut above the rest. Professor Sunil Ariyaratne in his five-minute guest speech posed a disturbing question. What have all the award ceremonies achieved for the sake of the entertainment industry That was prolonged - if not subject to embarrassment - by Thumindu Dodantenna more known as Jehan for his performance in much-talked-about Kumbiyo teledrama, as he accepted the award given to the most popular actor.
He went an extra mile of being vociferous by openly challenging a cabinet minister present in the distinguished gathering. This is an upset system, Dondantenna remarked, and bowed to the sitting ovation as he used the anglicised vernacular upset. People have given a sound verdict by choosing me as the most popular actor, Dodantenna went on to say and added that it is a clarion call to have this system changed. Suminda Sirisena, Wijeratne Warakagoda, Indunil Disanayaka and Noeline Honter were four key personalities honoured for their lifetime contribution to the entertainment industry. Close to midnight, the ceremony drew the curtain on a series of stunning performances.

Professionalism vital for law and order
First and foremost, we must understand that our country has undergone tremendous hardships. People were subject to suffering. A large number of valuable lives were lost due to terrorism, insurgency and communal riots in the recent past.
Looking back at history, it is important to examine the root cause. Why did we have to pay with a large number of valuable lives to come out of this situation Where did we go wrong It is the responsibility of the people in power to identify the root cause and make sure that we do not experience this unfortunate situation once more.
The security personnel, who came forward voluntarily to protect the nation, have all the right to discuss this matter with the public. As a part of the security personnel, we believe that human life is the most important aspect of the world. The 1971 insurgency, the 1980 northern terrorism, the 1988-89 southern insurgency shall not re-emerge.
A country that has suffered a brutal war for over two decades shall now realize the importance of Law and Order Ministry as well as Defence Ministry. The ministries should be under professionals with knowledge and experience who could produce results. If you look at a country like Israel, surrounded by the Arab World, it survives purely owing to the professional and dedicated leadership of intelligence and security apparatus.
Political leadership
Having a politically matured and a balanced personality in charge of Law and Order Ministry is not a bad move at this juncture. The incumbent minister is a reliable and experienced politician well positioned to offer leadership to the ministry. The ministers role will be to strengthen the departments under him and with all resources. Plus, the Ministry Secretary is a key figure who should be able to win the confidence of professionals under him. He should be able to offer genuine political leadership. One may wonder, at the same time, how a civilian secretary will fit into guide the police and military.
When you look at the history of this country, you may reflect on why we had to face insurgency and terrorism at a high level. We had to pay a huge penalty by sacrificing valuable lives including leaders and high ranking officials.
How did we lose the grip to protect our leaders and efficient officials Why could not we identify the threat at the correct time and counter the same with an effective security system It is true that we had excellent civil servants in the calibre of G V P Samarasinghe, D B I Siriwardena, Lionel Fernando and W T Jayasinghe. With due respect to all, it is very clear that the commodity of quality state officers are rare today.
On the same line, look at officers like General Sepala Attigala and Cyril Herath. They were highly qualified professionals who held the positions with respect. They won the confidence of the political leadership and the public. We must also realize that they were all civilians before they joined the specialized units. They underwent training, became professional officers, earned reputation and rendered yeoman service to the country.
A country that suffered for 30 long years under brutal terrorism should not drop the guard at any stage. We have to maintain a high standard of intelligence, policing, defence, protection of territory and stable economy in order to take our country to the next level.
Eradicating terrorism
The biggest achievement in our time is eradicating terrorism. Yet since it was a human problem, we have to reach the next stage. That is strengthening the life of people who suffered for over three decades. If you do not realize the importance of this situation and have real professionals to handle the present situation, you have to remember the historical evidence: at the end of a conflict, it will lead to another. We must realize the same and take a harder look. To earn peace, we had to pay a huge price for sacrificing young lives and we should not face a similar situation again.
Police, armed services, military, intelligence units have done their part. People have sacrificed a lot and suffered enough. They should feel they have a future and their children have a future.
It is worth to turn back and see, after sacrificing so much. It is up to the political leaders to map out the revival strategy and the plan to take our country to the next level. Having said that, what has happened after the war The politicians should stop and look over the shoulder and see where they have gone. Have they done their part to the country It is up to the political leaders to strengthen the economy of this country, which should be the top priority. With the eradication of terrorism, the path has been cleared to implement the national development plan. They can learn from the forces who achieved the challenge of terrorism by having effective goal-oriented officers to produce results and got the better of the most brutal terrorist organisation in the world. It was purely owing to the commitment, vision, strategy and the determination and the leadership displayed at ground level. This proved that you should have correct people to the correct slot and you cannot be sentimental.
If you miss this opportunity, by not having professionals to launch the future productive plan for the country, the future generation is going to suffer. By the time the professionals who rendered a yeoman service to the country is gone, it will be a new start for the younger generation. When the Constitution was changed, they accommodated the option of having a national list to the Parliament. It is purely in the interest of the country and not in the interest of the party or to get personal friends accommodated.
National security
They must realize that the professionals should be roped into the political leadership chain. I strongly believe that police and defence officials, who have sacrificed a lot, earned high reputation and won the confidence of the people, should get an opportunity to enter the Parliament from the national list and contribute to the national security. The national security is the topmost priority. There are no shortcuts. The basics have to be implemented with the help of experienced and knowledgeable professionals. The Law and Order Ministry is not the place for a novice. The countrys future and progress depend on the security and safety of the people who will contribute to a stable economy.
We must realize that we are going through a transitional period after a long-drawn war. It is the professionals who should guide the government at this juncture to cross this difficult path. See the number of crimes reported for a day and the brutal manner in which they are engaged in. This clearly shows the mentality of the criminals. It needs immediate remedial action and strategy to arrest this situation.
Countries like Malaysia have gone through similar changes in the past. It is not a bad idea for us to do a study and see whether we could implement a similar strategy to overcome this grave situation.

A rebel with a cause
The land bordering Maduru Oya was Bintenne where people living during the time of British occupation of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815, desired to remain independent from the foreign rule. This was so even at the time of their own rulers while they remained loyal to them.
Among the leaders of this region official positions like Rate Rala, Muhandiram, Adikaram, Archcchila and Korala were given to the members of the leading Sinhala families. Then the supply of salt and dry fish was the service rendered by the Muslim traders who were under the control of the Sinhala Muhndirams. It was the families of Butave Rala, Kohukumbure Rala of Wellassa who officiated the regular supply of salt and dry fish to the royal palace in Kandy.
Hill country
Muslims who were living in Wellassa served the kings of Kandy under their own Madige Ralas in performing their services - Rajakariya to the Sinhala kings. When the victorious British armies marched through Wellassa, Muslims helped them in transporting their goods to the hill country.
During the British occupation in Kandy, their soldiers looted and raped women of the Sinhala nobility which created a series of dissatisfaction among the people. It was no wonder the uprising against the British triggered off three years after the British occupation when the appointment of Hajji Muththu became the main issue for the Ova Rebellion of 1818.
The leadership of the rebellion was given to Kohukumbure Rala and Bhutave Rala. The news spread in the area of the presence of Doraisamy, a cousin of the deposed King Sri Wickrama Rajasinha, raised hopes among the people of installing a ruler in place of the British rule.
A battalion was sent by the British to support Hajji Muhandiram who acted on the information of the rebels set out in search of the rebels to Kehelulla and from there to Pinnawella. It was then, Bhutawe Rala armed with clubs and other weapons surrounded Hajji and his party in a surprise raid.
The Sinhala leaders of Bintenne, Wellassa and Uva and also Bhikkhus began to gather and discuss the rebellion. Within a month their numbers increased. Before long arms and ammunition and also food were collected to resist against the British. There was a widespread of resentment among the people which was noticed by the British authorities.
Hajji Muhandiram was sent by the British authorities along with soldiers to capture the rebels and they went in search of them from place to place when hearing about the movements of the rebels. Hajji Muhandiram finally went to Pinnawella.
The rebels came out from their hideouts, surrounded Hajji Muhandiram and tied him and then took him to Kokkagala as a prisoner.

On hearing Hajjis capture the British authorities sent Wilson with armed soldiers. Wilson was surrounded and was wounded and so was one of the Lascarins. The others escaped. Wilsons head was severed from his body and was taken to Kehehulla and from there to Kokkagala.
Governor Brownrigg was on his way from Trincomalee when he heard the news of Wilson, how he was rounded by the rebels and was beheaded and he sent Keppetipola Disava who was loyal to the British to quell the rebellion.
Disava first went to Badulla and then arrived at Alupotha where he met Kohukumbure Rala who addressed the Disava. By losing our freedom we have become slaves under the British, our religion and customs are threatened by the acts of the British. People are united and they are with us. We have now a ruler of our own to lead the battle against the British. If you dont join us we have to take your head to our new ruler.
One day a Muslim soldier came to meet Kohukumbure Rala and told him if the newly appointed king could grant him rewards and position in the army he would join the rebels. So Kohukumbure Rala promised to grant him his requests and the soldier promising to come again left Wellassa.
Treated to meals
After a few days time, some soldiers who had deserted the British army left Badulla and headed towards Wellassa. Kohukumbure Rala who is now Rate Mahaththaya received them and they were treated with meals.
While they were enjoying their meals by taking their seats on either side of Kohukumbure Rala the leader of the Muslim group Annan began to cough.
Immediately they took out their weapons that were concealed under their dresses began to attack them and killed them except Kohukumbure Rala who was taken alive to Kotabava where the British soldiers were stationed. In this manner the leader of 1818 rebellion, Kohukumbure Rala was captured and with him, one of the Sinhala leaders was lost.
It weakened the resistance of the Sinhala people who raised the rebellion in 1818 with the support of the villagers of Kokkagala, Kehelulla, Kohukumbura, Alupotha and the veddhas of Bintanne.

Respect shall be earned, not given!
The Colombo Zonal Education Office has issued a letter instructing the school principals to invite MPs and Provincial Councillors to important school functions and to treat them with due respect. The Zonal Education Director is instructing the principals that it is the duty of any government official to respect politicians.
This letter is an insult to government servants.
That should not be the case.
Now the principals are instructed to invite politicians to attend school functions and treat them respectfully. This move only encourages, and motivates the politicians to interfere with school administration. They will try to control principal and staff. This will cause the quality of education to drop.
If a politician wants to approach the principal, there is an accepted protocol.
They have to consult the relevant director and then meet the principal. If all the politicians begin approaching the principal straight away, there will be confusion.
This letter aptly raises the question of the dignity and esteem of the state officials.
There is harassment already happening to teachers and principals on the part of certain politicians. The letter issued by the Colombo Zonal Education Office, no doubt, will make things worse paving the way for unwarranted political influence and interferences.

SB mum on SLFPs stance on NCM
As the numbers game intensifies in the wake of the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, SLFP Treasurer and Minister S.B.Dissanayake yesterday said there was no reason for the SLFP to oppose the NCM.
He however refused to affirm whether they would vote in favour of it.
The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has to make that decision collectively. We have not taken a collective decision on it yet- but it is difficult for us to oppose this,Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters on Darley Road yesterday. Dissanayake said however that the contents of the NCM were not in opposition to what they as a party believed in. We have brought up the very same issues they now speak of. When the Bond Issue occurred, it was UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera who lodged the first complaint at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Minister Dissanayake said. A group of SLFPers including Thilanga Sumathpala and Nimal Siripala de Silva staged a protest outside the Central Bank against the issue. In addition, it was we who took it to COPE and asked that it be investigated. Our Members took great efforts within COPE to bring the crime to light, he said.
It was also the SLFP after a special Central Committee meeting that appointed a committee with Nimal Siripala De Silva to study the issue and they recommended that the President appoint a Presidential Commission to investigate into this, Minister Dissanayake said.
We also have to admit that in the last three years, we failed to develop the economy.We could not turn it around and as a result we faced many economic difficulties. We spoke of this with the Prime Minister and within the government on many occasions, he added. Minister Dissanayake noted further that at the last Local Government elections, the people had given them a clear message-it was to remind the government and the two major parties that drastic changes needed to be made.
Thereafter, we know that the President and a large group within the UNP tried to bring in certain changes in a democratic manner, having had discussions within the government and within parties but those did not bear fruit,Minister Dissanayake added.
We do not want to topple the government, he explained and added that they were hoping that the NCM would pave way for changes that the people and the two main parties want in this country, he said.
This new change he hinted would be in the form of a more comprehensive national government under a new Prime Minister, he said.
Dissanayake however added that they would still invite the current parties who helped set up the government to form the new government with them.
We look at this NCM as something not against the President or Government but against one,he said.
The NCM is written against the person who is most responsible towards the Central Bond issue.
At present, four SLFPers have already placed their signatures on the NCM.
The SLFP Treasurer was also quick to deflect any blame that might come the Presidents way through the NCM and stated that the President had always acted very democratically within government and allowed the Prime Minister along with the UNP a free reign within government.
The President could not even bring about the Cabinet reshuffle he wanted or make changes within the Finance Ministry, Dissanayake said.
The NCM will be taken up for debate on April 4 and Parliament can vote on whether they would go for a secret ballot or not.
It is only on two occasions that a secret ballot is held; when appointing the Speaker and when impeaching the President but if the majority wants, they can also ask that this be made a secret ballot, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said at the briefing.
We have until April 4 morning to make a final decision on the vote, quipped Dissanayake.

The Senanayake seal
Monument of D S Senanayake is far finer and rarer than stone or marble Donald Kennedy
Men are known by the monuments they leave, the roots from which they come and the quality of their personalities. The monument Mr Senanayake has left is not of stone or marble. It is far finer and rarer than that. He was the architect of Ceylons independence and its first guiding hand. He has left a free, independent people who may now enjoy their freedom of thought, speech and right of worship in their own way: Donald Kennedy --US State Department: President of Stanford University; Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during the Carter Administration.
DS realised that the future prosperity of Sri Lanka depended on the growth of nations agriculture. He was anxious that national reputation could not be maintained if food supply was to depend on foreign resources. Authoring Agriculture and Patriotism the first book on his pet subject as Minister of Agriculture in the State Council, he wrote, It is almost as if that sense of inferiority that is sometimes seen to overwhelm a Ceylonese to the presence of his European brother has also attached itself to the native products. Rice and other grains, eggs, onions, chillies and ginger are humble, though useful, commodities. Fruit has a status only a trifle higher than these. To be engaged in their production is something to be ashamed of.
One of his greatest achievements under the rebuilding of ancient irrigation schemes and reclaiming of the dry zone, is the system he initiated in and around Polonnaruwa. The main requirement in this task was the renovation of the Parakrama Samudraya.
Senanayake was a practical man of high calibre a visionary he was glad to share his thoughts and opinions with anyone who had something useful to offer his priorities are valid even today as they were in 1930s and 40s.
Senanayake understood that the decline in food production was due to the fact that this form of agriculture was un-loved by the educated and the well-to-do in the society. The irrigation schemes in ancient Ceylon, the earliest recorded from about 300 BC, during King Pandukabhayas reign and under continuous expansion for the next millennium, were some of the most intricate systems of the world.
In addition to building underground inland waterways, they were among the foremost to build totally artificial tanks to accumulate water.
The system was widely restored and further extended during Parakramabahus reign (11531186), followed by D. S. Senanayake [1931-1952]. One of DSs greatest achievements under the rebuilding of ancient irrigation schemes and reclaiming of the dry zone, is the scheme he initiated in and around Polonnaruwa. The main requirement in this task was the renovation of the Parakrama Samudraya.
Another measurement of DSSs Economic wisdom was the encouragement of animal husbandry as part of agriculture reforms. He educated the peasantry in the methods of housing, feeding and breeding in live-stock farms.
He also introduced protective procedures for animal husbandry and agriculture produce, by doing away with the egg imports. Senanayake finished his first term laying sound foundation for a rural economy by building irrigation facilities and led the stride towards self-sufficiency in rice. The rice production had been placed on the delicate shoulders of the debt-ridden peasant who did not own land.
It is a remarkable fact that we in Ceylon, while repeating in season and out, that ours is an agricultural country and that her prosperity is inextricably bound up with her agricultural progress, should yet be apparently content to pay a bill in a year of depression (1933) of nearly 87 million rupees for the imports of our food and drink. - D. S. Senanayake
Hands-on wisdom
The commercial products or plantation crops commanded credit from the banks and brokers and more profitable and of course more respectable.
Senanayake acknowledged the significance of nutrition in a food production policy. His book contains chapters on irrigation, land policy colonization, rural indebtedness and agricultural labour.
The wisdom of the late DS Senanayakes agricultural policy needs concerted attention at a time when the country is facing a rice crisis. Attention to administrative efficiency was primary among his economic and political wisdom.
DSs hands-on realistic wisdom, too helped a lot in carrying out the programmes. Realism was another measurement of his Pragmatism.
His recommendations should have been carried out rigorously and carefully by those who followed him to leadership, if so, the village economy today would be in a much better condition.
If DS disagreed with someones idea, he would put across it with an introduction like I would mean, As a matter of fact or Actually, and never pushing his way up in an oppositional face. If unconvinced, in the nicest likely way, that they should now withdraw, think again and come back.
Ours is an agricultural country and our prosperity is inextricably bound up with her agricultural progress--DSS
Racial issues, cultural sloppiness, religious hostility and language enmity have made any real progress in a developing country; is it possible under a so-called democratic system of government
It is not the system, but success depends finally on bold and clear-sighted leadership who can follow a direct course without much politicking in development without above attachments.
Independence from British
Sir Ivor Jennings, former Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya University, writing on Senanayake and Independence, says, that most of the agitation for independence by others have been on the wrong lines.
The British getting the fullest support for the war effort from the State Council headed by Senanayake, Dominion status was promised soon after the war. Not breaking the word, there came to be appointed a Commission under Viscount Soulbury. Soulbury Constitution it was called, but the fact is that it was produced by Mr Senanayake- Jennings
Sir John Kotelawala, his nephew and loyal subordinate says No other man had so many political enemies. But few others lived to make those same enemies come round to at least to grudging admiration.
Ours is an agricultural country: her prosperity inextricably bound up with agricultural progress

Sinhalese,Tamils and Muslims have always lived in harmony - Chief Incumbents of Malwathu and Asgiriya Chapters
It was not moral to highlight the recent unrest at several places in Kandy as racial conflicts since the Sinhalese,Tamils and Muslims in Sri Lanka have always lived in harmony, said the Chief Incumbents of the Malwathu and Asgiriya Chapters.
The Venerable Theras made these observations when the European Ambassador Tun-Lai-Margue, Swiss Ambassador Heinz Walter Nederkoorn and Romanian Ambassador Victor Chiudea called on Theras at the two temples in Kandy on March 27, to learn their stance on the recent incidents in Kandy.
The Venerable Theras told them that there are a minimal number of extremists in any religion in any country. The Theras also asserted Sri Lanka is no exception.
The Theras also said that the Buddhist monks had given protection to the Muslims in temples as well and this would not have happened had it been a religion based conflict.
The Theras refuted the allegation by these European Union representatives that the Sinhalese Buddhists had assaulted Muslims. The Theras emphatically stated that it was not justifiable to highlight a single incident to be an attack by the Sinhalese on the Muslims. Tung-Lai-Margue stated that they regret the damage caused to the properties of Muslims and it was important to prevent a recurrence of such incidents. He also said that Buddhism is based on Ahimsa. He also said that if the followers of Buddhism cause hurt to others, this behaviour is not consistent with the same religion.
Malwatte Mahanayake Thera Most Ven.Thibotuwawe Sri Siddartha Sumangala Thera said that Islamic extremists engage in terrorist activities even in European countries and on such occasions it was not fair to claim that all Muslims are involved in such violent activities.
The Mahanayake Thera also said likewise the incidents that took place in Kandy is not approved by the majority of the Sinhala Buddhists.
To prevent a repetition of such incidents, these matters have to be discussed in detail, Ven Thibotuwawe Sri Siddartha Sumangala Thera said. Secretary of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven.Medagama Dammananda Thera said that there is a small group within the Muslim community that attempt to build up a separate identity and they make various statements to disrepute not only the Buddhist monks but also the Lord Buddha.
Ven.Dammananda Thera stated that almost all the issues are analysed from a political point of view and some attempt to analyze this issue with the same yardstick.
The Thera also pointed out that most of the mosques and the business areas have been constructed in the lands of the Asgiriya and Mallwatta temples.
Anunayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven.Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Thera, Chief Incumbent of the Rangiri Dambulu Raja Maha Viharaya Ven Naranpanawe Ananda Thera also participated the occasion.

SL-Bdesh trade increases by 17% to US$ 166 mn
Sri Lanka has called for stronger maritime and air links with Bangladesh to boost booming bilateral trade as well as FDIs. Meanwhile, trade between both countries has shown a steady surge not only in the last five years but even on YoY basis in 2017.
Ports of Colombo and Hambantota are vital for Sri Lankas economy and the Port of Chittagong is of great importance to the economy of Bangladesh. Strong linkages and connectivity between the Ports of Chittagong, Colombo and Hambantota would facilitate shipping, tourism and investments between the two countries.
In addition, more frequent direct air links between Colombo and Dhaka too shall strengthen economic cooperation, investment promotion, tourism and people-to-people contacts. Expansion of air-links would bring more opportunities to entrepreneurs and investors of the two countries too said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen. Minister Bathiudeen added: In the past few years bilateral cooperation between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh has been strengthened by friendly visits of high level official delegations. And such efforts have grown and expanded to encompass defence, education, sports, culture, investment and trade. For example, Sri Lankas bilateral trade with Bangladesh has been on a growing trend. In the five year period of 2013 to 2017, total trade increased by 55% to US$ 166 million.
Even last years Lanka-Bangladesh total trade has increased by 17% to US$ 166 million in comparison to 2016s US$ 142 million.
In 2017, Apparels, plastics, and petroleum products were Sri Lankas leading exports to Bangladesh which totalled $ 122.39 million while imports totalled US$44 mn (pharmaceuticals, machinery parts, potatoes, jute yarn, non-alloy steel, electric accumulators, and food preparations were the main imports). Lankan exports to Bangladesh increased by 9% to $122 million in 2017 compared to 2016s US$ 112 million while imports from Bangladesh increased to US$39 million last year from 2016s US$ 29 million.
Over the five year period from 2013 to 2017 Lankan exports to Bangladesh increased by 48% while imports to Colombo in the corresponding period increased by 56%.
Bangladesh is Sri Lankas 19th exports destination while from Bangladeshi side, Sri Lanka is their 53rd exports destination.
As neighbouring members of the Bay of Bengal region, both countries have many commonalities. Our common cultural affinities and historical links have immensely nourished our modern day inter-state relations added Minister Bathiudeen.
Among the multilateral and regional fora where Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have been cooperating with each other are the UN, SAARC, BIMSTEC, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA).

Special programmes to suppress underworld
The government has implemented special programmes to suppress the underworld,the Department of Government Information said in a release yesterday.
They asked that the public not get carried away with reports that there was a breakdown of law and order in the country due to actions of a few individuals connected to the underworld.
Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have paid special attention to this, and a special committee appointed on it has instructed the police on action that needs to be taken to arrest the situation in the underworld, they added further.
One of the recommendations implemented was to strengthen the Police Intelligence Unit further to gather information on the underworld better.
Accordingly, special Police teams consisting of members from the Organized Crime Division and Special Task Force have been deployed to monitor areas such as Colombo and surrounding areas which have high rates of crime.
Enforcement teams have also been established in all 10 divisions in the Western Province and officers in civil as well as in uniform will be operating in these areas. They have been allowed to set up instant police checkpoints to conduct investigations.
Through these operations, the Police in the past few days were able to arrest several major underworld criminals along with their weapons. Police Intelligence is also investigating into information that a Sri Lankan national attached to the underworld is running criminal activities in the country from abroad and the police is to take action in the near future to arrest these individuals abroad with the assistance of Interpol.
The government has also taken measures to control the illegal drug trade in the country and a Special Drugs and Organised Crime Division has been set up to prosecute these individuals.

Sponsors put Australian cricket on notice
SYDNEY, Tuesday: Australias major cricket sponsors, including Qantas Airways, breakfast cereal maker Sanitarium and brewer Lion, said on Monday they were assessing their relationship with the countrys favourite pastime as the fallout from a ball-tampering scandal escalates.
The incident, which Australian captain Steve Smith said involved senior players hatching a plan to tamper with the ball during a game against rival South Africa, also threatens to upset current negotiations over broadcast rights.
Weetbix-maker Sanitarium, which counts Smith as a brand ambassador, said it was reviewing its sponsorship pending the outcome of an investigation by governing body Cricket Australia.
Certainly its under review as the actions taken by the team in South Africa dont align with our own values  Sanitarium does not condone cheating in sport, Sanitarium said in a statement.
The sentiment was mirrored by almost all of the sports commercial partners in Australia, including Qantas, apparel sponsor ASICS, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, insurer Bupa, Specsavers, Toyota, and brewer Lion, which owns beer sponsor XXXX.
Like the rest of Australia, were deeply concerned, a Lion spokesman said in a statement. This is not what youd expect from anyone in sport at any level.
Singapore Telecommunications Optus, which is a commercial partner and broadcasts cricket on its mobile network, said it would not comment on the incident as it was a matter for Cricket Australia.
The camera vision of Australian player Cameron Bancroft hiding a piece of yellow tape that was used to try and rough up the ball to benefit the bowler has stunned a sports-loving nation where back-yard and beach cricket are a national hobby. Roughing up one side of a ball can help it to swing through the air, making it more difficult for the batsman to hit.
Cricket Australia said in a statement it would present the findings of its inquiry on Wednesday.
Cricket Australia earned A$338.4 million ($261 million) in media, sponsorship and spectator fees in the financial year ended June 30, 2017, according to its most recent annual report. The value of its individual sponsorships are not disclosed.
Long-term cricket broadcaster Nine Entertainment declined to comment on Monday. - Agencies

Step into a scene, and let it drip
Sri Lankas book market does not offer much enthusiasm or encouragement to a budding writer as compared to that of a western country. Although publishers would flourish thanks to the sale of textbooks, translations and a host of novels, they have become the lamenting crowd with hardly anything up for sale.
That is why there are more author publishers than professional publishers in Sri Lanka. Most authors are destined with the danger of having their work rejected. The publishers of course are not to be blamed, as they too have to earn their bread and butter. And the author publications are mostly launched as a result of enthusiasm. Only a handful could claim a sizeable profit from the author publications.
Gunaratne Ekanayake belongs to that handful team, which is almost non-existent.
Sudu saha Kalu, which was launched recently, is Ekanayakes 75th book. Dealing with the White rule in Ceylon, Gunaratne Ekanayake uses his creativity to elaborate how the good old Ceylonese traditional village was capsized owing to the political and social changes caused by the colonial rule. The charming village traditions were demolished with the new highways built across the paddy fields.
Ekanayaka writes at a rate, anyone can comfortably state that. And he has a reason. His books sell well. Some of the books have even gone to 10 prints with 1000 copies each.
I am focusing on teenage novels, because the teenagers of this country are looking for material to read. Most novels published today contain more adult material than teenage-interest situations, Ekanayake observed.
Writing to the teenagers is the secret behind Ekanayakes bestsellers.
I am content. I am living by the income generated from my books. If someone thinks no one can live by books in Sri Lanka, I would cite myself as an example to oppose that theory. Books like Madol Duwa are sold because they are prescribed for examinations. I have earned a place in the market though none of my books is prescribed for examinations, Ekanayake noted.
Ekanayakes muse is simply a walk in the street. Or traveling by bus on the other hand. Once the muse settles in his mind, Ekanayake lets it brew in his head. The thoughts and the muse grow in his mind until he gets a chance to put the thoughts on a piece of paper.
Usually I write about four half sheet pages. That amounts to 60 pages in a month. That could be considered a novel on average. There is a lot of editing happening while I write. But once I am done, I will never rewrite it. I send it directly to typesetting. I may add or omit certain things while proof-reading. When I wrote Hutapata Veediya, I did not just write. I let it grow inside me. I was thinking about my own youth and was remembering all what happened by then. After it got implanted thoroughly only I began writing, Ekanayake explained.
That too does not happen all the time.
It will be wrong if I claim that I am always on the writers mood. No, I too face the writers block. There are times when I do not feel like writing a single word. Then I do not struggle to write. For instance, I am just idling around these days, Ekanayake said.
A novel has to be written when you are in the right mood, believes Ekanayake. Otherwise, you cannot produce a fine-quality novel. The writers have to read a lot. But Gunaratne Ekanayake does not have enough time to read.
The problem we have today is that we have a large number of books being published. The number of books is much larger than it used to be in the past. But the reader cannot be on the equal grounds. They are not in a stable financial situation to buy books. We have to make this journey slowly, Ekanayake said.
Slow and steady wins the race, of course. - SM

Stop re-introduction of Glyphosate to agriculture - GMOA
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) expects to meet the President as soon as possible and have a discussion on `Glyphosate', GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said. Addressing media in Colombo yesterday he said that Glyphosate should not be allowed once again on any grounds because Sri Lankan tea will lose the International market if containing poison in Ceylon tea. Therefore, Glyphosate should not be used for tea cultivation. Media reports revealed that the Plantation Industries Minister is pushing towards the re-introduction of Glyphosate to Sri Lankan agriculture.
Tea should be cultivated using the same methods that used before Glyphosate and other poisonous chemicals arrived in Sri Lanka, Dr. Aluthge said. More attention should be paid for the polluting water resources due to the use of Glyphosate in tea estates. More and more Sri Lankan people, especially children suffer from cancer and other deadly diseases due to the consumption of food containing poisonous chemicals. Therefore, the use of poisonous chemicals should be completely stopped, Dr. Aluthge added.

Reconciliation plans and strategies should be strengthened and implemented efficiently, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a meeting with Government Agents at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) yesterday.
This country belongs to each and every race and religion and we all should respect eachother giving pride of place to peace and harmony, the Prime Minister said.
We should do our best to prevent communal unrest like what happened in Kandy and strengthen social harmony. This task mainly falls on the Police, Home Affairs Ministry and the Education Ministry,the Premier said.
The recent unrest at Theldiniya proved very costly to the tourism industry.Tourists from Middle Eastern countries were compelled to reschedule their holidays here, the Premier pointed out. The Prime Minister further said the countrys economy is stable at present and now the focus should be shifted to creating employment and encouraging foreign investment.
Around 90% of families in Kilinochi have been resettled. Construction activities are taking place to resettle 3,000 families in Jaffna and 13,000 families in Mullativu respectively, stated representative of the District Secretaries when inquired about the resettlement programme in the Northern Province.
Home Affairs minister Vajira Abeywardena was present along with the District Secretaries of each district.

thickened with emotion
In 1995, the UNESCO introduced 14 short narratives as a collection for young readers. The countries included Afghanistan, Burma (now Myanmar), India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand. That marked the commencement of a new series of readers selected under the broad programme by the Asian co-publication project carried out in collaboration with the UNESCO by the Asian Cultural Centre for UNESCO/Tokyo Book Development Centre.
It is recorded that these narratives have been selected with the editorial help of the publishers of five countries with a central editorial board in consultation with the UNESCO member states in Asia, where Sri Lanka is included as well. On reading the 14 narratives, a reader may feel that they are meant to express chiefly the sensitive and complex sparkling experiences in the particular countries with reference to the cultural impact on juvenile behaviour patterns.
Cultural standpoint
As such, though thematically different, the central impact on the readers mind becomes an identity of that particular cultural standpoint. This enables the reader to feel the unity in diversity as regards the human existence. Varying types of experiences and varying types of structures are seen.
The first story that comes from Afghanistan titled as The Hawk and the Tree revolves around the life of a cobbler and his pet bird, hawk. This intends to give the impression that though the bird of the type known as a hawk is a hunter bird is nevertheless innocent when it is observed closely. The behaviour patterns of the cobbler are seen from the point of view of a young man who comes to know that the hawk undergoes gradually the pangs of death as its leg is tied to a string where it gets entangles to a branch of a tree.
The hawk undergoes a gradual death due to suffering in the entanglement. The central point that the writer intends to drive in is much more serious than the mere outer story layer. The cobbler who used to feed the hawk is known by the term Sparrow Hawk. The cobbler gradually comes to know that his constant companion, the hawk is trapped and undergoes a tragic death, despite his feeding nature.
The story comes to a close with the following lines:
I caught sight of the hawk hanging from another branch.
Why has he returned I asked myself.
But then I saw there was a second string on its foot, a string that stretched all the way to the cobblers shop. And this string was made of live sparrows.
There is food for thought beside the narrative line.
Beautiful thief
The second story comes from Myanmar. The Beautiful, Beautiful Heron is just the opposite type where a very young boy attracted by a heron, tries to own it by means of a theft. But he is struck by self-delusion and perhaps undergoes mental worry. As such, he refrains from being a thief. He is constantly reminded of a counterpart of a Robin Hood and gives up the intention.
One of the most notable and resourceful creations come from Iran titled as The Poet and the Sun written by Cyrus Tahbah. The work is an admixture of prose and poetry resembling some of the prose poems of Rabindranath Tagore in Gitanjali. The intention of the original writer is to depict the inner nature of a young boy, who so likes the various ways that he wants to come closer to the sun, in order to touch and feel it. But gradually as he ascends a mountain and comes closer to the sky, he comes to know that the sun is far away. The storyteller movingly makes the reader feel the pulse of the youngster in words:
The boy liked the sun. He liked the sun most of all. He could see, hear and sing in the sun.
The boy liked the birds. He liked their awakening songs. He liked to watch them fly and the colour of their wings in the sun.
As the boy wants to know more about the sun, the creator of the narrative envelopes various poetic visions that cover the developing process. In the end, he recalls a poem rendered by his father, in which he perceives the not merely the information but the knowledge he desired so much. The connecting poetic vision goes as follows:
Down by the river, an old turtle roams about, sunny is the day.
The old turtle lies in the warmth of the sun, sleeps peacefully by the river.
Down by the river, I am alone.
In the pain of desire,
I am looking forward to meeting my sun. Not even for one moment, do my eyes capture it. My sun has turned its face away from me in the faraway water.
If interpreted carefully, the narrative rests on two layers: fantasy and reality.
Sybil Wettasinghe
This form of narratives is cleverly perceived by our own childrens story writer and illustrator, Sybil Wettasinghe. Her short narrative, as I understand, is not only a story written for children but also for adults. The story in the collection is titled as A Lantern as Big as a Home. The narrative revolves around two characters, the granny and her grandson. As the Vesak dawns, the children in Sri Lanka are drawn to illuminate their houses with lanterns, using bamboo sticks and tissue paper. Granny loves her grandson who is denoted by the term Patiya. He comes to know through her association and loving kindness the various meanings adduced to faith and devotion. Both of them utilise time and energy in lighting up the house in the best way of making a Vesak lantern.
Surprisingly enough, however, the lantern is made in a massive manner with the grandest glory of creation; the old granny is seen inside the lantern. She manages to come out. Their effort is fulfilled as people come to see it. But the story rests on other layers as well. Granny is made to recall her days spent which culminates in her ways of imparting the same to Patiya.
She tells him:
If by renouncing some little pleasure a wise man can derive greater pleasure, let him renounce his little pleasure for the greater one.
The storyteller, Sybil, mentions that Patiya did not quite understand but he knew that granny was happy, filled with joy, beyond his understanding.
All in all, these 14 stories that come from 14 Asian countries could be reckoned as one of the best gifts for the settlement of social conflicts that rise up day by day.

Around 30 percent of dengue patients in Sri Lanka are children and it is a must to carry out a blood test on the third day of fever, Dengue Control Unit Director Dr. Hasitha Tissera said.
He was addressing the launching ceremony of the DengueFreeChild app, which was held at the BMICH, yesterday.
According to Dr. Tissera, about 80 percent of dengue patients do not show any symptoms during the initial stages and significant numbers of them die due to complications. People do not develop immunity against dengue because there are four different strains of the virus.
The National Dengue Control Programme would be carried out at 50 high-risk areas in 15 districts, from April 3 to 9. Teams of health officers and armed forces would visit houses and private and state institutions, especially schools, to locate mosquito breeding grounds, he said.

The arrest of fugitive former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga has been confirmed by highly placed government sources as reported exclusively in yesterdays Daily News.
Weeratunga has been arrested in the United Arab Emirates, following an Interpol Red Notice secured by the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) in connection with the alleged 2006 MiG Deal.
Following a combined operation by signals intelligence units in Sri Lanka and Abu Dhabi, Weeratunga was traced to a safe house last Saturday, approximately 80 kilometres from Dubai, where the former diplomat was residing before going into hiding last month following the Interpol Red Notice issued against him.
Officers of the Dubai CID acting on the intelligence received visited the location where they found Weeratunga operating a residence and placed him under arrest.
The Interpol Red Notice that led to the arrest was secured by the FCID on the strength of a warrant issued by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, under which Weeratunga is wanted for charges including money laundering, criminal misappropriation of public property, cheating and forgery for the purpose of cheating.
According to government officials with direct knowledge of these events, discussions are underway at the highest levels to determine the appropriate means through which to secure Weeratungas lawful return to Sri Lanka, so that he may answer the charges against him in a fair and impartial judicial proceeding.

US, allies expel Russian envoys over spy attack
FRANCE: The United States and its European allies on Monday expelled scores of Russian diplomats in a coordinated action against Moscow which they accuse of poisoning an ex-spy in Britain.
The United States expelled 60 alleged spies posted around the country and at the Russian mission to the United Nations.
It also closed the Russian consulate in Seattle over alleged spying at the nearby Kitsap submarine base and Boeing.
The retaliation against Moscow was taken in response to Russia's use of a military-grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.
Canada ousted four diplomats, calling the nerve agent attack a despicable, heinous and reckless act. Australia followed suit with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull saying two Russian diplomats had seven days to leave.
Sixteen EU states have joined Britain in expelling Russian diplomats following a European Council decision last week to react to Moscow within a common framework.
Additional measures including further expulsions are not to be excluded in the coming days and weeks, EU President Donald Tusk said. Britain itself has already kicked out 23 Russian diplomats, with Moscow retaliating with a tit-for-tat move.
Croatia: One diplomat Czech Republic: Three diplomats Denmark: Two diplomats Estonia: One diplomat France: Four diplomats Finland: One diplomat Germany: Four diplomats Hungary: One diplomat Italy: Two diplomats Latvia: One diplomat Lithuania: Three diplomats Netherlands: Two diplomats Norway: One diplomat Poland: Four diplomats Romania: One diplomat Spain: Two diplomats Sweden: One diplomat
Two diplomats Macedonia: One diplomat Norway: One diplomat Ukraine: 13 diplomats President Petro Poroshenko called for even more action to be taken.
The next step is to increase the price that Moscow has to pay for its international crimes, including the strengthening of personal, financial and economic sanctions, he said. Meanwhile, true to President Donald Trump's embrace of superlatives, that was the largest single expulsion of Russians or Soviet intelligence officers on record, according to one senior official.
Trump also ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle -- within snooping distance of a US submarine base and a plant run by aircraft-maker Boeing, one of the president's favored companies.
Trump's aides, aware that Americans think he and Putin are too cozy, stressed the expulsions were the President's decision. It seemed like, as with US Presidents past, the scales may be falling from Trump's eyes when it comes to the former KGB officer who now runs Russia. - AFP

Vaishnavee brings divine love
Vaishnavee a cinema that will be released in the circuits soon is the latest creation by Sumitra Peries, the first Sri Lankan female filmmaker.
This cinema is based on magical realism and is crafted using the attributes of myth and folklore.
The story is by Dr Lester James Peries. Scripted by late Tony Ranasinghe, Vaishnavee revolves around a puppeteer named as Osanda who falls in love with a wooden statue carved by him of a beautiful woman that comes to life in his mythical dream world.
Shooting of Vaishnavee indeed was a challenging experience for me as a director. Lester feels this is the best film I have done hitherto and that comes as an endorsement of the creativity and technical supremacy of this cinema, says Sumitra Peries.
While Yashoda Wimaladharma plays the lead role, Thumindu Dodantenna, Vasanthi Chathurani, Jayalath Manorathne, Veena Jayakodi, Rohana Baddage, Mahendra Perera and Iranganie Serasinghe comprise the rest of the cast.
Vaishnavee made Sumitra the first director ever to shoot with the latest Red Epic camera with a set of new zeiss lenses on 4K and this step has laid the foundation for the next generation Digital Cinema of Sri Lanka.
The camera of Vaishnavee has been handled by the veteran cinematographer Donald Karunarathne. Known to all as the Poetess of Sinhala Cinema, Sumitra showed her mettle with films such as Gehenu Lamai, Ganga Addara, Yahalu Yeheli, Sagara Jalaya, Loku Duwa, Duwata Mawaka Misa, Maya, Sakman Maluwa let alone a set of short films.
Her debut cinema Gehenu Lamai featured young Vasanthi Chathurani in the lead role with Vijaya Kumarathunga and Sanath Gunatilleke.
Her cinematic creations across the board had the feminine touch in abundance and were highly commended by cinema lovers, scholars and critics locally and internationally.
The technical know-how on cinema Sumitra had mastered from her budding young age had taken her to the helm of filmmaking that brought her international acclamation in later years.
The Lester James Peries and Sumitra Peries foundation was inaugurated in June 2011 at BMICH. Dr Peries and Sumitra celebrated their Golden wedding anniversary on 19 June 2014 and now live happily in the comfort of their home located down the road named after Dr Lester James Peries.

Virtuous  verses
The slim book of poems of 48 pages, going by the title Me and My Angel may suggest a dedicated poetry of the beloved of the poet, Ithayarasan, a retired educator of high ranking status. He had earlier brought out two books in Tamil. One is Meeralkal (poems) and Muranpaadukal (Short Fiction) Meeralkal may mean acts of violation and Muranpaadukal, Contradictions.
The writer comes from a Marxist family. Therefore, the terms are reasonably correct. This is a publication by Jeevanathi Publishers and its Chief Editor Kalamani Bharanitharan has written an introduction and an excellent analysis as the foreword is by senior lecturer in sociology at Yaalpaanam University, Rajesh Kannan (his name reminds me of a Hindi actor of yesteryear). There are 31 Marxist-oriented poems in this collection.
Instead of me giving my views, I think it is better if I translate some of his poems so that the reader in English would understand what Lankan Tamil writers think about the society at large and more particularly their immediate surrounding.
Unresponsive feelings
I am the soil feeling pride of the lush grass
Sprung today after yesterdays rain
The minerals around and the solemn fragrance
Sweepingly sprinkle the colourful richness around
The embellishing neighbouring soil like me
Desires to speak with me
I could feel its every movement-
My thoughts and movements too
Would have been caught by its eyes
And yet our relationship continues
To be mere fondness
On a gloomy darkness of a waning moon
I was stolen.
It might be that pitched darkness had it
Made it possible the helplessness
0f my father and mother- but I was isolated.
With the hardened clay of soil
I was forcibly copulated
Thinking of happy dreams of me
That soil which spoke a silent language would
Have been sold in the international market
For a good price.
Destruction
Real eagles prick and prick
And decompose
The dreaming birds
That believing forever
The Spy stories
Enrapturing a dreamy sheet
In a remembering bed
Male Characteristics
She builds a house
He ties a Thaali
She bears a child
He bloats his stomach
She carries burdens like a donkey
He neighs as a horse
She remains patient
He invests in ignorance
She works hard without sleeping
Even when everything is She
Everything belongs to him Belongs to Him
Bridegroom
A bull bought for a fat sum
To fertilize

Bride
A Sacrificial Cow
With jewellery and goods
And herself
Footprints that write pain
Every footstep the hill county women
Steps in the tea garden
Writes the unsolved pages
Of their deplorable life.
The wound of the Vanni
Our lands women
During the Vanni War
Forcibly raped carry
In their chests
The historical wounds.
Vision
Even in post-Mullivaaikaal
Thamil Nationalism
Is Pounded
Like Blinds Viewing
An Elephant
Castes
In Tamil Culture
The foul-smelling
Dirty Wastages
Cultural Revolution
Soora Padman and his brothers stand
As symbols of the centre of autoreactive
New Colonial Suppression
Sooniyam
Even for a little vibration of a tumbler
The wartime hearts of people
Thought it was a bomb blast
And yet in peacetime i
People are in pain
Without Sleep
In the silent zones.
In the above creative translations, I have tried to put the essence of what Ithayarasan says in his poems. I have selected only the simple ones. But there are more serious poems in this collection and they are a little difficult to translate and if attempted, the importance of primary words may be lost translation.
This is a welcome addition to selective meaningful collection of recent Lankan Tamil Poetry.
Bharaneetharan also must be congratulated for the cover picture for his imaginative creation.

## Title: The way Forward for DFCC Bank

The way Forward for DFCC Bank
DFCC was the first bank to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1956, said DFCC Bank Chairman, Royle Jansz.
DFCC has always been a listed company from 1956 and its shares have always been held by individual and institutional investors, he said in an interview.
Excerpts of the interview:
Q: Why does your annual report say that DFCC is the Bank for the Times
A: DFCC is the bank for the times because it is agile, responsive and powering ahead on a foundation of capital strength and a mindset of being a leader and in tune with the aspirations of all our customers. A bank for the times must move with the times; which is what DFCC Bank has been doing for over 60 years.
Q: Your annual report claims that DFCC is a Pioneer, Pathfinder and a Trailblazer. Can you explain
A: DFCC Bank is a Pioneer because it is one of the earliest development finance institutions in Asia, and the first in Sri Lanka. Since its inception in 1955, DFCC Bank has supported building the nation by pioneering many innovations in Sri Lankas financial sector.
The Bank played a major role in the launch of Sri Lankas first unit trust, the National Equity Fund, acted as the executing agent, promoter and was one of three principal investors, it was instrumental in setting up the then biggest venture capital company, Lanka Ventures Limited by taking the larger equity stake along with Asian Development Bank and other investors in 1992, and in the formation of Lanka Industrial Estates (LINDEL) Ltd as a public/private partnership to manage an industrial estate.
We are a Pathfinder because DFCC was the First Bank to be listed in 1956 on the Colombo Stock Exchange (when it was the Colombo Brokers Association) and the second Financial Institution to do so. The second bank to be listed was 14 years thereafter. Our Shareholders cover a spectrum of local and foreign investors and include financial and non-financial corporates, investment funds, and individuals.
DFCC is a trailblazer because as the first development bank, it has been the financier of trail blazing Lankan entrepreneurs and an adder of value to the enterprises they built  particularly during their risky early stages. Many successful corporates in the business world today obtained their initial funding from DFCC.
Q: Why did the Bank think it was necessary to include this information in this years Annual Report
A: Because public perception is that DFCC was a government owned development bank which was subsequently privatized and is now no longer into development banking.
This view has been put forward from time to time at various fora and in print and we believe it is time to correct this misconception once and for all.
DFCC has always been a listed company from as far back as 1956 and its shares have always been held by individual and institutional investors.
Therefore the question of privatisation does not arise.
When we received approval from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to become a Commercial Bank in 2015, this was subject to DFCCs commitment to maintaining a significant portion of project loans in our portfolio and to assist development projects while expanding our commercial banking business.
At present, approximately 45% of our portfolio consists of development loans, and such lending contributes significantly to the growth of the economy.
We are still the preferred lender for green development projects such as waste to energy, hydro, wind, and solar energy projects in addition to other large start up projects.
The expertise of our project lending teams, honed by over six decades of experience in this field, is unmatched in the industry.
We are still the reference bank and the first port of call for anyone with a great idea needing finances to bring it to fruition.
Q: What are your priorities as Chairman of DFCC Bank
A: It is very simple. My role is strategy, people and governance.
The Board has approved strategic short and medium term plans and performance against these plans are monitored quarterly at Board level. The Board discusses strategy at every board meeting as Strategic Discussion is an early agenda item. Succession planning has been given priority by targeting focused career development programmes for high potential staff and by establishing a committee headed by a Board Member to reorganise and improve the succession planning process for key management personnel. We have strengthened practices by enhancing the scope of the board nomination committee to include governance. The Board sets the example for employees of the bank by implementing the highest standards of business ethics and corporate governance.
Whistle blowing policy is in place and all members of staff are educated and encouraged to report any suspected wrong doing.
The highest levels of authority in the bank including the Chairman, CEO and senior management are always accessible and information received is speedily investigated and actioned if found to be credible.
DFCC has an open door policy and, in addition, frequent open days are organised so that any member of the staff could meet the Chairman and CEO to discuss ideas or issues and concerns.
Q: What plans does the Bank have for the next few years
The Bank has set itself a challenging plan for the next three years and the Board is confident that the CEO, Lakshman Silva and his team will deliver.
Our people have confidence in themselves and their colleagues and have the desire to succeed.
As I said earlier, we are a Bank for the times. We are innovative and service oriented and dedicated to providing excellence to our customers and optimizing returns to our shareholders.
