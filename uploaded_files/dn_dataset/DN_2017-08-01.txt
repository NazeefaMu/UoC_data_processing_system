Suwasariya to go countrywide after first years success
The India-backed pre-hospital care emergency response ambulance service, Suwasariya on Tuesday marked its first anniversary with the managers of the programme and Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva announcing that moves are afoot to expand it throughout the island.
According to reports, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has moved a proposal to the Cabinet stressing the importance of extending the emergency ambulence service.
The Suwasariya ambulance service is operational in the Southern and Western Provinces. The service will be made available in other provinces soon under the second phase of the programme, sources said.
Steps will be taken to add more 300 ambulances to the fleet under the second phase.
Suwasariya was established as a private- public partnership programme between Indias not-for-profit professional organisation, GVK EMRI, operating in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode and the Sri Lankan Government with the financial assistance from the Indian Government. Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva played a major role in the process.
The services got off the ground with the formation of GVK EMRI Lanka connecting with the Health Ministry. During the first year, Suwasariyas controlled centre has received over 322,000 emergency calls and has served over 32,000 cases, out of which, cardio, trauma and stroke have been the major cases, the sources said.
Nine childbirths have taken place in Suwasariya ambulances during the year.

Abans Finance records  Rs 197.4 mn PBT for 2016/17
Abans Finance, a member of Abans Group, has registered a pre-tax profit of Rs. 197.4 million for the period ended March 31, 2017, compared to Rs. 130.5 million recorded in the corresponding year of 2016, achieving a YoY growth of 51.29%.
The posttax profit of the company for the period under review has also improved by 48.2%, from Rs.90.1 million in 2016 to Rs. 133.6 million in 2017.
Abans Finance has also enhanced its stated capital from Rs. 382.3 Mn to Rs. 844 Mn during 2016/17 and further to Rs. 1,121.4 Mn during the current financial year of 2018. Ironwood Investment Holding (Pvt) Limited has invested in Abans Finance and currently holds 41.89% Equity of the Company with the conclusion of the Mandatory Offer closed in July 2017.
Ironwood is a private equity firm that successfully raised a Sri Lanka-focused Private Equity fund of up to USD 30 Mn. in long term (8 year) capital commitments.
The company has continued to increase its profitability ami external challenges such as increasing interest rates and slowdown in consumption. The increase in profitability was mainly due to favourable growth in net interest income.
A slight shrinking of Net Interest Margins (NIM) had an adverse impact on the Net Interest Income (NII) of the entire NBFI sector and Abans Finance was no exception to this trend. Nevertheless, NII of the company recorded a remarkable increase of Rs. 162.98 million or 23% during the period under review from Rs.708 million in 2016 to Rs. 871 million in 2017, aided by the significant expansion of the asset-base of the company since 2016, coupled with prudent liability management strategies.
Net fee and Commission income which mostly comprises of fees, commissions and other fee based income decreased to Rs.19.4 million from being Rs. 34.7 million during the year 2016, reflecting a decline of 44.2%. The company introduced a number of unique value additions to its Hero Motor cycle leasing offerings during the period under review in order to remain competitive in view of the fact that most competitors have now made moves to the two wheeler motor cycle credit market to retain margins in a period of rising interest costs.
A 22.5% growth was recorded in other operating income for the period under review as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. Other operating income earned during the 2017 amounted to Rs 20.7 million,whereas in 2016 it was Rs. 16.9 million.

Alert SriLankan cabin crew members avert major incident
Alert cabin crew members aboard SriLankan Airlines flight UL 166 managed to avert a major incident that is believed to have been caused by the ignition of a lithium battery pack or mobile phones in a passengers hand luggage, SriLankan Airlines sources said.
The incident had taken place last Sunday when the flight was en route to Colombo from Kochi.
None of the 202 passengers or any of the crew had suffered any injuries and the Airbus A330-200 aircraft had landed safely at Colombos Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) at the scheduled time. A spokesman for the airline said as soon as the flight landed, passengers broke out in applause at the decisive manner in which the crew handled the situation.
Explaining about the incident he said, shortly after the meal service on the 70-minute flight was concluded, alert cabin crew members in the aft area of the aircraft noticed smoke appearing from an overhead luggage bin.
The cabin manager and the captain were immediately informed. The aft cabin crew members rapidly armed themselves with fire extinguishers and opened the bin.
Upon finding a bag emitting smoke, they sprayed it with an extinguisher. The crew then removed the bag from the overhead bin and carried it quickly away from the passengers to the aft galley, at which time it began to emit smoke once again at a faster rate. Suspecting a lithium fire, they adopted the lithium fire extinguishing procedure by immersing the bag in a container of water. The situation was successfully contained and the bag ceased to emit smoke. Upon investigation, the crew found a lithium battery pack and two mobile phones in the bag.
The flight crew immediately informed air traffic controllers at the BIA and the aircraft was met on arrival by dangerous goods experts, firefighters and other safety related personnel. Since the situation was under control, passengers did not require emergency evacuation and disembarked in the usual manner.
SriLankan Airlines has launched an investigation into the incident, as have the relevant authorities in Sri Lanka.
The spokesman further said, with its prime priority being the safety and well-being of its passengers, Sri Lankan Airlines provides all its cabin crew with rigorous training in the handling of all types of emergency situations, including possible fires on board. Also, the Airline has been actively involved in global safety measures with regard to spontaneous ignition of Lithium batteries. In October 2016, SriLankan imposed a total ban on the carriage and usage of Samsung Note 7 on board its aircraft.
Sri Lankan Airlines commends the crew of flight UL 166 for their vigilance, timely action and calmness under pressure in adopting the proper procedures, which avoided a major incident, he added.

Aloysius forgotten  Apple Password:Commission says use memory or deal with implications
Anuja Premaratne PC sought permission from the Commission to allow his client, Arjun Aloysius to purchase a sim card with the same mobile number which he has handed over to the digital forensic investigators attached to the Treasury Bond Commission.
The Attorney Generals panel assisting the Commission objected to the application, saying that Aloysius has not cooperated with the investigators.
They said that they will be able to provide Aloysiuss mobile phone within 48 hours, if Aloysius cooperates with them and give his Apple User Account name and password to the investigators. ASG Yasantha Kodagoda pointed out to the Commission that Aloysius has lied to the investigators when he was giving statements. He also said optimal measures will be taken, if Aloysius will not give his Apple user account password to the Commission. We are going to get into the Aloysius Apple User Account somehow. ASG Kodagoda said. He also pointed out that forgetting the password is not an excuse.
Justice Jayawardena told Aloysiuss lawyer either his client may have to recall his lost memory and come up with the password, or deal with the inconvenience.
Meanwhile, Arjun Mahendrans legal counsel Chanaka de Silva requested permission from the Commission to purchase a new mobile phone and a new sim card.
Commissioner Justice Jayawardena said Mahendran does not need to seek permission of the Commission for such a purchase.
Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne yesterday made a submission to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue to represent Arjun Aloysius, the former CEO of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited. Aloysius was previously represented by Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indratissa who later withdrew and is presently representing Perpetual Capital Holdings at the Treasury Bond Commission.

Aloysius logged into Apple account within the last 48 hours: ASG

Arjun Aloysius of the Perpetual Treasuries has logged into his Apple account within last 48 hours using the password he claims to have forgotten, it was revealed at the Treasury Bond Commission today (01).
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Yasantha Kodagoda raised concerns of a possible attempt to destroy evidence in Aloysius Apple account.
ASG Kodagoda pointed out the evidence sought by the PCoI should be secured at all costs, and contemplated that the investigators may already be too late in deriving crucial evidence.
We dont know whether he (Aloysius) has already deleted this data. ASG Kodagoda said.
ASG Kodagoda said Aloysius has logged into his Apple Account using his wife Anjalee Mahendrans Apple phone.
How can he (Aloysius) plead amnesia Kodagoda asked, While using the password he claimed to have forgotten 
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera requested the PCoI to consider Aloysius attempt to erase important backup data in his Apple user account and to issue an order to Aloysius, or anybody else on his behalf, prohibiting the access or meddling with backup data in the said Apple account.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda pointed out that Aloysiuss claim to have most conveniently forgotten his Apple user account password, while actually having it in his possession, is an instance of contempt of the order given by the Commission.
ASG Kodagoda further said if Aloysius continue to utter falsehood and not give his Apple accounts password, the Attorney General can consider seeking legal action against Aloysius.
Aloysiuss lawyer Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne said his client does not remember the password to his Apple account. He also said his clients email account has been hacked into, after being submitted to the CID.
ASG Kodagoda rose to point out that Premaratne PC was also mislead by his client and told that Nothing has been hacked into and why would a CID officer hack into an account
Referring to Premaratne PCs claim that his client has forgotten the password, Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked, When you say your client cannot remember, does it not imply that there is an Apple account and a password to it Premaratne PC answered in affirmative.
Justice Jayawardena asked SASG de Livera and ASG Kodagoda under what law an order should be issued regarding the latest development in the matter relating to Aloysiuss Apple user account. ASG Kodagoda said the order should come under the inherent powers of the PCoI while SASG de Livera said it should be a consequential order.
The PCoI is to make an order regarding the mattertomorrow, after considering the reasons given by both AGs panel and Aloysius lawyer.
The PCoI issued an order in July third week, to hand over all his digital communication devices used by his from 2015 to 2016, to the Criminal Investigation Department to conduct a digital forensic examination.
Complying with the order, Aloysius handed over his laptop computer and his mobile phone which he was using for the last six months to the CID team attached to the PCoI, on 24 July.
On 24 July morning Aloysiuss lawyer informed the Treasury Bond Commission that Aloysiuss Apple phone which he was using in 2015, was destroyed in Singapore. A statement was also recorded from Aloysius on the same day (24) he handed over his communication devices.
According to ASG Kodagoda, Aloysius initially giving a statement to the CID has claimed that he does not have an Apple user account. Later on, the investigators have found out that Aloysius has used an Apple user account to download certain applications. Aloysius has refused to give his password at that instance.
The PCoI then issued a written order on 28 July, to Aloysius to reveal his Apple user account name and its password.
Aloysius sought permission from the Commission on 31 July, to purchase a SIM card with the same mobile number that he has handed over to the CID. The AGs panel objected to the application.

Avant Garde Captain collapses in Court

Ukrainian captain of the Avant Garde ship collapsed in Supreme Court today morning just after a Fundamental Rights petition filed by him was fixed for another date.
Ukrainian Gennadiy Gavrylov, the captain of MV Avant Garde was subsequently taken to a private hospital in an ambulance belonging to Superior Courts.
The Supreme Court had earlier granted leave to proceed with a fundamental rights petition filed by the Ukrainian captain of the Avant Garde ship, challenging his alleged illegal arrest and prolonged detention.
The petition will be taken up for argument on March 12.
The petitioner, Ukrainian Gennadiy Gavrylov, the captain of MV Avant Garde, is challenging his arrest in early October 2015, purportedly outside Sri Lankan territorial waters and his continued detention at the Galle remand prison.
The petitioner, a father of one, who is being detained at Galle remand prison, claims that he had absolutely no political affiliations to any group or party in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner stated that he was unfortunate to be embroiled in a political tug of war prevailing in the country.
The petitioner cited the Officer-in-Charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), CID Director, DIG in charge of the CID and Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd. (RALL), a Government-owned business undertaking affiliated to the Defence Ministry, Avant Garde Maritime Services (AGMS), Sri Lanka Shipping Company Ltd., Lanka Maritime Services Ltd., the Defence Secretary, and the Attorney General as respondents.
The petitioner stated that MV Avant Garde, which was chartered by Avant Garde Maritime Services belonging to the Sri Lanka Shipping Company, had been seized in international waters in early October 2015 in the wake of the change of Government.
He alleged that some of the respondents subjected him to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment through the false accusation that he had entered Sri Lankan territorial waters in the vessel he had taken command of on July 24, 2015.
Manohara de Silva PC with Arinda Wijesurendra appeared for the petitioner.

Blanket ban..!
Horror of horrors! A news item appearing in Indian newspapers mentioned that the blankets offered by the Indian Railways to its passengers for their overnight journeys were washed only once in two months! Which meant, realized horrified passengers that they had slept in the sweat and dirt of sixty other passengers, before the blankets went for their bi-monthly cleaning!
But thats not all!
How did the railways react Did the minister in charge or the general managers put their heads down in shame
No, they didnt! Theyve decided to punish the people for refusing to sleep in those filthy blankets.
No more blankets! they cried in unison, and have decided to stop offering blankets to passengers.
Many years ago, I wrote a play about a man caught in a lift. Different people came upto the shut doors and offered different pieces of advice to the poor man inside. Some told him not to panic, some made him sing religious songs, some even told him to breathe slowly so as to not use up all the air in the lift.
Suddenly everybody was quiet and the man inside, realized somebody important had come.
Sir, I am stuck inside! he shouted, Help me!
A minister had arrived. He looked around, saw he had an audience and declared, From today all lifts are banned!
This is how we address problems.
Instead of finding solutions to let the man out, to see that lifts dont stop midway, the lift was banned and people trudged up the stairs as much as they will now have to spend cold nights on trains, because the railways were caught with unwashed blankets.
In the last two years, banning has become a popular pastime in India and also the rest of the world.
Instead of going after those hoarding black money, the very notes were banned, causing immense disruption to the economy which went into a nosedive.
Trump, instead of fighting terrorists, blocks whole nations from entering his country.
Banning, was a medieval method of threatening people. If one villager rebelled, the whole village was punished. This primitive method seems to be gaining momentum.
Why did you reveal that the blankets were not being washed asks the traveler to the agency which had revealed such.
So that blankets would be washed, and you would know the source of the skin rash you get after each journey!
But now we have no blankets!
And instead of rallying against those who ban, against those who are responsible for the problem, we cry in ager at those who reveal the truth, at those who get caught in the lift.
Help! cries the man in the lift, his voice becoming weaker.
You stupid man, because of you we have to use the stairs! cry the people as they plod up and down the stairs, cursing the man who they feel has made them suffer this discomfort..!

## Title: A blending hub for tea  Not at this time

A blending hub for tea  Not at this time
I refer to the article, Consequences of not Liberalizing Tea Imports, published by the Tea Exporters Association (TEA) in the Daily News of June 16.
While making the case for liberalization, the article omits to mention the possible negative effects of such a policy. As pointed out by the TEA, this matter has been debated for 15 years.
This procrastination is likely because there are strong arguments for and against, each of which entails serious consequences for the tea industry and the national economy.
Like Brexit, this is a complex issue with sound arguments on both sides. Neither opening the floodgates to the import of orthodox tea nor shutting out tea imports altogether, is in my opinion practical.
As the TEA concedes in its article, the tea exporters too, are split down the middle on this issue. Several large exporters of both value-added and bulk tea adamantly opposefurther liberalization. This makes it additionally difficult for the government to revise the existing policy.
Nevertheless, the TEA has had ample opportunity to present its case: its chairman serves on the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the association was represented also on the cabinet-appointed committee that advised on this matter.
Clearly, there are two sides to this debate. Both deserve to be heard, and if only because the TEA has (understandably) not presented the other side, I will attempt to summarize it here.
I emphasize that what is important is not to score debating points but to understand the competing forces that must inform policy in this area.
Background
Sri Lanka has a 150-year history of producing tea. The Ceylon origin today symbolizes teas of the highest quality, setting Ceylon teas apart from those of competitor countries. Ceylon tea thus attracts a substantial premium over teas from other origins.
The quality of Ceylon tea derives from several attributes unavailable to competing origins, including, in combination: flavour, aroma and colour; characteristic regional diversity; strictly-regulated residue standards; high ethical standards (e.g. no child labour); and good manufacturing practices.
The Ceylon origin is uniquely associated with these values. These are the common property and heritage of the industry.
The Sri Lanka Tea Board permits only teas of 100% Sri Lankan origin that are also packaged for retail in Sri Lanka to be labelled with the Ceylon origin, usually as Pure Ceylon Tea.
However, the Ceylon origin is widely abused in many consumer countries, causing the Tea Board to mount expensive legal challenges. If nothing else, this demonstrates the value of the Ceylon appellation.
Sri Lanka is the worlds largest exporter of orthodox tea. The orthodox method of production results in more than 20 grades of tea differing in particle size, appearance, colour, aroma, liquor etc., a far greater diversity than CTC teas.
Orthodox vs CTC is thus essentially a matter of specialization versus commoditization. Because CTCs are ideally suited to tea bags, world demand is largely for CTCs.
CTCs, however, account for only about 6% of our national production and usually fetch significantly lower prices than premium orthodox teas.
To help Sri Lankan exporters compete effectively in the global market, the import of CTC teas for blending and re-export has been permitted for the past several years.
In 2016, for example, 2.9million kilogrammes of CTCs were imported, approximately 1% of national orthodox production.
At the request of the TEA, and with the support of the Tea Board, the government recently agreed to abolish the 1% import duty levied on such imports. The import of orthodox tea too, is permitted, subject to a 25% duty on the CIF value.
When exported, such blended teas are usually labelled with words like A blend of Ceylon and other-origin teas, packed in Sri Lanka.
Unfortunately, though most CTC teas can be freely imported for blending and re-export, this opportunity has not been seized by exporters.
Few exporters have availed themselves also of the opportunity to import orthodox teas, paying the 25% duty. While 25% may seem excessive, it should be borne in mind that the average price at the Colombo auction increased by as much as 50% during the past year.
If that was afforded (albeit with much difficulty) by the export community, surely the 25% tariff on the import of much cheaper orthodox teas is hardly a formidable disincentive And shouldnt there be some disincentive to other countries dumping cheap tea in Sri Lanka and damaging the countrys premium brand Would, for example, Frances wine industry import and blend cheaper imports with its own produce
Sri Lankas value-added tea industry (some 40% of exports by volume are in value-added form), which is the envy of other tea-exporting countries, is strongly reliant on the global reputation of the Ceylon origin.
A few exporters who emphasize the origin have created brands that are able regularly to achieve FOB averages of more than Rs 1,600 per kg for quantities in excess of 5 millionkilogrammes annually, indicating the potential of value-addition for the industry at large.
Theaverage FOB value of value-added tea in 2016 was, however, only Rs 785 per kg, which suggests there is a lot more potential that could be tapped.
My mention of these statistics is by no means intended to belittle exporters who do not achieve top prices: I grant that the building of big brands calls for big investment, huge risk, and perhaps most importantly, the contingency of good luck.
The case against blending
For brevity, I here refer to as blending - the process of importing orthodox teas duty-free from other origins for value addition and re-export, usually after blending with Ceylon tea.
The primary opposition to blending stems from a perception that the unique value of the Ceylon origin will be diluted or damaged.
Unlike in the case of industrial products, consumers of food products attachmuch importance to the origin of the foods they consume.
Just as French wine, Colombian coffee, Norwegian salmonand California oranges attract a premium, so does Ceylon tea.
Thus, even if blended teas do not use the word Ceylon, the fact that they are packed in Sri Lanka may result in consumers equating them with Ceylon tea, diminishing the prestige of the latter. Would consumers, for example, attach the same value to a watch Made in Switzerland as to a watch Made in Switzerland using Swiss and other-origin parts
While it is true that brands have out-marketed origins in the case of many goods including some foods, origins still hold value in the case of premium foods.
For example, Nescafe produces Classic and Gold, unremarkable instant coffees sold on price without any mention of bean-type or origin. But Nespresso, their premium offering, is sold with the unique virtues of each origin being highlighted and celebrated.
With Ceylon tea aspiring to the premium end of the market, we need to embrace quality, authenticity, provenance and ethics, not seek the lowest common denominator by diluting the prestige of the Ceylon brand with other origins.
A brand may nevertheless incorporate substantial quality variation, as evidenced by the huge price-range of same-label wines and whiskies, e.g., the Red, Black, Gold and Blue labelling system Johnny Walker has adopted, or the phenomenal range of wines marketed by labels such as Wolf Blass.
This position is underlined by the fact that several major international tea brands use Ceylon in their labelling, even for teas blended with those from other origins such as India, or perhaps with no Ceylon tea content at all.
Additionally, several unauthorized and misleading uses of the Ceylon origin (in forms such as Ceylon Plus, Ceylon Gold, Mild Ceylon and the like) and even the Lion Logo are commonplace.
It is therefore clear that the Ceylon brand carries great value, and allowing its dilution with teas of other origins will only diminish the reputation won by the brand over the past 150 years.
There is also a risk that orthodox teas imported for blending purposes will find their way into the local market, to be re-exported as Ceylon tea. In addition to depressing demand for our teas, once consumers discover such malpractices, they will cease placing a premium on Ceylon tea, to the detriment of the industry.
Most of our tea exports go in the form of bulk or value-added to order to an ever-smaller number of importers in overseas markets who squeeze our exporters to minimize their margins and maximize their credit.
It is for this reason that the average FOB price even of value-added tea is as low as Rs 780 /kg. The pressure to blend with other origins to reduce cost while retaining the Ceylon brand-appeal seems to originate largely from these importers.
However, exporters who develop and aggressively promotetheir own brands stand to make much higher margins; they are much more jealous of the Ceylon brand. The challenge for exporters then, is to strive to become genuine value-adders, appealing directly to consumers, capitalizing on the premium the Ceylon origin gives them. I fully realise this is easier said than done.
If we now decide to freely blend our orthodox teas with other orthodox teas by removing the 25% import duty, we stand to reduce our quality to the detriment of Sri Lankan and overseas brands loyal to the concept of Pure Ceylon Tea.
We will also devalue the equity of Pure Ceylon tea in the eyes of consumers. The fact that the Ceylon origin is widely counterfeited and dishonestly labelled only highlights its value.
The challenge that faces us therefore, is to help exporters place their Pure Ceylon products on shop shelves overseas, not to dilute their key value proposition, namely the Ceylon origin.
Exporters ask why they are being held captive and forced to buy and export only Ceylon tea to a world market that demands teas of all types and origins. The truth is that subject to modest tariffs exporters can even now import any raw materials they like, including green, white, CTC, specialty and even (subject to the 25% duty) orthodox tea.
Why then, is Sri Lanka not the tea-bagging hub of the world Despite these freedoms, only a single exporter has engaged substantially in importing sizeable volumes of CTC teas and re-exporting these in value-added form.
Sri Lankas tea industry has through 150 years of toil established itself as the worlds premier producer of black tea. It is a well-established principle of marketing that a product cannot be positioned as both premium and cheap.
The question before us is, do we follow a Pure Ceylon strategy or Packed in Sri Lanka strategyThe former argues that Ceylon Tea is a public good that is the common property of all Sri Lankans whereas the latter avers that the Ceylon brand may be worth trading for greater export revenues.
It is accepted that the premium value of Ceylon does not apply to all teas of Sri Lankan origin. There are good teas, to which Ceylon adds special value, and ordinary teas, which probably do not benefit from the origin.
However, it is the premium teas that pull the rest of the industry along, just as the premium value ofchampagne and Chateau Lafite benefits the entire French wine industry. Everything possible must therefore be done to safeguard the Ceylon origin for the benefit of the entire industry.
When we allow orthodox teas from other origins such as Indonesia and Vietnam to enter Sri Lanka for blending, we indirectly endorse these origins and give them an entry to our hard-won captive markets.
By using our value-addition expertise and the prestige of the Ceylon originto take these teas to our consumers, we are only creating, perversely, a new marketplace for our competitors, while further weakening the production sector in our country.
The future of tea
Personally, I see merit in both sides of this debate. I here present mainly the case against blending simply because it too, deserves to be heard. The matter is not as self-evident as the TEA suggests.
From the governments perspective, this question boils down to what future is envisaged for our tea industries [sic], for the fact of the matter is that we have two tea industries: producers and exporters.
These two sectors are necessarily at odds. Producers want to sell their tea at the highest price while exporters want to buy it at the lowest price. And producers have a vested interest in holding the exporters captive, with limited access to raw materials from other origins.
Although this conflict of interest is moderated by the tea auction, it is not moderated linearly. Last year, for example, when tea production fell by some 10%, the auction prices rose by almost 50%. This places huge stress on exporters, who often have forward-contracted and cannot up their price simply because of rising raw-material costs.
Their margins get squeezed and naturally they want access to cheaper orthodox teas. But this begs the question, to what heights would the Colombo auction have risen last year if the 10% production shortfall had been bridged by cheap imports
The TEA is right to claim that both the extent of land under tea and the quantity of tea produced by Sri Lanka are declining. This reflects an economic reality: the fact that, owing to Sri Lankas per capita GDP being streets ahead of its nearest competitors, its cost of living (and hence wages) too, are much higher.
Labour represents about 75% of the cost of production. Our tea is thus set to become yet more expensive even as our rivals continue to produce theirs much more cheaply than we do. Where does this end
I often receive letters from retired planters urging the government to intervene more strongly in the industry. I believe, however, that state intervention in the forces that shape industry is futile and counter-productive.
We should not forget the disaster that followed the states post-nationalization intervention via the monolithic institutions of the JEDB and SLSPC. Unless the tea industry remains diverse, competitive and dynamic it cannot develop the innovations that will see it thrive in the future. The states role should be to facilitate and regulate, not to operate.
Neitherdo I believe that it is sustainable for the state to prop the producers up by handing out subsidies, whether for replanting, factory modernization or anything else. The industry must stand on its own feet.
This means that factories making poor-quality teas must, if their cost of production is too high, eventually drop out, depressing output still further.
Sri Lanka at a crossroads
This is not to say blending is all bad. There is no doubt that Sri Lanka lost a great deal by disincentivizing the multinational companies that wanted to bBlend tea here.
Now they do so offshore, with little incentive to buy Ceylon tea, though sometimespirating the Ceylon origin. At the same time, principally because of our high prices and regulatory inflexibility, we have largely lost key tea markets such as the UK, Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, South Africa and Poland, which we dominated just decades ago.
Blending would arguably have allowed us to retain these markets, none of which has since been regained. Even now, the trends in key Ceylon tea markets such as Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation are waning. These losses are perhaps mainly due to our high prices but arguably also at least in part because we failed to liberalize our export industry.
The case for blending includes also some arguments that the TEA may not have emphasized sufficiently. The decline in tea production is driven also by the aspirations of our people.
No one wants to be a tea-plucker anymore. There is an acute dearth of labour in the plantations. The youth in these areas too, have dreams. They want to work not in the fields but in the value-addedservice economy of the future.
Blending accelerates transition to that future, with jobs in packaging, design, logistics, financial services and the like - even driving a tuk-tuk. The migration of labour will reduce yet further the amount of tea locally available to exporters, strengthening the case for blending.
The tension we see between the constituencies for and against blending are a symptom of Sri Lanka being at a crossroads: an agricultural economy transitioning to a predominantly service economymore like those of Singapore or Dubai.
The question is, how rapidly will this transition occur If it will take 20 more years, blending is probably a bad idea at this point. If it will take five, then that prospect changes dramatically. Between those extremes there is undoubtedly some wriggle room in which innovations could be tested.
Examples of such innovations are the provisions to freely import CTC main grades and, on payment of the 25% tariff, orthodox teas for blending. The TEA would be wise to seek the consensus of the wider industrial constituency and propose further innovations so that a smooth, incremental transition to a new industrial paradigm becomes possible.
We can see for ourselves in the SAITM fiasco what happens when a consensual, incremental approach to innovation is spurned.
Finally, the Minister of Plantation Industries, Navin Dissanayake, has made it clear that he is open to blending if there is clear industrial consensus. Neither he nor I have uttered a Not on my watchresponse to this question.
In the present circumstances, however, and subject to the realities I have outlined above, I am opposed to a complete liberalization of tea imports, particularly the tariff-free import of orthodox teas. But this policy is not carved in stone: it must necessarily evolve as the industry and the economy evolve.

BOC celebrates 78 years of service today
With the confidence and trust that has been build over the years in the Sri Lankan Banking and Financial Services sector, Countrys NO.1 Brand steps into its successful 78th year of service as Bankers to the Nation on August 1.
Having to celebrate 78 years of being the No.1 Bank in the Sri Lankan Banking Industry is an extraordinary tale to tell. Since the Banks inception in 1939 to assist the Sri Lankans to come out of the difficult situation that prevailed at that time depriving locals from obtaining financial assistance reasonably, the Bank has been committed to socio-economic development through financial inclusion, providing genuinely value-added services to those who seek reliable and convenient financial solutions and the overall up liftment of the countrys banking and financial landscape to align it with international banking standards. The Bank of Ceylons Chairman, Presidents Counsel Ronald C. Perera said.
I take this opportunity to thank all our beloved customers to whom we owe our success and our main stakeholder the Government of Sri Lanka for the direction, finally to all stakeholders and all Sri Lankans in general, he further added.
A state council member George E De Silva spearheaded a demand which led to the calling for the establishment of a state aided bank. The inauguration took place at Bristol Street, Colombo Fort on August 1, 1939 with the patronage of the British Governor Sir Andrew Caldecott.
Just as it addressed the need of that time for a commercial bank for people of this country, the Bank still proudly upholds same core values that were transmitted by its founders to be a leader of positive economic change and a passionate banking service provider.
We know that every step we take to re-modify and transform our banking processes has the effect of providing greater value to Sri Lankans at large. Addressing this concern at all times the Bank continuously maintains and enhances its services to suit the changing lifestyle of Sri Lankans, stated the General Manager D.M Gunasekera.
In more recent times, innovative steps and out-of-the-box thinking has enabled BOC to grow stronger and strengthen the countrys economic resources.
The Bank has scheduled several events to take place in celebration of its 78th anniversary. Among them are the BOC Ran Kekulu Little Picasso Art competition, special Ran Kekulu promotion for babies born in the month of August, several CSR campaigns including a blood donation campaign, a religious procession followed by an overnight pirith chanting on 4th August and an almsgiving on the following day.

Bond commission: Saman Kumara was planted at the front office
Former Superintendent of the Employees Provident Fund, Assistant Governor R.A. Jayalath yesterday revealed to the Treasury Bond Commission that former Governor Arjun Mahendran threatened him to place the recently interdicted officer of the EPF P.H.I. Saman Kumara in the EPF Front Office where Treasury bond trading was carried out.
AG Jayalath observed that Saman Kumara was close with then Governor Mahendran and it seemed Saman Kumara was divulging details of discussions held at the EPF to Mahendran. Jayalath said he came to this conclusion following certain conversations he had with Saman K. and Mahendran.  On the following day (the day after Saman Kumara was transferred), I received a call from Mr. Mahendran. He shouted at me, saying I sent a fellow with CFA qualification and he was not assigned to the front office and put somewhere else. I understood that Kumara mustve gone and told Mahendran that he was not put to the front office. I felt frustrated. It was under my directive to place Kumara. Mahendran directed me he threatened me to do that (to put Saman Kumara in the front office). Saman Kumara as the Chief Dealer of the EPF was responsible for buying treasury bonds purchased by Perpetual Treasuries in the secondary market.
AG Jayalath also said Saman Kumara had violated certain regulations in the Investment and Trading Guideline of the EPF by conducting dealings exceeding his daily limits. Daily dealing limit for a Chief Dealer in the EPF is Rs.2 billion. He also said Saman Kumara was difficult to control he was regularly not in his seat and continuously used the mobile phone, disregarding the instruction not to (use mobile phones), to carry out deals.
AG Jayalath also said a preliminary investigation he conducted in early 2016 on collusive activities of EPF dealers never received recognition from Governor Mahendran.
Asked as to how he felt at that time, Jayalath said he felt frustrated and uneasy about this arrangement, but did not want to shift Saman Kumara to another position because if I (Jayalath) had shifted him (Saman Kumara) I would also have to walk out of my position.
AG Jayalath went on to say that he had heard what happened to some of the persons in the Central Bank who were against the then Governor Mahendran. Laughter from those who were present at the hearing followed Jayalaths observations regarding the difficult position he was in.
According to AG Jayalath, P.H.I. Saman Kumara was transferred to the EPF on 08 June 2015. I put Saman Kumara in the Risk Management Division of the EPF. My people (the staff at the EPF ) warned me against Saman Kumara whom they claimed to a questionable dealer.
So I was scared, Jayalath pointed out. Dealers bare a big responsibility. I put Saman Kumara to a position in Risk Management Division to deal with equity, to test his conduct. Then I received a telephone call from the then Governor Arjun Mahendran, Jayalath explained. He called me and shouted at me for placing Saman Kumara in the Risk Management Division.
Quoting the conversation, Jayalath said Mahendran told him I sent a fellow with CFA qualification and this fellow tells me he was not assigned to the EPF Front Office. According to Jayalath, Mahendran was unhappy that Saman Kumara was placed in the Risk Management Division. AG Jayalath said he attempted to reason out with Mahendran and told him that the EPF was handicapped with lack of people in the Risk Management.
AG Jayalath then explained his meeting with then Governor Mahendran at his office, after Governors office contact him to say that Governor Mahendran wanted Jayalath to come and meet him.
So, I went to see him and spoke to him about the transfers. Mr. Pathuman of the EPF was transferred to Public Debt Department. He was one of the most experienced. So I ask Governor Mahendran to send him back to the EPF. Jayalath said.
Governor Mahendran then inquired me of Saman Kumara and told me that I gave you a skilled CFA qualified person, so why are you not using him Jayalath said.
So I told Governor Mahendran that we cannot rely on Saman Kumara because concerns have been raised on his conduct, Jayalath said. Then Mr. Mahendran asked me whether these rumors had any proof. I told him we do not have proof. Then he asked me so with no proof how can you say Saman Kumaras conduct as a dealer is questionable Jayalath reflected.
Disregarding his reasonings, Jayalath said Mahendran asked me to assign Saman Kumara to the Front Office. He also said I requested Mahendran to give me one week before placing Saman Kumara in the Front Office because I did not want my staff to be demoralized by the decision. AG Jayalath is to appear before the Treasury Bond Commission today (01).

CCC presents recommendations to FM  to fast-track PPPs under new agency
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerces (CCC) National Agenda Committee (NAC) on Infrastructure presented a set of recommendations on fast-tracking Private-Public Partnerships (PPP) to Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera recently and highlighted the need for a robust institutional and operational set up for the new PPP agency.
At a meeting held recently, the group presented their recommendations to the Minister and Ministry officials A. R. Desapriya (Deputy Secretary to the Treasury), K. A. Vimalenthirarajah (Director General of the Department of Trade and Investment Policy) and Deshal De Mel (Economic Advisor to the Ministry of Finance) and discussed priority issues to be tackled and ways of collaborating to advance the PPP investment agenda in Sri Lanka.
The NAC on Infrastructure first made representations to the Ministry of Finance in October 2016, on the need for PPPs and to establish a robust mechanism for dealing with PPPs in a transparent and profitable manner.
This subsequently saw the setting up of a PPP unit and a national PPP initiative, which was launched amidst 100 foreign investors at the Chambers Investment and Business Conclave 2017 held recently.
The Committees latest set of recommendations which focussed on developing guidelines to ensure efficient collaboration between the PPP unit and line ministries; prioritization of projects through developing a robust project pipeline; ensuring a fair, transparent and well managed procurement process; as well as implementing an effective communication strategy were well received by Minister Samaraweera.
The Chamber Committee and Ministry officials pledged to collaborate closely to promote PPP investment opportunities among domestic and international investors through the CCC.
The NAC on Infrastructure comprises leaders in private and public sectors with experience in infrastructure development, as well as representatives of multilateral development agencies. Since last year, the NAC has been continuously lobbying for the facilitation and fast-tracking of PPPs.

OF Cemeteries, Caste and Communists
People from other oppressed caste villages are also participating in the Satyagraha
Interviews S. K. Senthivel, General Secretary of the New Democratic Marxist Leninist Party
Caste relations and conflicts have taken varied forms at different times in Jaffna. The recent conflicts around upper-caste cemeteries in proximity to oppressed caste dwellings resulted in a major protest on May 13th, opposite the Jaffna Bus Stand. In Kalaimathy village in Puttur, historically a Communist stronghold in Jaffna, some 23 villagers are in remand custody and 30 people including 11 women are out on bail, following an intensified struggle against a cemetery in the middle of their village. A Satyagraha campaign is continuing for weeks now in Kalaimathy, calling for the removal of all cemeteries next to peoples settlements. People from other oppressed caste villages are also participating in the Satyagraha and many others are coming to express their solidarity. S. K. Senthivel, General Secretary of the New Democratic Marxist Leninist Party, shared his views on this recent conflict, their work in Kalaimathy village lasting close to four decades and the history of anti-caste struggles in Jaffna.
Q: You have a long relationship with Puttur and particularly Kalaimathy village that is in the heat of struggle today. Could you elaborate on this conflict
A: The people of Kalaimathy village, which has about 700 families making a population of about 4,500 people, are continuing with a Satyagraha struggle supported by the Mass Movement of Social Justice. With the demand that all cemeteries next to peoples settlements should be removed, large sections of the Puttur people from Kalaimathy village are participating day and night and taking forward a powerful conscientious struggle. These villagers have taken a collective decision, that even as they continue their daily wage work, each day, different persons are taking days off and contributing their energies towards organising this struggle.
Those who observe this struggle, wonder about the commitment of the village people towards this struggle, including the history and tradition of this village. And it is indeed, a different kind of activism here, compared to other villages. While there is one consistent leadership in this village for the Community Centre, Womens Society, Sports Society and other village institutions, there is also a politics to the thinking of these people. The basis of their struggle is that for hundreds of years, the people in this village have been oppressed on the basis of caste.
Q: Can you speak about the history of this cemetery that people want removed
A: The cemetery is very old. But in those days, there were no settlements near it. The lands next to it were not used for agriculture with wild over growth. But few decades ago, there was a government settlement scheme which also used some of the cemetery land amounting to 15 lachams (150 perches) and settled some of the villagers. Eventually other villagers also started building houses on the cemetery land as land was scarce and there was no boundary.
As people settled near the cemetery, some practical environmental problems came up in the 2000s. As bodies were burned in the cemetery, the ashes and the smoke began to trouble the people. Animals ran around with half burned body parts that remained. The people began to oppose the existence of the cemetery, and by the 2010s there emerged a widespread opposition to the cemetery. The last body was perhaps burned three or four years ago.
Early this year, one body was brought and it was turned back by the villagers who convinced them to burn it in another cemetery close by, which was distant from peoples settlements. That a dominant caste body was turned back has troubled some people, and they want to prove a point. Next, another family had tried to bring a body, this was of an oppressed caste person, but backed by the dominant castes, and this became confrontational. The courts and the police have intervened. The Judge wanted a high wall built with a gas incinerator. As the confrontation escalated, the villagers broke the half-built wall around the cemetery that was being built in defiance, creating a tense situation and further police action.
Q: What is the education level in this village and how do they earn their living
A:It is only in recent times that students have begun to study O/L and A/L, which reflects the educational backwardness of this village. Until 1975, they could not even attend the Puttur Somaskanda College that was just half a kilometre away, and so their educational access had remained low. They mostly ended their education with grade five, but now there is a young woman who has finished her university education from Kalaimathy. There is now a thirst for education in this village.
The village people are involved in many forms of day wage labour. An interesting characteristic of Valikamam East is that it is a red soil region. But there are stones on top of that soil, and these villagers go as groups of four or five and break and remove the stones and prepare it into farm land. Then there are tree climbing workers. Currently, there are over hundred men who are involved in marketing fish on bicycles. Thus such bodily labour is what they depend on for their incomes. We can also see hundreds of women from this village who go for wage labour in the red soil region of Achchuveli and Valalai.
Q: I have seen women go in groups to work in such farms. What are the social and economic conditions of workers and how are their wages
A: Agricultural work has been necessary for women, because they are unable to sustain their families with the wages of men. The women are involved in planting and harvesting onions. However, there is a great difference in the wages received by men and women. If men receive around Rs. 900 a day in wages, women may only receive half the wage.
The important issue in this village is that they have been landless. And landlessness, caste oppression and economic deprivation, lead to class oppression including low wages.
In this background, in 1979, there was a serious incident of caste violence. Casteist thugs claimed the oppressed caste people had drawn water from their wells and beat them mercilessly.
The oppressed caste people lived in fear, they would say, we work on their land, we live under their trees, we cannot oppose them.
It was with this incident that our Party started working in that village. About twelve youth from that village, with strong anti-caste views, came and spoke to us about their predicament. We talked to them about possible efforts, and that without the support of more people from their village, we cannot do anything; we cannot oppose caste oppression, we cannot gain land, we cannot raise the wages.
When they go for work, they are given bread and tea, but tea is given in coconut shells, or half cut bottles. But the people wont oppose such practices at once. We had to first organise and work with the determined youth, and we advised them to start a community centre. Those youth were convinced,and they formed a youth group and worked with us. The community centre became effective, and was run by both the youth aligned with the Party as well as others in the village.
Q: What kinds of struggles were first taken up in this village
A: At that time, there were about 500 families in that village, and we saw that they needed a path for the village. If a sick person or a pregnant women had to be rushed to the hospital, they had to be carried on footpaths through peoples gardens before reaching a vehicle. We asked the landowners for the path, we also asked government officials, we even called MPs and asked them, but all of them said nothing can be done.
Then we explained the situation to the village people, we drew a possible map for the road. Some people who had a humanitarian consciousness gave us part of the pathway. Then one night about 1,000 people, both men and women, worked all night. We arranged ten tractors of sand, and in one night laid the road, with the people spreading the sand through the lands of landowners.
The next morning the landowners were shocked and created trouble. They called the police. A woman called Sinnamma was arrested and remanded by the police, but then the women in the village got even more involved with a sense of responsibility. Eventually, the landowners could not do anything, we opened the road and named the village Kalaimathy.
The next struggle was to form a co-operative store in the village, because most of the villagers used food coupons, which had to be used in different shops. But the co-operative officials refused to create a co-operative store. Eventually, we approached the GA at that time, Devanesan Nesiah. He said, he can help us create an AD (Government Authorized Dealer) shop. So, we formed an AD shop and the villagers brought all their coupon stamps to this shop. The shop worked around the clock, including to serve the workers who returned home late at night.
The success of the struggle for the road and the co-operative store, gave the people confidence. They began to believe they can achieve anything with the leadership of those youth, the support and direction of the Party, and the unity of the people. That was a major victory for us.
Q: What kind of struggles were there for land And how and when did they gain their housing land in Kalaimathy
A: The people had absolutely no land. Most of the land was owned by a powerful landowning family called Malavarayan. The people who were squatting on their land, even if they gained some savings, and wanted to build even small cement houses, they would not be permitted by the landowners. By the 1990s, the village was mobilised around the land issue, but there were different perspectives on how to approach it. Ultimately, the land deeds were owned by the landowners. So, it was decided that the people would offer to purchase the land. The landowners could also see that the people were organised and they could not be evicted. So, they agreed to sell the land for a small price. The Party suggested a cap of two lachams per family to buy that land, so that all the people in the village could have housing land.
The village had a reputation of high alcoholism and other abusive substances. We tried to direct the village through various activities. We introduced sports in a major way, particularly football and volleyball. We also started adult literacy classes. It is through such daily activities that the village was transformed.
Q: The Communist Party led major anti-caste struggles for temple entry and equal seating in the 1960s and early 1970s. There were struggles in many villages, but anti-caste and progressive mobilisations in many of those villages did not continue. While your party has a base in Puttur, what is the reason for the decline of the Left in the other villages
A: Long before we started working in Puttur, the Communist Party launched the anti-caste campaign in October 1966. Over one thousand people from various villages participated in those struggles. In villages like Changanai, Maduvil, Karavetty, Neliaddi, Alvai, Point Pedro, Manthuvil and Poliyandy, we had people linked to our party. There were about 15 people who died in those struggles that took place between 1966 and 1971. Rising on the strength of those struggles the Party wanted to launch major land struggles, land for the landless and for livelihoods.
But the JVP insurrection of 1971, resulted in tremendous repression of our Party. Many of our leaders were arrested and many of us went into hiding for close to a year. Tamil nationalism was also on the rise in the 1970s, with standardisation and the rise of the Tamil students movement. Next, many backward Tamil nationalists like Amirthalingam, Sivasithambaram and Naganathan lost in the 1970 election.
They in turn put forward the Tamil Eelam call. They wanted to push a narrow ethnic politics and also defeat the Left with such a call. When Tamil youth took up arms, the already militant oppressed caste youth joined the armed groups that were putting forward Leftist slogans. With the open economic policies, many people from the villages also migrated abroad. With the political space shrinking we used the space where we could. Our work in Puttur focused on the needs of the people and to provide our support to the people. The village people also take their important decisions after consulting us.
Q: What kind of solidarity are you expecting from people of other communities and the South
A: We are a Left party and we have connections with other Left parties in the South. We have been informing them about our struggles. Just as we support progressive struggles in other parts of the country, we want them to see this struggle and support it. We want them to bring out this issue and put pressure on the Central Government.
This is a just and democratic struggle. It is not just about one village, but about all those who are oppressed by caste in different forms.
This is about the daily life of people, and the people in this village have supported progressive struggles. When a people like that are struggling, Leftists, people who work with peasants and all progressives, have a far-reaching responsibility to support this struggle.

Changi Airport unveils upcoming Terminal 4
Changi Airport unveiled its soon-to-be-opened Terminal 4 (T4). The terminal presents a new travel experience with its boutique design and innovative use of technology.
T4 will be the first terminal at Changi Airport to offer end-to-end Fast and Seamless Travel (FAST) for departing passengers.
With the extensive use of technology, including facial recognition software, FAST redefines the passenger's travel experience, enhances operational efficiency and raises productivity.
Passengers will enjoy the flexibility of checking in at their own convenience, without having to wait for counters to open. FAST will also yield productivity gains with manpower savings of about 20% expected in the longer term, when operations have stabilised.
T4 has a total floor area of 225,000 square metres including the two-storey terminal, car parks and taxi deck. The project was completed after three years of construction. Although just half the size of Terminal 3 (T3), the planners and designers of T4 have managed to deliver a terminal that will have a capacity of 16 million passenger movements a year, two-thirds that of T3.
T4's design theme is fun, vibrant and positively surprising. There is a sense of space - a hallmark of Changi Airport - brought about by a high ceiling and height limits for equipment and machines. The terminal's showpiece is a Central Galleria (300m long x 18m wide x 23m high) which separates the public zone from the transit area.
Due to its compact size, T4 will have centralised areas for departure and arrival immigration as well as pre-board security screening. This provides for more optimised deployment of manpower and equipment.
Nine airlines will operate at T4 - the Air Asia Group (of four airlines), Cathay Pacific, Cebu Pacific, Korean Air, Spring Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Together, they serve an estimated eight million passengers at Changi Airport each year.
Two lounges - Cathay Pacific's First and Business Class Lounge and SATS PPG Blossom Lounge, a pay-per-use lounge managed by SATS and Plaza Premium - are located at level 2M within the transit area.
With T4, the total handling capacity of Changi Airport will be raised to 82 million passengers per annum. There will thus be more capacity at Changi's terminals to support the growth plans of all airlines.

In this thought-provoking and informative article, the writer has adroitly juxtaposed the nudity of the modern fraudulent generation of politicians and the genuine politicians who did not have a single cent in general parlance in their bank accounts at their demise. In addition to that they didnt depend on peoples money to run their vehicles. They worked from their homes without getting any residence allowance. Therefore they didnt want to waste their time at police stations or at this junction and at that junction to fast unto death munching lemon puff.
Fr Augustine has traced the history of other countries in the region who gained Independence with us and how they have surpassed us in economic development. Where have the advisers gone Not only the past regime but also the present one is said to have an array of veteran advisers to preach the rulers on how to take decisions. Yet the country seems rudderless.
I think a Simple Simon at the village tea-kiosk could give some good advice to the government on these matters that the rulers go wrong. The general public have to pay them for the ill advice they give. The government is accountable to the voter. So, the government is duty-bound to publish the names of these advisers to the public. According to the writer the Dharmadweepa is getting politically, socially and culturally demoralized.
The oratory skills of the uneducated thuggish politicians have ruined the country. Religious harmony of the country is badly eroded by them. All the efforts of burning the racial flame is for mere political power. Unimaginable privileges and perks doled out to them have made them greedier for power. Avarice for money is their ruin. Swindling public property is the name of the game. Politicians have lackluster characters.
Their image before the public is grim. The writer cites the whole system as rotten. It is correct to the last syllable. The uncertain future on the horizon develops an apprehensive mood among the general public. The million dollar question is that why the government does not seem to seek advice from the veteran writers whose thinking is pragmatic.
I duly endorse the writers voice to reject vagabond capitalism, derelict totalitarian ideological regimentation and the crooked socialism of the old red brigade. Voice for freedom ought to be upheld at any cost.

Commission says well aware of MPs privileges
Ravi K to appear before Bond Commission on August 2:
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake failed to appear before the Treasury Bond Commission for the second time yesterday. His lawyer said that he was summoned for a Security Council meeting, called for by the President.
Following the absence which resulted in back and forth dialogue between the Commission and Karunanayakes lawyer, the Commission said that Minister Karunanayake must appear before the Commission on August 2, 2017 to give evidence.
Chairman K.T. Chitrasiri pointed out to Karunanayakes lawyer that the Commission is taking measures to accommodate his clients commitments. He said that in return Minister Karunanayake should also be considerate of the demanding time frame within which the Commission has to work.
The PCoI initially issued a notice on last Saturday (22) summoning Minister Karunanayake to appear before the Commission on Tuesday (25). However, a lawyer representing Minister Karunanayake informed the PCoI on Monday (24) that his client is unable to comply with the notice due to pre-arranged official commitments.
Thereafter Minister Karunanayake was summoned before the Treasury Bond Commission following evidence led on a Penthouse which was rented by the Perpetual Treasuries former CEO Arjun Aloysius for eight months on behalf of Minister Karunanayakes family, spending around to Rs. 10 million for the lease.
Subsequently to Minister Karunanayakes absence the Commission did not sit on Tuesday (25) since no other witnesses were lined up for the same day. The PCoI re-issued the summoning notice to Minister Karunanayake on Tuesday (25) for Karunanayake to appear before the Commission on yesterday (26).
At the Commission yesterday, with respectively a larger gathering of lawyers, journalists and the public present to witness the proceeding, the Commissioners Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri, Justice P.S. Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General V. Kandaswamy commenced the hearing as usual in the morning at 10.00 a.m. Minister Karunanayakes lawyer Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsakularatne accompanied by his panel including lawyers Namal Karunaratne, Shyamindri Arsakularatne and Thilina Gunatilake then marked their appearance before the Commission.
Arsakularatne PC then rose to inform the PCoI that his client, Minister Ravi Karunanayake is unable appear before the Commission since he has been summoned by the President Maithripala Sirisena to attend a Security Council meeting held on the same day morning. Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri after paying attention to the submissions, pointed out that the Commission is well aware of the privileges in the parliament and said the Commission is not going to call Karunanayake on the days that the parliament is sitting.
Chairman Justice Chitrasiri then asked Arsakularatne PC if Karunanayake is able to appear before the Commission on Saturday (29). Arsakularatne PC said he did not receive instructions regarding the weekends.
While pointing out the reason for summoning Minister Karunanayake, Chairman Justice Chitrasiri told Arsakularatne that the Commission is trying to find out the truth and ascertain the facts (regarding the evidence led) and him not being here when he is summoned, we cannot make a decision.
Karunanayakes lawyer repeated his clients difficulties when Justice P.S. Jayawardena pointed out the time frame within which the Commission is operating.
We have summoned your client on one day and then we were told that he cannot attend. We asked him to come today and today parliament is not sitting in the morning. Justice Jayawardena said. Arsakularatne PC again pointed out Minister Karunanayake was attending the Security Council Meeting in the morning. Minister Karunanayakes lawyer assured that his client will appear before the Commission on the fixed date and said that Minister Karunanayake is very much willing to come to the Commission to give evidence if it were not for his official commitments which include parliament sessions, a cabinet meeting on next Tuesday and an official visit to Maldives on next Monday.
Justice Jayawardena said Minister Karunanayake must not be absent again on August 2 and added a comment saying That is that.
Arsakularatne PC assured the Commission that Minister Karunanayake is available on August 2,2017. Following the absence of Minister Karunanayake the PCoI adjourned early. Prior to adjourning Chairman Chitrasiri asked Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera if the AGs panel could lead evidence with Central Bank Assistant Governor R.A. Jayalath who is the next witness to be summoned before the Commission.
SASG De Livera said they are not ready to lead evidence out of schedule. He pointed out the AGs panel is working round the clock in order to lead comprehensive evidence so that they cannot rush the investigations or the preparations to leading evidence.
While pointing out that the AGs panel has been fully committed in assisting the Commission, De Livera said the mandate of the AG is to investigate and present evidence. We are expected to investigate and for that we need time. De Livera also said that the summoned witnesses should come and give evidence so that investigations could be executed on new information as well.
While expressing his confidence that AGs panel will be able to lead evidence with AG Jayalath on Friday (28), Justice Jayawardena told de Livera to make no stone is left unturned before the conclusion of evidence led by the Attorney General.

Courts reject SLT`s application to prevent Dialogs fibre network expansion
The District Court of Colombo on 24th July, 2017 refused the applications for Enjoining Orders sought by Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) against Dialog Axiata PLC (DAP). SLT had instituted proceedings against DAP on 05th June, 2017 seeking to restrain DAP from providing any Fixed Telecommunication Services including Gigabit Passive Optical Networks (GPON) Active Solutions operations.
Whilst SLT sought to obtain ex parte Enjoining Orders, DAP lodged an appearance and brought to the notice of Court that SLT had erred in instituting proceedings against the wrong party and misrepresented facts to Court by stating that DAP was not entitled to provide or be engaged in GPON Active Solutions operations, when in fact, it was Dialog Broadband Networks (Private) Ltd (Dialog Broadband), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DAP, that was entitled to and engaged in GPON Active Solutions operations, under the license issued to Dialog Broadband.
Accordingly, the case has no impact whatsoever on the GPON-based Fibre Solutions provided by Dialog Broadband. The action by SLT against DAP to block the lawful provision of GPON Solutions by DBN is monopolistic and anti-competitive, suppressing choice and competition in the provision of the said services.
Dialog Broadband has over the past years made large scale investments in cutting edge high speed broadband and other digital infrastructures totaling to over USD 425 Million (over LKR 48,000 Billion). The coming to fruition of these investments including without limitation the rapid expansion of its fibre network, connection to the 100G-Plus Bay of Bengal Gateway submarine fibre cable, and the launch of the countrys first-ever Tier-III certified data centre, has introduced an all new dimension of competition and choice to end-users within Sri Lankas broadband market.
Meanwhile, Dialog Broadband, which is duly licensed by the TRCSL to provide fixed telecommunication services as well as Integrated Transmission services using Fibre Optic or Radio technologies including without limitation GPON-based Active Transmission Solutions filed action against SLT in the District Court of Colombo to restrain SLT from disrupting, undermining, interfering or obstructing in the supply and installation of GPON-based Active Solutions.
DAP further stated to Court that the SLTs case is wrongly constituted and premised upon confidential information belonging to Dialog Broadband namely confidential Request for Proposal, which SLT had unlawfully and wrongfully obtained.
The confidential information of Dialog Broadband comprised of comprehensive Network Architecture and Service Delivery Architecture design specifications amongst other confidential information of Dialog Broadband and as such kept secret due to its enormous commercial value.
In this regard, Dialog Broadband has already instituted action against SLT in the Commercial High Court bearing No. HC (Civil): 23/2017/IP for wrongfully and unlawfully acquiring confidential information belonging to Dialog Broadband and the Court has ordered SLT to disclose the source / person from whom SLT had acquired the confidential information of Dialog Broadband and to show cause as to why the interim injunction restraining SLT from using the confidential information contained in the Request for Proposals should not be granted.
In the present case, after hearing submissions of Counsel for the Plaintiff - SLT and Defendant - DAP, Honourable Amali Ranaweera - Additional District Judge, Colombo, reserved Order which was thereafter delivered on 24th July, 2017 rejecting the enjoining orders sought by SLT.
S.A Parathalingam, President`s Counsel appeared with Chanaka de Silva instructed by G.G Arulpragasam for the Plaintiff, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC.
K. Kanag-Isvaran, President`s Counsel, appeared with Avindra Rodrigo, L. Jeyakumar and Nimesha de Silva for the Defendant, Dialog Axiata PLC.

Etihad Airways reports net loss for 2016
Etihad Airways recently announced its 2016 financial results, recording a net loss of US$ 1.87 billion on US$ 8.36 billion in revenues as one-off impairment charges and fuel hedging losses weighed against a solid performance of the core airline.
The core airline business achieved steady passenger revenues of US$ 4.9 billion and 79% load factors while carrying a record 18.5 million passengers.
Available seat kilometres (ASKs) increased by 9% to 113.9 billion. Yields fell 8% amid market capacity pressures and the tough global economic climate, but this was partially offset by an 11% reduction in unit costs.
Total impairments of US$ 1.9 billion included a US$ 1.06 billion charge on aircraft, reflecting lower market values and the early phase out of certain aircraft types. There was also a US$ 808 million charge on certain assets and financial exposures to equity partners, mainly related to Alitalia and airberlin.
Legacy fuel hedging contracts also had a negative bearing on performance in 2016, though this exposure is expected to have less of a financial impact during 2017.
A slowdown in the cargo market put increased pressure on cargo revenues and yields, and the airline saw a slight improvement in freight carried at 595,519 tonnes for the 12-month period.
Mohamed Mubarak Fadhel Al Mazrouei, Chairman of the Board of the Etihad Aviation Group, said: A culmination of factors contributed to the disappointing results for 2016. The Board and executive team have been working since last year to address the issues and challenges through a comprehensive strategic review aimed at driving improved performance across the group, which includes a full review of our airline equity partnership strategy.
The record passenger numbers in 2016 affirm Etihads role as a significant economic enabler for Abu Dhabi, and our airline business continues to support Abu Dhabis vision to develop tourism, grow commerce and strengthen links to key regional and international markets.
Ray Gammell, Interim Group Chief Executive Officer, explained: We are focused on maintaining the solid performance of our core airline business - operationally and financially - even amid difficult market headwinds. At the same time, we continue to implement changes across the group as part of the comprehensive strategic review, with a focus on improving revenues and reducing costs.
During 2016, the airline commenced a Right Size and Shape programme that generated total overhead savings of 4% through headcount reductions and other measures by the end of the year, even as capacity and total passenger number increased.
This year is just as challenging for the global aviation industry and the ever-evolving competitive environment is likely to impact overall performance in 2017. However, our airline business remains strong and class-leading, and as an aviation group, we are in a stronger position.
Peter Baumgartner, Chief Executive Officer of Etihad Airways, added: We are in an industry characterised by overcapacity, declining market sizes on key routes, and changing customer behaviour as a weak global economy affects spending appetite.
"Our answer to these challenges is innovation and reinvention, and this gives Etihad Airways a competitive edge as we seek to leverage opportunities offered to us by a changing environment."

Ex All Ceylon captain and chief selector comments
I had the privilege of meeting Dhanasiri Weerasinghe ex-All Ceylon captain and chief selector at his residence in Camberwell Melbourne.
He is of the view that there is no dearth of talent in the island but insists that harnessing that talent, through the proper channels is not that easy. Weerasinghe, points out that in his days (I can remember as a young fan of his, how he became the schoolboy cricketer, laying his first brick to a wonderful cricket career).
Weerasinghe recollects how the late F.C. de Saram tried to persuade him to join the SSC by sending the then owner of Bogala Mines, a good friend of his father, to meet his father but, that attempt failed because Dhanasiri wanted to play for his home side Panadura Sports Club in the Daily News Trophy. He says that the structure to reach to the top was in three tiers. A good schoolboy cricketer would first enter The Daily News trophy tournament and then go on to play for the Donovan Andree. And if good enough will graduate to the Sara Trophy, which was the plum.
After playing for Panadura in the The Daily News Trophy for one season, and scoring two centuries and one ninety, he decided to join the Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club to play in the Sara Trophy tournament. During the same period A.C.M Lafir who excelled as a batsman at St Anthonys Kandy Joined Kandy Sports Club and played in the Daily News Trophy tournament and also got two centuries and a ninety and walked straight into the All Ceylon team. Dhanasiri was modest enough to state that Lafir was the better of the two.
He also stresses that the talented school cricketers from outstations like Kandy, Kurunegala, Jaffna, Dambulla, Galle, Matara, etc should have well equipped cricket clubs to go to rather than uprooting themselves and coming all the way to Colombo where the competition is high.
A good example is Asela Gunaratne; he had to wait till he was 31 years to wend his way into the Sri Lanka team. If there was a top level club in Kandy, he would have joined that club and shone much earlier. One wonders how many Asela Gunaratnes are perishing around the country. Another interesting point is have we got any cricket scouts to spot talent around the country I bet India has. I personally think that the only other club apart from the Colombo who are feeding the Sri Lanka pool is Ragama Cricket Club. I am sure that club is under capable hands.
It really is a pity that Sri Lankan cricket is in the doldrums now, e.g. the visiting Indian team is making mince meat out of them. The Indians walked all over them because the Sri Lankan team behaved like a rudderless ship without a proper captain. Again I quote once a team takes the field it is their business to perform well, forget about the higher ups, support staff and the selectors.
Getting back to the interview proper, during Dhanasiris tenure as the Ananda College cricket captain, they were the champion school in 1955, that team was star studded, with players of the calibre of Nimal Thammita, Palitha Premasiri, Mahinda Jayasinghe, A.P. Jayasinghe and Sarath Wijesinghe ably guided by the master cricketer Dhanasiri Weerasinghe.

Feel humble, hear the jungle
As the beam of autumn strikes China, this garden will attract a magnificent influx of tourists both Chinese and foreign.
For Sri Lankans, this garden with its interesting as well as the questionable name, it will hark them back to Brief Garden
(which belonged to Bevis Bawa, brother of Geoffrey Bawa).
What is the destiny of politicians and administrators when they are caught red-handed for corruption and administrative failure They would carefully close the door behind them, and let the public forget that much clichd phrase. In this land, politicians have never been heard of being humbled nor forced to eating the idiomatic pie. And so it is that both humble and administrator run only parallel tracks never to converge into one path.
In Wang Xiancheng, however, we hear a different tale.
Following his appointment as an Imperial Envoy, Xiancheng had to tread a rough terrain. His career, though illustrious, was full of demotions as well as promotions. In the end, he had to call it a day as a result of being accused of corruption. Luckily he planned his retirement while still being an administrator. He chose a marshy land with a Taoist temple on it to create his garden in 1513. He left the door open to his painter friend, Zhengming to syringe an artistic touch to the garden.
Xianchengs classical reading inspired him to name the garden accordingly. He was enamoured by Pan Yues lines in An Idle Life: I enjoy a carefree life by planting trees and building my own house...I irrigate my garden and grow vegetables for me to eat...such a life suits a retired official like me well.
That points us to the inner creature in Wang Xiancheng and his passion for living a humbled life without caring much about the bureaucratic lifestyle. And the name of the garden arrived at Xianchengs doorstep: The Humble Administrators Garden.
For those familiar with Vikram Seth, this is no poetry collection. Yet, as you step into this landscape, you will hear the poetry of jungle from all corners. It is simply a miracle to witness the work of one man who lived only a few centuries ago. And that offers us a sweet reminder: administrators can afford to be humble too.
As the beam of autumn strikes China, this garden will attract a magnificent influx of tourists both Chinese and foreign. For Sri Lankans, this garden with its interesting as well as the questionable name, it will hark them back to Brief Garden (which belonged to Bevis Bawa, brother of Geoffrey Bawa).
The gardens name is interesting because of the over-pervading peacefulness. And the name is open to question with its acreage of 13, and being the largest garden in Suzhou. The 13-acre garden should be more than a humble mans work. But it can essentially be a work of an administrator.
Despite huge crowds thronging on a Saturday, peacefulness exists quite much in the garden. The Chinese guide, John, enlightened a South Asian delegation how everything in this garden is designed according to the feng shui.
The beauty of the season is very much present in this area. Although windy and chilly, you will really enjoy being here. After 4 pm, the atmosphere gets a bit cooler.
The walkers in the garden have three parts to explore. First, it is the central part known as Zhuozheng Yuan. Second, the eastern part once called Guitianyuanju (Dwelling Upon Return to the Countryside). And third, a western part formally is known as the Supplementary Garden. The structures are grouped around a labyrinthine lake, rather like a Chinese water village. The Hall of Distant Fragrance is on the south shore of the lake and looks to an island with the Pavilion of Fragrant Snow.
Although the garden was much simpler in the past, today, it is home to a variety of pavilions and trees.
Like in any generation, Wangs next generation lost the control of this lovely estate. Drowned in gambling debts, his son had to disown the garden which was to be followed by many owners afterwards.
The Humble Administrators Garden continues to charm a huge gathering with its exclusive designs, delicate beauty and the serene atmosphere. That could probably be one of the foremost reasons why the UNESCO has declared the garden as a World Heritage Site.
The visitors enter a lost estate with its numerous pavilions, bridges, pathways, ponds and small forest areas. The pavilions await the romance with many couples  whether they are long-time married, newly-married, about-to-get married or budding relationships  occupying for a short while. The bridges are the raised platform upon which you can see afar and capture yourself on a selfie against the iridescent skies. The pathways are ready to welcome you to feel calmer with a soft meditative walk. Take a little break by the ponds and listen to the consistent hiss of mini waterfalls. And breathe in the silence reigning on the small forest areas.
Once you enter this garden, everything seems to move as though in a dream. Walk on, without a hurry, and fill your soul with this song of the jungle.
Built in 1509 during the Ming Dynasty, Humble Administrators Garden is the largest and most renowned classical landscape garden in Suzhou, covering an area of 5.6 hectares (13.8 acres). Suzhou is located approximately 62 miles (100 km) west of Shanghai, and the two cities are connected by high-speed train. The garden is open 7:30 am to 5:30 pm daily from March to November, and 7:30 am to 5 pm daily mid-November to February.

Fitch affirms Sierra Cables at BB+(lka), outlook stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based cable manufacturer Sierra Cables PLCs (Sierra) ational Long-Term Rating at BB+(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
Sierras rating reflects its exposure to cyclical end-markets such as infrastructure and construction and investments in international markets where the company has yet to establish itself.
These risks are counterbalanced to an extent by its growing domestic market share and stable EBITDA margins.
Consequently, Sierras revenue growth has been volatile, which is reflected in its rating.
The domestic construction sector started recovering from late 2016 on the resumption of projects that were halted in 2015/16, helping Sierra to increase its local cable revenue by 21% yoy in FY17 compared with a decline in FY16.

Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lankas Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLCs National Long-Term Rating to A+(lka) from AA-(lka). The Outlook is Negative. The agency has also downgraded the National Long-Term Rating on Lions outstanding senior unsecured debentures to A+(lka) from AA-(lka).
The downgrade reflects Fitchs expectations that Lions net leverage, defined as lease-adjusted debt net of cash, operating EBITDAR, is unlikely to fall below 2.0x over the next three years due to lower beer sales from the higher taxes imposed over the last 18 months.
We do not expect Lions EBITDA to recover to historical levels over the same period. The negative outlook reflects the potential for further downgrades should Lions sales volume not recover enough in the next 18 months to reduce leverage to less than 3x.

Prior to this project, the re-settled families in the Kattumurivu Village faced severe hardship in collecting water for drinking and sanitation,as the available well water was not drinkable due to itshigh salinity.
5,000 litre overhead tank where rain water is mixed with ground water to reduce the ground water salinity levels to make it suitable for human consumption.
To overcome this situation, the Kattumurivu rural water supply CSR initiative undertook the installation of a rainwater harvesting scheme, a well to collect ground water and a single storage tank holding 5,000 litres to blend water from the well with rain water. Five distribution tanks with community taps were strategically located throughout the village guaranteeing each family has access to ten litres of clean water per day.
Thecompleted project has been vested in the Kattumurivu village community directly benefiting all 223 families, amidst the presence of all stakeholders.
We are proud to complete this innovative project in partnership with World Vision, said Chamath Tennekoon, Chief Executive Officer, Future Automobiles. This is one of many ways of how rural communities can benefit from many stakeholders joining forces, working tirelessly together including the Divisional Secretary, the Pradeshiya Sabha, with collaboration of the Water Board, contributing their expertise to make a real difference in peoples lives.
Commenting on its role, Dr. Dhanan Senathirajah, WVL National Director, added, World Vision Lanka is committed to serve the most vulnerable communities in Sri Lanka. We are extremely grateful to Ford in partnering with us to bring clean water to one of the poorest communities in Vaharai. We will continue to build on this partnership to work together for the wellbeing of children.
In order to develop a more effective and sustainablesolution towards the perennial problem of water scarcity in the area and provide uninterrupted access to clean water, thesecond stage of the project is also being planned.
This phase envisages the diversion of the Kattumurivuriver to provide individual household water connections to these families.For the past few years, Ford has contributed to several local projects in Sri Lankaincluding raising communities awareness on sustainable farming and water savingmethod through an agricultural livelihood project in Kilinochchi and providingprevention measures to minimize damage caused by forest fires in the southern border of the Knuckles Forest Reserve in the central highlands of Sri Lanka.

Gnanasara Thera Case: Prosecution  concludes giving evidence

The Court of Appeal hearing the contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behavior inside the Homagama Magistrates Court today concluded recording evidence from prosecution witnesses.
When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, Attorney-at-law Upul Kumarapperuma and the registrar of Homagama Magistrate's court gave evidence.
Former Homage Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is now serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate and Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris had also given evidence in this regard.
Further inquiry fixed for September 21.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General. President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnanasara Thera.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behavior and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges leveled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.

Htota deal  boosts investor  confidence: Moodys
Sri Lankas economic prospects improve
The Governments billion-dollar partnership with China to revive the loss-making Hambantota port will be credit positive for Sri Lanka and bolster investor confidence, an international ratings agency said yesterday.
Moodys ratings agency said the 1.12 billion dollar transaction will boost Sri Lankas foreign exchange reserves and ease the governments external liquidity position ahead of several large bond repayments between 2019 and 2022.
Earnings from the Hambantota port stake sale will feed into the central banks foreign-exchange reserves, which will help bolster investor confidence and encourage future portfolio inflows, Moodys said in a report on Saturdays deal.
The government sealed the deal with China Merchants Port Holdings to jointly run the Hambantota port which had accumulated a loss of 46.7 billion rupees since 2011.
The port was also bleeding another 9,100 million rupees annually to service its foreign debt to China.
The previous government had borrowed 1.5 billion dollars to build the port which the Chinese valued at 1.4 billion raising questions about huge kickbacks during the construction.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced last week that he managed to secure a deal with China to take away the debt burden and also ensuring security concerns were fully addressed.
Sri Lankas Navy will be in charge of security at the port while the agreement with China Merchants will be in line with Sri Lankan law.
The Prime Minister said he also expected China Merchants to invest in excess of 300 million dollars initially on improving the Hambantota port.
Development of the broader Hambantota port area will help bring in foreign direct investment, especially from China, Moodys noted.
The buildup of associated infrastructure surrounding the port can also help attract greater private-sector investments, it added.
This, together with other ongoing development projects such as the Western Region Megapolis Plan and Colombo Financial City Project, will provide a stable source of financing for Sri Lankas external position and support economic growth.
Closure of the long-pending deal also will allow the government to focus on key priorities, including advancing economic and structural reforms under its IMF program, the international rating agency noted.
It noted that the transfer of a 70 percent stake in the port on a 99 year lease will allow the government to set aside earnings to repay its upcoming debt maturities and reduce its external debt, a key constraint on Sri Lankas credit quality.
External debt maturities in 2019-22 total 13.8 billion dollars, it said underscoring the huge debt burden passed onto the new administration which had borrowed from abroad at high rates during Mahinda Rajapaksas decade in power.
Economic challenges would remain for the elevated government debt and the need to borrow more.
We expect the central bank to come close to its target, which would help support the sovereigns credit quality, Moodys said.
Moving forward, greater exchange-rate flexibility and more limited foreign-exchange interventions by the central bank would help preserve reserves, Moodys said.
It expected Sri Lankas external vulnerability indicator, which measures the ratio of external debt payments that are due over the next year to foreign-exchange reserves, to rise to about 183 percent in 2017 from around 150 percent in 2016. Moving forward, greater exchange-rate flexibility and more limited foreign-exchange interventions by the central bank would help preserve reserves, it added.

HBO hacked: Upcoming episodes, Game of Thrones data leaked online

HBO has joined the ranks of Hollywood entertainment companies to suffer a major cyber attack.
EW has learned that upcoming episodes of a couple series and at least one apparent script have been put online by hackers who breached the companys systems  with more threatened to be coming soon.
HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the compromise of proprietary information, the network confirmed in a statement. We immediately began investigating the incident and are workingwith law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms. Data protection is a top priority at HBO, and we take seriously our responsibility to protect the data we hold.
Hackers claimed to have obtained 1.5 terabytes of data from the company. So far, an upcoming episode ofBallersandRoom 104have apparently been put online. There is also written material thats allegedly from next weeks fourth episodeof Game of Thrones. More is promised to be coming soon. HBO is not commenting on what content might have been stolen or confirming specific titles.
This morning, HBO chairman and CEO Richard Plepler sent an email to HBO employees alerting them of the breach.
As most of you have probably heard by now, there has been a cyber incident directed at the company which has resulted in some stolen proprietary information, including some of our programming, he wrote. Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling, and disturbing for all of us. I can assure you that senior leadership and our extraordinary technology team, along with outside experts, are working round the clock to protect our collective interests. The efforts across multiple departments have been nothing short of herculean. It is a textbook example of quintessential HBO teamwork. The problem before us is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a part of. As has been the case with any challenge we have ever faced, I have absolutely no doubt that we will navigate our way through this successfully.
On Sunday, an anonymous email was sent to many reporters announcing the hack: Hi to all mankind. The greatest leak of cyber space era is happening. Whats its name Oh I forget to tell. Its HBO and Game of Thrones!!!!!! You are lucky to be the first pioneers to witness and download the leak. Enjoy it & spread the words. Whoever spreads well, we will have an interview with him. HBO is falling.
Its not clear if the hackers have what would be the crown jewel target for an HBO cyber breach  upcoming episodes of the companys biggest hit,Game of Thrones. So far, noGoTepisodes have leaked.
In April, a hacker penetrated Netflix to release episodes from season 5 ofOrange Is the New Blackahead of its summer return. And in May, a hacker claimed to have stolenPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, but Disney chief Bob Iger later said the threat was a hoax. The biggest Hollywood hack victim was Sony in 2014, where approximately 100 terabytes of data was uploaded online.
For years, HBO has fought a cyber-battle to keepGame of Thronesstorylines secret and the shows content from being illegally distributed  particularly before episodes air. In season 5, the first four episodes leaked online before the shows season premiere after review DVDs that were sent to the press and industry insiders. HBO has since halted the practice of sending any episodes in advance. That same year, some clips leaked ahead of time from overseas HBO distributors, and even images of Jon Snows death found their way online before the finale aired. Just a couple weeks ago, aThronestrailer to be screened at Comic-Con leaked onto YouTube in advance of its release.

Iglesias has yet to introduce girlfriend to his father
Enrique Iglesias has yet to introduce longtime girlfriend Anna Kournikova to his father Julio Iglesias - despite being with her for 16 years.
In 2014, Julio revealed that while his wife and children have met the former tennis ace, he himself had not, and now son Enrique has admitted the situation still hasn't changed three years later.
"They still haven't met, no. They have to meet at some point," he said, according to The Sun newspaper, adding that Anna and his father have rarely been in the same country at the same time.
The 42-year-old has been dating Anna on and off since 2001, after they played lovers in the music video for single Escape. They have been dogged by marriage rumours, especially in 2011 when Enrique referred to Anna, 36, as his "wife" during a concert and again last year (16) when she was spotted wearing a gold band on her ring finger.
However, he has insisted once again that they have no plans to tie the knot.
"We're just as happy. There comes a point when you've been with someone for a certain amount of time that I believe that you are like, married," he insisted. "I guess the only difference is that we haven't walked down the aisle."
Enrique is currently promoting the remix of his song Subeme La Radio, which features Sean Paul and Matt Terry, the winner of Britain's The X Factor in 2016, and he told Britain's Daily Star newspaper he had no problem working with a singer who found fame on a TV talent show."It's tough to be an artist and get signed to a record company these days," he explained. "To me, whether you get signed because you are on X Factor or because you walk into the Sony building, it's not any different."
Matt spent time living in Spain and can speak Spanish, and Enrique has praised his singing on the track, saying, "When I heard Matt sing in Spanish its crazy. You wouldn't know he was English. He doesn't have an accent." Music News

Isner wins fourth ATP Atlanta title
WASHINGTON: John Isner claimed his fourth ATP Atlanta title on Sunday, saving a set-point in both sets en route to a 7-6 (8/6), 7-6 (9/7) win over Ryan Harrison. 
Second-seeded American Isner notched his second ATP title in as many weeks afer lifting the trophy in Newport last week. 
Atlanta was the perfect place for him to keep the momentum going. Isner, who has reached the final in seven of eight editions of the tournament, added a fourth title to those he won in 2013, 2014 and 2015. 
Harrison, seeded fourth, was denied a second career ATP title, to go with his victory in Memphis in February. 
There wasnt much that separated us at all, Isner said. So Im happy to win that match in straight sets ... very happy to win today.
Both players held serve throughout the opening set to force the tiebreaker, in which Isner faced a set-point at 5-6 but saved it with a booming serve. 
He then converted a set-point of his own at 7-6 with a forehand winner. 
Harrison ended Isners run of 75 straight service holds -- dating back to last weeks Newport tournament -- when he broke for a 2-0 lead in the second set. 
But Isner broke back immediately, and they held serve to another tiebreaker. AFP

Lady Macbeth : Chilling subversion of a classic
The title sets the stage for the action that is to follow. In William Shakespeares widely read tragic play Lady Macbeth spearheads the action, leading Macbeth to doom as he kills King Duncan and well as Banquo.
The reason for the killings is her lust for power and position. However her soul is not laid to rest as she has nightmares and we finally hear of her suicide towards curtain call. Similar action follows in William Oldroyds Lady Macbeth. The setting is rural England in 1865. The young Katherine leads a loveless marriage to a bitter man twice her age. Her father in law, Boris, is cold and unforgiving. His evil nature is such that she has to be forcefully kept awake one night till her husband, Alexander, comes to bed after a late night meeting.
One day both Alexander and Boris are called away on business matters. This spells freedom for Katherine. She ventures out into the wilderness, eager to explore her surroundings. The picture of her with her hair loose and scampering out into the woods reminds us of Emily Bronthes Katherine in Wuthering Heights.
Katherine soon encounters Sebastian who captures her interst. She embarks on a passionate affair with the young worker on her husbands estate. With this affair a force is unleashed inside her. It is so powerful that she will stop at nothing to get what she wants.
Similar to Shakespeares character, Katherine too will stoop to murder to keep Sebastian by her side. Her first victim is Boris whom she poisons over dinner. This first scene of murder - how cold bloodedly she kills him, having locked him in the next room and listens him choking to death while she makes small talk with her maid, Anna, freezes our blood. Alexander is next as she drives him into a rage by openly flaunting her affair before him. When a fight breaks out Katherine beats Alexander to death with a stick. The two bury him and kills off his horse to erase the evidence of his return. As soon as we think that things are finally settled for the lovers Teddy enters their lives.
The little boy is brought to the manor by a woman saying that he is Alexanders offspring. Though she had her doubts at first Katherine is forced to provide shelter for the pair as they are in possession of legal documents to prove their story. Thus Sebastian once again has to be in hiding. This not only frustrates the lovers but it is also a humiliating factor for Sebastian who has been behaving like the lord of the manor till Teddy and his guardian showed up. Katherine also discovers that she is with child.
One day Teddy goes missing and is rescued by Sebastian as he is found at the edge of a waterfall. However Sebastian secretly admits to Katherine that he considered pushing in over the edge. They argue and desperate to please her lover Katherine pledges to do anything he wants. The duo smother the young lad with a pillow while he is asleep. This is the height of the horror which finally breaks Sebastian and he confesses to their crimes. However Katherine accuses him of plotting it all with Anna and the two are taken away.
Much of the films allure comes from its central, powerhouse performance from Florence Pugh. At 21 years she shows that she is more than a mere pretty face and dishes out a performance which is worthy of an Oscar. She is backed by some great acting by Christopher Fairbank, Paul Hilton, Naomi Ackie and Cosmo Jarvis.
The camera angles and presentations is brilliant as well. The fast moving pace of the story does not bore the viewers. This is movie making at its best and Oldroyd shows his brilliance in a simple yet moving manner through his masterpiece.
Lady Macbeth may be a dark and gloomy drama, but it is also a refreshing and tasteful period piece. You cannot stop grazing at its beauty although you would rather turn a blind eye on its cruelty.

LAUGFS identifying emerging market trends, leveraging expertise
Though there are several Sri Lankan brands which have made it to the global arena, only a few companies have been able to thrive with their operations overseas. LAUGFS is one such Sri Lankan brand which had stamped their footprint successfully in a number of countries. With an annual turnover of over Rs. 28 billion and a workforce of 4,000, the company has diversified aggressively with businesses currently in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and UAE.
In a mere two decades we have been able to firmly imprint the LAUGFS name not only in Sri Lanka, but also across the region, touching the everyday lives of millions, remarked LAUGFSs Group Managing Director, Thilak De Silva. He recalled how the company started its journey in 1995 with the revolutionary auto gas conversion business - Gas Auto Lanka. LAUGFS has since expanded rapidly into over 20 industries covering power and energy, industrial, services, consumer retail, leisure, logistics and property sectors.
LAUGFS has been strengthening its presence in the power and energy sector within the region with a number of ventures. The LAUGFS LPG Import & Export Terminal, which is currently under construction, is one such project, which it believes will help positon Sri Lanka as an energy hub, by taking advantage of its strategic geographic location in the Indian Ocean. In 2015, LAUGFS entered Bangladesh, becoming one of the largest LPG downstream players in the country. Last year, the company also set up its energy trading arm with SLOGAL Energy DMCC, which is based in Dubai.
Commissioning Sri Lankas largest solar power project, setting up our maritime logistics arm and expanding our LPG vessel fleet, as well as expanding our LPG operations to Bangladesh and becoming the first Sri Lankan energy brand to become a multinational are some of our great achievements, Thilak De Silva commented. As a Sri Lankan conglomerate, we are proud of what we have achieved within a very short span of time.
In addition, LAUGFS has also now ventured into Health Care & Wellness Sector. LAUGFS Pharmaceutical is setting up Sri Lankas largest pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, with a massive investment in excess of USD 30 million. Our LAUGFS Wellness is a distributor of international Wellness products and also operates our own Pharmacy chain. We also have plans to go into the online Pharmacy platform in the near future, he remarked.
These efforts also won both local and global accolades for LAUGFS, with Chairman W. K. H. Wegapitiya and the Group Managing Director Thilak De Silva being presented with a haul of awards. We have a philosophy to not compromise anything less than perfection in whatever we do. Our continuous focus is on delivering value to our stakeholders, Thilak De Silva said.
Q: How did you get involved with LAUGFS
A: After I came back from England having completed my studies, I joined our family business and was involved in that for several years. Then in 1995, I got the opportunity to be part of a pioneering venture in auto gas conversion, which became the inception of LAUGFS. What started that day with just a few people, has today become a diversified conglomerate with over 20 businesses in Sri Lanka and overseas, employing over 4,000.
Q: Given the current market and economic conditions, where do you see the country within the next 10 years
A: Sri Lanka is on its way to becoming a middle income country. World power is shifting to countries like India and China and we are geographically very well centred to cater to the market demands of these economies and the country needs to rapidly gear up for this.
I see Sri Lanka becoming a service hub in South Asia, and as a Sri Lankan conglomerate, we have also identified these strategic opportunities and have made investments for future growth. Our LPG Import & Export Terminal in Hambantota is one such example.
Q: As a company with local roots and expanding beyond borders, what is your vision for the country and its people
A: We believe that Sri Lanka has the resources to compete effectively on a global platform. Sri Lanka has a vibrant and diverse culture and strong values and ideals. We have a workforce with tremendous potential, and as a company with a strong Sri Lankan identity, we believe that we can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with international companies on a global platform.
We have shown this when we first started LAUGFS Gas competing with a multinational in 2001. Our LAUGFS Lubricants became the first to launch a Sri Lankan lubricant brand, again competing with international brands in the market
Q: The group recently expanded its operations to Bangladesh and what is the potential you see and the vision behind diversifying beyond Sri Lanka
A: We are always looking to identify emerging market trends and to leverage on our expertise.
Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing LPG markets in the region. With depleting natural gas reserves, the government is currently promoting alternative energy sources, especially LPG. With over 160million population, it is also one of the most populated countries in the world. We see tremendous potential for growth in Bangladesh.
Going into Bangladesh has helped us take the first step in becoming a serious regional energy player. We are the only player in the market with own vessel fleet, which in itself provides a strategic advantage.
Q: What are the future investment plans for the Hambantota terminal
A: The LAUGFS LPG Import & Export Terminal at Hambantota is a world class facility and will be one of the largest terminals in South Asia.
This is a significant project not just for LAUGFS, but for our country, as it will help position Sri Lanka on the global energy map, taking advantage of Hambantota Ports close proximity to some of the busiest shipping routes and our strategic location amidst some of the largest emerging LPG markets in Asia, such as Bangladesh.
It is constructed with a total investment of USD 80 million, with a total capacity of 45,000 MT, of which Phase 1 will be of 30,000 MT. Construction is well on track and we plan to commission the new Terminal in the 2nd half of 2018.
Q: What are the future plans for the maritime and LPG sectors
A: We recently acquired our third LPG vessel  Gas Courage, in January this year. Our plan is to expand our vessel fleet to service our expanding businesses in SL, Bangladesh and other countries. This will strengthen our LPG logistics capabilities to cater to regional demands as well as our own LPG operations in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
Q: Today start-ups have become the culture across the world and what advice would you give to young entrepreneurs
A: Entrepreneurs face many challenges, especially at the early stages, and persistence and courage become very important. Its important to look after your team as you go along, since its them who will help you drive your vision and make things a reality.
Once you become successful, its very important to never forget your roots. The people who have been there for you, your family, your upbringing, your school, have also had a tremendous impact on you to become who you are today. So, its important to remember that and give back in whatever way you can.
Q: What are your views on the importance of sustainability and company initiatives
A: I believe that sustainability of our businesses also depends on our team. I believe that having a great team with a strong trust-based relationship is vital for any business to succeed. We have a very strong family culture, with a great team spirit at LAUGFS. Our teams have worked tirelessly over the past two decades with a single vision to make LAUGFS what it is today.
Also, as a conglomerate with Sri Lankan roots, we believe that we have a responsibility towards helping and supporting our communities and our nation. We have been able to make a significant positive impacts on our local communities and our countrys economy as a whole  from infrastructure development to supporting industry growth, to employment creation to skill and knowledge enhancement and more.
We have a similar approach to our environment, where environment sustainability and responsible practices have been an important part of our business strategy from day one. In 1995 we offered auto gas conversion as a cleaner alternative for motorists. Today, our businesses include LAUGFS Gas, which offers LPG as a cleaner alternative to traditional fuel, Eco Sri, which is a pioneer in air quality management, as well as LAUGFS Power, which engages in renewable energy generation including hydro and solar. In addition, there are various projects we are currently working on to minimize our impact on the environment. For instance, LAUGFS Solutions is currently working on electricpowered trishaws, with 4 trishaws already converted as part of the pilot project.
Q: what are your personal ambitions
A: I believe that remembering our roots are very important, no matter how successful we are. I grew up in Ahangama and I constantly focus on giving back to the community I grew up in and have been spending a lot of time in projects to uplift the local communities there.
Im currently planning on setting up a total community centre there, which would include a theatre, library, playground, and a Montessori.
My pet project at the moment is a Tuck Shop Im setting up at Mahinda College, dedicated to Dani Aiya, who helped me when I was a young student at the college. He used to give me a free cup of tea when I didnt have any pocket money, and I have always been grateful to him for that. Helping to develop my former schools (Ananda College, Mahinda College and St. Aloysius College) have been a key focus for me.

Less is more!
Being natural is not just a proclamation, it is also the closest anybody can get to themselves. Having said that, nude make-up is the finest technique in the industry to make an individual look completely natural and genuine. It not only enhances the features but makes them look real.
Ideal for women with sharp features, endorsing the look is only enhancing ones natural beauty. Some people consider this look bland or muted, but if youve applied the right kind of products and on the right places, you can really look like a diva, that too effortlessly! The nude look involves using a few basic, neutral colours, such as rose, beige or peach, and their related shades. Here are a few tips you can use while trying to achieve this look:
Less is More: This is the first rule. You should not look caked-up while trying to look natural. Use foundation carefully and know when to stop!
Try to Look as Natural as Possible: Choose the shades that look natural on you. Lip colour should also look natural. Instead of matte lipstick, apply a little gloss on your lips directly.
The Magic Mascara: If you want, you can add false lashes to give a glamorous twist to your final look.
Blush: You can use blush, but make sure it compliments your skin tone. Do not opt for shades that look contrasting, and also keep a check on the amount of blush being used.
Lip: Stick to nude colours for the sophisticated subtlety! Deccan Chronicle

Maldivians can get kidney operations done in SL: Rajitha
Although kidney operations are banned for Indian nationals, Maldivian nationals can get kidney operations done in Sri Lanka without a problem, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said that kidney operations were banned by the Government for Indian nationals due to a racket, but this ban does not apply for Maldivians. Therefore, Maldivians can get done kidney operations in Sri Lanka. Minister Senaratne expressed these views during the recent meeting held with Maldivian Health Minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim.
Minister Senaratne said, kidney operations will be done for all Maldivian individuals under the recommendation of the Maldivian Government. He made a request from Minister Ibrahim to do regular screening for HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB) for Sri Lankan workers employed in Maldives.
The Ministers agreed to discuss the topic again and sign the relevant agreements in September, during the WHO sessions for South and South East Asian countries.

He was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone for the Nurses Training School to be constructed in Galle at a cost of Rs. 555 million.
Before commencing the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, the relevant persons had checked the minimum standards of medical education with the SLMC, but then SLMC President had told them that such standards were not given. Then the culprit was the SLMC. But now some talk and shout about the quality of the medical education, the minister said.
Private medical education is globally spread and some Sri Lankan doctors were educated at foreign private medical colleges. Some are opposing private medical education. What they are having is a dialogue between idiots. The present Government is protecting free health and education, the Minister said.

NASA to observe asteroid flyby
US: A small asteroid that is expected to fly close to the Earth will provide NASA an opportunity to test its network of observatories and systems for planetary defense, scientists say.
The asteroid 2012 TC4 - estimated to be between 10 and 30 metres in size - will safely fly past Earth on October 12.
Even though scientists cannot yet predict exactly how close it will approach, they are certain it will come no closer than 6,800 kilometres from the surface of Earth. The asteroid has been out of range of telescopes since 2012.
Scientists have always appreciated knowing when an asteroid will make a close approach to and safely pass the Earth because they can make preparations to collect data to characterise and learn as much as possible about it, said Michael Kelley, programme scientist and NASA Headquarters lead for the TC4 observation campaign.
This time we are adding in another layer of effort, using this asteroid flyby to test the worldwide asteroid detection and tracking network, assessing our capability to work together in response to finding a potential real asteroid threat, Mr Kelley said.
Professor Vishnu Reddy of the University of Arizonas Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson leads the campaign to reacquire 2012 TC4 and sees it as an opportunity for the collaborative observation campaign to utilise the international aspect of the network.
This is a team effort that involves more than a dozen observatories, universities and labs across the globe so we can collectively learn the strengths and limitations of our near-Earth object observation capabilities, said Mr Reddy.
The goal of the TC4 campaign is to recover, track and characterise 2012 TC4.
This effort will exercise the entire system, to include the initial and follow-up observations, precise orbit determination, and international communications, Mr Reddy said.
Asteroid 2012 TC4 may be slightly larger than the space rock that hit Earths atmosphere near Chelyabinsk, Russia, in February 2013.
TC4 has not been seen since its 2012 discovery, when it sped past Earth at about one-fourth the distance from Earth to the moon. It has been too distant and too faint to be detected over the last five years.
As it starts to approach Earth this summer, large telescopes will be used to detect it and re-establish the asteroids precise trajectory.
The new observations are expected to help refine knowledge about its orbit, narrowing the uncertainty about how far it will be from Earth at its closest approach in October. - AFP

New music, new look
Ricardo Valentine, better known as 6lack (pronounced "black"), spent late April to early June opening the Weeknd's Starboy: Legend of the Fall tour, performing sparse, dreamy, moody music that fits somewhere between trap, cloud rap, screw and alternative R&B.
He originally gained buzz by releasing freestyles over songs like Partynextdoor's "Break From Toronto" (aptly named "Break From Atlanta"), and late last year Interscope put out his first release, Free 6lack, a brooding rumination on feeling free that plays like a hip-hop-informed version of The xx's tight and skeletal gloom. Single "Prblms" currently has 39 million views on YouTube and was certified Platinum last month. With the tour over, 6lack has been spending time in his personal recording space in the offices of LoveRenaissance, an Atlanta-based creative agency and newly minted record label also affiliated with D.R.A.M. and Raury.
Rolling Stone talked to the rising star about the follow-up to Free 6lack and why he cut the hair that hung over his face on its cover.
Q: Why did you cut your hair
Cutting it was the perfect transition. It's more of a personal growth than anything. I just feel like moving forward. I shouldn't be moving with my head down or hiding behind my hair or thinking about my hair while I'm performing.
Q: Was there a correlation between the hair and your new music
Yeah. Definitely. They were synonymous.
Q: What was the first thought you had the day after
I was still kind of traumatized. It was a quick change, a big change. Like, immediately. Even though it was a weight off of me, I felt like what was concealing me, my curtain, was gone. I gotta walk with my head up now. I gotta make eye contact with everybody regardless if I want to or not. It was a lot to deal with initially, but after the first day, I felt a lot lighter.
Q: What did you take away from your run on the Weeknd's Starboy tour
Every single night, I watched every single show.  I went into it with the mindstate that every single night, the show has to get better. No matter what the case is, I get off stage and I'm never mad and let's do better tomorrow.  I'm watching him, the fans, the lights, the reactions.  I was there for a reason. I was watching somebody who came from nothing. Everything matters.
What's one thing you've learned musically since you've gotten a Platinum single
The only thing that has changed is that I'm more careful. I'm more particular about every line, melody. I try to listen to through other people's ears too. I like this song but maybe it won't carry across as well  I gotta figure out a different way to say what I want to say. I'm way more careful about what I say. I know attention spans. It only takes one boring line for people to say, That song is okay. I don't think making a song like "Prblms" really changes anything. I didn't go into it with the intent of making a Platinum record. It was just what I was going through at the time.
Q: In your new music, is there anything present from the new process that was absent before
I didn't write at all for Free 6lack. I haven't written on paper or on phone for six years. For this one, I know at some point I want to pick up a pen. I will sit here [in LoveRenaissance Studio B] for 12 hours and not record one thing  not until I get a line out. There's hundreds of songs. For this next album specifically, a lot of music. There's always more than enough to make an album. It's about having the sound that you want.
Q: What was working with Jhen Aiko like
I met Jhen in the studio and our managers were in the studio waiting for something to happen. We just kind of looked at each other and realized we don't work with tons of people around. We had our session later on. She walked in, I was halfway done with the song. I walked out, she finished it.
Q: What's the process of working with Gucci Mane like for you
With Gucci, I had some stuff that clicked with him and he had some stuff that clicked with me. We made six songs in a couple of hours.

Q: What's a new lyric you wrote for the album you're especially proud of
On my new song, "Eyes on Me," at the end of each verse, I just kind of say something to my daughter. "I hope I make you proud. I might make some mistakes." This is for her to listen to one day and to come back and be like, 'My dad was talking to me.' That's the thing that's sticking out the most right now.
Q: What was a proud moment with your child
Just looking. Everyday. Knowing that I created something, that she's going to be here with me for the rest of my life and that she's going to grow and take after me and look to me for guidance. Every single thing that you could possibly think about makes you happy when it comes to a kid, even if they're screaming [at] the top of their lungs and you just want to get sleep. You also think about it and it's like  Well, I'm also grateful for you being here and screaming and being upset right now. Whatever you need, just [tell me]. It's cool to have to take care of somebody and watch them grow. She's growing fast.

One-stop-shop for health and beauty
People from all walks of life and age groups are now highly concerned of their beauty and physique today. Beauty salons and gyms have mushroomed everywhere to cater to these needs. They are found in every nook and corner in the country.
Many beauty salons in Sri Lanka, being me-too products, are very western oriented. They stick to common marketing tactics to serve their customers.
It is true that the local consumer segment that represents the masses could be enticed by a westernized approach since their aspirations are such. Yet exclusive up market clienteles and niche markets always yearn for factors such as emotional or intangible benefits a product or a service offers in addition to tangible benefits or physical product attributes.
Beauty Zone Salon situated in the heart of Kadawatha has a different approach towards its clients. It adheres to Sri Lankan traditions paying emphasis on hospitality that leads to lifelong relationships.
Sri Lanka is a country that has a lineage for the best traditions and hospitality bestowed upon it by its rich culture. The Buddhist culture has imparted us with qualities to make humble and honest relationships with people. The Seri Vaanija Jathaka story sheds light on a door-to-door seller called Kachchaputa who had practiced Relationship Marketing.
Beauty Zone has grasped that tradition to treat its patrons cordially as guests.
Beauty especially in women is not skin deep. Beauty comes from within. We at Beauty Zone treat our visitors as guests thus we educate them on many factors that contribute towards maintaining beauty, says Beauty Zone Director Indika De Silva who has been a professional architect. Sanjaya Alahakoon is the co-director.
Architecture is a subject that harmonizes with aesthetics. After indulging in it for many years I wanted to diversify into the salon business which too goes hand-in-hand with aesthetics. Similar to architecture the salon industry too is a scientific art. In Sri Lankan history, the barbers used to come to Walawwas to do haircuts. I was inspired by this concept to start Beauty Zone. Our customers whom we treat as guests should feel at home and have a special feeling once they step into our premises. Physical evidence, procedures and service providers play a vital role here, says Indika.
There is no cash counter to be seen at Beauty Zone. Ample space and homely atmosphere prevails. The soothing ambience is in abundance with greenery. Cosmetics kept on a canoe at the midst of the salon are the centre of attraction. Visitors feel they are in a user-friendly domestic environment.
Fashion cuts, fashion colours, hair treatments, facials, clean ups, manicures/pedicures, threading and waxing, face lifting treatments, whitening treatments, pimple treatments, makeup, hair styles and many more services are on offer for the guests who visit Beauty Zone seeking for exclusiveness.
Unlike in earlier decades people are now self-educated on the subject of beauty. Social media has done this revolution. When they visit us with this knowledge, we must have the capacity to captivate them with our services. Newcomers often come with pre-decided products to be used on them.
Yet we always guide them to use the right product that best suits his/her personality, skin colour and habits, Indika stressed. Beauty Zone does not rely on branding or pamphlets to promote its business. Their loyal customers are their promoters.
We use a top Italian brand of cosmetics which is a world top brand with international green standards coupled with specialized services that do no harm to the skin. Ours is the only salon that uses this brand in Kadawatha. Hence our guests get value for their money and gain exclusiveness while enjoying peace in mind. Contented customers become our ambassadors by spreading positive word-of-mouth, he added.
Beauty Zone benchmarks with latest global trends to maintain uniqueness. Nail art is a brand new service that is on offer. Neon-Coloured Hair Colouring which is visible only in the dark is in store for early adopters.
According to Indika phase two of his venture is to unveil a Slimming and Skin Toning section with an in-house dietician.
Personality development has a big market potential now. More than ladies, gents will be lured towards this in future.
People who have obesity will be guided to reduce their body fat not only by adhering to plug and burn methods but also by practicing better food habits and water intake, he said.
Also, world famous beauty products from Italy and Australia will be introduced to up market clients via Beauty Zone.
Thus Beauty Zone is poised to offer a complete solution under one roof to its guests as a one-stop-shop in Kadawatha.
While promoting green habits, we work towards achieving the US Green Building certificate for Beauty Zone, Indika concluded.

## Title: The open economy
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

The open economy
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has thanked all SLFP led governments, which ruled the country after 1977, for continuing with the open economy introduced by late President J.R. Jayewardene. Speaking at the opening of the exhibition organised to mark 40 years since the introduction of the open economy, at the Youth Centre in Maharagama on Thursday Premier Wickremesinghe said the open economy was introduced by the late President J.R. Jayewardene but his successors also continued with it. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga continued with it while some of those in the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime did the same. I would like to thank all of them for it, he said.
True, at the very inception of the open economy the SLFP was among the most virulent critics of the system along, of course, with the Marxists, and not entirely for invalid reasons. Most saw the system as exploitative, and that which widened the gulf between the haves and the have-nots. The market economy also made inroads into social and cultural values hitherto taken for granted, with the creation of a new class of nouveau riche. It is still being claimed that the influx of hard drugs into Sri Lanka had its origins in the open economy when the country was thrown open to the outside world and to all comers. The unbridled consumerism that was spawned by the market economy also exacerbated the poor - rich divide and created a breed of fat cats who raked in the shekels from the ample opportunities that came their way, with some becoming billionaires almost overnight.
However, on the plus side, the country took off in the sphere of economic development as was never witnessed before in the post Independence era, with the free trade and burgeoning economic activity providing a climate for employment generation. Free Trade Zones sprang up with the establishment of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission, providing a bonanza for the job starved youth and garment factories virtually mushroomed, bringing village girls to the cities for gainful employment. The country which was hitherto in virtual slumber, suddenly began to stir with commercial activity. Giant infrastructure projects were coming up at a rapid rate with foreign investments flooding into the country while multi-purpose projects like the giant Mahaweli was telescoped from the original 30 years to six years to cater to the irrigation, agricultural needs of the rural community and to meet the rapid demand for power generation in the wake of heightening economic activity.
No doubt, the open economy was firmly entrenched by the time Chandrika was waiting in the wings to take over the reins after seventeen years of UNP rule and it became a fait accompli. Perhaps, to make a virtue out of necessity, CBK made the pledge to continue with the open economy, which was so anathema to the SLFP not many moons ago, but giving it a human face. The rest, as they say, is history, except that the onetime avowed socialist went about the job with a vengeance, outdoing the UNP in the privatization exercise, even recalling the Shell Company which her mother booted out of the country during her first tenure as Prime Minister in the early sixties. Mahinda Rajapaksa, for all the rhetoric he bellowed against the open economy and despite the janagoshas and pada yatras held to highlight the evils of the system, picked up the reins from CBK and continued with even greater zeal.
It is in this light that it is difficult to comprehend the stand taken by certain elements of the SLFP in the unity government when they say that they could not work with the UNP, whose policies are diametrically opposed to the SLFP. True, the SLFP was said to have evolved to cater to the needs of the marginalized sections of society and it owed its electoral successes largely to this constituency. Hence, some of the SLFP stalwarts may feel vulnerable to appear to take a divergent path in alignment with the UNP and are obviously making sounds in order to send a message to this segment of their vote base.
But, as the Prime Minister said, the other day, the allies of the national unity government should concentrate on the countrys development instead of turning against one another. Speaking at a religious ceremony held at Kande Vihare in Aluthgama the Premier said there was no point in confrontational politics at the moment as what is needed at present is for everyone to focus on development.
The PM was obviously referring to the sniping that has been a regular feature between the UNP and SLFP members in the unity government which is being pounced on by the Joint Opposition to portray a crisis in governance. For the first time since Independence both major parties have joined together to work towards achieving a common goal and it is only right that petty differences be put aside and all players pull together in one direction for the good of the country.

## Title: The option of accountability

The option of accountability
The system of transferring the ownership of the cars imported on duty free permits and selling them by some parliamentarians and making a good bit of money while depriving the State of taxes show not only the unsound and skewed policies of Governments but also the abysmally low quality and immorality of parliamentarians who indulge in many other malpractices and unethical deals as well. It is plainly a racket that has been legitimized and justified by those with crooked minds.
As parliamentarians give the lead, professionals and noted public figures too have imbibed the misuse of their social standing thereby disturbing good civic order, equality and justice in society. It also undermines human dignity. It is also a case of politicians in power usurping for selfish political ends the power of the people. These parliamentarians and professionals not only lack a sense of responsibility they also lack a sensitive social conscience. They become a law unto themselves and are devoid of accountability. This is nothing but degenerate political culture.
The Governments by certain policies they adopt demonstrate that they have only a mediocre sense of accountability. The people elect someone equal to themselves in human dignity, with educational and professional competence, capable of representing them to responsibly participate in the Government of the country for the common good. Unfortunately, because of their lack of education and understanding, many of them once elected, think they are absolute rulers without limits and act like petty dictators.
CAPRICIOUS ACTIONSAND CORRUPTION
They do not seem to understand the purpose of privileges, the space, the facilities and freedoms within certain perimeters given to them to render a social service by the right of representing the people and standing by the country unhampered by fear or favour. However, in the vanity of their egoism they arrogate to themselves powers they do not have and try to justify their kind of arbitrary exercise of power. Not only they; their siblings, in laws, their wives, children think power also flows on to them and exercise varying degrees of power, arbitrarily. Shallow and ignorant nobodies try to become somebodies with inept activities and arrogant attitudes and they end up becoming outlandish cynosures to those who notice them.
Some politicians have arbitrarily arrogated to themselves such powers in their electorate that they order the opening and closing of shops and business establishments according to their personal whims and fancies. Politicians have gone to the extent of exercising capriciously fanciful power  many of them wish to be able to order the police; one tries to order a judge, another barges into a television station, ties a public servant to a tree while another forces a teacher to kneel before students. Inside parliament crude politicians are known for their bad conduct. Some of them are swollen headed and have not learnt how to behave there and even in their ministries and offices. And they think that they need not explain anything to anyone and that no one should question them about their public conduct and their public expenditures. Their indiscipline and lack of accountability indicate their irresponsibility, their state of corruption and ignorance of public duty. That such individuals have been elected is due to people continuing to be deceived by the ruses of politicians.
SURFACING HIDDEN MONEY
The leaders of the Government are vested with much power. All that power is to be used first and foremost for the good of the country and not for their private benefit or for that of individuals close to the leaders. When they do so, they become betrayers of the people. The last regime did just that and the people taught them an unforgettable lesson. If the present leaders close their eyes to corruption by those who are close to them and act obstinately like those of the last regime, common sense would say how the people will punish them
The people should make them feel the heat of the high temperature of a burning political stake even if they are not on the stake itself. The people will not tolerate the continuation of the stupidity and the sheer lack of accountability of the Rajapaksa regime by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime as well. If the Bond scammers and other rotters in their ranks are prioritized and the good of the people overlooked the political motivations of the present leaders will seem as dubious, inconsistent and corrupt as those of the former regime. Further, it goes completely counter to the new political culture that was promised.
Surely MS-RW and their team did not promise a level of corruption comparably just a little lower than that of their predecessors who to create trouble for the government now seem to be spending lavishly on asinine projects to bring down the government. The Government should investigate the hideouts whence the money comes.
NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Governments and its members are clever at presenting all kinds of reasoning and befuddling the people and arrogating to themselves all sorts of privileges from absenting themselves from parliamentary sessions  now they have given themselves a payment to induce them to attend each session, in addition to their MPs salary,  to gallivanting the globe on the slightest excuse, to ordering the police and even the judiciary in addition to their normal practice of intimidating the people who elected them. And they call press conferences to sweep many issues under the carpet or throw a blanket over them and threaten journalists without clearly pointing out any misreporting by journalists. Press conferences should be to clearly set before the people well thought out government plans and call for their support while exposing the conspiratorial plans of opponents including the befuddled civic-senseless GMOA headed by politicians wearing trade union masks.
There are a few others who overawe the people and get away with it while many politicians think that they are in a continuous popularity contest. Their judgements and decisions about the common good and accountability get skewed. This is far from upholding and maintaining courteous relationships with people and the public service and facilitating services between them. It should also be remembered that MPs elected are not in any way privileged to be contractors and business dealers with the Government. MPs should not be involved in any transactions with the Government and no trace of conflict of interest with regard to their mission as peoples representatives. Membership in parliament should not be contaminated with unworthy and hidden suspicious deals. If presently there is room for these unethical practices, the new Constitution should put it right and protect the peoples interests in this regard.
PROBITY OF CHARACTER
People should hold the leaders of the government, all of the Cabinet and all the MPs to account and demand that they carry out their responsibilities honourably. If they are just MPs, it would be sufficient if each of them could say that they faithfully carried out an unbroken dialogue with the people s/he represents and attended the sessions of parliament and contributed in the best way they could to the debates, carried out the assignments in the interests of the people that may have been given to them, without being tainted with immoral dealings, unethical practices and corruption of any sort.
The leaders of the government and ministers should show the people that they are worthy of the positions they are entrusted with and hold and that they are not careless of the high cost to the people for every session of parliament and for every decision they make especially concerning instances when they wish to defer to certain individuals to whom they wish to show favour. There should be no procrastinating or sidestepping on the probity of character and the integrity of key party men or of critical issues and there is no question of anyone saying how difficult it is to govern after a big mess that has been left behind.
OWNERSHIP SHOULD BELEGITIMATE
Anyway, many an irritable element in the Cabinet contributes to negate the focusing of the Government on such important matters as the New Constitution with the new elements in it that people hope will bring about a new political culture and clean political environment prioritizing service to the people.
After a restoration of the democratic power of the people, the people wish to see that justice is done and not set aside, that what has been stolen or illegitimately acquired and taken away by any citizen is recovered. Absolutely no MP or any citizens should be beyond explaining how legitimately he has earned, acquired and owns all that one claims as ones own. What is beyond reasonable explanation should be confiscated and become the property of the State. No one should be allowed to escape with any transgression by paying a nominal fine minutely out of proportion to the deception or to what has been stolen.
What needs to be understood is that neither corrupt men and women of the former regime nor the corrupt men and women of the present regime could do any lasting good to the country and its people. It is the duty of the President and Prime Minister to honour the pledges given to the people, uphold the trust the people have reposed in them both and do what needs to be done to clean up their administration and set the ship of state on a righteous course. All the members of the Cabinet need to be held to a high standard of honesty, accountability and transparency. The President and the Prime Minister are entitled to be faithful to their friends, but even they, not at the cost of the people of this country. The undemocratic disregard of merit, competence and qualifications and preferment of the undesirable tradition of nepotism, favouritism towards kith and kin and political henchmen needs to be banished and should have ended definitively with the demise of the last regime.

President slams new govt. dreams
Nobody can form a new govt. without my blessings
President Maithripala Sirisena said that although some groups are dreaming of changing the numbers in parliament and capturing power to form a government, everybody should keep it in their minds that his blessings are essential to form a new government.
Commenting on a statement by an Opposition Member of Parliament as well as a former minister who said power of the government and the Presidency will be over after winning the support of 113 members in parliament, the President pointed out that according to the constitution nobody can form a new government without his blessings.
He said when the government is working for the countrys progress by removing all barriers, certain empty voices were attempting to cause disturbances. The President was speaking at the opening of the new building of the Regional Education Office in Hingurakgoda yesterday (July 31).
The President said : Certain media today were giving space not to the people who work with a true feeling about the country, but to those sounding off their empty rhetoric . Hence certain sections of the public have been entertaining misunderstandings about the government, the President said.
Some people raise their empty voices as they cannot bear the advances made by the government through protecting democracy and freedom of expression by changing the way the country was governed through fraud, corruption, waste and family rule, under me as a leader who was raised in the village , he said.
The President said there was no existence for those who live by misdeeds in this country.
In a sacred Buddhist land, existence will be there only for those who tread the righteous path through truth and justice, he stated.
The new building has been built at a cost of Rs. 4,500,000.00 to facilitate the administrative and management activities of the Hingurakgoda Educational Zone, with the objective of building a knowledge-based society. This was built under the provisions of North Central Provincial Council.
The President launched the website of the Regional Education Office at the occasion.
Meanwhile, the Primary Medical Care Unit in Meegaswewa, Medirigiriya was vested with public by the President. The Primary Medical Care Unit which expands the health facilities of nearly 3000 families in Meegaswewa, Vadigawewa, Pathokwewa, Senarthpura, Kumudupura and Mayilagashandiya was built at a cost of Rs. 11 million.
The President, opened the Primary Medical Care Unit by unveiling the plaque, and registered the first patient there.
Chief Minister of the North Central Province Peshala Jayarathne, Provincial Health Minister M. Herath Banda and the Provincial Minister Sampath Sri Nilantha were among those participated in this event.

Relief pack of Rs. 5, 000 for drought- affected

Cabinet today made the decision to provide people affected by the drought a relief pack with essential items worth Rs. 5,000 per month, for the next two months, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing the media at the end of the meeting with the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Cost of Living (CSCL) at the Ministry of Finance he said the beneficiaries would receive Rs 2,500 worth of good every two weeks.
As the prevailing drought further devastates paddy harvests, Minister Amaraweera said that the CSCL had also made the decision to decrease the Special Commodity Levy on the import of rice from Rs. 5 per kilo to Rs. 25 cents per kilo.
Essential Items Importers Association Secretary Ilamanathan explained that given the reduction in tax, importers have now been able to provide white raw rice (Vietnam) at Rs. 60 per kilo, par boiled (Nadu) at Rs. 72 per kilo and ponni rice at Rs. 75-76 per kilo.
In addition, the Cabinet Sub-Committee has also opened up imports for wheat flour and wheat grain: Cess tax on wheat flour has been reduced from Rs. 25 to Rs. 15 and that of wheat grain has been reduced from Rs. 9 to Rs. 6, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He added that the maximum retail price on packeted flour too has been removed.
The main reason behind reducing price of flour is the prevailing drought. We are not aiming to make people switch to flour - rice is our focus, but local harvests have drastically reduced due to the drought," he said.
"In the next few months, even if the droughts continue, the government will ensure that the price of essential items remain stable," he promised, adding that the government is also taking action to encourage food production.
The Fisheries Ministry has also requested that the Special Commodity Levy on wet fish be reduced by Rs. 50. Accordingly the levy on imported thalapath and koppara have been reduced from Rs. 75 to Rs. 25.
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the meantime has drawn up MoUs to import 100,000MT of par boiled (Nadu) rice and another 25,000MT of white raw rice from Thailand. Another MoU has been drawn up to import 30,000MT of white raw rice from Myanmar.
The CWE, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce announced, had also started extracting 51,000 MT of paddy lying with the Paddy Marketing Boards warehouses to mill in CWEs own mills and through private millers.
Thus the Ministry expected a total of 187,000 MT of rice to flood the market immediately.The country consumes 200,000MT of rice each month.

Root joy as England mark Oval milestone in style
London: Joe Root was delighted with Englands all-round effort as they bounced back to hammer South Africa by 239 runs in the third Test at The Oval on Monday.
Englands Moeen Ali finished things off in style by becoming the first bowler in 100 Test at The Oval to take a hat-trick.
What a way to celebrate the 100th Test at this ground, Root told Sky Sports of off-spinner Alis hat-trick. Man-of-the-match Ben Stokes, who caught two of Alis hat-trick victims, had a good view when Morne Morkel fell lbw to complete the Worcestershire all-rounders treble -- although England had to first review an original not out decision.
I cant believe it didnt get given out, said Stokes, who helped Ali start his hat-trick by catching Dean Elgar to end the openers gritty 136.
Credit to Dean Elgar with the innings he played, added Stokes,
It was a really gutsy hundred, we were glad to see the back of him.
Meanwhile an elated Ali said of his hat-trick ball: I was very confident it was out.
As soon as the ball left my hand I thought it was straight, and then when it hit the pad I was surprised the umpire (West Indies Joel Wilson) initially didnt give it.
It was a great feeling. The match ball went straight into the pocket.
But much of the hard work that helped put England 2-1 up in this four-Test series had been done before the Alis landmark feat after lunch on Mondays fifth day.
England came into this match on the back of a colossal 340-run defeat in the second Test at Trent Bridge. Several former England captains criticised Roots men for lacking the patience required to bat through difficult periods in a Test match. But Ben Stokes, angered at suggestions that the teams desire was being called into question, made a well-constructed 112 in seam-bowler friendly conditions during a first innings total of 353 at The Oval that also saw ex-captain Alastair Cook weigh in with a valuable 88.
We got stuck in and posted a very good score on a challenging wicket, said Root.
As for his century Stokes, often troubled by accurate seamer Vernon Philander, admitted: I had to work pretty hard, especially early on.
There were some difficult periods, with the wicket offering a bit, particularly for Vernon Philander -- I lost count of how many times he beat the bat.
Its pleasing to get through those hard times.
Philander, however, spent much of this match off the field with a viral complaint, having tormented England at Trent Bridge.
Its obvious to say that Vernon Philander missing out for us in that first innings was a huge moment in the game, said South Africa captain Faf du Plessis.
The conditions at that time needed someone like him, an expert in challenging the batsmen.
To allow England 350 in that first innings was probably about 100 too many, but you have to also give credit to the way England played.
England responded to their Trent Bridge trouncing by selecting three debutants in their XI at The Oval, the south London headquarters of county side Surrey.
One of those new caps was Toby Roland-Jones, a stalwart seamer on the other side of Londons River Thames with Lords-based Middlesex, the reigning English county champions.
The 29-year-old had an England debut to remember, returning match figures of eight for 129 and scoring 45 valuable late-order runs.
It has been draining at times, but to be a part of these last five days and to come out on top is obviously very rewarding, said Roland-Jones.
I couldnt be happier. AFP

Rs. 40 million paid for non-existent  Consul General
Two members of Gotas security detail occupied premises
FCID informs court
The Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) yesterday informed the Fort Magistrates Court that a sum of Rupees 40 million had been misappropriated in the guise of paying for rent for the Consul General office in Los Angeles.
Making submissions before Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne, the FCID informed court that the moneys had been paid, despite there being no appointment of a Consul General to Los Angeles.
Instead two Military offices who were a part of ex- Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksas detail were stationed at the premises. The two officers had been paid salaries from both the Military and the office of the Consul General the FCID revealed.
The court was informed that the funds had been used for all expenses including utitlites for the premises. The FCID informed court that the premises was used from August 1, 2013 to June 30, 2015 without any appointment of a Consul General. It was also revealed that the payments had been made in violation of the lease agreement which said that in the event of non -appointment of a Consul General, the agreement would be terminated.
The Court was informed that two officers of the Army, Lakshman Thilakasiri and Upul Dharmadasa were sent during the former Consuln General Dr. Hector Weerasinghes tenure, but following the termination of his tenure the duo had failed to return to the country within the specified six month period. Instead they had remained at the residence for another 18 months.
the FCID also informed court that the duo had not been granted permission by the Army or the Ministry of Defense.
The FCID had recorded statements from Former Ambassador Jaliya Wickremasuriya, and Consul General Dr. Hector Weerasinghe and 22 others regarding the fraud.
The FCID also informed court that further investigations are being carried out to ascertain if any other persons had resided at the premises.
The Court informed the FCID to continue with the investigations and report to court regarding its findings.

## Title: The safety of Glyphosate
## Supertitle:

The safety of Glyphosate
I would like to reply to two articles from Amal Wimalasena and Prof. Nimal Gunatilleke in the Daily News. No agrochemical is totally safe. As a person who is cultivating rice in the Kegalle district I know the importance of weedicides in controlling weeds and its importance to obtain a good harvest. If we want to use totally safe agrochemicals the humans will starve to death. At the time of Independence our population was less than five million and we imported 60% of our rice. In 2015 we were able to produce sufficient rice to feed twenty million people and also have an excess. This is due to modern agriculture practices and the use of agrochemicals. We still import most of our food from countries that freely use Glyphosate. Therefore it is not practical to burden our farmers with a ban and still consume food produced in other countries using Glyphosate. It is important to evaluate scientifically what is Glyphosate.
Glyphosphate is a derivative of amino acid glycine. It is a broad spectrum systemic herbicide, that has been used since 1970s. Glyphosate is the most used herbicide in the world. In United States 180 million pounds are used annually for crop protection and another 5 to 8 million pounds for domestic purposes. Mode of action of glyphosphate is to inhibit the shikimate pathway used by plants and many bacteria to produce aromatic amino acids. The enzyme inhibited is 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3- phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Glyphosphate inhibits the enzyme by binding to the active site. As animals do not have the shikimate pathway, it has very low toxicity to animals.
Toxicology of Glyphosphate
All chemicals are toxic. So there is a range for toxicity and LD50 is used as the standard. LD50 means the quantity required to kill 50% of an experimental rat population. This is expressed as mg/Kg body weight. The toxicity range for LD50 is 1) very toxic - less than 25mg 2)Toxic  25 to 200mg 3)harmful  200 to2000mg. The LD50 of some common chemicals are sodium Chloride(Salt) 3000mg,Ethanol(alcohol) 7000mg, Glyphosate has a LD50 of 5000 mg.
A systemic review in 2013 by the German Institute of Risk Assessment examined epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies and concluded no classification and labeling of carcinogenicity is warranted and did not recommend a carcinogenicity of either category 1A or 1B. International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified Glyphosate as probably carcinogenic in humans (category 2A). IARC does not conduct risk assessment and they classify carcinogenic potential. This means a few positive findings are sufficient to declare a hazard. Although negative studies are also present.
Glyphosate is used in 130 countries. In September 2013 El Salvador banned glyphosate use after 2015.In 2014 Netherlands banned the use of Glyphosate for domestic use. In 2015 in France it was advised to sell Glyphosphate from locked cabinets. Sri Lanka and Burmuda banned the use of Glyphosate in 2015. It is very obvious that developed countries do not consider that the commercial use of Glyphosate is harmful to humans.
Glyphosate as it has a charged phosphate group binds strongly to soil. Therefore water pollution is very low. Glyphosate is degraded to aminomethylprosphonic acid (AMPA) and carbon dioxide by soil microbes. Half life of Glyphosate varies from 2 to197 days. Glyphosate and its degraded product AMPA are considered to be much less toxic than herbicides that were used prior to Glyphosate.
Glyphosate and GeneticallyModified Crops (GMP)
Some microorganisms have the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate syntase, which is resistant to Glyphosphate inhibition. A enzyme that is resistant to glyphosate and that has sufficient activity to continue plant growth was discovered from Agrobacterium sp. The gene was cloned and transferred to soya bean in 1996. Glyphosate resistant soya bean has been commercialized and other genetically modified crops that are resistant to Glyphosate are maize (corn) and cotton. In 2010 in the United State 70% corn, 78% cotton and 95% soy bean planted are herbicide resistant GMP plants.
In Sri Lanka a major component of the cost of production of agriculture is weed control. It is vital in major crops like Tea, Paddy and Coconut. The price of production of a kilo of Tea has increased from Rs. 126 in 2000 to Rs 422 in 2013. Cost of production of rice in the Polonnaruwa district has increased from Rs.15 .70 per Kg in 2005 to Rs 32.49 in 2013. The production cost for 1000 coconuts in 2002 was Rs.4154.00 and in 2013 has increased to Rs 12684.00. The use of manual labour for weeding may lead to a possible collapse of the plantation industry. The use of alternate herbicides will not only be more expensive, it will also lead to more serious environmental damage.
Chronic kidney disease ofuncertain etiology (CKDu)
Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) is prevalent in the North Central province. Studies by Jayathilaka and co-workers indicate that risk is higher in males above 39 years. The farmers engaged in chena cultivation were more susceptible than persons involved in paddy cultivation. They observed food items in the endemic areas contain Cadmium at a higher level than the reference level. They concluded cadmium exposure is a risk factor and genetic susceptibility observed indicate predisposing factors for the development CKDu .
Danubian endemic familial nephropathy (DEFN) was first identified in 1920s. DEFN was observed in small discrete communities along the Danub River. This is only observed in adults. The disease is observed in people who are resident in endemic areas for more than 15 years. Over the years more than 25000 cases have been reported. The first hypothesis was intoxication with heavy metals. The etiology of DEFN is still uncertain. However chronic exposure to dietary aristolochic acid has been identified as a major risk factor in 2011. Aristolochic acid is present in seeds of Aristolochia clematitis (European birthwort), an endemic plant in the effected region. The seeds are mixed with wheat used for producing bread. Aristolochic acid present in Chinese herbal medicine is associated with a related condition known as Chinese herbs nephropathy.
In hot low land Central America a mysteries kidney dieses (CKDu) has affected persons working in sugar cane plantations. It was first assumed to be caused by infectious diseases and heat stress. Later it was blamed on herbicide and insecticides. However it was discovered that in El Salvador CKDu does not affect people working in regions 500meters above sea level. Pesticide expose is the same in both populations. Therefore heat stress and chronic dehydration is assumed to play a major role in the development of CKDu.
The future
A solution for CKDu requires a join scientific study involving multidisciplinary research teams to determine factors leading to the development of this disease. Experience from other countries indicates that this may take a long time. It is sad to observe that political decisions are made regarding scientific matters without consulting intuitions that have been establish by acts of Parliament. Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science or the Institute of Chemistry has not been consulted before making a decision, which requires scientific advice. We hope that the Glyphosate ban will be lifted and scientific discussions regarding the dangers will be held before making a decision. If we assume we are more advanced in the science of food toxicity and food quality regulations than the USA and Europe it demonstrates our ignorance to the world scientific community.

## Title: Self-regulation for social media

Self-regulation for social media
When we talk about social media self-regulation, a number of questions will crop up. Who will create a code of ethics to be adapted to the online environment What kind of challenges does convergence bring to social media self-regulation What is the impact of the self-regulatory process on Press Complaints Commissions Who should follow whether the editors and administrators are maintaining the specified ethical standards Here again, public debate and discussions are needed to find acceptable answers
Addressing the 28th Law Asia Conference in Colombo, the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commented that time had come for the legal sector and the Government to think whether it was possible to regulate social media. On the other hand, he questioned, If you regulate social media, is it a violation of Fundamental Rights
Prime Ministers concern is quite justifiable. Social media are truly becoming absolute hits among todays population regardless of age, sex or location. There is no doubt that social networking sites have become an essential element and support for current modern lifestyle and communities. Thus, the conclusion is clear: social media is here to stay.
Defining social media is difficult because of the wide variety of stand-alone and built-in services available, but for our purpose we will settle for a simple definition. Social media is an umbrella term used to describe social interaction through a suite of technology based tools, most of which are internet based. This includes, but is not limited to, internet forums, networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, webcasts, and blogs.
This emergence and staggering growth had brought along with it a wide range of ethical issues worth giving our attention.
What are they To quote few:
(1) Privacy/Anonymity -When social networking, no one can ever guarantee that they are contacting the real person. The majority of users are unaware that when they register, upload content, post comments etc. they are allowing huge organisations to stalk their private information
(2) Free speech - In democratic ideology, free speech is always supported. But it is a dangerous weapon for specific groups of people to manipulate this right to spark unethical sentiments such as racial or religious hatred through social media.
(3) Data Leakage - Many new technologies related to data security and protection have been introduced to the market in the recent years. Yet, data leakage still remains as a big issue. It has been proven that social networking is one prime culprit.
(4) Identity Theft - This is a form of technique used by criminals to impersonate someones identity with intention to pursue or commit for crime. Identity theft is prominently found in social media sites.
No social media site is a safe space. There are so many hidden dangers and ethical concerns in every site. Social media blurs private/public boundaries when individuals personal information and opinions enter the public domain. The boundaries between personal and work life also become blurred as companies make use of social media for business purposes.
These unique characteristics of social media pose serious ethical challenges for both personal and business users.
Social media abuse
Every other day we do come across an abundance of incidents of abuse of social media platforms by mischievous elements with malicious intentions. Of late, there has been a surge in such abuse on social networking websites through propagation of falsehood, defamation, character assassination and even extremist religious and racial views.
Angry and abusive comments routinely continue to feed the trolls. False perception and mistaken belief of unlimited freedom of expression and the thrill and excitement of instant transmission of message, mostly among younger generation, make the matter worse. We find many social media sites publish posts and stories, which are technically defamatory, without carrying out even minimum due-diligence in regard to the veracity and authenticity of the information.
With no visible censorship, regulation, control and monitoring, there is very often a tendency among social media users to go berserk, even at the slightest of provocation. Bogus / fake accounts abound in the social media and somehow escape the eagle eye of cyber sleuths and cyber-crime control agencies.
Public discussions
This brings us to a number of serious questions: Should we allow to continue unhindered and unpunished the prevailing free for all scenario Or should we put in place some kind of regulatory mechanism Or, as our Prime Minister has queried, whether too much of cyber-policing not lead to encroachment on individual freedom of expression Wont such a move be perceived as an attack on fundamental rights and democratic principles
Public discussions are needed to come to a solution or compromise.
At the same time, the uniqueness of social media has changed the rules of the game. Now anyone can have a broadcast channel. In fact, everyone now is a channel itself. Each person on the social networking site is a content developer, a script writer, an author and an editor. Millions of such self-styled professionals have been thrown into the massive ocean of cyberspace to share their pearls of wisdom with the rest of the world.
The result is the phenomenon of having 24x7 news without newspapers, round-the-clock online journalism without journalists. This makes the task of regulation and keeping vigil on the activities much more difficult or maybe, impossible.
Self-regulation
The widespread availability of content deemed harmful has inspired concern among right thinking people. At the moment, there is no common understanding of the rules that should internationally govern the Internet. Hence self-regulation appears to be the best solution to increase online accountability while offering more flexibility than state regulation. And it is the only mechanism which wouldnt hurt the right of free-speech.
Digitalization not only has changed the way people communicate, it has transformed profoundly and irreversibly the nature of journalism and ethics. While social media encourages people to speak their minds, democracy still demands editors and administrators of those sites to provide reliable and impartial news and analysis. A crucial task of self-regulatory mechanisms is to foster public trust in the social media.
Social media self-regulation cannot succeed in a repressive environment. However, when social media freedom is guaranteed, self-regulation can help preserve the independence of social media and protect it from government interference.
When we talk about social media self-regulation, again a number of questions will crop up. Who will create a code of ethics to be adapted to the online environment What kind of challenges does convergence bring to social media self-regulation What is the impact of the self-regulatory process on Press Complaints Commissions Who should follow whether the editors and administrators are maintaining the specified ethical standards
Here again, public debate and discussions are needed to find acceptable answers.
Corrections
Social media is not meant to be a tool to carry out any malicious and vicious campaign against any individual, religion, belief, community or any group. Nor is it meant to settle personal scores. Strongest of criticisms and disagreements are supposed to be expressed in polite manner.
But, all said and done, the behaviour in the social media cannot be viewed in isolation. It is only a reflection of the general behavioural pattern of the country. That is why a self-imposed code of conduct, norm and social media ethic is the best way to tackle this menace
Until the time adequate self-regulatory systems, processes and mechanisms are built into social media networks to inspire the confidence of public and government to allow things to run in auto-pilot-mode, it is only natural that agencies of the government will need to step in to bring some semblance of order or discipline.
Most Press Complaints Commissions still rely on moral sanctions, particularly critical adjudications and a right of reply which the offending media should publish. However, the publication of a critical adjudication or of any other sanction such as correction or an apology can be less prominent on the Internet than in a print edition.
For this reason, Press Complaints Commission (PCC) of UK has issued new guidance on prominence for corrections, clarifications and apologies published online. It said, The correction or adjudication should appear in the relevant section of the site where the original article appeared and should link back to the original article, assuming it is still online. It is also important that online corrections and apologies were searchable in the same way as any other article
One of the key functions of the PCC of UK is the negotiation of published remedies to complaints, in the form of letters, corrections and apologies. Clause1 (Accuracy) of the Code requires that corrections and apologies be published with due prominence.
On the subject of self-regulation of social media, including how to implement it successfully, we can learn a lot from the PCC of UK and Finlands Council for Mass Media.

Shah Rukh Khan can charm a microphone
Actor Anushka Sharma says Shah Rukh Khans genuineness made it easy for her to do on-screen romance with the superstar in their upcoming film, Jab Harry Met Sejal.
Anushka, who made her debut with Shah Rukh in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, has teamed up with the 51-year-old actor for the third time in the new film by Imtiaz Ali.
Asked how was it to romance Shah Rukh, Anushka told reporters, Extremely easy. He has a lot of genuineness. If you see this song, his eyes have a lot of genuineness when he looks at you with love.
In my opinion, Shah Rukh can romance this mike also. He can look at the mike with the same kind of love he would look at the most beautiful woman in the world, she said.
To this, SRK added in a lighter vein, As long as youre holding it I can romance it, otherwise no.
They were speaking at the launch of Hawayein song from the movie, on Wednesday. The duo was accompanied by filmmaker Imtiaz Ali and music composer Pritam.
The 29-year-old actor has worked with directors like Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra but said the best part about Imtiaz, with whom she has teamed up for the first time, was the moments he brought out between the two characters.
His films are love stories but I dont think the characters are aware that they are in love. There is some internal travel, soul searching which happens and then they realise it, she said.
Thats when they discover love... he has a very deep understanding of a man-woman relationship, she added.
The film is scheduled to release on August 4. Hindustan Times
The blockbuster Hindi movie Jab Harry Met Sejal will be screening with English subtitles from August 4 at CEL circuit cinemas.

Successive govts have completely neglected export sector - Harin de Silva
Successive governments have completely neglected the export sector for far too long which has resulted in exports declining by the year, said President of exporters association (EASL) Harin de Silva.
Speaking at their Annual General Meeting at Hotel Ramada, he said that time and again exporters have stressed the importance and need for a strong and positive political will and vision to drive the export sector to reach its full potential.
The EASL has always been extremely vocal in asking successive regimes to include the association in its endeavors to shape export policy through a public private sector partnership whereby a new model of advocacy is developed under the new governments slogan of good governance.
He said that the present government has looked at their suggestion positively and asked to make representations to the government on a yearly basis. This is a welcome move, he said.
Commenting on the restoring GSP+ back to Sri Lanka he said it will most certainly come with fair share of challenges. Those exporters who shifted away from markets based in the EU since GSP+ was withdrawn from Sri Lanka will take time to re-establish themselves back in markets based in the EU.
Limited production capacities in Sri Lanka have severely hampered the Sri Lankan export fraternity to cater to the additional demand the GSP.
With many key geopolitical developments such as Brexit shaping the course of global economics, it is fair to say that Sri Lanka has a massive challenge in being competitive in our exports when compared to countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia who have continued to grow their export sectors in spite of external constraints of this nature. Capacity constrains in terms of labour shortages is one challenge that springs to mind which has been highlighted in many forums by stake holders. With Brexit now unraveling itself in the EU Sri Lanka is faced with a very unique challenge that will have negative impact on realizing the GSP+ benefits especially for sectors like the apparel sector as the UK accounts for 40% of Sri Lankas apparel exports into the EU, he opined.
Meanwhile Minister of State for Enterprise Development Sujeeva Senasinghe said that the government should try to force the rich to pay more taxes and reduces the indirect tax revenue which is around 80%
He said that the affluent pays only around 11% taxes of the total of GDP and this should move up to 20%. The government has in the recent times moved this up from 11% to 14% and a further 5% increase is needed.
He emphasized that no new taxes were needed but only loop holes in the tax system should be tightened. He said that these additional tax revenue can be used for infrastructure development of the country. (SS)

Ten killed as Venezuela vote turns violent
VENEZUELA: A wave of bloodshed swept Venezuela Sunday as troops cracked down on violent protests against elections to choose the members of a powerful assembly that President Nicolas Maduro has tasked with writing a new constitution.
Protesters attacked polling stations and barricaded streets around the country, drawing a bloody response from security forces, who opened fire with live ammunition in some cases.
At least 10 people were killed, prompting the United States to threaten further strong and swift sanctions on Maduros government.
Senior opposition leader Henrique Capriles called on Venezuelans to continue defying the deeply unpopular Maduro with new protests against the election and the massacre he said accompanied it.
We do not recognize this fraudulent process, he said at the close of voting, calling for nationwide marches Monday and a mass protest in Caracas Wednesday, the day the new Constituent Assembly is due to be installed.
Maduro has decreed a ban on protests during and after the vote, threatening prison terms of up to 10 years.
The socialist president is gambling his four-year rule on the 545-member assembly, which will be empowered to dissolve the opposition-controlled congress and rewrite the Constitution. But the unrest fueled fears that his insistence on convening the assembly -- despite months of demonstrations and fierce international criticism -- would only plunge the country deeper into chaos.
Prosecutors said 10 people were killed in violence around the vote, bringing the death toll in four months of protests to some 120 people.
Those killed included a candidate for the new assembly, a regional opposition leader, two teenage protesters and a soldier in the western state of Tachira, which saw some of the worst violence.
In eastern Caracas, seven police were wounded when an improvised explosive targeted their motorcycle convoy. National guard troops used armored vehicles, rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters blocking roads in the west of the capital. Maduro, whose term is meant to end in 2019, describes the election as the most important in Venezuelan history.
I have come to vote to tell the gringos and the opposition that we want peace, not war, and that we support Maduro, said voter Ana Contreras.
Turnout will be key to determining the legitimacy of the election.
But that will be difficult to ascertain, as most voters will be able to vote twice: once by region and once by social or industrial sector.
According to polling firm Datanalisis, more than 70 percent of Venezuelans oppose the idea of the new assembly -- and 80 percent reject Maduros leadership. Fear of the violence worsening has rippled across the region, and beyond.
The US, the EU, Canada and Latin American powers including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have condemned the election.
Maduros sham election is another step toward dictatorship, tweeted US envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley.
Britains junior foreign minister Alan Duncan also described the vote as a sham, as did many experts. - AFP

Track king Bolt eyes final hurrah
LONDON: Sprint superstar Usain Bolt will seek a final golden hurrah when he takes to the track at the IAAF World Championships in London this week.
Bolt has dominated sprinting since taking double individual gold at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, going on to win a further six Olympic golds and also picking up 11 world titles.
World records of 9.58 and 19.19sec in the 100 and 200m when winning in the 2009 Berlin worlds were followed by the towering Jamaican winning consecutive world golds in the 100, 200 and 4x100m relay in 2011, 2013 and 2015, with the exception of a false start in the 100m in Daegu in 2011.
The 30-year-old scored triple gold at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics in London and Rio, his sole hiccup being stripped of his 2008 Olympic relay gold after teammate Nesta Carter failed a drugs test.
It is a staggering tally for a track athlete who has admitted he wants to go out on a high as athletics seeks to turn a new page.
My main aim is just to win (in London). I just want to retire on a winning note, Bolt said recently in Monaco, where he won the 100m in 9.95sec, dipping under the 10sec barrier after two sluggish outings in Kingston and Ostrava.
Bolt has opted not to defend his 200m world title, meaning he will not race against South Africas Wayde van Niekerk, the athlete Bolt has tipped to take over as the next track and field superstar.
Thats one of the most disappointing things in my career now, he said. He came along at this late stage and I didnt get to compete against him, because I think hes one of the best now. World and Olympic 400m champion Van Niekerk, who will attempt an audacious 200-400m double in London, added: Usain has been a massive inspiration.
But Ive still got quite a long way to go before I even get close to the heights that Usain has reached. One of the stand-out moments of the 2012 Olympics at the same stadium in east London was Super Saturday, when Britain won three gold medals in the space of an hour to set the packed stadium alight.
Distance running legend Mo Farah, on an unbroken streak of nine global final wins (the 5000m in 2011, and the 5/10km double in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016). will again compete, but there is no Jessica Ennis-Hill, the heptathlete having retired, or long jumper Chris Rutherford, out injured.
But Ennis-Hill will sit atop the podium once more as the world champs sees the reallocation of a number of medals from previous championships including two golds. The upgrades follow the disqualification of the results of the original medallists after their sanction for anti-doping rule violations.
Ennis-Hill will pick up a 2011 gold and the US womens team the 2013 4x400m title.
Im delighted that the athletes are properly honoured for their achievements and what better way than in front of passionate athletics fans at a major championship, said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
For those receiving gold medals, their moment in London will be all the more special as they will hear their national anthem played. Whatever their nationality, clean athletes worldwide will celebrate with them. Coe, a two-time Olympic 1500m gold medallist, will chair a series of IAAF meetings in the run-up to Fridays start of the track and field proper.
Coe heads up the IAAF Council meeting on Monday, with lively discussion expected on Russia, which will miss the worlds because of its state-sponsored doping programme that also saw its athletes barred from the Rio Olympics.
Since then several Russian athletes have been cleared to compete under a neutral flag as the IAAF works with all parties to ensure a transparent anti-doping culture in the track and field powerhouse.
The Council meet is followed by the 51st IAAF Congress with Coe on hand to launch an innovative one-day convention called IAAF Athletics Connect on Wednesday.
Tellingly, in Bolts swansong season, the convention is designed to prompt discussion about building a strong future for athletics. AFP

Two cases against Shashi Weerawansa fixed for further trial

Two cases filed against Shashi Weerawansa, the wife of National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa, over an incident where she had fraudulently obtained two passports, including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Immigration and Emigration Department, were yesterday fixed for further trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
The seventh, 16th and 17th witnesses of the case were noticed to appear in Courts on May 25, 30 and 31 by Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara. On a previous occasion, in his evidence, an Assistant Commissioner attached to the Department of Registration of Persons had informed Court that Shashi Weerawansa had applied for a National Identity Card (NIC) in 2010 as a person who applied for the first time. He said the accused had submitted her application for an NIC at the age of 39 as a person who never obtained an NIC.
When the cases came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, defence counsel appearing on behalf of the accused sought a further date for the trial citing that they are required to peruse a document.
The CID had filed two charge sheets against Shashi Weerawansa that she had fraudulently obtained two passports, including a diplomatic passport by submitting forged documents to the Immigration and Emigration Department.
The witness had earlier informed Chief Magistrate Bandara that an article published on Ravaya newspaper had revealed the accused had possessed two identity cards by two different numbers indicating that she was born in 1967 and 1971.
The case was fixed for further trial on August 29. The witness is to be cross-examined on the next trial date.
On a previous occasion, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) filed a charge sheet against Shashi Weerawansa under two counts.
Shashi Weerawansa was arrested on February, 2015 over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passports illegally.
She had allegedly submitted birth certificate with forged names and dates of birth to obtain the passports. She is out on bail.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, Chief Inspector Jayantha and Police Constable Ganegedara of CID prosecuted. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appeared for the accused.

US imposes sanctions on Venezuelan leader Nicols Maduro

The US government has branded Venezuela's President Nicols Maduro "a dictator" and frozen any US assets, after he held a controversial poll.
Under the sanctions, US firms and individuals are banned from doing business with Maduro.
The election of a constituent assembly on Sunday was held amid mass protests. At least 10 people were killed.
Maduro saidthe poll was a "vote for the revolution", saying "sanctions from the empire don't scare me".
"The emperor Donald Trump took decisions against me that show his desperation and hate," President Maduro said in a televised speech on Monday.
"I don't obey orders from foreign governments and never will... Sanction me as you wish, but the Venezuelan people have decided to be free and I am the independent President of a free nation."
Venezuela's new constituent assembly will have the power to rewrite the constitution and disband the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
The opposition coalition, which boycotted the election, said 88% of voters had abstained. It has refused to recognise the election. Electoral officials said the turnout was 41.5%.
Protesters have blocked a number of roads in the capital, Caracas.
A march scheduled for later on Monday to honour those killed on polling day appears to have been postponed until Wednesday, the day that the constituent assembly is due to meet.
Venezuela's attorney general, Luisa Ortega, a vocal critic of the Maduro government, called the vote an expression of "dictatorial ambition".
The US had previously warned that it would not recognise the election, with President Donald Trump vowing "strong and swift economic actions" if it went ahead.
The sanctions wereannounced in a statement by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
"Yesterday's illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people," he said.
"By sanctioning Maduro, the United States makes clear our opposition to the policies of his regime and our support for the people of Venezuela who seek to return their country to a full and prosperous democracy."
Maduro is only the fourth foreign leader to be blacklisted in this way, Mnuchin said.
US National Security Adviser HR McMaster said the Venezuelan leader had joined an "exclusive club" that also includes Syria's Bashar al-Assad, North Korea's Kim Jong-un, and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.
On 26 July, the US Treasury had imposed sanctions on 13 current and former Venezuelan officials in a bid to deter Maduro from holding the poll.
Those targeted include the interior minister and the head of the army.
"Who do these imperialists in the United States think they are" Maduro said in response to these sanctions. "The government of the world"
He called the sanctions "illegal, insolent and unprecedented".
International condemnation of the latest vote was widespread on Monday. The EU expressed "preoccupation for the fate of democracy in Venezuela", and said it doubted it could accept the results.
However, Russia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia have stood by Maduro.
Venezuela's 30 million citizens are suffering through shortages of basic goods and medicines, as the country's weakened economy declines still further.
A wave of anti-government protests has left more than 120 people dead in four months.
So far, Washington has not imposed restrictions on the country's huge oil exports to the US.
Mnuchin would not confirm whether oil sanctions were being considered, but said President Trump had decided not to take measures that would hurt the "Venezuelan people" rather than Maduro's allies.
The Treasury secretary also urged those elected to the 545-member Constituent Assembly not to take their seats.
Last week, he warned that those elected could be subject to US sanctions for "undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela".

A vengeful whack as bottom line payback!
Putdowns and bullies used to make me mad. But the best advice I ever had was given by my old Grandpop who said: Dont get mad, get even. And so I started striking back at a very early age.
You don't need to go overboard, and there's no point doing anything illegal or it could just end up getting you into trouble. But you can find safe and legal ways to get your own back and have fun doing it.
And if you are the goody-goody type who preaches that payback is a swine and revenge is sweet then I'm the sweetest swine you will ever meet. Now look there is nothing vindictive about looking for healthy justice.
Besides, I don't care what you think of me, because it couldn't be half as bad as what I think of you. I dance to my own band and it doesn't matter if they're a little out of tune.
In primary school, we 10-year-olds were extremely unfortunate to be in the clutches of a merciless teacher, I had nicknamed London Canda. He was my Grade IV class teacher, who we all looked upon in a mixture of awe, admiration and amusement. He appeared to take a vicarious delight in flogging some of us pitilessly. He indulged in a sadistic pleasure in thrashing his pupils in turn, one after the other for the most trifling infringements.
He had the proper combination of humour and authority required to deal with students such as us  a caboodle of raucous, rowdy and rebellious rapscallions. But I must concede that although his style of imparting education was unconventional it was effective.
He meted out his own brand of painful punishment to the recalcitrant rascals, although not always even-handedly. He was judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one. We were convinced then that the Spanish inquisitors could have taken a leaf from his agonisingly inventive forms of punishment that were mostly dictated by whim.
There was not much margin for error in that time and place and corporal punishment even for the slightest infraction was the norm. British-style formal caning was fully lawful in Ceylon schools then and strongly supported by the government. Most of the countrys secondary schools used the cane, which was a significant element in the disciplinary system. But such punishment rarely fitted the crime, so to say, and provided a free rein for appalling abuse by many tyrannical pedagogues. This sternness notwithstanding , London Candas classes were always conducive to learning. He worked us hard, giving us big and challenging assignments such as requiring a weekend diary complete with an illustration to highlight the event. I was no Michelangelo and never aspired to be one. But I managed to sketch a fairly good cartoon likeness of him to illustrate the satirical text about him. Of course I cheated by tracing a caricature of him from an old school magazine and touching it up to make him look as grotesque as ever.
My classmates thought my diary jottings and sketches were hilarious. But old London Canda caught on to my shenanigans quite quickly. While perusing my diary and drawings he would subconsciously draw not his paintbrush but his cane. As the swish of his switch blistered my tender bottom I wondered as a lampooning artist whether I would ever be able to even draw breath.
As the Lord High Executioner he was never moved by tears. Ok, I concede I cried once. That was enough weakness. Real men don't cry. They seek revenge. From then on he knew he was dealing with a hellion who mostly beat him to the verbal punch.
In religious knowledge class Canda jocosely explained the seventh commandment. Unable to resist a crack at him  and not Gods decree  I scrawled on a page of a notebook I kept: Thou shall not covet thy neighbours wife. This commandment thou shall not slaughter. But thanks be to God there is no commandment which says thou shall not covet thy neighbours daughter!
Unfortunately by some quirk of fate the notebook got into Candas clutches. He smacked me consistently for my poetic philosophical propounding and made me stand outside the class as a punishment for what he termed as Blasphemy. The primary department Principal, a Christian Brother, doing his regular rounds queried as to why I was being punished. Canda said I had blasphemed. I accompanied the brother to his office and on reading the incriminating evidence he laughed till he was on the verge of apoplexy. I was exonerated with a warning to keep my theories out of sight of all teachers.
Now London Canda, also doubled as the Under XII cricket coach who lined up ten and eleven year olds against the sightscreen and dispensed catching practice. We were genuine cannon fodder as the powerfully pitched hard, red blur hurtled missile-like towards our heads and chests. Our very lives depended on quick reflexes as we learned to hold on despite suffering from bruised torsos and almost having our heads scalped Apache-style. But some of us managed to exact sweet revenge on the ostensible horrors perpetrated on us. I recall the time when London Canda took strike in the middle at a practice session. He was in the process of demonstrating to his charges a cover drive or so he imagined. Being average height for an adult he was forced to bend more than he usually did as he was wielding a junior sized willow.
He ordered me to bowl a straight ball at him, reminding me sternly: And none of your swing, you rascally thing! I could hardly believe my good fortune. To me it was a dream come true. I resorted to a longer than usual run-up. This was my opportunity to get even and administer a vengeful arse-bite to a pedagogue who had been responsible for blistering generations of tender bottoms.
Galloping in I pitched in an out-swinger with all my might and sinew. My target: His protruding posterior. Bent double while holding the small bat he had to take sudden evasive action with a bum-jerk reaction that made him look all kinds of a fool. But it was a little too late to save his hind-end from a retributive searing.
Much to the amusement of the onlookers I scored a bulls-eye. You may say I hit two targets with one ball, in that the leather ricocheted off his ample rump and ripped out his middle stump. It was the bottom line payback. And for me one of lifes most therapeutic moments!

CEB will protest against SAITM
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees will collaborate for the national protest day to protest against the execution of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) as a private medical college, CEB Joint Trade Union Convener Ranjan Jayalal said.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that August 2 had been declared as the National Protest Day to carry out protests island-wide to stand against SAITM and CEB employees will provide their fullest cooperation for it.
Jayalal also said that prevailing issues could be solved only through trade union actions and not through conducting and protests or through peaceful discussions with the authorities.
The convener also warned that the civil laws would be violated if no appropriate solution would be presented to issues of the labourers, including the issue related to SAITM.
CEB is not an organisation which operates with a financial loss. The leaders of the country have contributed to bring CEB to the state to run at a loss. Therefore, its the Governments responsibility to restructure the organisation to deliver efficient services, as well as to earn revenue for the organisation, he added.
Jayalal further said that if no favourable response would be received from the Government in relation to the prevailing issues including the SAITM issue and the attack on petroleum trade union members, a trade union action would be organised by the CEB employees after August 4.
Lanka Viduli Podu Sewaka Sangamaya (LVPSS) President Malaka Wickremasinghe also participated.

## Title: Htota Port deal boosts  foreign exchange reserves

Htota Port deal boosts  foreign exchange reserves
The deal to sell a majority stake in Hambantota Port to China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited for $1.12 billion and under a lease term of 99 years is credit positive for the sovereign because it will boost foreign-exchange reserves, Moodys said.
This will ease the governments external liquidity position ahead of several large international bond payments in 2019-22.
Earnings from the Hambantota Port stake sale will feed into the central banks foreign-exchange reserves, which will help bolster investor confidence and encourage future portfolio inflows. Importantly, the sale will allow the government to set aside earnings to repay its upcoming debt maturities and reduce its external debt, a key constraint on Sri Lankas credit quality. External debt maturities in 2019-22 total $13.8 billion.
Sri Lankas balance-of-payments position remains vulnerable after foreign-currency reserves materially declined in late 2016 and early 2017. More recently, reserves have risen somewhat because of capital inflows from international sovereign bond issuance and syndicated loans.
As of June 2017, gross official foreign-exchange reserves (including gold and special drawing rights) were $6.9 billion.
The foreign-currency reserves portion of gross reserves was slightly under $6 billion (see Exhibit 2), covering about 3.75 months of imports, just above the International Monetary Funds (IMF) minimum reserves adequacy threshold of three months.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka intends to increase gross official reserve assets to at least $7.4 billion by the end of 2017, in accordance with the targets under Sri Lankas current three-year IMF Extended Fund Facility program. Moodys expects the central bank to come close to its target, which would help support the sovereigns credit quality.
Moving forward, greater exchange-rate flexibility and more limited foreign-exchange interventions by the central bank would help preserve reserves.
Although the Hambantota receipts will ease external pressures, we expect those challenges to remain, given persistent elevated government debt and large borrowing requirements. Moodys expect Sri Lankas external vulnerability indicator, which measures the ratio of external debt payments that are due over the next year to foreign-exchange reserves, to rise to about 183% in 2017 from around 150% in 2016.
Development of the broader Hambantota Port area will help bring in foreign direct investment, especially from China.
The buildup of associated infrastructure surrounding the port also can help attract greater private-sector investments.
This, together with other ongoing development projects such as the Western Region Megapolis Plan and Colombo Financial City Project, will provide a stable source of financing for Sri Lankas external position and support economic growth.
Closure of the long-pending deal also will allow the government to focus on key priorities, including advancing economic and structural reforms under its IMF program.

Indian govt open to foreign  airline taking stake in Air India
The Indian government may not be averse to the prospect of allowing overseas carriers to bid for stakes in Air India, according to a senior government official.
This (sale to foreign airlines) was one of the options suggested in the presentation made to the ministerial panel by the aviation secretary, said the official.
The ministerial panel did not object to the idea of a foreign partner for the national carrier and foreign airlines could be allowed to bid for the national carrier.
The discussion took place last Friday at the first meeting of the panel led by finance minister Arun Jaitley thats looking into possible options for Air Indias disinvestment. Others at the meeting included aviation minister Ashok Gajapati Raju, power minister Piyush Goyal and railway minister Suresh Prabhu.
Analysts said Air India would fetch a fair price if overseas airlines are allowed to bid for it.
Foreign airline equity participation up to 49% in AIs divestment will be critical to achieve a successful outcome for the government, said Kapil Kaul, CEO, CAPA South Asia. Restricting foreign airlines will send a wrong signal globally and significantly constrain the number of interested bidders."
The aviation ministry is said to be working on various options, one of which could be to sell assets and subsidiaries to clear the working capital debt but some analysts said this may not be the right way to go.
Each asset sold would make the airline less lucrative for the prospective buyer, said Amrit Pandurangi, former director at Delloitte and an aviation analyst. The government should look at other means to address this debt and not by selling the subsidiaries of the airline.

Learnings from Sri Lanka has propelled our practice -  MTIs Bangladesh Head
Commenting on the completion of 14 years since MTI set-up its fully-owned Bangladesh subsidiary and coinciding with MTI CEOs visit to Dhaka, Saima Mazhar (Country Manager) said, Our Sri Lankan operations has provided an excellent learning platform and sharing of experiences that has helped MTI Bangladesh to propel as one of Bangladeshs leading strategy consultancies. We have immensely benefited from the Sri Lankan experience and regular cross-border project initiatives, that has speeded up our learning curve. I also feel that both at an enterprise and country level, there is a lot that Bangladesh can learn from Sri Lanka.
MTI Bangladesh headed by Saima Mazhar (who is also a board director of MTI Sri Lanka) has been in operations since 2005 and has worked with some of Bangladeshs leading business groups and industry majors. Saima has led a young team of consultants and analysts, who have delivered some successful projects to conglomerates and family-owned businesses. MTI Bangladesh focuses on advisory and related services in the areas of strategy, re-structuring, process re-engineering and market feasibilities.

National Protest Day tomorrow
The National Protest Day organised by the Anti-SAITM Peoples Barricade will be held countrywide tomorrow. The event aims at opening the eyes and ears of the Government, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said raising awareness of the public and the launch of the poster campaign will take place today at Lipton Circus, Colombo. The GMOA will extend the fullest support to the anti-SAITM organisation, he said.
Inter-Company Employees Union President Wasantha Samarasinghe said the end of the Government will be marked by the SAITM issue.
The Government should solve the issue without pushing the country into a general strike. Nobody demanded the Government to take over the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital. It is maintained with the tax money of the people, he said.
Samarasinghe said the people have joined hands against SAITM. It is not a minor protest by a group of individuals. Over 8,000 medical students have not attended lectures for eight months. About 600 lecturers do not conduct lectures for medical students, he said.
Black flags will be hoisted in protest of SAITM. Anti-SAITM walks, protests and leaflet distribution campaigns will take place countrywide, he said.

Second Innings brings fresh hopes
Deveni Inima (Second Innings) now being telecast on TV Derana has captured the attention of local teledrama viewers across the board.
Parents sit with their young ones before the TV to go down memory lane recalling their schooling days and what they have achieved and missed out on during their times as budding youngsters.
Subsequent to the Golu Hadawatha novel/cinema and the 1979 cartoon creation Ithin Ita Passae in Siththara paper, popularity of such magnitude by the masses is gained by the Deveni Inima teledrama.
The director of Deveni Inima is none other than Saranga Mendis who directed the mind blowing teledrama, Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli, a sequel to the book and the film with the same name by Anura Horatious and Udayakantha Warnasuriya.
In the midst of shooting some decisive scenes in Deveni Inima the young director found time to talk to the Daily News T&C.
Q: Deveni Inima is poised to break many records in the local teledrama sphere.
We are reaping the harvest of what we have sowed and I am a content person as the director.
Q: Deveni Inima is your third teledrama. It has a unique presentation style just as your first two teledramas, Gini Avi and Dedunnai Adarae.
According to my point of view a teledrama director or a film director should not try to boost his/her image via his works. We have to adapt a style best suited for a particular creation although our philosophy could be a different one. I personally like to differentiate my works and hate to confine to a particular genre.
The most important thing is to be sincere to your creation and Deveni Inima is sheer proof of that fact.
Q: How did your past experiences pave way for Deveni Inima
A. After Gini Avi became a huge success, TV Derana invited me to do an original Sinhala teledrama to counter Sinhala dubbed versions of Indian teledramas shown on local TV channels. Hence I did Dedunnai Adarae.
With Dedunnai Adarae we were able to address the market segment of viewers who have been watching dubbed teledramas brought from India.
But I must admit Dedunnai Adarae had its pros and cons due to Pro-Indian presentation style. Thus it did not attract Sri Lankan audiences to the anticipated level.
However via Dedunnai Adarae we proved that we can counter Indian soap operas dubbed in Sinhala with local products.
Subsequently we teamed up to do Deveni Inima inducing it a more local touch while maintaining Bollywood attributes, taking the hint from Sinhala films made in 1970s. This experiment really worked.
Laksiri Wickramage, Madhawa Madawala, Charith Kothelawala of TV Derana, myself, my wife Chamika Mendis (producer) and the script writer Saman Edirimuni sat together and discussed lengthily prior to writing the Deveni Inima story.
Q: Some people try to compare Deveni Inima with the films Golu Hadawatha and Gehenu Lamai.
It is a foolish thing to do. Golu Hadawatha and Gehenu Lamai in their totality were made in different contexts when the world was different. Now we live in a digital era and the thinking patterns of youth and people in general in the present context are very different.
See the big picture. In Deveni Inima we shed light on love and compassion that has a universal appeal. We never harp on sensuality.
In that sense Samalka in Deveni Inima could be the same character of Dhammi in Golu Hadawatha living in a totally different context.
Q: Why did you cast dream star singers and TV presenters as actors in Deveni Inima
There were two reasons for this move. We wanted to cast new faces in our story and by doing that we intended to induce novelty to the story.
The other reason is the prior exposure of these youngsters to show business. As up-and-coming singers and presenters they have performed before huge audiences and had been taught by TV Derana how to face the camera. Hence it was easy to direct these resourceful youngsters.
We have no acting schools or academies here so we are compelled to resort to such means in selecting new actors.
Of course we did rehearsals to fine-tune their raw talents. Senior actors who perform with them guided them well through the process. All-in-all there is a fine blend of seasoned and new actors.
Q. How does the script contribute towards Deveni Inima
Saman Edirimunis contribution as the script writer is enormous. The dialogues written by him are so powerful that it keeps me at ease when directing the teledrama.
Saman also writes the script of Sindu teledrama which is telecasting over TV Derana and the Seya radio play that is now being aired.
I have a constant dialogue with him and this is team work at its best.
Q. Is Deveni Inima a copy
There is a saying; there are only six stories in the world. Thus one can even assume Deveni Inima is copied from Saththa Kumba Jathaka story that talks of two little parrots being brought up in two different environments.
Q: Some young actors and actresses in Deveni Inima seem to develop star qualities.
People flock to see Anuhas when we shoot. That reminds us of the 70s decade when people were yearning to have a glimpse of Vijeya Kumaratunga in real life.
Anura Horatious called me from Australia and said the actor who plays Avantha has the prowess of an actor like Dommie Jayawardene.
Q: How is the local teledrama industry progressing at present
There is a great disparity when it comes to distribution of finances. The cash flow must be streamlined and for that to happen there should be unity amongst people in the fraternity.
