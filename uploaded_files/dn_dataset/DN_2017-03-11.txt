AIADMK, DMK members raise  fisherman killing issue in Parliament
Members from AIADMK and DMK on Friday raised the issue of killing of an Indian fisherman allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy in Parliament and asked the government to give a strong message to Sri Lanka.
In the Rajya Sabha, the issue was raised by Kanimozhi of DMK and S.R.Balasubramaniam of AIADMK, to which the government responded by saying that the matter has been taken up with the Sri Lankan government.
The government has taken this matter and the welfare and concerns of all fishermen most seriously. We have raised this issue through Vice President on the sidelines of a summit in Indonesia.
The government of Sri Lanka has promised full investigation, Minister of State for External Affairs M J Akbar said.Vice President Hamid Ansari had raised this issue during his bilateral meeting with Sri Lankan President Maithripala Srisena on the sidelines of the Summit of Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) on March 7. A 22-year-old Indian fisherman was shot dead on Monday last while he was fishing in a mechanised boat a short distance off the Katchatheevu islet.
Local fishermen alleged that he was killed by the Sri Lankan Navy while another was injured.
Kanimozhi said many fishermen have lost their lives and their livelihood has been affected. They (fishermen) are worried and they are not sure about coming back alive if they go for fishing, she said.
Describing this as a burning issue in Tamil Nadu, she said the central government is not responding. Kanimozhi asked the Centre to take steps for the welfare of fishermen since it claims to be a strong government.
She demanded that a full discussion should be allowed on this matter. Balasubramaniam said the killing of fishermen is not justifiable under any circumstances and this incident should be strongly condemned. He also said a strong message should be given to the Sri Lankan government. Madhusudan Mistry of Congress raised the issue of arrest of fishermen by Pakistan recently and asked why the government is not taking any action. Responding to this, Akbar said that, the issue of fishermen has a long history and this is the most unfortunate incident.
In the Lok Sabha, the issue was raised by J Jayavardhan of AIADMK who demanded that Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India should be summoned by the Ministry of External Affairs to lodge a protest.

Angela Lee:The worlds youngest martial arts  champion
When 20-year-old undefeated female professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Angela Lee walks into the room its a slightly strange moment.
With a white frangipani flower behind her ear and her highlighted hair bouncing around her shoulders, the smiling 5 foot 4 inch Lee cuts a friendly figure.
Is this the same woman who appeared on pay-per-view TV around the world last May, punching, kicking and grappling to defeat experienced Japanese fighter Mei Yamaguchi
The same fierce fighter who, aged 19, secured the inaugural ONE Championship (ONE) womens atomweight title, becoming the worlds youngest MMA champion, earning her comparisons with boxing legend Mike Tyson, who achieved his first world title aged 20
As a small child growing up, I always wanted to be a world champion, Lee tells CNN in Bangkok, where she is training for her next big fight.
Since achieving that goal, she has become one of the most popular MMA fighters in Asia -- male or female. She has thousands of followers on social media and is constantly cited by MMA journalists as one of the top athletes in the game.
Lee says its important for females to defend themselves.
Undefeated with six wins, five by submission -- including an ultra rare twister spinal lock submission -- Lees ground game is notoriously slick. As that frangipani hints, she has a style of her own.
A family of fighters
Born in Canada to a Singaporean father and a South Korean mother, Lee comes from a family of fighters. Her three younger siblings -- two brothers and a sister -- all practice martial arts, while her parents are both highly decorated martial arts competitors and instructors.
Lee says shes been training since she could walk.
And while its her dad, Ken, and her 18-year-old brother Christian -- also a professional fighter with ONE Championship -- that fans see in her corner on fight night, Lee credits her mother for teaching her to be a strong and independent woman.
Growing up with my mom as a martial arts instructor, and also the additional values that I learned from mixed martial arts, really shaped me into the kind of person I am today, she says. Her dad, meanwhile, gave her a versatile grounding in MMA, a sport that has evolved dramatically over the last 20 years and entails using a combination of moves from different martial arts disciplines to defeat an opponent. Growing up with my dad, I was able to learn all those styles and incorporate them into the new style of MMA that is fought today, says Lee.
(I learned to use) everything from striking, boxing, kickboxing and Muay Thai to things like wrestling and judo on the ground. I think thats the beautiful thing about this sport. Its constantly forcing you to evolve and improve in all areas.
Making a mans world her own
Today Lee divides her time between Hawaii, where the family moved when she was young, and Singapore, where shes a member of the Evolve fight team and competes with the ONE Championship organization -- considered by many to be the Asian equivalent of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), an American organization and the largest MMA promoter in the world.
When Lee emerged victorious from her championship fight last May, her new contract with ONE reportedly made her one of the highest paid females in the history of any MMA organization in the world.
Though specific details about her contract havent been released, ONE founder Chatri Sityodtong has publicly said that Lee is now one of the top five best-paid fighters in his organization.
He wrote in a post on his Facebook page: I believe in meritocracy and that is how all of my companies are run. Everyone should be afforded the equal opportunity to be the master of his/her own destiny through his/her thoughts, words, and actions.

Cancellation of A 350             aircraft order :Decision  taken by EMC,  relevant parties
The decision on the cancellation of three A 350 aircraft ordered for SriLankan Airlines was taken by the Economic Management Committee (EMC) after discussing with all relevant parties, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Responding to a question by UPFA MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage in Parliament yesterday, the minister pointed out the Government was left with no other option but to cancel the order for three aircraft to avert a loss of Rs.32 billion.
However, Hashim said as the subject minister he was not made aware of the procedure followed in cancelling the aircraft order, adding that steps have been taken to correct this situation and get SriLankan Airlines follow the directions of the Ministry.
The minister also firmly refuted the allegation that the cancellation was subsequent to an email message sent by the Prime Ministers Senior Advisor Charitha Ratwatte to SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte. That message was intended only to communicate the Prime Ministers instructions to the other party, he said.
There is a massive scam behind the purchase of these three aircraft. The former Government has agreed to pay USD 1.4 million per month for each of the aircraft, whereas the market value only amounts to USD 950,000. That is USD 450,000 extra for each. When calculated for the entire lease period of 12 years, we were made to incur a loss of USD 644 million for the three aircraft. Had we purchased them, those would also have suffered an operational loss as those are long-range aircraft, he explained.
The minister pointed out there are another four A 350-900 aircraft ordered by the previous Government which are not yet cancelled. The former Government has agreed to pay USD 200 million for each of them, where as it could have been bought at USD 120 million he said.
The minister pointed out the SriLankan Airlines, which recorded Rs 4 billion profits in 2008, recorded a loss of Rs 9 billion in the year after that, and the loss increased to Rs.32 billion in 2014. By 2016, we were able to reduce the loss to Rs 16 billion and we convert it back to a profitable venture within this year, he said.
MP Aluthgamage questioned if there had been financial frauds at the SriLankan Airlines as claimed, why was not a single person arrested or brought before the law even after the lapse of two years. He repeatedly charged that the powers of subject ministers had been overpowered by certain figures in the government and important decisions are made overlooking the relevant ministers.
Minister Hashim replied that the practice of overlooking the subject ministers first started during the former Government, adding that Cabinet approval had not been sought before purchasing these aircraft and that the subject minister and his deputy were in dark over these purchases.

Davis Cup matches to be shortened
The International Tennis Federation's board of directors has endorsed plans to change Davis Cup matches from best-of-five sets to best-of-three.
The ITF has been looking at ways to make the competition more attractive to the leading players, who are sitting out ties in ever increasing numbers.
Davis Cup could also join Fed Cup in staging matches over two days instead of three, although that proposal remains under discussion.
A statement from the ITF read: 'At their meeting in Indian Wells, the ITF Board of Directors unanimously endorsed a package of comprehensive reforms for Davis Cup and Fed Cup by BNP Paribas.
'These include Davis Cup matches being played over three sets rather than five sets following a review of current match formats.
'Further discussions on the implementation of best-of-three-sets matches across either two or three days are continuing with all stakeholders.
'All recommendations will be put to the ITF AGM in August 2017, with all changes requiring a formal vote of approval.'
There is likely to be little opposition to the change of format, but other proposals put forward by ITF president David Haggerty, who has made reforming the competition a focus since his appointment in September 2015, are more controversial.
Plans for the final to be staged at a neutral venue have been particularly contentious.
Talking last November, Novak Djokovic, a member of the ATP Player Council, said: 'ITF owns Davis Cup. ITF hasn't been really very helpful with the players' demands.
'The only thing that they wanted to change is the neutral final, which, talking to all the players on the council, most of the players also around the tour, nobody agrees with that.
'You're taking away from the players the one thing that players love about Davis Cup, which is the home tie, the home crowd.'
Shortening the format would lessen the demand on the top players but would not address the key issue - the timing of the ties in the calendar.
This year's first-round matches were staged the weekend after the Australian Open, with Djokovic the only top-10 player to take part.  Daily Mail

Derick Raymond Memorial Cup boxing
St. Sylvesters College, one time king makers of the boxing ring will hold their Inter-House boxing tournament after many years on March 18 Saturday thanks to the efforts of the 2006 batch of Sylvestrians, who have come forward to organize this meet.
Former national champion Nimal Lewke will be the chief guest. This school has a history where they have produced some of the brilliant boxers this country has ever seen. In the 1960s and early 1970s, they really dominated the Stubbs Shield inter-schools boxing, and many of their boxers were in the Sri Lanka School Boxing teams that took part in the dual competition with Indian Schools for the M D Gunasena Trophy during that period.
This was the time Derick Raymond who was stationed at Peradeniya University as a Marshall, was in-charge of St. Sylvesters boxing. He produced brilliant boxers, who as schoolboys went on to win National Championship and even represented Sri Lanka in Commonwealth Games and Olympics. It is a fitting tribute to a person who has contributed so much to Sri Lanka boxing to be recognized and at this inter-house meet a trophy in memory of the late boxing guru Derick Raymond will be awarded to the champion house team. It was the idea of Nimal Lewke (the last National champion produced by Derick Raymond) to donate the trophy in memory of a most respected boxing coach. Raymond migrated to Australia in the early 1970s and later to UK where he passed away few years back.
The following trophies will be presented at the meet: Malcolm Bulner Challenge Trophy for Best Boxer, Derrick Gunasinghe Memorial Trophy for Junior Best Boxer and Nimal Lewke Challenge Trophy for Up and Coming Boxer.

The Sylvestrians who were invited to take first turn of the wicket were all out for 136 with Monoth Rajapakse top scoring with 40. Vidyartha coming into bat after the tea break scored 37/2 at the close.
On the second day they were struggling and had reached 104 for 8 when rain halted play 40 minutes before lunch. The awards: Man of the match - Tusith de Soysa, the best batsman - Husindu Rajapakse both Sylvestrians and the best fielders award was won by Vidyarthas Shane Danawatte. Now they are set for the one day game, which is on March 25 and the T20 on March 26 both at Pallekelle.

Gymnastics St. Sylvesters College emerged as the boys champions at the Kandy District Gymnastic championship with Ravindu Shehan, the captain winning the best prize in the competition. The meet was held at Viharamadevi Balika Vidyalaya on Sunday. St. Sylvesters is a school that indulges in this sport but lacks the facilities. So, the OBA should give the school a hand, which is badly needed. They won the event without a proper venue for training.

The female  William  Webb Ellis
William Webb Ellis will always be known as the boy who, in 1823, picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football game.
His action with a fine disregard for the rules is credited with creating the game of rugby -- though historical evidence suggests the story best fits into the category of legends or myth.
Nevertheless Webb Ellis was honored as the first inductee of what became the World Rugby Hall of Fame, with plaques and a statue in the English town of Rugby honoring his place in history. The men's World Cup trophy is also named after him.
The Hall of Fame includes 120 individual men, five teams, four institutions -- and only six women, mainly recent retirees, all admitted as recently as 2014.
But supporters of the women's game are becoming increasingly aware of another name -- Emily Valentine -- whose credentials for inclusion can rival those of Webb Ellis. Her story also takes place in the 19th century on a school playing field.
Statue of the young William Webb Ellis
Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, has had more than its share of famous alumni. Pupils who passed through the gates went on to accomplish great feats in football, cricket, athletics and the arts. Playwrights Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett honed their storytelling skills here -- but it's the tale of a 10-year-old girl which is of interest to the rugby world.
I loved rugby football, but seldom got a chance to do more than kick a place-kick or a drop-kick, but I could run in spite of petticoats and thick undergarments. I could run. My great ambition was to play in a real rugby game and score a try. Extract from Emily Valentine's journal.
Emily's father was assistant headmaster at Portora Royal in 1887, when she made her rugby debut. A more recently-retired deputy head, Robert Northridge, picks up the story.
Her brothers were playing rugby and they were a man short -- a woman short -- they were somebody short, he tells CNNs World Rugby show.
So Emily was standing, luckily suitably attired in suitable footwear, at the side of the field and they beckoned her on and said, Come on Emily, please join us in this game. She leaped at the chance to play because it was something that she'd longed to do for a very long time.
At last my chance came. I got the ball -- I can still feel the damp leather and the smell of it, and see the tag of lacing at the opening. I grasped it and ran dodging, darting, but I was so keen to score that try that I did not pass it, perhaps when I should. Extract from Emily Valentine's journal.
Northridge continues: Her parents certainly didn't find out until much later because she tells the story of them having tea later that evening and one of the boys saying We won today, mother.
And the mother said, I hope you all played well -- and one of the brothers kicked Emily under the table to make sure she didn't say anything to tell them that she had scored the winning try.
I still raced on, I could see the boy coming towards me; I dodged, yes I could and breathless, with my heart thumping, my knees shaking a bit, I ran. Yes, I had done it; one last spurt and I touched down, right on the line. I had scored my try. Extract from Emily Valentine's journal.
Northridge concludes: It was obviously one of the major moments of her life because 50 years later she could recall every detail of diving for the line and jumping up and throwing her arms in the air.
Valentine's granddaughter Catherine Galwey lives in the English city of Norwich. She remembers her grandmother documenting her life story.
She was in a nursing home in London and she didn't have much to do, so she thought she would write a biography -- a memoir for us all, Galwey tells CNN.
The whole memoir is full of life and enthusiasm, and that's how I remember her -- taking life by the horns -- and all the sad bits in it were just glossed over really.
I think she was thrilled to let rip and she didn't mind about mud and all the things that girls are supposed to mind about, and she was able run and do all those things and prove herself. - CNN

Fire alarm drama as  South Africa edge ahead
DUNEDIN March10, 2017: South Africa shrugged off a ground evacuation because of a fire alarm to reach 38 for one in the first Test against New Zealand on Friday, a lead of five runs.
With the game evenly poised after an absorbing first three days, both sides were hoping looming rain over the weekend did not dictate the outcome.
It does seem pretty even but we don't know what the weather holds. But hopefully we can make a game of it, it's always nice to get a result, said South Africa's man of the moment Keshav Maharaj.
Maharaj claimed his first five wicket haul to halt the New Zealand innings at 341 with a Kane Williamson ton and the heroics of an injury-hit Ross Taylor giving them a 33-run first-innings lead.
BJ Watling, who contributed to New Zealand's total with 50, believed a result was still possible with one crazy session that could change the balance.
We've just got to (take) each session at a time and see what that leaves us with, he said.
You can't play a game of cricket expecting it to rain because sometimes it doesn't and you get caught out. It's just the nature of the beast. South Africa lost opener Stephen Cook for a duck in the first over of their second innings and, despite a 20-minute delay when the University Oval was evacuated after a fire alarm in the main grandstand, they survived without further loss until bad light stopped play.
Firemen who searched the area blamed steam for setting off the alarm and when play resumed, in gathering gloom, New Zealand's spinners were unable to find success against Hashim Amla, who was unbeaten on 23, and Dean Elgar (12).
Cook was caught behind off Trent Boult without scoring on the fourth ball, and walked rather than seek a review -- although replays were unable to detect the ball hit the bat.
Earlier Williamson's 130 plus valuable half-centuries from Jeet Raval and Watling -- along with Taylor's late return despite a calf injury -- carried New Zealand to 341.
It was the first time in seven Tests dating back to 2012 that New Zealand have led South Africa after the first innings.
Williamson brought up his 16th Test century, putting him level with Taylor and one behind the New Zealand record of 17 held by the late Martin Crowe.
After a patient 380 minutes in the middle, in which he faced 241 deliveries, the captain was eventually undone by Kagiso Rabada who used the extra bounce and movement of the new ball to get an edge. It triggered a run of three wickets for 27 runs that had New Zealand 304 for eight when Neil Wagner levelled the scores with a nick off Vernon Philander that brushed Quinton de Kock's fingers on its way to the boundary.
Boult put New Zealand in front with a single off Maharaj but was bowled soon after by the spinner to bring Taylor back to the middle for a last stand with Wagner. With the lead secured, Wagner opened up with a six and two fours off consecutive balls from Philander and added another six and four off Maharaj.
Taylor, crippled by a calf tear that forced him from the field when on eight early in the innings, was barely able to run.
After an early single off Maharaj, his one other scoring shot came from clouting Morne Morkel over the ropes for six.
The 27-year-old Maharaj, in his fifth Test, ended the innings when he had Wagner caught by JP Duminy for 32 to claim five for 94. AFP

Hamilton calls Ferraris bluff as Vettel dazzles
Barcelona: Lewis Hamilton claimed Ferrari were bluffing after Sebastian Vettel blitzed the competition in posting the fastest time by a distance in pre-season testing in Barcelona on Thursday.
The German four-time world champion clocked 1min 19.024 around a sun-kissed Circuit de Catalunya despite appearing to ease off in the third sector of his fastest lap.
Hamilton was three tenths slower on the same ultrasoft tyre compound used by Vettel.
I think Ferrari are bluffing and that they are a lot quicker than they are showing, said the Englishman, who had a busy 24 hours in the Catalan capital.
Hamilton was putting the Mercedes W08 to the test at 9am local time (0800GMT) after being pictured celebrating Barcelonas sensational Champions League comeback against Paris Saint-Germain with Barca star Neymar into the early hours in the Catalan capital.
Mercedes have dominated for the past three seasons with Hamilton and retired world champion Nico Rosberg winning all but two of 21 races last year.
However, despite his skepticism, Hamilton does expect to be pushed all the way by Vettel as Ferrari have closed the gap following an overhaul to the sports regulations.
Its difficult right now to say exactly who is quicker, he added. They are very close if not faster.
Whatever the case, I cant wait to go out and compete. Just a couple more weeks to go.
Vettel also showed the reliability of the SF70H by logging a marathon 155 laps to also record the most miles for the day.
But Vettel insisted Mercedes remain the firm favourites for the drivers and constructors titles.

Hy Vong (Hope) Choir  at residence of SL Ambassador to Vietnam
Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.
That is what exactly happened on March 5, when the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Vietnam opened her Official Residence to hold the concert by the Hy Vong (Hope) Choir, consisting of students of Nguyen Dinh Chieu School for the Blind.
Initiated by the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Vietnam, Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake, the diplomatic community in Hanoi joined to support the concert. The Choir comprised of 20 talented visually-impaired singers and musicians who play Vietnamese folk musical instruments. They practiced under the direction of renowned musicians Ton That Triem and his opera singer spouse, Nguyen Xuan Thanh.
Triem formed the Hope Choir over 10 years ago training students to sing in many different languages. The current choristers sing in over 30 languages including Azerbaijani, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Malaysian, Polish, African, Georgian, Irish, Japanese, Welsh, Swedish, Polish, Armenian, Malay, Vietnamese, Sinhala, etc.
Addressing the audience the Ambassador explained that she had the opportunity to listen to Christmas Carols by the Hope Choir last December and how heart-warming it was to see their perseverance singing in many different languages.
Having come to know the Choirs financial difficulties to continue with their good work, she had immediately talked to Friends of the Vietnam Heritage who arranged the Christmas Carols event to raise funds. The Ambassador explaining he desire to help the choir said it is probably due to her Sri Lankan culture that values the concept of donations and sharing.

Its not a traditional Galle  turner  Tharanga
GALLE: As much as Bangladesh faces an uphill task in trying to score the remaining 390 runs for an unlikely win off a minimum of 98 overs today Sri Lanka will also have a challenge ahead of them trying to capture ten Bangladesh wickets on a Galle track described by second innings century-maker Upul Tharanga as one with less turn than its traditionally known for.
On top it is the inclement weather which threatens to disrupt the fifth and final day. The weather has already clipped off 49 overs which both sides would have valued and there is no guarantee that today it will be rain-free.
Our planning was not based on weather predictions. We cant look too much into the weather. It could rain tomorrow as well, said Tharanga at the end of the fourth day. We have 98 overs and the first hour is going to be crucial. In that first hour if we can take two-three wickets, we can turn the game in our favour.
Our aim was to give them 125 overs. The Galle wicket this one has less turn. Even on day four theres not much turn which is unusual. Bowlers need some cover as well. When they have lot of runs they can be attacking. For the fast bowlers the bounce was variable. Disappointed we didnt get a wicket today.
Scoring his maiden Test century at home Tharanga said that he was pleased to get it after his first innings failure.
I was asked whether I liked to open before the series. I stated as an opener I didnt have any issues and said yes, said Tharanga. In the last few years I batted in the middle order and in the last two series also in the same position. Wherever I play I want to do a job for the team.
Its up to the management and selectors to decide where I bat. They have used me as an opener since South Africa. If the management is happy, I am happy too.
However Tharanga admitted that being moved up and down the order was a challenge for a batsmans mental make-up.
Batting in the top order and middle order is different. I take up that as a challenge. Its all up to how I prepare. In a Test match when you open, the first hour or two, the ball seams. You have to prepare for all that. As a player you have to be prepared for such changes, said the 32-year-old left-hander from Balapitiya. ST

Katchatheevu retrieval is of no use: Pon Radhakrishnan
Lashing out at the political parties demanding the retrieval of Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka, Union Minister of State for road transport, highways and shipping, Pon Radhakrishnan, asserted that retrieving the islet will not solve the Indian fishermen issue. Those parties that put forth such a demand were only imagining things and showed that they lacked understanding on the subject, he charged.
There are several issues revolving around Katchatheevu, ceded to Lanka in 1974 by India, The BJP government was never involved in it. In fact, the Jan Sangh had then opposed ceding of India's territory to Lanka, Mr Radhakrishnan said. Speaking to reporters he said on Thursday, It is sheer imagination of certain political parties that retrieving Katchatheevu will resolve the fishermen's problems. They lack knowledge on the subject.
The issue, he argued, was not confined to the islet alone. One has to look beyond for a meaningful solution to the frequent killing of the Indian fishermen. If you think the retrieval will solve the problem.
Then you are wrong, he said and added this particular issue could be discussed when the need and such a situation arose. Recalling External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj's role in ensuring negotiations between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen and the representatives of Sri Lankan government and Tamil Nadu, Mr. Radhakrishnan said despite her health condition, Ms Sushma undertook the visit to Colombo in good faith of resolving the crisis. She had to undergo kidney transplant later on. Nowhere will you find such a minister who is dedicated to the people's cause, he added.
Union Minister of State for road transport, highways and shipping, Pon Radhakrishnan has claimed that extremist elements have infiltrated into the fishermen agitation in Rameswaram and contended that their increasing presence in the state will not augur well for the future of Tamil Nadu.
"I had warned of their infiltration during the jallikattu protest (on the sands of Marina in Chennai). Once again they have infiltrated donning a different avatar. If all the political parties understand the threat, those parties and democracy will stand to gain or else this will lead to regret later," he warned on Thursday. The infiltration of the extremist elements under various occasions, the Minister told reporters in Madurai airport, will not augur well for the entire state.
On January 25, Mr. Radhakrishnan, while alleging that "extremist forces" had infiltrated the pro-jallikattu protests and that they had "used" the youngsters, sought to know how police could allow unwanted elements to sneak in amid the students. "Why did you allow a python or cobra to sneak into a students' protest" Mr. Radhakrishnan had asked then.
Asked about the opposition to the hydrocarbon project, the Minister said certain parties were opposing the project in Neduvasal with the attitude, "Even if I lose one eye, it doesn't matter; my enemy should lose both the eyes". "But, on the other hand, we are thinking of everyone's welfare. Those political parties are playing nasty politics.
They themselves will create a situation of facing the worst consequences wherein it will be difficult for politicians to step out," Mr. Radhakrishnan said and added their opposition to the project is against democracy and the well-being of Tamil Nadu .- DECCAN CHRONICLE

Kodituwakku misses out on century as Thomians tie scores
S. Thomas College were 255 for 4 in their first innings reaching the identical total scored by Royal College in their first innings when bad light brought an abrupt end to the second day of the 3-day 138th Battle of the Blues cricket encounter played at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Thomian Sithara Hapuhinna drives a ball from Royals Ganith Sandeepa during his innings of 54 not out on the second day of 138th Battle of the Blues at the SSC grounds yesterday. 

Play was called off around 3.45 pm by umpires Messrs. Linden Hannibal and Asanga Jayasuriya as the light kept on deteriorating. A total of 40 overs were still to be bowled. On the first day too 14 overs were lost due to bad light making the total number of 54 overs lost and with only one day left a winning result in the match looks very unlikely unless something dramatic happens today.
Aided by a dropped catch in the morning, S.Thomas went on relentlessly to frustrate the Royalists after resuming at 33 for no loss.
Ravindu Kodituwakku who was unbeaten on 23 overnight was given a life at the beginning of the second day when Pasindu Sooriyabandara failed to hold on to a straightforward catch in the slips off the bowling of Ganith Sandeepa. Kodituwakkau assisted by the other opener Dulip Gunaratne began to launch the Thomian innings. The Royal bowlers were unable to purchase anything from the placid pitch and the Thomians looked set for a big score.
Kodituwakkus on drives were pleasing to watch while Gunaratne played second fiddle but rendered valuable support in pushing the score along. In the 28.3 overs bowled in the morning session S. Thomas scored 94 runs with Kodituwakku adding a further 64 runs to his overnight score. On the stroke of lunch Royal finally got the breakthrough they were looking for when Himesh Ramanayake found the edge of the bat of Gunaratne and Madarasinghe accepted the catch behind. By that time the openers had added 127 runs for the first wicket with Gunaratne striking 35 off 92 deliveries with two fours.
Ramanayake looked the pick of the Royal bowlers on an unresponsive wicket. He unsettled the batsmen with an occasional bouncer and created doubts in the minds of the batsmen. After lunch Ramanayake bowled a fiery spell and Kodituwakku approaching his century (98) succumbed to nerves rather than his ability going for an ambitious drive and edging one to the slips where Sandeepa took a neat catch. Kodituwakku faced 149 deliveries and stroked 14 fours.
Royal partially came back into the game with the dismissals of Kodituwakku, Dinura Gunawardene ( 16) and Dellon Peiris ( 6) with the score reading 174 for 4 still 81 runs behind.
But skipper Romesh Nallaperuma and wicket keeper Sithara Hapuhinna took control of the situation and took the Thomians closer to the Royal total with some sensible batting. The aggressive Hapuhinna with some lusty hits reached an unbeaten 54 and Nallaperuma remained unbeaten on 32 adding 81 unfinished runs for the fifth wicket.
Hapuhinnas 54 not out had seven boundaries after facing 71 deliveries and Nallaperuma struck four boundaries facing 68 balls for his unbeaten 32.

Lankan refugees who sheltered Edward Snowden seek Canadian asylum
Lankan refugees in Hong Kong who sheltered rogue National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden are seeking asylum in Canada.
The three families lawyers have filed claims on their behalf.
Some city legislators say two Sri Lankans who have travelled to Hong Kong have been targeted by Sri Lanka police.
The refugee families fed and housed Snowden for two weeks when he fled the US after leaking thousands of files.
They are still living in poverty in Hong Kong and unable to work after providing a refuge for the American in July 2013.
Their lawyers say it is a matter of life and death if they remain in the city.
Canadian immigration lawyer Marc-Andre Seguin said that over the past few weeks the refugees lawyers felt they needed to take additional steps to speed up the process.
Its clear that discretionary power should be applied, he told the South China Morning Post, referring to the ability by Canadas immigration minister to expedite claims.
Two of the refugees - Sri Lankan nationals Kellapatha Supun Thilina and Debagma Kankanalamage Ajith Pushpa Kumara - have said they are being illegally pursued by Sri Lanka police.
They fear being forcibly returned to Sri Lanka, and that they could face violence and torture.
The refugees also say Hong Kong authorities have questioned them on their ties to Snowden. BBC

Maria Sharapova's drug ban began an year ago  : What has the shamed tennis  star been up to
It was a year ago that Maria Sharapova hired a conference room in a Los Angeles hotel and publicly pre-empted the announcement that she had failed a test for the newly banned drug meldonium during the 2016 Australian Open.
The countdown is now on to her comeback and she is not wasting any time. Despite her 15-month ban not ending until April 26, the Wednesday of the Porsche Grand Prix in Stuttgart, the promoters are arranging the schedule to accommodate her in the draw (although she is not allowed on site until that day).
When faced with a ban for doping, most athletes decide to fade into the background. However, with her own brand to protect and a host of others to promote, the former world No 1 has been no shrinking violet.
Some of the great and good in tennis and the corporate world have chosen to overlook the reason she has been absent. One can only wonder whether, say, a leading track-and-field athlete or cyclist would have been so accommodated under the same circumstances. In between training stints and regular commercial appearances, here are some of the highlights of the past year for tennis' highest profile doping offender yet
The early weeks of Maria's suspension are spent rehabbing existing injuries, but by the end of April she is back on the court and practising

She is photographed in a Zara shirt emblazoned with the phrase 'Back in Five Minutes', which becomes a worldwide seller as they are snapped up by fans around the globe.
June 25  She enrols on a course with Harvard Business School in America and then, during Wimbledon in early July, she comes over to London to attend more classes in the prestigious institution's London branch.

As is usually the case with CAS in tennis cases, it looks favourably upon the player and the ban is reduced from two years to fifteen months.

A frantic round of sympathetic interviews and chat show appearances ensues.

Moratu Vidyalayas Gamini Perera played in 7 Big Matches
Former Moratu Vidyalaya, Ceylon Government Railways, Moratuwa Sports Club and Government Services cricketer Gamini Perera celebrates 60 years of Big Match captaincy against arch rivals Sri Sumangala College, Panadura this year. Not only as a cricketer and a past captain but also in other fields of sports like Athletics, Volleyball, Badminton and Table Tennis he brought fame and glory to his alma mater Moratu Vidyalaya. Perera speaks to the Daily News from his residence at Kadalana, Moratuwa.
Q: What is your full name and date of birth
A - Madapathage Gamini Srilal Perera. 25th July 1939.
Q: Which is your first school
A - In 1944 I was admitted to Palliyagodela Sinhala Mixed School, Rawathawatte and from there to Moratu Vidyalaya in 1949 to Grade 5.
Q:How did you commence your cricket career
A - As a schoolboy I was interested in cricket and I played soft ball cricket with my neighboring friends and my class mates. During this period our Principal was A. M. de Silva and the Master in Charge of Cricket and Prefect of Games were Mr. Manukularathna and Mr. Ranasuriya respectively. Mr. Manukulasuriya wanted to commence cricket at college and he organized inter house cricket matches and I did well and I was selected for the first eleven cricket team as an under 13 boy. Mr. De Silva arranged a big match with Methodist High School Moratumulla and their Principal was Annesley de Mel, later the President of the Ceylon National Schools. We played the big match at our grounds. Our captain was Divilton Fernando and the others were Tudor Hapugoda, Madurapala Gunaratne, Shelton Perera, Mohanlal Fernando and Vincent de Alwis to mention a few. We continued this encounter upto 1955 vice versa at De Soysa Park, Methodians home grounds. Due to unavoidable circumstances this encounter was stopped and Mr. De Silva arranged the Big Match versus Sri Sumangala College, Panadura a leading Buddhist Educational Institute in the coastal belt in 1956 and I played in this match in 56, 57 and in 1958 when I captained the team we lost to Sumangalians on our grounds. My opposite number was P. Gaminiratne. That year we played against Maliyadeva, Dharmapala, Piliyandala Central, Kalutara Vidyalaya, Gnanodaya, Tissa Central, St. Thomas Matara, St. Servatius and Rahula. I represented my school for seven years and played in seven big matches which may be a record for both schools.
Q:Did you play club cricketduring yourschool career
A - Yes. My coach Bertram de Silva took me to Moratuwa Sports Club and I played Daily News Trophy cricket. Also I represented outstation schools against Combined Schools. Our team was led by Charlie Joseph and the team included Nimal Maralanda, Dennis Ferdinands, and Suranjith Mendis to mention a few.
Q:Did you take part in any other sports at school
A  Yes, Athletics, Volleyball, Table Tennis and Badminton. I won the Discus and Javelin Throws at the Western Group Meet in the under 19 age group and went on to represent school at the Public Schools Meet in the same events. I was a member of the 4x110 and 4x440 yards relay teams and my other team mates were Laxman de Alwis, Nimal Fernando and Hector Perera. In Volleyball under my captaincy we were District Champions in the Lankadeepa Trophy and we lost to Zahira College and finally Zahira lost to Lawrence College, Gampaha in the finals captained by Sri Lanka famous spiker Sirisena.
Q:Your school is a mixed one, and how did the girls excel in sports
did not take part in sports. They played Netball and participated in sports meets. Now there are several sports for girls.
Q: What is your employment
A - I joined the Ceylon Government Railways in 1959 and served for 30 years. After my retirement they absorbed me and I worked for another 16 years for a total of 46 years. I was taken as a Trainee Engine Driver and there too I played cricket in all divisions of the Government Services and I captained for several years. Finally I played for the Veterans team too. There I played for the Volleyball team and I captained them also.
Q: Did you continue to play club cricket
A- Yes. I continued to play for Moratuwa SC upto 1970 in Sara Trophy. I played with stalwarts like D. D. Jayasinghe, Nisal Senaratne, H. I. Fernando, Stanley Fonseka, Sylvester Dias, D. C. V. Perera, Tudor Meegoda, Kingsley Fernando, R. M. Fernando, Laxman Perera, Suranjith Mendis to mention a few.
Q: Any unforgettable incident
A - Yes. Once we beat formidable University of Ceylon which consisted of players of the caliber of Carlyle de Silva, David Ponniah, Nihal Gurusinghe, Cyril Ernest, Buddy Reid, L. P. Gunathilake, Lariff Idroos, Kingsley Fernando to mention a few. We batted first and scored 187 runs and I was the top scorer with 41 runs and though this score was insufficient we got them out for 112. In another Sara match H. I. got a century and I was unbeaten at the other end with 81 and all these runs were in singles and perhaps it may be a record in Sara Trophy.
Q: You have played with fine cricketers prior to getting Test status to Sri Lanka and in your opinion who is the best batsman you have come across
A - No doubt. It is H. I. Fernando whether it is matting or turf.
Q: What is the advice you could give to the young Vidyalian cricketers
A - My advice is dont take the Big Match and the Limited Overs Match easily because the present day cricket is very tough. All the cricket playing schools are very well coached and geared. Dont under estimate your opponents and always play the game hard according to the rules and maintain discipline at all times. On the other hand dont neglect your studies at any cost. If you have good results with the sports background you will be able to find out good employment. Sports alone will not help to fit you into a better place. May the triple gem bless both schools.

Nike launches hijab for Muslim women athletes
The head cover, called the Nike Pro Hijab, boasts a single-layer pull-on design made from lightweight polyester in dark, neutral colors. The fabrics tiny holes will make it breathable while remaining opaque, a requirement for hijab-wearing women.
Nike (NKE) said it began developing the hijab after some Muslim athletes complained about wearing a traditional head scarf during competition.
The design process took 13 months, and the final product will be available for sale in the companys Spring 2018 season.
Nike said the hijab is already being worn by Emirati figure skater Zahra Lari.
I was thrilled and a bit emotional to see Nike prototyping a Hijab, Lari said in a statement. Ive tried so many different hijabs for performance, and ... so few of them actually work for me.
But once I put it on and took it for a spin on the ice, I was blown away by the fit and the light weight.
The move comes just weeks after a controversial Nike ad released in the Middle East.
It featured five successful female professional from different parts of the Arab world pursing their athletic dreams while a voice asks, what will they say about you Its a rhetorical question that many young Arab women face if they step out of cultural and traditional norms.
The video went viral with million of views on social media, prompting a debate over its message.

## Title: No dumping of garbage on UDA lands by years end: Patali

No dumping of garbage on UDA lands by years end: Patali
The Urban Development Authority (UDA) will not allow any Local Government Authority to dump garbage on its lands by the end of this year, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Garbage has been the most controversial and persistent issue the Ministry has had to deal with and has locked horns many a times with the Local Government authorities over the issue,the minister said.
Ten years ago when I was appointed as the Minister of Environment. At the time, John Seneviratne invited me to lay the foundation stone to start a waste management facility at Muthurajawela which will turn garbage into electricity. But, that facility never materialised due to various protests and today we have mountains of garbage, said Minister Ranawaka, who
awarded the contract to set up a Waste Management Facility (WMF) in Muturajawela once again to Fairway Holdings yesterday at Waters Edge.
Fairway Holdings will undertake the project via a public-private partnership with the Western Province Waste Management Authority and is expected to process 500 MT of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) per day. It will turn this garbage into 10MW of electricity back into the National Grid to power 37,500 households and produce 50,000MT of liquefied bio-fertilizer a year. The plant will cost approximately Rs 27 billion.
The Minister also awarded another contract to the Korean company KCHT Jang to build a WMF capable of handling 650MT of MSW per day in Kardiyana. The Korean factory will produce 24.8MW electricity per day and it will sell 10MW back to the National Grid.
The two projects are expected to be completed within 2-2.5 years.
Western Provincial Council Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said, After the war,it is garbage that has become our greatest challenge. The WMF will come under the purview of the Provincial Council and they would oversee its functions.
The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Province Development in turn has taken an interest in it under the clean city,
green city concept, Handling waster does not come under the UDA. It is the job of the Local Government Authority
concerned but we said we would help them find an investor and help them solve the issue, Minister Ranawaka further said.
With protests launched against the government over rising landfill sites in urban areas, Ranawaka said, Garbage has become a reality show on television today with everyone using it as a political tool. But the fact of the matter is that those who protest do not offer solutions to it and neither do they manage their own garbage properly,he said.
He added that various projects on waste management were mooted because of protests, First manage your own garbage before you point fingers at others, he said as he appealed to the collective responsibility of all to deal with garbage.
Furthermore the Megapolis ministry plans in the next three years to take over the Bloemandhal landfill and turn it into an eco-park. The Meethotumulla landfill will also be similarly turned into an eco-park with a section being used to develop infrastructure for the port.
By 2020, we hope to have a successful programme to deal with garbage in the country in place, said Ranawaka.
He also stressed that the people can no longer go on with a not-in-my-backyard attitude and that they need to be ready to pay if they keep generating more garbage, It costs around Rs 7-10 to process a kilo of garbage now, are you ready to pay,he asked.
Whoever creates garbage has to be responsible for it, it is only then we can solve this problem,added the minister.
As the Megapolis also hopes to establish townships like the Colombo Financial City, Homagama and Malabe technological parks, Ranawaka said they would ensure that their garbage and energy needs would be looked after from within and that they would not ask the local government authorities to step in.

The Public Services United Nurses Union (PSUNU) will conduct a protest campaign islandwide on March 13 and 14 against governments failure to rectify the seven demands of the Public Nursing Staff, PSUNU President Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Ven. Ananda Thera was speaking at a media briefing at the Abhayaramaya in Narahenpita yesterday.
He also said that the higher ups had been unable to satisfy needs of the Nurses Union and the Executive Committee of the PSUNU would conduct a protest campaign against it.
The Government is trying to suppress the working class by taking refraining orders from Courts, but our agitation would not be stop at any cost, Ven. Ananda Thera added.
He said that the protest would be carried out to obtain the bonuses that should be received by the public nursing staff that provides services for 12 hours per day.
Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera challenged Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to prove as to whether he had satisfied any of the needs of the public nursing staff so far.
He further asked the higher ups to present immediate solutions in order to control this situation rather than weaken the hospital system and create inconvenience to the patients.
Ven. Ananda Thera also said that they would conduct a month long protest campaign if any favourable solution was not presented by the Government.

Speaker promises to attend to JO request and give a ruling
Sandasen Marasinghe and Disna Mudalige
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that he would attend to the matter of Joint Opposition Member Wimal Weerawansa and his fellow members to sit independently in the joint opposition and give a ruling later. He also added that he needed to conduct the sessions in a fair manner.
He made this observation yesterday following MP Weerawansa's speech on the Speaker's decision delivered on Tuesday. The Speaker allowed Wimal Werawansa MP to speak on the Speaker's decision as promised earlier.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa said the members of the Joint Opposition get only 10 minutes a day to speak if there were four members to speak. He said that the official opposition in Parliament does not speak on genuine issues of the country such as the Geneva UNHRC sessions, incarceration of Intelligence Unit members, government's tendency to follow in the policies of the West and suspension of MP Dinesh Gunawardena. Part of the Opposition joined the government to suspend MP Gunawardena, while the other part kept mum.
"The National Government was formed by the UNP and the SLFP," MP Weerawansa said. "The UPFA did not join the government. Please recognize our right to dissent. You as the Speaker should respect the precedence set by your predecessors not be bound by letters and opinions of Nimal Siripala de Silva or Mahinda Amaraweera."
He also said that in 2004, the JVP contested with the UPFA and then in 2005 contested separately at the General Election. He added that the then Chair accepted the JVP as an independent group in Parliament. He also said that when W J M Lokubandara was Speaker, he left the JVP with 10 or 11 others and sat independently. The Chair accepted their right to sit independently in the House.
He requested the Chair to accept their right to act as an opposition party, adding that otherwise this problem would prevail and conducting the business of this House would be difficult.
At this staged UNP MP Hector Appuhamy raising a point of order, said that MP Weerawansa was threatening the House.
"I too need to conduct the sessions in a just and fair manner. I will discuss the issue of MP Weerawansa," the Speaker said.

I always act according to my conscience: Speaker

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday in Parliament, stressed that he always follows his conscience and that he would not remain in his position if he could not do so.
The Speaker made this comment while responding to a statement by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma. MP Alahapperuma speaking on behalf of the Joint Opposition Group appealed to the Speaker to ask his own Conscience whether he made the right decision over the JOs request. You are a well-regarded personality and there is an opinion in society that you treat everybody fairly. Your struggle to bring forth the Right to Information Bill is known. Do not destroy that image of yours. You were the UNP Deputy Leader but remember you should act independently when you are in that seat, he said.
Replying to such a statement, the Speaker noted that he was not holding any position in the UNP since he was appointed Speaker of Parliamen. I have not stepped into the Sirikotha since the last elections. I was appointed unanimously and I have a duty of being impartial to everybody. Knowing the difficulties we encountered in the Opposition, I always try to give fair hearing to the Opposition. However, at times, my hands are tied as Speaker. I cannot intervene to internal matters of parties. Those should be resolved among themselves. I took a decision over MP Dinesh Gunawardena after pleading him nine times to allow me to continue the days business without interruption. Appointing another to represent him is a decision that needs the approval of the UPFA, he explained.
MP Alahapperuma requested fair time for the JO to raise their voice in the House, observing that their group had the second majority numbering 51 members after the 106 of the UNP. What we are asking is our right to represent our people. We are not asking for luxurious building spaces or vehicles. Critical matters that affect the country are not properly brought out in the House. This is not good for democracy and is against Lichchavi principles, he said.

US ambassador in Colombo Athul Keshap were also present.
JO to continue struggle for main opposition status
Sandasen Marasinghe and Disna Mudalige
The Joint Opposition members observed that the JO would continue with their struggle to gain the status of the main opposition in and out of Parliament.
Joint Opposition Parliamentarians made this observation at a press briefing held at the Parliamentary Complex.
Dallas Alahapperuma said their efforts made in Parliament yesterday, was the beginning of the struggle. He also said that they requested speaker Karu Jayasuriya and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa to give heed to their request. He said the Joint Opposition invited the former Speaker to help them in their endeavour and the latter had accepted the invitation. MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara speaking at the press briefing, said giving the status of the main opposition to the JVP and the TNA was not fair as the joint opposition had more seats.
MP Jayantha Samaraweera said the JVP and TNA could not be recognized as the Opposition since the government has the blessings of these parties for everything it does.
The Joint Opposition also said that the Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella's behaviour was worse than that of MP Dinesh Gunawardena. They added that Minister Kiriella applied more pressure and threats on the Speaker.

Parliament adjourned; UNP Mps walk out after tense situation
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned Parliament yesterday at around 11.50 a.m. as the UNP members walked out of the House amidst a tense situation. This situation was created over the delay of the commencement of Public Business due to an opportunity given to Joint Opposition members to speak over making the National Freedom Front (NFF) an independent party in the House as well as assigning a member to represent the Joint Opposition in place of Dinesh Gunawardena who was suspended from attending Parliament sittings for a week.
Amidst the tense situation that prevailed in Parliament, the House was adjourned until 1 p.m.on March 21.
The tense situation was created when Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella objected to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for providing an opportunity for Joint Opposition members to speak in Parliament over making the NFF an independent party in the House and assigning a member of the Joint Opposition to represent its views in place of Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena, who was suspended from attending sittings for a week.
When JO member Keheliya Rambukwella was speaking following JO members Chamal Rajapaksa, Wimal Weerawansa and Dullas Alahapperuma, Minister Lakshman Kiriella objected to allowing them to speak in Parliament stating that the Speaker had already given a ruling. He added that it was not fair to waste the time of the House as there were a lot of matters that the government had to take up.
This is a matter that the Speaker had already given the ruling, Minister Kiriella said. When around two hours was allowed to be wasted every day for these members how could the government work
At this moment, the Joint Opposition members rose to their feet and began shouting to express their objection against Minister Kiriella. Several government members too join in creating a tense situation.
The Speaker said that the Joint Opposition members were not given opportunity to speak on these matters during the last three days. I promised to allocate time during this week. Let them speak, the Speaker said.
But, the decision has been given already. We have to attend to the public business, Minister Kiriella said. There are Private Members Bills of our members to be moved.
I promised them to give time to express their grievances, the Speaker said. Lets give them five minutes. MP Rambukwella may continue his speech.
Thereafter,MP Rambukwella continued amidst a chaootic situation with members of both sides shouting. However, when MP Rambukwella wound up his speech the Speaker announced the Public Business is commenced. By this time, the Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella, Chief Government Whip Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and MP Hector Appuhami were seen walking out of the House. Minister Karunathilake was seen gesturing to the UNP back
benches sitting on the other side of Parliament and around 10 UNP MPs including Heshan Vithanage, Kavinda Jayawardena, Arshu Marasinghe etc were seen walking out of the House.
UPFA government side members and TNA members were not seen in the House. JVP MP Anura Dissanayake remained in the House.
Amidst the din and chaos,sittings were suspended for 10 minutes. Thereafter, the Speaker announced the adjournment of Parliament until 1 p.m. on March 21.
The Joint Opposition members were seen standing and shouting slogans hailing the Speaker.
However, according to the Order Paper,sittings were scheduled from 10.30 am to 1 p.m. and from 1.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. An Adjournment Motion was scheduled to be moved at 1.30 p.m.

Parliament not a place to solve internal party disputes: Mujiber Rahuman
The so called Joint Opposition (JO) should understand that Parliament is not the place to solve internal disputes of the party, party, Parliamentarian Mujiber Rahuman said.
"If there are internal issues of the JO members they should be solved after dealing with UPFA Chairman President Maithripala Sirisena." he said.
Rahuman said the JO has been misusing the first two hours of the Parliamentary session to obstruct the smooth functioning of Parliament. As a habit, the JO objects to the Speaker showcasing a bad behavior in the House, he said.
Rahuman was addressing the media at Siri Kotha yesterday.
"The internal dispute of the UPFA should be dealt within their party rather than in Parliament,thus wasting the time of Parliament," he said.
"This situation, which hampers the smooth functions of Parliament,is no more acceptable. He reminded that a UNP Parliamentarian was assaulted by an unruly group of the Joint Opposition a few months ago. Rahuman also alleged said that Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena is nearing the end of his political carrier. When considering the political behavior of Gunawardena, his (Gunawardena) time is up. He has become a clown now, Mujiber Rahuman added.

Kalutara North Police OIC Ananda De Silva was transferred to Colombo North Division on disciplinary grounds after the prison bus carrying underworld figures including Aruna Shantha alias Samayan came under attack in Kalutara on February 27. Seven people were killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire at the bus carrying these prisoners to the Kaduwela Magistrates Courts from Kalutara.
They also attacked a van with prison officials who were providing security, killing two.
The IGP has transferred the OIC on the recommendation of National Police Commission (NPC) yesterday. IGP Pujith Jayasundera who participated in an event in Killinochchi last week had said that there was a lapse from the part of Kalutara North Police OIC for not providing security to the prison bus even after a request was made
IGP Pujith Jayasundara has admitted to a shortcoming by police to some extent in the Kalutara Jayasundara made the observation while speaking at an event held in Kilinochchi on Monday.

Prof.  Ananda Samarasekaras revision application re-fixed for inquiry

The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrates Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday re-fixed for March 14 by Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the Court was informed that the prosecution was yet to receive the DNA report pertaining to the skeletal remains seized at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
On a previous occasion, former Colombo Chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen. On September 15, 2016, Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail on the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
However, through his revision application Prof. Samarasekara sought an order to revise Colombo Magistrates Court order to refuse him with anticipatory bail.
Prof. Samarasekara denied allegations levelled against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence.
Presidents Counsel Shavendra Fernando with Counsel Thisya Weragoda and Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the former JMO.

Speaker cracks the whip: Dinesh ordered out
MP Dinesh Gunawardena is no doubt a well-versed senior member in Parliament with experience spanning to over three decades. He is an old-timer who first entered Parliament from the 1983 by-election representing Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP).
He is the current leader of the MEP and also the Parliamentary Group Leader of the Joint Opposition, a self-proclaimed group formed by stalwarts of pro-Mahinda Rajapaksa camp.
Hailing from Boralugoda family, Dinesh has been playing a leading role in Parliament as a front bencher, and Parliamentary traditions and Standing Orders are nothing new to him. Being a seasoned politician of our time, there is little doubt that many new comers in our legislature would naturally look to him, despite varying political affiliations, to shape their own careers.
It was such a political personality who went down to new low this week to end up with one weeks suspension of Parliament service. Had it been MP Prasanna Ranaweera or Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma, as was the case in May last year following an in-house brawl, it might not have raised many eye brows. Yet, MP Gunawardenas conduct in Parliament last Wednesday was unbecoming for his own stature, and that scene sets off alarm bells over the lack of discipline among our members representing the highest elected body in the country.

Speaker rejects Weerawansa's separation move
The ugly scenes in the House took place barely a day after a supplementary estimate of Rs 134 million was presented to Parliament to pay the newly approved monthly allowance of Rs 100,000 to each MP. The allowance of MPs for attending Parliament sittings has also been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 500. It was not long ago Speaker Karu Jayasuriya reminded the House that Rs 4.6 million is spent for a day to run a Parliament session, and urged the members not to waste public money by disrupting the sittings.
Ironically, the ugly scenes in the House took place barely a day after a supplementary estimate of Rs 134 million was presented to Parliament to pay the newly approved monthly allowance of Rs 100,000 to each MP. The allowance of MPs for attending Parliament sittings has also been raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 500. It was not long ago Speaker Karu Jayasuriya reminded the House that Rs 4.6 million is spent for a day to run a Parliament session, and urged the members not to waste public money by disrupting the sittings.
What preceded the chaotic situation in the House on Wednesday was the Speakers detailed ruling refusing to recognize five National Freedom Front (NFF) MPs led by Weerawansa as a separate group in Parliament. This in fact was a decisive ruling that would go down in the annals of history of countrys legislature.
The Speaker pointed out accepting the NFF as a separate group would set bad example which could ultimately lead to mushrooming of separate groups or parties other than that of their original party from which they have been elected to Parliament. He observed that this could eventually fail the entire parliamentary system and pave way for misuse of parliamentary privileges.
The Speaker however assured that he would take all possible measures to see that the rights of each and every MP are guaranteed.
Uproar in House
A tense situation erupted in the House following this announcement as MP Weerawansa agitated in the House requesting the chair to allow him to express his views over the ruling, and MP Gunawardena backed his colleagues call. The Speaker did not permit this request maintaining that his ruling is final and that it could not be challenged or debated. Then again he stated he would allow MP Weerawansa to raise his concerns on a future date possibly within the same week, but the JO paid no heed.
The chaotic scenes followed next led to the abrupt suspension of sittings for three times and Parliament Police were called into the Chamber for the first time in recent memory.
After all it was not only MP Gunawardena, who misbehaved in the Chamber at that instance, but also NFF MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Padma Udayashantha Gunasekara. They too were seen repeatedly challenging the chair while flouting Standing Orders by storming into the well.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya tried his level best to plough through the days business giving repeated warnings to protesting MPs, but in vain. He came to a head when the JO MPs defied his orders hurling abuse at the chair with utterances such as Shameless Speaker, What a shame, and Speaker is a puppet.
At one time the seemingly miffed Speaker admonished MP Gunawardena stating, You are a very senior MP and you should not behave like this. I remember, when you were the Chief Government Whip, you did not even allow me to stand up to move the Right to Information Bill. Now you try to preach us on freedom of speech.
Police called in to remove Dinesh
The Speaker gave back to back warnings to MP Gunawardena and then ordered him out of the Chamber due to severe breach of discipline using the powers vested in him under the Standing Orders. As MP Gunawardena did not obey and remained firmly seated, the Speaker ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove him from the Chamber with the assistance of Parliament Police.
About 20 police personnel filed into the main chamber, while the Joint Opposition MPs numbering about 15 formed a protective ring around the seat of MP Gunawardena to prevent him being taken out. The Policemen stood close to MP Gunawardena but did not attempt to touch him. Then after about 30 minutes, the Police withdrew from the Chamber and the House resumed sittings.
It was at this point a motion was put before the House to suspend MP Gunawardena from Parliament for a week. It was passed with a majority of 63 votes, receiving 85 votes in favour and 22 votes against. Three abstained from voting while 114 were absent. The TNA MPs voted for the motion along with the UPFA and UNP MPs in the Government. The Joint Opposition group voted against while the JVP MPs abstained.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena walked out of the Chamber after the adoption of the motion and the JO group followed him.
Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando, who had been perusing old Parliament records to find out similar incidents in Parliament, told the Daily News on Thursday that the last occasion where police personnel entered the main Chamber to remove a member was far back in 1994.
On January 18, 1994 the Police had removed Parliamentarians Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, Heen Mahaththaya Liyanage, Wijith Wijithamuni Zoysa and Reji Ranatunga from the Chamber. The Speaker at that time was M H Mohamed. Prior to that former Parliamentarian Sarath Muththettuwegama had also been removed from the Chamber by Police in 1985, he said.
Debate on SAITM
Meanwhile, the SAITM issue also came to the fore in Parliament this week as members of both sides took the floor to air their different views on this subject.
The adjournment debate on the SAITM moved by JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake attracted a lot of attention, while pro-SAITM and anti-SAITM groups held demonstrations in the vicinity of Parliament.
In fact, the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe is a conundrum the former Government left behind for this Government to solve. However, the members of the former Government, now in the JO, have shown confrontational attitudes towards the SAITM expediently forgetting their role in its making.
The JVP voiced strongly against private universities, while the Government members were seen divided on the matter. Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekara were vocal against the SAITM, while Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and S B Dissanayake fought tooth and nail to withstand criticism directed at it.
The SAITM issue has resulted in headaches for the Government that it can no longer bury its head in the sand. Not a day passed without commentary or new development over this contentious issue that has been dominating the news cycle over the past days, arguably adding more fuel to the tensions rather than simmering them down.
For the cash-strapped Government grappling with much more serious issues such as the debt-ridden economy and hammering out a deal on vital aspects of Constitutional reforms, issues such as the SAITM could serve as distractions. Clearing the air of uncertainty on them would be of help for the Government to move fast to achieve its desired goals.

The sport   that helped  a nation to heal
Kamanda Tharcisse's voice is barely a whisper as he recalls the events of the Rwandan genocide of 1994.
An estimated one million people were killed during a 100-day period, among them Tharcisse's father and two brothers. Aged 13, he was forced to flee his home and then the supposed safe shelter of a camp to stay alive with his mother, sisters and remaining brothers.
However, he has been able to slowly and steadily heal his emotional wounds thanks to an unlikely source of solace -- the game of rugby.
With rugby, I feel alive, says Tharcisse, one of the country's first players, a former international with national side the Silverbacks, and now the general secretary of Rwandan Rugby.
I feel like I'm running to the future, he adds.
It can bring you great joy and you don't think about the past. When rugby started here, people were still thinking about the past, about the genocide. The game just brings so much unity with other people.
SEEKING A PURPOSE
Prior to 2001, rugby barely existed in the Land of a Thousand Hills.
Bar the occasional game between ex-pats, it was unheard of in the East African country. Football was king, and still is -- the other key sports in Rwanda being basketball, volleyball and cycling.
But that all changed in 2001, with the visit of a British charity worker seeking to find a purpose in life.
Emma Rees was unsure what to do after completing her university degree, and traveled to Rwanda with Voluntary Service Overseas.
She started throwing around a rugby ball with school kids, and has since become a sort of modern-day William Webb Ellis -- the schoolboy credited as being rugby's original founder in the 1820s -- for one particular country.
Rees first took the game to schools, and the following year the Ministry of Sport granted approval for the formation of the Rwandan Rugby Federation. Two years later the Friends of Rwandan Rugby charity was formed.
The charity's treasurer Deena Aiken, a former Australian rugby international, spent 14 months in Rwanda at one point in the role -- as she puts it -- living in a mud hut.
 There were two families there that lived next door to each other but had not spoken since the early 90s, Aiken says. But the children started playing rugby and suddenly the families were coming back from rugby and talking. They finally had something to talk about.
And there's countless stories like that. You hear stories of how boys would dress up like girls in a dress, or hide in a swamp for a whole month just to escape, and these are guys I know today. They don't talk about it very often because they're all trying to move on.
Modern-day Rwanda is irrevocably interlinked with the genocide, nearly quarter of a century later.
The volume of Tharcisse's voice drops as he discusses it. Two brothers and my father died, he says. But for me now, today, I feel okay. I feel interested in life and I think my family are proud.
I remember when I first invited them to watch, they thought, What is this odd game But they're very happy that rugby has given me a job. It's changed my life.
Without doubt, the reason I still volunteer 15 to 20 hours a week is because of the stories you hear, she says, citing one tale from a rugby development officer in the north.
DREAMS COME TRUE
Rugby is still very much in its infancy in Rwanda, and did not receive full international membership until August 2015.
The Silverbacks are ranked 96th out of 103 nations in the World Rugby listings, sandwiched between the Solomon Islands and Bulgaria. The team played in the fourth tier of the 2016 African Cup, losing to DR Congo in the East Division final in Kigali.
There are 600 players at senior level, while Rwanda is 96th in the World Rugby rankings.
Tharcisse was one of Rees first converts, playing at his secondary school, Groupe Scolaire Shyogwe. Initially he was bemused, but became enraptured with the sport.
It has become his job as the boss of Rwandan Rugby -- based in the capital Kigali -- to spread the message of the game, particularly in schools.
He now has five development officers under his tutelage, and the sport is played in 74 primary and 56 secondary schools.
With his own international career over -- Rwanda currently play the likes of Zambia and Mauritius -- Tharcisse allows himself to dream about the future.
It's happened already so I can say that dreams come true, he adds. Maybe we can get to the stage where we're competing for the World Cup in a few years time. We're also pushing in sevens and trying to play against sides in Kenya and Uganda that are are in the World Series. These are countries we need to learn from.
SCOTTISH SUPPORT
There are nine teams in the Rwandan League and some 600 senior players, while the sport has the backing of the country's premier Paul Kagame. In addition, Rwanda has competed at the Kowloon 10s, an event associated with the Hong Kong Sevens.
Aiken helped teach Kagame's children how to play rugby, while former Scotland national XVs coach Frank Hadden and sevens specialist Scott Wight have visited to provide coaching support, and Welsh clubs have donated kit for players to wear.
The Scottish link started at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, when the country's local councils were asked to Support a Second Team Rwanda was paired with East Lothian, and sent athletes to Scotland prior to the competition.
In return, with the help of the Scottish Rugby Union, Wight traveled to Rwanda in September last year to work with a group of 20 players aged under 20.
I really enjoyed the whole experience. It was so humbling learning about what the country has been through with the genocide to where it is now, he tells CNN.
But most importantly the thing I enjoyed most was the attitude and desire of all the kids in showing me the willingness to learn and get individually better at rugby.
Wight says there is a massive amount of talent and a really bright future there, though Rees admits to a modicum of frustration that she has not achieved more since her first visit to Rwanda.
I don't want to sound negative but the potential for rugby's not been fully met there, she says, but I'm really proud of the kids we've got playing and that some of those kids are now coaches.
BUILDING TO THE FUTURE
Rees describes post-genocide Rwanda in 2001 as still being raw, the place very basic, but the kids wanting to talk about their experiences.
She laughs at the idea that she went there planning to launch some rugby revolution.
Football, basketball and volleyball were basically the only sports you could play then, she says. It was a bit selfish as I just wanted access to rugby. I just taught some kids to share my passion and it went from there.

The Agenda for Growth idea to promote trade, investment and job creation in member countries such as Sri Lanka will help the unity governments reform vision of industry and commerce, he said.
Minister Bathiudeen met Secretary-General Patricia Scotland and discussed the progress of Commonwealths projects in Sri Lanka. The Secretary-General Scotland thanked Sri Lanka for its contribution to the Commonwealth Trade Finance Facility and discussed ongoing projects where the secretariat is providing technical assistance to Sri Lanka. These include support with free trade agreement negotiations, designing an export diversification strategy and helping to set up an export/import bank.

Sri Lanka farmers advised to grow short maturing rice, other crops in 2017

Sri Lanka is forecasted to get normal rain in 2017, but farmers outside the wet zone have been advised to grow short maturing rice, alternative crops with tanks starting the next cropping season with low water levels, the Department of Agriculture said.
 In the next Yala minor season, there is expected to be normal rainfall in the Wet zone in the Dry and Intermediate zones rainfall will be low as usual, the Agro-climatology & Climate Change Division of Sri Lanka's Department of Agriculture said.  Due to the lagging effect of last year's drought, irrigation tanks are low in water and it was unlikely that they will get enough water to reach capacity in the next two months.
 "Therefore, it is highly advisable to grow short-age crops and varieties during Yala 2017 season in the Dry and Intermediate zones," the Department of Agriculture said in a weather update.
 "In paddy fields, priority should be given to 2.5-months paddy varieties.."
 In field that tend to dry up quickly other field crops like green gram, black gram cow-pea, sesame and vegetables should be grown, the department said.
 In Sri Lanka's Wet zone covering the South Western area, rice could be grown widely.
 "It is likely that Wet zone of the country will continue to receive substantial amount of rains from mid March onwards and therefore, every possible actions should be taken to bring a maximum possible extent of paddy lands to cultivation from this climatic zone," the statement said.
 On average it takes about 1,400 litres of rice to produce a kilogram of rice, especially in East Asia.
 But depending on the yield and the condition of the field which soak up water it may take up to 3500 to 4000 litres of water to produce a kilo of rice. Unlike other crops, rice is grown in flooded conditions.
 The warning is coming as the main Maha cultivation season is ending, with up to 137,000 hectares of paddy fields hit by drought.
 The Department of Agriculture tried to discourage farmers in areas where water shortages were forecasted last year, so that they could earn some income from an alternative crops.
 But officials said many farmers did not heed their advice, partly due to a faith that rains would eventually come, and partly because they wanted the security of having a store of rice.
 Rice production in Sri Lanka's main Maha cultivation season is expected to be sharply down in 2017, with lower output also in the Yala season despite normal rainfall being predicted, for this year.

Sri Lanka has 25 percent women representation in local bodies
The 25 percent women representation in local government institutions is the greatest victory achieved by Sri Lanka in the gender equality sector during the last 50 years, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said in a press release issued recently.
The release adds: "International Womens Day is celebrated at a time when certain ministers are trying to turn the tide against this victory and take the country back to the proportional system of elections. "Women in Sri Lanka obtained universal adult franchise in 1931 before European countries started talking about womens rights.
Thirty years later Sri Lanka produced the first women Prime Minister in the world.
"Womens Day in 2016 was celebrated by highlighting the campaign for 25 percent women representation. Several proposals were also received for increasing women representation when the 20th Amendment to the Constitution was brought forward.
But today, several parties in the political mainstream had launched a campaign to abolish 25 percent women representation in the local government sector.
"Heroes of yester year Womens Day celebrations were trying to perform the villains role. Their endeavour was to take the local government system back to the corrupt proportional representation which did not allow even five percent women representation."

Stronger, tangible results needed to keep hard-earned trust: Global Tamil Forum
While welcoming High Commissioner Zeids report on Sri Lanka released on March 3 in Geneva, the Global Tamil Forum said that stronger, tangible results needed to be forthcoming without further delay to prevent any further dissipation of hard-earned trust.
Quoting from the High Commissioners report the GTF called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to make every effort to implement all of the recommendations presented in the High Commissioners report, which include: present a comprehensive strategy on transitional justice, with a time-bound plan; invite Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to establish a full-fledged country presence; adopt legislation establishing a hybrid court, which should include international judges, defence lawyers, prosecutors and investigators; and operationalise the Office of Missing Persons Act and provide the Office of the Missing Persons with sufficient resources and technical means.
The GTF requested the member states to consider the following in resolution 34/1;in respect of Sri Lanka
1.Extend the timeline by the requested (by Sri Lanka) twenty four months to implement all of the requirements of resolution 30/1 of October 2015.
2.Must formally ensure that Sri Lanka makes a time bound delivery commitment to implement requirements of resolution 30/1 in full, without any exceptions.
3.Include a formal mechanism of monitoring of progress by OHCHR based from Sri Lanka
4.Delivery on these commitments must be formally reviewed on a more frequent basis (every six months) at the Council during the next two years, to avoid recurrence of non-delivery or partial delivery by Government of Sri Lanka by the end of the extended period.
GTF would like to reiterate its commitment to Sri Lankas transition to real peace, justice and prosperity, founded on genuine political power-sharing with all its peoples.

Systematic measures should be taken to develop handicraft industry:CBK
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said yesterday, that if a systematic effort was made to develop the handicraft industry, craftsmen will not leave the filed seeking for other jobs.
The Former President was speaking at a ceremony organized to felicitate winners of Handicraft and Handloom exhibition conducted in 2016 by the Ministry of Road Development, Transport, Cooperative Development, Trade, Estate Infrastructure Development, Industries, Rural Development and Housing and Construction of Western Provincial Council held at Sambuddha Jayanathi Mandhiraya hall in Colombo yesterday.
She said the Ministry of Road Development, Transport, Cooperative Development, Trade, Estate Infrastructure Development, Industries, Rural Development and Housing and Construction of Western Provincial Councils render yeomen service to encourage and appreciate the talents of craftsmen and developing the handicraft and handloom industry in the Western Province. We must appreciate the service, she said. I have a special interest in this filed. Therefore I never hesitate to buy handicraft and handloom products whenever I travel round the world. It was former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike who gave state sponsorship to the handicraft industry for the first time in Sri Lanka. Her government established the Laksala to purchase the products of craftsmen, while creating market potentials for their products. The Laksala also provides loan facilities to craftsmen, she said. Crafts sector plays a vital role in the economic growth of the country. This sector is instrumental in absorbing the talents and capabilities of the rural Sri Lanka into the export efforts of the country. This industry could emerge as a major foreign exchange earner to the country.
The handicraft industry has become a one of India's largest employers and a mainstay for the rural economy today. We need a strategic plan to develop the sector. There should be a plan to help local craftsmen to be on par with international standards and be updated on the latest trends in the global hospitality and craft sectors, she said.

Tackling poverty
Most news items can make you either happy or sad, but there are only a few news items that can give rise to both emotions at the same time. This is one such news item, that may also surprise you.
The 2016 Wealth Report by Knight Frank, a UK-based property consultancy released recently said Colombo is likely to see a 160 per cent growth in the super rich with more than US $ 30 million (Rs.45 billion) in personal wealth to 182 individuals over the next decade.
The report noted that Sri Lanka has 3,400 dollar millionaires, 170 multi-millionaires (more than US $ 10 million) and 70 ultra high-net-worth individuals with more than US $ 30 million in assets, though no dollar billionaires were listed as being resident in Sri Lanka. The report has excluded persons of Sri Lankan origin living overseas.
Only Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam was expected to grow faster than Colombo, at 170 percent with 30 million dollar plus individuals growing to 243 by 2026, from 90 individuals in 2016. By comparison, developed Hong Kong already had 4,080 super rich and would see them grow 40 percent to 5,712. Singapore had 2,500 super rich individuals and was expected to grow 40 percent to 3,500.
This revelation is great news in the sense that we are getting closer to the more economically advanced nations in Asia. Both Vietnam and Sri Lanka are emerging economies and their inclusion in the super rich individuals lists is a good sign. However, one should also look at the other, less glamorous side and that is the growing disparity between the rich and the poor, not only in Sri Lanka but around the world.
In fact, if Sri Lankas Western Province were a separate country, its growth rate would far exceed that of many other countries in the region. Colombos streets are awash with the latest luxury vehicles, many condominiums, hotels and retail complexes are coming up and the overall pace of development is dizzying. But the downside is that the Western Provinces growth rate is higher than the growth rate of all other provinces.
This is a glaring status of inequality that a developing country can ill-afford. The Government should be commended for taking this factor into consideration in its overall development plan. For example, the proposed projects in Hambantota would be an economic boost for that impoverished region.
Working towards the equitable distribution of wealth is a challenge that all countries are grappling with. To Sri Lankas credit, the poverty rate has come down drastically over the last few decades. The Sri Lankan government has been successful in reducing poverty from 15.2% from a decade ago to just 8 percent and the nation has made significant progress towards achieving the UNs Sustainable Development Goals on eradicating extreme poverty.
Globally too, the proportion of the population living in poverty has declined to fewer than 10 percent today from 35 percent in 1990. Since the world population now exceeds seven billion, that still leaves more than one billion people living in extreme poverty. This is simply unacceptable, given the fact that the world spends a staggering US$ 1700 billion annually on defence. Just over one tenth of this amount given as development assistance would go a long way towards eliminating poverty. Another astonishing fact: just 62 top billionaires are wealthier than half the world population combined.
The question is, in Sri Lanka and around the world, are the rich contributing enough to uplift their poorer cousins The answer is a resounding no. Most rich people are likely to evade taxes either by not declaring their income and assets to the relevant agencies or depositing their monies in offshore accounts which are not liable for taxation in the home countries. This was highlighted with the release of the Panama Papers, which revealed account details of thousands of rich individuals (and corrupt politicians) who had deposited funds in offshore accounts. Many Sri Lankans are known to have deposited funds abroad and the authorities have rightly granted an amnesty for investing such funds in Sri Lanka. However, it is worth investigating how some of them may have accumulated so much wealth without seemingly having any avenue to do so.
An article from the Center for Global Development calculated that about three quarters of global poverty could be eliminated if developing countries gave a helping hand to the poorest by collecting more taxes from their wealthiest citizens. This is a major problem faced by Sri Lanka  many who should be in the tax net are not in it. Efforts should be made to widen the tax net to cover more rich individuals.
It would be churlish to define wealth in monetary terms alone. Sri Lanka is richer than many other countries in terms of health and education, which are provided free by the State to all citizens, rich or poor. That is equality in action, but we need to do more to ensure that the poor can rise on their own feet.

Tharanga century  leaves Bangladesh chasing 457 for win
GALLE: Upul Tharanga scored his first Test century at home in 24 attempts as Sri Lanka set Bangladesh a daunting target of 457 to chase in a minimum of 125 overs to win the first Test played at the Galle Cricket Stadium.
By the close of the fourth day brought forward by 11 overs due to bad light Bangladesh had made a positive start scoring 67 without loss with Soumya Sarkar setting the pace for his team by scoring his second half-century of the match  an unbeaten 53 off 47 balls with six fours and a six. Tamim Iqbal his partner played a passive role and was 13 not out.
With the loss of 38 overs on the third day due to rain and a further 11 yesterday a total of 49 overs have been lost in the past two days due to inclement weather conditions.
Tharanga whose appearances in Test cricket has been few and far between since making his debut in 2005 had made hundreds only in Bangladesh and Zimbabwe before yesterdays innings of 115 off 171 balls that saw Sri Lanka declare their second innings closed after tea at 274-6. Tharanga was involved in half-century partnerships for the first three wickets with Dimuth Karunaratne (32), Kusal Mendis (19) and Dinesh Chandimal (50 n.o.).
The flat Galle surface proved an ideal platform for Tharanga to make up for his cheap dismissal in the first innings when he was dismissed for four. He played an unblemished innings that lasted for 225 minutes during which time he found the boundary on 11 occasions and twice over it.
Chandimal also compensated for his poor dismissal in the first innings by completing an unbeaten half-century off 75 balls riding on the dropped chance he offered at 11 to Sarkar at slip off Mehedi. Bangladesh require a further 390 runs and Sri Lanka ten wickets off a minimum of 98 overs going into the fifth and final day today.

They still haven't beaten the mighty  New Zealand - Zinzan Brooke: England should not 'pop champagne' if they equal unbeaten record
All Blacks legend Zinzan Brooke says England do not deserve to pop champagne if they equal his countrys 18-Test record tomorrow because they have still not beaten the Kiwis.
Despite being undefeated under Eddie Jones, Brooke believes Englands winning run would come to an abrupt end if they faced Steve Hansens All Blacks.
England have not played the No 1-ranked Kiwis since 2014 and, speaking to Sportsmail, Brooke claimed the Red Rose record is just a number. Is this England team as good as the New Zealand team that won 18 in a row No, said Brooke.
Which coach would relish a Test between England and the All Blacks Id say Steve Hansen. Theyre in a good place for a team that lost 750 caps of experience.
If I were in that England team, I wouldnt be popping a bottle of champagne. Youve taken the record but you havent played the team with back-to-back World Cups.
'How does that work Youve set a number but havent played the best team in the world.
New Zealands 18-Test run included the 2015 World Cup final and overlapped the retirement of Kiwi legends Richie McCaw, Dan Carter and Maa Nonu, though interestingly they didnt face England during that time!
Englands run started against Uruguay, added Brooke. Thats a good one, isnt it But theres nothing in clause 2.31 that says you have to play the best team in the world to break the record.
Theyve been tripping up a little bit and Eddie Jones flipped his lid when Italy outsmarted them.
Ive watched quite a bit of the New Zealand franchises and the Lions are going to have to take 50 players down there. Some of the play is unbelievable.
When the All Blacks get together, Id back them against England.  Daily Mail

Trump assails CIA on hacking leak
US: President Donald Trump's administration levelled fresh criticism at the CIA Thursday after WikiLeaks published a trove of documents describing the US spy agency's cyber espionage operations. Hours after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange accused the Central Intelligence Agency of "devastating incompetence" for failing to protect its hacking secrets, Trump's spokesman echoed that, branding its systems "outdated."
Trump has "grave concern... about the release of national security and classified information that threatens and undermines our nation's security," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.
"He believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated."
The White House terminology was milder than earlier this year when the president blasted US intelligence agencies over media leaks, and accused them of playing politics with their findings on Russian interference in last year's election.
But it added new pressure on the CIA and its chief, Mike Pompeo, as US intelligence agencies continue to suffer losses of top secret materials -- most famously with Edward Snowden's 2013 exposure of NSA spying. On Tuesday, WikiLeaks published nearly 9,000 documents it said were only part of a huge trove leaked from the CIA. WikiLeaks said the leaked archive represented the CIA's entire arsenal of cyber-attack plans, guides and malware programs -- though it held back the programs themselves from release.
"This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA," it said.
On Thursday Assange gave a press conference on the leak, which again put the crusading anti-secrets group in the midst of US politics.
Speaking via streaming video from Ecuador's embassy in London, where he has been living as a fugitive from justice since 2012, he waved off criticism of WikiLeaks while blasting the CIA for its poor controls.
"This is a historic act of devastating incompetence, to have created such an arsenal and then stored it all in one place," Assange said.
"It is impossible to keep effective control of cyber weapons... If you build them, eventually you will lose them."
The documents show that, using a tool chest of malware like viruses and trojans, CIA hackers can turn a TV into a listening device, bypass popular encryption apps, and possibly control people's cars.
Assange called the CIA "careless" for losing control of its cyber weaponry, which WikiLeaks suggested had reached it via private contractors that the US agency hires to develop hacking tools.
He said it might already have circulated into the hands of criminals and US enemies.
"It's quite possible numerous people already might have it," Assange said.
He claimed that WikiLeaks possesses "a lot more information" about the CIA's hacking, but would refrain from publishing it until it can speak to tech manufacturers affected.
Much of the agency's cyber operations focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in popular networking equipment, consumer electronics, and software, including Apple's iPhones and smartphones running the Android operating system.
"We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have so fixes can be developed and then pushed out," Assange said.
"Once this material is effectively disarmed by us we will publish additional details about what has been occurring."
The CIA defended itself while criticizing the WikiLeaks founder.
"As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity," said spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak.
"Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries."
She reiterated that cyber operations are an integral part of the CIA's job, rebuffing Assange's suggestion that the agency had quietly gone into competition with the main US signals intelligence body, the National Security Agency.
Hacking is a normal part of its mission "to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad," Horniak said. - AFP

TRUMP's NEW WORLD ORDER

The first US policy on immigration in 1948 welcoming persons fleeing persecution saw 205,000 refugees which increased to 415,000 in two years and by 1952 rules for Asian immigrants were relaxed. President Truman whose veto was overridden by a vote of 278 to 113 in the house and 57 to 26 in the senate, quoting from his veto message said: we do not need to be protected against immigrants. On the contrary we want to stretch a helping hand to succour those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism. In no other realms of our national life are we so hampered and stultified by the dead hand of the past as we are in the field of immigration.
Donald Trump's choice preferences of precautionary measures in national interest are spot on. That indeed may not go down well with the world at large and could be argued at length. As a pragmatist and realist he has to churn the wheels of government in a way that he thinks is going to be effective and beneficial for him and in doing it his way has flashed a welcome smiley on all anti-Muslim elements. Netanyahu and Putin are important side kicks for Trump if he is to paralyze the ISIS. His success story, if ever, only time will tell. Unlike under former American leadership, he sees the importance of teaming up with Russia towards such goal attainment. This he has done quite successfully. But whether it will hold in the international sphere needs to be watched as the days unfold against the backdrop of a surge in criticism progressively mounting.
Retrospective analysis of US immigration laws from 1885 -1990 all of which had a distinct rationale basis were far different from emotion based, Trump favoured policies. Governments of those times not only acted on US needs in immigration policies but also unfailingly took serious note of the humanitarian aspect as well - a distant wail from today's ethnocentric leanings.

On the contrary we want to stretch a helping hand to succour those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism. In no other realms of our national life are we so hampered and stultified by the dead hand of the past as we are in the field of immigration.
Immigration act
Certainly, the Trump endeavour is not the maiden American attempt to lid immigrants. The 1924 immigration act even debarred entry of Asians. Way back, the 1917 immigration act confronted international distaste and invited the utter disgust and consternation of President Woodrow Wilson who vetoed it only to be met with a congressional overruling. He saw it as soiling American values much looked up to by the world. According to him, not only did the act efface the high ideals which America stood for, it also prevented many good people from entering American society. In vetoing the act Wilson said,
It will all but close entirely the gates of asylum which have always been open to those who could find nowhere else the right of opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they conceived to be the natural, inalienable right of man. This right of political asylum has brought to the country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land and who has become an ornament to our citizenship and public mind.
UK/US trade deal
But Woodrow Wilson and Donald Trump are two different personalities. One sees the nobility of character and elevated purpose in an asylum seeker that will contribute to American societal fertility while the other views them as a formidable threat. One possesses the vibrant armour of intellectual depth while the other skims the surface for want of emotional brilliance. Trump has dedicated his life to amassing American Petro dollars while Woodrow has what money cannot buy drawing out his most positive potential in the realms of intellectual grandeur. Even in appearance they are poles apart. Woodrow the elegant of the two while Trump has missed out on the elevated plane. House of Commons speaker John Bercow in a moment of brilliance punched Trump straight in the face when he said, addressing the House of Commons is not an automatic right. It has got to be earned. As far as this place is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.
However Prime Minister Theresa May's plans are afoot to green light Trumps state visit to realize a UK/US trade deal. Perhaps the British style of a  kick and kiss  for Trump - though only the French are renowned for diplomacy the world over. Perhaps closer geographical proximity between the two countries does not rule out the possibility of French influence and inspiration over Britain.
Towing Woodrow Wilson's line of thought, the American Judiciary somersaulted on the executive's orders of dispatching immigrants. It no doubt deserved a standing ovation proving that country's judiciary be a great celebration to America's democratic values. The US Federal Court has even upheld the suspension. Writing off Muslim immigrants, building walls and what else is to come off Trump's Pandora's Box one has to wait and see - certainly not a good sign of enlightened and elegant governance.
But that such governance as is Trumps cannot have its way and say is well proven in the American theory of checks and balances where the three governing arms namely the executive, judiciary and legislative act independently of one another without any external influence. Politicization in the American system has no chance and where such governance exists emotional government over what is rational becomes operational. In this volatile state of politicization of administration, the chances of national progress are undermined.
Viewing humanity in a much broader concept is where justice prevails and has very much to do with Christian ideals which invariably and unfailingly strike commonality with other religions as well. Those eminent men that comprised the American bar that dispensed justice for sure are all practicing Christians and they rose to stature proving themselves to be worthy of Christ's followers. If the Mexican wall and Muslim ethnicity are going to be Trump's bugbear, he certainly invites sympathy for his limited understanding of the higher purpose of life - a key attribute a charismatic leader ought to posses. A wrenched, stunted outlook will not carry the American President any where. Already, he has failed to impress the world at large except invite global distaste in the kind of warped mentality he displays. In his relentless struggle of pecuniary fortification he has missed out on seeing all else beyond the glistening dollar not to forget his outstanding record of pecuniary aggrandizement.
Donald Trump and Mahinda Rajapaksa
Power in the hands of such personalities carries the risk of furthering instability in an already unstable world. Contrastingly Canada, UK and Germany all of whom have welcomed the Muslim refugees in a grand show of magnanimity have expressed unwillingness to be accommodative of the trump card - surely symbolic of character and depth of those state heads.
It is well known that high degree centralization and polarization are twin brothers. Both breed and expand national and global chaos. Mitigating the presence of both will enable the chances of reconciliation and peace. Such administrative prowess hallmarks the entry of a statesman while fostering both is to the advantage of a petty politician for as the oft quoted saying goes, the former is conscious of the next elections while the latter, the next generation. Trump has already unfolded his incapacity to show up in the realms of statesmanship.
The world is in the direction of narrowed vision, most intolerant of flamboyancy so easily taken to by youth of a recent generation. However, to capture political power, playing up to ethno/ religious identity is compulsory which was the sole preserve of both Donald Trump and Mahinda Rajapaksa. They may even perhaps take cue from other world leaders and poets who have embellished world history by a portrayal of dignity, effulgence and a collaborative endeavour with what they saw as the best.
For instance, when Nehru wanted the winds of change to blow across India from the four corners of the world, he was not into rigid insistence of India's cultural purity nor did he fear cultural pollution. Tagore, echoing similar sentiments prayed to realize a world not broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls such as ethno / religious/ caste, national and other social constructs of boundaries. If Nelson Mandela was to avenge the South African whites misdeeds against the blacks, deportation of that community would have been his preferred option. Yet, as is characteristic of Mandela's liberality, he insisted on a black populace assurance that he would not leave jail until and unless every white man was safe.
Obviously Trump's concave lenses denied him similar broader vision reflective only of a magnanimous statesman. Arguable indeed is that nit picking is his lot overlooking the blessed sight of the larger picture.

Two more Sri Lankan fishermen arrested
Indias Coastal Security Group (CSG) Police on Thursday arrested two Sri Lankan fishermen whose boat had reportedly drifted towards the Vedaranyam shore due to rough sea conditions. The fibre boat was also seized.
With this, the number of Sri Lankan fishermen, who were arrested over the last two days for entering Indian waters, has gone up to 12. On Tuesday, the Coast Guard had arrested 10 Sri Lankan fishermen from Trincomalee for entering Indian waters.
Acting on a tip-off that a Sri Lankan fibre boat was noticed on the Kodiakadu shore near Vedaranyam, the police, Q branch CID personnel, and the Coastal Security Group rushed to the spot and conducted enquiries with the two persons onboard the boat.
The fishermen claimed that their boat had drifted towards the Indian shore due to rough sea. They were subsequently arrested under the Passport Act as they did not have necessary documents to enter India.
They were identified as Siriraj (42), son of Anthoni Pillai and Yasanthan (17), son of Kanda Vadivel of Paruthithurai in Jaffna district of Sri Lanka. Both were Tamil fishermen. They reportedly landed between Kodiakadu and Maniyantheevu near Vedaranyam early on Thursday.
Ten remanded
Meanwhile, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court on Thursday remanded the 10 Sri Lankan fishermen who were arrested by Indian Coast Guard on the charge of fishing in Indian waters.
The fishermen included both Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhalese fishermen from Trincomallee and other areas in Sri Lanka. On Tuesday, they were apprehended while fishing about 50 nautical miles east off Nagapattinam.

UN: World facing greatest humanitarian crisis since 1945

The world is facing its largest humanitarian crisis since 1945, the United Nation's humanitarian chief said as he pleaded for help to avoid "a catastrophe".
Stephen O'Brien told the UN Security Council more than 20 million people are facing starvation and famine in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria.
Unicef has already warned 1.4m children could starve to death this year.
O'Brien said $4.4bn (3.6bn) was needed by July to avert disaster.
"We stand at a critical point in history,"O'Brien told the Security Council on Friday. "Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations."
"Now, more than 20 million people across four countries face starvation and famine. Without collective and coordinated global efforts, people will simply starve to death. Many more will suffer and die from disease.

UNP MPs tell Speaker : Take action against JO Parliamentarians for tarnishing Parliaments image
Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna said the UNP Parliamentarians will request the Speaker to take tough action against the Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentarians, who tarnish the image of Parliament and disregarding Parliamentary traditions. No JO members can be allowed to play the fool in the House while disobeying Parliamentary traditions and insulting the dignity of the Speaker.
At this juncture, the UNP backbenchers have decided to request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take action against such JO Parliamentarians who behave with disrespect in the august assembly, he said.
Rajakaruna was addressing the media at Siri Kotha yesterday.
As a result of the unruly behaviour of JO members in Parliament, the dignity of the House has been brought into disrepect, he said.
Speaking on MP Dinesh Gunawardenas behaviour in Parliament, he said that such bad behavior by one of the most senior Parliamentarians can never be accepted.
It is fair if he raises his voice on an issue of national importance,other than just talking minor issues which should be solved through discussions with the UPFA General Secretary. Gunawardena, destroyed the dignity of the house while disobeying and challenging to the Speaker. Once a Parliamentarian is named by the Speaker, the particular MP leaves Parliament. That is the general practice, he said. The other main partner of these issues is MP Bandula Gunawardena. Rajakaruna claimed that Gunawardena makes statements aiming to mislead people. As an outcome of his falsehoods, he was advised by the Presidential Commission of Treasury Bond scam not to do so again, Rajakaruna said.
He is pretending as an economic expert while levelling baseless allegations against the government. But, it is questionable whether he is such an economic expert when considering his past statements such as Rs.2,500 is enough for a family per month, he added. Speaking on the recent JO media conference at the Parliamentary car park, Rajakaruna said that only a party leader or a minister is offered a committee room. Apart from that, no committee room can be used on their own accord to their whims and fancies.Speaking on former President Mahinda Rajapaksas statement that there are shootings taking place throughtout
the country,Rajakaruna added that he is suffering from a disease, by which one cannot remember his past.
Even if he cannot remember,anyone can remember the way journalists were treated and the gun culture reigned supreme during his tenure. The entire country was affected by state terrorism, Rajakaruna added.

UPFA constituent parties should speak independently in Parliament: Chamal
Constituent parties of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) other than the SLFP should be provided an opportunity to speak independently in Parliament since those parties had not entered into agreements with the UNP, Joint Opposition and SLFP Parliamentarian Chamal Rajapaksa said in Parliament yesterday.
Chamal Rajapaksa made this observation yesterday speaking over the matter of the National Freedom Fronts (NFF) request to sit independently in Parliament.
MP Rajapaksa said that the SLFP General Secretary had entered into an agreement with the UNP. But the other parties in the UPFA had not entered into agreements with the UNP nor did the UNP had consult the views of those parties.
He added due to these reasons those parties should be given opportunities to speak in Parliament.
MP Chamal Rajapaksa also said that the Joint Opposition has more members than that of the official opposition in Parliament.
At this stage, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he had taken measures to give more opportunities to the Joint Opposition as he could recall the difficulties they had to face while the UNP was in the opposition. I had taken measures to grant 55 percent to the JO of the time allotted to the UPFA. But, I cannot intervene into the internal matters of a party, the Speaker said. The UPFA also has to take a decision on it. If the members have any problems I can attend to them, the Speaker added.

'Ven. Rathana Thera protecting wrongdoers'
The Citizens' Organizations collective suspects that Ven. Rathana Thera is protecting wrongdoers and murderers, while trying to bring in an anti-democratic fascist political leader into power.
Left Centre Co-convener and Citizens Organization's collective Convener Chameera Perera said he suspects Ven. Rathana Theras activities as he continues to make contradictory remarks about law and order of which he is not aware of while criticizing his own party.
If he has issues within his own party without taking measures to solve them, he is on a mission to form a new party which is against moral norms, he said.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR).
Perera alleged that Ven. Rathana Thera is among the group of individuals who supported the anti- democratic activities carried out by Mahinda Rajapaksa under the former government.

WHY NO  RACE IS SUPERIOR
The Indian Tamils are different to the Lankan Tamils. That can be as the Indian Tamils were brought to Lanka mainly from TamilNadu by the British in the 19th century. Investigation shows that the Muslims and the Malays are also closely related to each other. This contradicts the traditional thinking that Muslims from the Arabian Peninsula arrived in the country between the 7th and 8th centuries, mostly as traders, while the Malays from Southeast Asia arrived during the Dutch occupation of Lanka in the 17th and 18th centuries.
There is no ethnic problem in Sri Lanka as I understand. Since 1974, when I came out with my explanation for the Tamil national problem, I discussed this as a problem of nationalities. Sri Lankans have been a civilized people over 3000 years, according to archaeologists and historians.
Many different views are expressed on this subject. Some are scientific while others are biased to fit chauvinist positions held by political leaders. We have to get the facts and figures correct and analyse the socio-economic development of the Sri Lankan society in each stage of development.
At the time of the supposed arrival of Aryan people from North India to this island between 6th and 3rd century BC, those who lived here belong to the South Indian Megalithic culture.
Small tank-villages
It was a commune society based on small tank-villages. This was an intrusive culture thought to have originated on the basis of recent discoveries, in the Nubian region which came into South India sometime after 1000 BC. It was metal using, with implements chiefly of Iron. A settlement had four distinct areas; a habitation area, a cemetery, a tank and fields. Dravidians who build the fabulous cities of Mohenjo-daro -- Harappa and taught the Nomadic Aryan invaders how to irrigate with dams and canals, had shifted to the South; and the South Indian Megalithic culture may have had descended from them.
A general joke is made about lineage is that no one really knows who ones father is. The only fact without dispute is who ones mother is. That is how humans grouped in early days as matriarchal societies. Mother had the control and sisters of mother become a sisterhood and control of the primitive society thus, came under women. For a long period, may be 100,000 years, we walked in this path until private property emerged to dominate the human society. One of the oldest civilizations, the Indus valley civilization, lies at the very cradle of subsequent civilizations that arose in the region of the Indus valley.
This civilization flourished in areas extending from what today is northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India.
Along with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilizations of the Old World, and of the three the most widespread, covering an area of 1.25 million km2. Entire populations of people were settled around the basins of the Indus River, one of the major rivers in Asia, and another river named Ghaggar-Hakra which once used to course through northeast India and eastern Pakistan.
Harappan and Mohenjo-Daro civilization
Also known as the Harappan civilization and the Mohenjo-Daro civilization  named after the excavation sites where the remains of the civilization were found, the peak phase of this civilization is said to have lasted from 2600 BC to around 1900 BC.
A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture is evident in the Indus Valley Civilization making them the first urban centres in the region. The people of the Indus Civilization achieved great accuracy in measuring length, mass, and time. And based on the artifacts found in excavations, it is evident that the culture was rather rich in arts and crafts. Was this the beginnings of Dravidian people How this collapsed and male-dominated Aryans did came in to this area
First, it was assumed that nomadic Aryan barbarians attacked and plundered. In the later 20th century, ideas were refined along with data accrual, and migration and acculturation were seen as the methods whereby Indo-Aryans and their language and culture spread into northwest India around 1500 BC. The term invasion is only being used nowadays by opponents of the Indo-Aryan Migration theory.
In any case we know now that Dravidian mother culture society was over-powered in the course of time by Aryans and that has spread down to Lanka; that is the origin of Lankan society and several nationalities have emerged in the modern times. Even though there is no ethnic difference, national identities are strong and unity can arrive only on the basis of equality, autonomy and the right of self determination.
In the mix of our debates on the national problem a pioneering team of researchers from the Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IBMBB) of the University of Colombo has followed to clear fact from fiction, from the larger picture that is Lanka, based irrefutably on science. Not just genes and their patterns has Dr. Ruwandi Ranasinghe peered at but that all-important Eve Gene to shed light on the crucial questions buried in the dim mists of time. Who are Lankans From where have we come Are the major ethnic groups and also the Veddahs closely-linked or disparately different They found that Contemporary Lankans share very close maternal ancestors.
Ethnicity is created by linguistic, religious and cultural differences, rather than genetic differences. That means there are nationalities but no ethnic divisions. The differences between the major ethnic groups are minimal except in the case of the Veddahs who stands out as a separate cluster.
Lankan Tamils
There is a considerable genetic admixture in contemporary ethnic groups in Lanka  the Sinhala are closely related to the Lankan Tamils. Hence the traditional thinking that an admixture of North Indians with the original inhabitants of Lanka to have established the Sinhala ethnic group around 2,600 years ago cannot be accepted. The Veddahs are thought to be remnants of the original inhabitants; that may be. Traditionally the origin of Lankan Tamils is attributed to successive invasions by South Indians beginning a few centuries later. This contradicts the first finding.
The Indian Tamils are different to the Lankan Tamils. That can be as the Indian Tamils were brought to Lanka mainly from TamilNadu by the British in the 19th century. Investigation shows that the Muslims and the Malays are also closely related to each other. This contradicts the traditional thinking that Muslims from the Arabian Peninsula arrived in the country between the 7th and 8th centuries, mostly as traders, while the Malays from Southeast Asia arrived during the Dutch occupation of Lanka in the 17th and 18th centuries. However predominance of Indian mtDNA haplogroups among Muslims and Malays support the notion of largely male migration and marriage to local women.
The Veddahs are the most distinct group but is a little close to the Lankan Tamils!
