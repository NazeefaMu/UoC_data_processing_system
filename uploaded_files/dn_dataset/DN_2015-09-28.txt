Up-Cycled Fashion
The age old practice by Buddhist monks of stitching their robes from the saffron colored cloth used to wrap corpses in India is one of the oldest known instances of up-cycling clothing. However at present up-cycling is still an emerging trend in Sri Lanka, says Dhanushika Welagedara a final year student attached to the Department of Textile and Clothing Technology of the University of Moratuwa. She presented a paper on her study of the acceptance of Up cycled fashion in Sri Lanka at the 4th International Conference on Management and Finance (ICME 2015) held at the University of Ruhuna recently.
The word up cycling has originated its meaning from deviations of recycling which in general is reducing the waste and reusing everything we shed. Up-cycling has also be defined as optimizing the materials, ingredients and process pathways in such a way that waste is converted to raw materials for nature or some other industry. It is the process of reusing discarded items to create a product of higher value than the original, she explained.
In the fashion arena, up-cycling could be defined as the process where waste or useless products are converted to new fashion products of better quality or a higher environmental value through craftsmanship and design. It is one way to take care of over consumption in an environmentally responsible way and still satisfy the profitable fashion industry and the needs of the fashion conscious consumers. Up-cycling provides a vista of opportunities to designers who are willing to do business with less guilt, she added.

State has more rights towards children than parents
Children have many rights. The State has more rights than the parents towards children. When we find a child who is neglected or is likely to be harmed by their guardians or parents, we take the child into our care, said Lakmini Sewwandi Shah, a Cabinet member for Children's Safeguarding (Deputy) and Mayoral Advisor for Domestic and Family Violence in Newham London, UK.
During an interview with the Daily News she said: "Parents cannot hit children. There are rare cases of child harassment and a majority of it is done by someone who is known to the child."
Here are the excerpts of the interview:
Lakmini Sewwandi Shah
Q: Comment about you and your work
A: I was born in Hambantota. My parents are Indrani Palliyaguru and P.M. Dissanayake. My father is from Lenagala, Kegalle.
I studied at Ladies College, Colombo. After Advanced Level, I left for further education to Russia on a scholarship. I finished my education at Moscow with a Business Administration degree in London University, East London. I met my husband, Ash Shah, there. He is of Indian decent. We have three children. My eldest daughter is at medical college and my older son is doing his A/Ls. My youngest son is in Year Nine.
I worked at British Gas Board/ Centrica as a financial consultant until I entered politics in 2006.I was elected as a local government councillor to the East London borough, Newham, UK. This is the place where Olympics was held in 2012. This is my third term in politics. I was elected in 2014 for the third time. There are around 450,000 residents in my borough. We have an Executive Mayor who is elected by the people. There are 60 councillors. My seat is East Ham South. The mayor elects his cabinet and there are eight cabinet members and I am one of them. I am also an advisor to the mayor.
Q: Describe your work as a Labour Cabinet Member for Childrens Safeguarding (Deputy) and Mayoral advisor for Domestic and Family Violence.
A: I am elected as a Labour Party Councillor. Even though the central government is Conservative, Newham is a Labour borough whereby all the elected members are from the Labour Party.
There is a cabinet member for Children and Young People's Services (CYPS). safeguarding or child protection is only one aspect of the CYPS. I lead on safeguarding. I advise the mayor on the problems women and families have and how we can drive the agenda forward according to the policies.
I meet women from various walks of life and women's rights organisations to understand the problems women face in society.
I see two reasons. They are ignorance and financial constraints. Ignorance is when men feel more powerful than women and men feel that they are superior to women.
There is an organisation that we commission to deal all sorts of domestic and family violence. It's called One Stop Shop. One Stop Shop provides all the support women need such as providing for women refugees, providing housing, giving advice and guidance on how to acquire various social and financial benefits, training for women to be employed, finding employment and police protection.
Q: What is your role as an advisor
A: I have officers who are specialised in policies on women's rights and specialised in domestic and family violence. According to the intelligence or information, I have I set the agenda to make women or men deal with domestic violence. Ten percent of domestic violence is suffered by men, which might not be relevant to Sri Lanka. It all depends on the need of residents. This role is a new role which I was appointed to two months ago. Currently, I am carrying out a fact finding mission to look into the needs in the borough.
Q: From your experience what is the main cause for family violence and how do you suggest to minimize family violence if that could not be eradicated totally
A: Men feel women need to be behaving in a certain manner. This is different when there is poverty and a woman becomes solely dependant on a man and she has to put up with all the abuse as she has no other option.
This might be more relevant for countries such as Sri Lanka where the State don't provide financial support to women who have faced domestic violence.
Educating men by the State is important. They need to provide support to women who have faced domestic violence. They need to provide housing, employment and training to women so that they become financially independent. A welfare system needs to be created. The first contact, which would be the police, need to have a trustworthy structure and a system where women feel safe to walk in and make that first complaint.
Q: Comment on the people's awareness of your support system
A: The people know that there is such a role and also that the borough has the One Stop Shop where they get all the support they can access.
Q: How safe are the children in your country Do you read instances where children are harassed, molested and raped
A: Children have many rights. The State has more rights than the parents towards children. When we find a child who is neglected or is likely to be harmed by their guardians or parents, we take the child into our care.
Parents cannot hit children. There are rare cases of child harassment and a majority of it is done by someone who is known to the child. In these cases, the police take over such cases. We have registers of offenders where parents can have access to. If there is such an offender living close to their house, parents have the right to know. It is called Sarah's Law. Everyone who works with children have to undergo a thorough police check which is called a DBS check. Without that check, no one is allowed to enter even a school.
There are foster parents who look after children. For every child they foster, the parents obtain 500 per week and all the support they need.
Q: What lessons could Sri Lanka draw from your experience to ensure that our children are treated better
A: Children should be treated with respect. They should be heard. Schools should be taking a lead role in this. Teachers should be not just teaching books but keeping records of children to see if they struggle from neglect or abuse.
As Sri Lanka is a developing country, there are financial constraints on families. The government should provide for these families. It would be great if there's a long term plan for Sri Lanka to become a developed country. Politicians need to have a selfless plan to achieve this. The answer is very broad. It is not one thing but a long term strategy needs to be driven forward.
Q: In your view, what should the society, State and law making institutions do to ensure that families are safeguarded from domestic violence and safety of children is ensured
A: Education is needed to eradicate cultural habits. Policies should be in place to protect women. Financial support is needed. Employment and training should be provided to women so that they have financial independence. Politicians need to drive this forward. The police need to implement the law and a welfare scheme should be in place to provide support.
Q: What is your assessment of family life in Sri Lanka in comparison to the UK
A: I grew up in Sri Lanka until 18 years. So I did not hear much of domestic violence cases as I was a child then. I assume since Sri Lanka is an Asian country, Asia usually has patriarchal societies. I think women have less power over men. This can lead to serious forms of domestic violence.
Q: How do you assess the safety of Sri Lanka for children
A: I do not like to make comparisons between the UK and Sri Lanka when it comes to child rights.
They are totally two extremes as the UK is a developed country and Sri Lanka is a developing country. Culturally it is different. What is important is to have laws to protect children and rigorously implement them to safeguard children from harm. Again this is the duty of politicians. If politicians abide by the Nolan Principle for elected members, anything can be achieved.
So my advice is to read up on the seven principles of public life and no doubt Sri Lanka will become a developed country.

Droughts, floods and sea level rise impacts
Are we ready 
This week of September is a key week which addresses worlds development agenda and the ways to move forward in addressing the grave impacts of climate change, termed as loss and damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
With 2015 being the year for a new legally binding agreement on climate change, and also the year of deciding the sustainable development goals for the global development which does not leave the vulnerable and marginalized behind, understanding the concepts relevant to this discussion, and impacts of slow onset events such as floods, droughts, sea level rise play a key role in developing policies to address these issues.
Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA) in collaboration with Asian Pacific Network (APN), ActionAid International and Asia Pacific Adaptation Network (APAN) organised a workshop on loss and damage from slow onset events of climate change impacts in Colombo, Sri Lanka on the 22nd and 23rd of September, 2015.
The floods that devastated some parts of the country recently.           
Sea erosion, rising sea levels have negative effects on a country. 

The inauguration and the initial technical sessions of the workshop were held on the 22nd of September, with technical sessions extending to the 23rd. The inaugural ceremony was held with the participation of the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Disaster Management Dr. S Amalanathan, Mr. Ranga Pallawala CEO Janathakshan (Gt. Ltd.), Ms. Visaka Hidellage Assistant Country Director of UNDP, Ms. Nilmini Ranasighe Environment Management Officer of Ministry of Environment and Mahaweli Development, Mr. Sarath Ekanayake Board Member of Climate Action Network South Asia, and various stakeholders representing the government, private sector and the academia.
International policy making processes
The workshop focused on the international mechanism to address loss and damage, and discussed the international policy making processes and the development of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and slow onset events, as well as the emerging nature of the subject and the difficulty in coming to an international consensus on how to address loss and damage.
The health impacts due to slow onset events due to climate change gained a focus in the discussions, in addition to impacts felt to the agriculture sector. This is due to the fact that not having access to clean water, and chemicals being used on agriculture plays a key role in the increase on the number of cases of chronic kidney disease. More the impacts of slow onset events are felt, such as droughts and depletion of water resources, more the number of cases of health will increase. Current policies for development in Sri Lanka and the presidential manifesto of the President highlights health and agriculture as key sectors of focus. If these issues are addressed through policy, communities impacted by health issues, as well as agricultural issues will find solutions to them.
In terms of addressing loss and damage related to climate change, there is a lot of focus on insurance and compensation, as well as risk transfer. This is one of the key discussions that have been prevalent in the international forums in the last few years. Who needs to fund the losses and damages suffered by the victims of climatic impacts While the developing world points the finger at the developed world, the answer remains yet to be determined.
Impacts on economy and development
In order to address impacts of climate change, and the losses and damages due to slow onset events such as droughts and floods it is important to choose options which are planned with the consideration of scientific data. While lack of water resources, impacts on agriculture leads many to migrate to different parts within and outside the original habitat, unplanned adaptation measures will only lead to aggravating the situation. Furthermore, it is important that the discussion on the topic takes into consideration the significance of economic and livelihood diversification and building up climate resilience as solutions to impacts on economy and development. However it was noted that scientific data on the hasards, and accurate calculation of damages are missing at the national level.
As steps to move forward in building solutions to address the issues of climate change impacts such as slow onset events and merging them with the development agenda of the country it was suggested that the findings of the consultation be presented to a larger group of stakeholders who will in turn contribute to the mapping of the way forward on the topic at national level, facilitated by the Ministry of Disaster Management Centre and the Climate Change Secretariat.

## Title: BLACKOUT DUE TO TECHNICAL FAULT

BLACKOUT DUE TO TECHNICAL FAULT
The country experienced an islandwide blackout on Sunday night, for more than three hours, due to a technical fault at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
Speaking to the Daily News, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said an unexpected drop in the electricity demand, during off-peak hours, was the main reason behind the blackout.
Siyambalapitiya said the power went dead throughout the country because of what is called cascade tripping.
The blackout was experienced from 12 midnight to close to 4 am.
The demand plummeted to a region of 850 Megawatts from the usual range between 2,000-2,100 Megawatts, which caused the grid to trip, he said.
The CEB found it difficult to deal with this unexpected situation, the minister explained.
Minister Siyambalapitiya also apologised to the public over the inconvenience caused by the unexpected blackout.
However, Minister Siyambalapitiya said, the Ministry of Power and Energy, has launched an immediate inquiry into the incident.
The committee investigating into the matter will comprise of relevant officials and experts. Ministry Secretary Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda said the report of the inquiry would be handed over to Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya for further action.
Meanwhile, a CEB statement said that on an ordinary working day, maximum peak demand during night increased upto about 2,100 MW and reduces down to about 1,100 MW after midnight. However, during week-ends the maximum night peak demand is about 1,900 MW and the minimum demand will be reduced down to 950 MW.
Yet on this Sunday, the total system demand had further decreased and it was around 1,775MW during the night peak which is a significant reduction from the usual. Furthermore, at 0053 hrs the demand was further reduced to around 940 MW which is much less than usual 1100 MW and this too was falling further.
According to a CEB Engineer, this is the second time that a cascade effect had caused an island wide power failure in the country since 2010.
Asked why they took so long to restore power after the outage, CEB sources said they had to synchronize the operation of power units across the country. It took time, they said.
The power supply demand fell yesterday because it was a Poya day and it rained right throughout. Industries and shops were closed because of that.. Also,people did not have to turn on their fans due to the inclement weather, an official said. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Employees Union convener Ranjan Jayalal also said that the blackout was purely due to a technical fault.

COUNTRY ROADS taking its 27th turn
Let the children come to me. Dont stop them. For the Kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these  Matthew 19:14
Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf is welcoming me  Matthew 18:5
In the same way it is not my heavenly fathers will that even one of these little ones should perish  Matthew 18:14
Jesus was one of the greatest spiritual leaders and teachers who walked this earth. Yes, children are the future of our world. But they are important for a greater reason that this. And Jesus knew this. And that reason is that the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them and all in heaven look upon them with adoration and love.
This is why Country Roads is travelling down that path for the 27th year. It is South Asias longest running concert for children. A very worthy endeavor, the country roads concert series has to date raised many millions of rupees for childrens charities. Country Roads 2015 will provide only the highest quality family friendly entertainment featuring high caliber, fan-favorite international and local acts such as Mavericks from Germany and Astrid Brooks from the UK as well as Sri Lankas very popular Flame, Cosmic Rays and Mariazelle.
The Country Roads concert for children, now in its 27th year, is undoubtedly a worthy cause with all proceeds going towards local childrens charities. However it is also an enjoyable evening. It is a fun and entertaining Country, Western and Folk Music show with its own unique style of fun and family- friendly entertainment, President of the Country Music Foundation and Organizer of the Country Roads Concert for children, Feizal Samath said.
It also raised a further Rs. 100,000 for the Oxonian Heart Foundation which helps to treat the impoverished and destitute with heart disease and another Rs. 100,000 for a poor family with a special needs child. On its 25th Anniversary in 2013, since the concert series began in 1988, the CMF raised a million rupees for a special project with UNICEF.
In 2002 CMF and the Chamber of Commerce organized a CEO breakfast for 200 CEOs. It was an event discussing children and raising awareness among these CEOs and what was interesting is that it was held the morning after the country roads concert and the breakfast event started off with a band from Germany playing a song.
In 2014, the concert donated Rs. 500,000 to Save the Children Sri Lanka to support its mother and child programs on Sri Lankan plantations. It was an interesting event, because what they did was, on the day of the concert at 4pm they had a roundtable with CEOs of plantation companies. The meeting was coordinated by CMF and Save the Children to discuss the needs of the mother and child in the plantation sector.
Another unique funding initiative this year is the exclusive special dinner for 50 guests organized by the CMF on the eve of the show where Dirk of the Mavericks and Astrid Brook will talk about their experiences over the past 10 years of raising funds for the Foundation through music in an elegant evening of conversation, dinner and music at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Country Roads Concert for Children will be held on Sunday, October 11, 2015 from 6.30pm at the Main Ballroom of the Mount Lavinia Hotel. Tickets for the concert can be purchased on www.tickets.lk

Digital India to transform the way India will live, work - Modi
US: Prime Minister Narendra Modi told US tech greats that his government's vision of Digital India was an enterprise to transform India on a scale "perhaps, unmatched in human history" that would touch the lives of those living in the farthest corners of the country and also change the way the nation "will live and work".
In his speech at the Digital India dinner here, Modi recounted the way technology was helping make connectivity easier, with the internet, mobile phone and Skype touching the lives not only of farmers, villagers and those living in cities but also connecting doctors in India with hospitals in other countries.
"Today, technology is advancing citizen empowerment and democracy that once drew their strength from Constitutions. Technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses, not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes," he said.
He said with Digital India, the government will "transform governance, making it more transparent, accountable, accessible and participative."
"I spoke of e-Governance as a foundation of better governance - efficient, economical and effective. I now speak of m-governance or mobile governance. That is the way to go in a country with one billion cell phones and use of smart phones growing at high double digit rates." Modi said: "Since my government came to office, we attacked poverty by using power of networks and mobile phones to launch a new era of empowerment."
"I see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity," he said. "In this digital age, we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago."
Modi said the government wants paperless transactions and announced plans to set up a "digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments".
He said the e-biz portal set-up is aimed to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient.
The government, he said, is using technology to impart scale and speed to development and for this there is need to bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way as ensuring general literacy.
Modi said: "We want our 1.25 billion citizens to be digitally connected. We already have broadband usage across India go up by 63 percent last year. We need to accelerate this further."
He said the government has launched an aggressive expansion of the National Optical Fibre Network that will take broadband to 600,000 villages.

Earls equals record as Irish trounce Romania
Keith Earls scored two tries to equal Brian ODriscoll as Irelands leading World Cup try scorer as they eased to a 44-10 victory over Romania on Sunday.
The 27-year-old, who took his tournament total to seven tries, saw fellow wing Tommy Bowe also score two tries with Rob Kearney and Chris Henry getting the others.
Irelands second successive easy victory -- in front of a record World Cup crowd of 89,267 at Wembley -- sets them up nicely for more challenging Pool D matches against Italy and then France.
Romania had already put in over 40 tackles by the time the game reached the five minute mark, indicating the tough match ahead.
Ian Madigan put the Irish 3-0 up in the eighth minute to reward their early pressure. But Darren Cave was penalised for not rolling away and Valentin Calafeteanu kicked the penalty to level affairs.
The Irish looked to have scored one of the tries of the tournament so far when Simon Zebo rushed down the left wing. But his celebrations, including sticking his tongue out at his fan club, proved to be premature as the television official ruled it out for a foot still in touch when he collected his kick ahead.
Madigan added a penalty for 6-3 and Ireland turned on the style again with Earls prominent in creating the move that swept from the left hand side to the right and Bowe managed to touch the ball down before he was bundled into touch. The Ulstermans 29th test try was welcome as he had been pilloried for his performance in the warm-up Test defeat by England -- Madigan landed a fantastic conversion from the touchline for 13-3.
Zebo turned creator in the 27th minute. Seeing Earls free wide out on the left wing he floated a long pass out to his Munster team-mate and Earls had no problem in running the ball in to make it 18-3.
Earls drew level with iconic centre ODriscoll four minutes into the second-half, running onto Eoin Reddans kick through and touching it down. Madigan converted to meke it 25-3.
Romania held the Irish at bay for the next 15 minutes but referee Craig Joubert eventually lost patience with some gamesmanship by the Romanians and sin-binned Csaba Gal on the hour mark. Within seconds the ball had been whipped out of the scrum and along the line for Bowe to go in for his second try of the game. Madigan landed another stunning conversion from wide out on the right for 32-3. The Irish ran in another superb try minutes later, Zebo the spark again unselfishly offloading to Kearney to score -- though more worryingly the fullback, who was struggling for fitness prior to the tournament, limped back to the halfway line. Madigan failed for once to land the extras to leave the Irish leading 37-3.
Henry added another try as the Romanians wilted and Madigan added the conversion for 44-3. But there was a great cheer when veteran Romanian lock Ovidiu Ionita scored a try right at the death in what is his fifth World Cup.

England's 'Typhoon' Tyson dies aged 85
Frank Tyson
Former England fast bowler Frank Tyson has died at the age of 85, his former county Northamptonshire announced on Sunday.
Northamptonshire announced the news on their website, stating that Tyson has passed away in hospital in Australia -- where he emigrated after retiring -- following a period of ill health.
Nicknamed 'Typhoon' due to his ferocious pace, Tyson notably picked up 28 wickets in five Tests during the 1954-55 Ashes series in Australia, which England won 3-1.
"Northants Cricket offers sincere condolences to Frank's family and friends at this sad time," Northamptonshire said.
Born in Lancashire, Tyson played 170 matches for Northamptonshire, claiming 525 wickets at an average of 20.94, and took 76 wickets in 17 Tests for his country.
His 28-wicket haul in the 1954-55 Ashes included 10 wickets in the second Test in Sydney, as well as seven for 27 in Australia's second innings in Melbourne.
After retiring due to injury at the age of 30, Tyson moved to Australia and became a school headmaster, whilst also working as a coach, commentator, journalist and writer.
"Frank 'Typhoon' Tyson will forever be remembered as a great of English cricket," said Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland in a statement.
"Throughout his career he struck fear into the hearts of batsmen around the globe. But once his playing days were over he chose to settle here in Australia, the country where he had become a household name.
"Over many years he became a much-loved and greatly admired member of the Australian cricket community where he coached and mentored countless players in Victoria and Queensland.
"He also made a wonderful contribution to the coverage of the game in Australia as a broadcaster and cricket writer.
"Cricket Australia mourns his loss and extends its deepest sympathies to his wife Ursula, family and friends at this sad time."
England Cricket tweeted: "Very sad to hear of the passing of England and @NorthantsCCC paceman Frank Tyson. RIP Typhoon Tyson."
Lord's Cricket Ground also expressed its condolences, writing on Twitter: "Sad to hear that former @englandcricket bowler Frank Tyson has passed away." AFP

Europe mustnt look away, says drowned toddlers dad
GERMANY: The father of drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi says it was appropriate for news organisations to run photos showing his son lying dead on a Turkish beach.
People must not look away from the terrible things happening on the way to Europe just because we cannot get a visa, Abdullah Kurdi told Germany's Bild newspaper on Saturday.
Aylan drowned in early September with his 5-year-old brother and their mother off Turkey as they were trying to make the sea crossing to Greece.
The pictures of Aylan appeared on newspaper front pages around the globe, highlighting the scale of the humanitarian crisis created by the Syrian civil war. The conflict has forced more than 4 million people to flee abroad.
Speaking from the northern Iraqi town of Erbil, Mr Kurdi said he can only look at the photos very briefly before he is overwhelmed with emotion.
Kurdi has previously said he wants the whole world to see what happened to his family after their small boat sunk in the Mediterranean.
We want the world's attention on us, so they can prevent the same from happening to others. Let this be the last. The Kurdi family are Syrian Kurds from Kobane, a city in northern Syria near the border with Turkey that was under siege by the Islamic State group last year, forcing thousands to flee.
The bodies of the three Kurdi family members who perished in the Mediterranean were buried in Kobane.

Facebook Chief plans to bring the internet to refugee camps
UN: Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, promoted access to the Internet as an enabler of human rights and a force for peace, as he announced that his company would help the United Nations bring Internet connections to refugee camps.
It's not all altruism, Mr Zuckerberg said later, in an implicit acknowledgment that drawing new users to his service is also good for Facebook's bottom line. We all benefit when we are more connected.
Calling for efforts to ensure Internet access for everyone globally by 2020, Mr Zuckerberg said Internet connections are a dynamic tool for sharing knowledge, creating opportunities, lifting communities out of poverty and promoting peace.
A like or a post won't stop a tank or a bullet, but when people are connected, we have a chance to build a common global community with a shared understanding, he told at private luncheon with business leaders at the United Nations. That's a powerful force.
Zuckerberg's company has faced a rash of legal trouble across Europe over privacy concerns.
The connectivity campaign calls on governments, businesses and innovators to bring the Internet to the some 4 billion people who now do not have access, organisers said.
Signing on to the connectivity campaign were U2 star Bono, co-founder of One, a group that fights extreme poverty; actress Charlize Theron, founder of Africa Outreach Project; philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates; British entrepreneur Richard Branson; Huffington Post editor Arianna Huffington; Colombian singer Shakira, actor and activist George Takei and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales.
The connectivity ambitions are at the centre of Mr Zuckerberg's advocacy effort, Internet.org, whose principal goal is to offer Internet access to about 4 billion people in the world who cannot afford smartphones or do not live near fibre-optic cable lines or cell towers.
Internet.org teamed up with phone carriers to offer free access to Facebook and other websites in developing countries like India, but critics said it restricted what people could access in what they called Facebook's walled garden.
In April, 65 organisations from around the world sent an open letter to Mr Zuckerberg complaining that the project violated the principles of net neutrality in the guise of access for impoverished people.
In the courtyard of the General Assembly building this past week, Facebook displayed pieces of the mammoth drone that it is building to beam Wi-Fi connections to places that have none.
The drone is as big as a Boeing 737 and is solar-powered. It has yet to be launched, and it is one of several efforts underway by technology companies to spread the Internet to unconnected parts of the world. Google is trying something of its own, a network of high-altitude balloons.

Green thoughts at 21!
Her life is an open book for all those who love and admire her. Today at the age of 88 years one of the countrys acting legends, Iranganie Roxanna Serasinghe, says that if she were 21 years-old today she would spend a few minutes to sit down and contemplate on how to make the world a better place for all living beings.
The world is a beautiful place, physically. However the most intelligent creature living on this earth is also the cruelest and most disruptive being. Man does not realize that by destroying the natural beauty and environment he is destroying himself. I would ponder over the fact how I could possibly change this situation, she said.
She believes that she can put her new-found energy to good use by spearheading environment conservation projects. She notes that she will gather many other individuals whose hearts lie in the subject to create an environment conservation movement.
Conservation of natural resources is immensely important for the survival of Sri Lanka as well as the world. We are so negligent about this fact. Throughout the ages we have destroyed many things. The British destroyed all the central hills to plant coffee and tea by burning acres and acres of land but when we took over, we did the same thing. Even people in power have a hand in selling trees that have been cut down and are making money out of it, she repents.
Everything is interconnected and interdependent. To destroy nature is like committing suicide! I would use my energy and young blood to get the message across to the society. Our country is blessed with beautiful places but people ruin the beauty through anti-social behaviour. There are enough rules and regulations to protect nature but no one obeys or enforces them. That is the tragedy, she notes.
She is aware that many consider 21 years as the ripe time to think about marriage but Serasinghe notes that she has not yet recognized the difference between how the man and woman thinks.
Marriage is supposed to be a beautiful partnership but it is truly the saddest and most disappointing liaison. Many marriages end in divorce today. There are many people who are staying together due to various reasons. It is sad that they are forced to be together when they can lead a peaceful life away from each other, she says.
She still loves the idea of having children and considers the most cherished moment in her life as the day she set eyes on her first born.
Environment conservation work comes before marriage for me. Therefore I would not focus on marriage at 21. I would postpone it. I would do my best to make the world a better place to live, environmentally, she mused.
Human beings are so greedy! They are not satisfied with what they have. Even those who have so much  too much in fact  want more! They engage in inhuman acts like cheating, stealing and murder to extend their wealth. They grab onto more material things, she said.
She suggests that meditation is the healing balm for the society.
I engage in vipassana meditation daily. It helps me to get to know about myself and the world. I believes that it sets me on the right track, she said.
She would also like to be a healing touch for the distressed.
Little things count for sad and lonely people. Stretch out a hand and help the distressed. If you cannot provide funds at least spend a little time listening to their grief, she requests.
Though she had never dreamed of becoming an actress and never thinks of herself as one, Serasinghe has grown to love her profession and believes that she would get into acting even if she was 21 today.
Though I prefer stage dramas, cinema is the in thing at the moment. I would to love to work in both. I enjoy acting and entertaining masses with a purpose. You can send a positive message across to the society through art productions, she said.

Maitland brings up century as Scottish maintain unbeaten start
Sean Maitland scored the 100th try of the Rugby World Cup to help Scotland make it two wins from two in a 39-16 victory over United States in Leeds on Sunday.
Maitland, who hails from New Zealand, was one of three foreign-born players to score tries for the victors, Dutch wing Tim Visser and South African prop WP Nel being the others.
Centre Matt Scott and Duncan Weir also got tries as Scotland grabbed their second successive bonus point win to move on to 10 points.
They are three clear of South Africa who they play in Newcastle next Saturday.
All the tries came in the second-half after the Americans had led at half-time.
AJ MacGinty gave the Americans a good start with a penalty in the third minute but an infringement by Titi Lamositele allowed fullback Stuart Hogg to level in the seventh minute.
Scottish fly-half Finn Russell -- impressive in the win over Japan where he marked his 23rd birthday with a try -- put the Scots into a 6-3 lead on 10 minutes with a penalty.
Hogg missed with another penalty attempt and within minutes the Americans had stormed down the pitch. From a well worked passing move from a lineout Lamositele burrowed over -- MacGinty adding the conversion for 10-6.
Scotland blew a chance to score a try of their own as Hogg ruined a blistering solo run. He sent a poor pass to the wide open Visser, prompting coach Vern Cotter to turn away from the pitch in frustration.
Scotland were slightly off their game as Russell went wide with another penalty attempt and a succession of earth-shattering tackles by the Americans -- one by Seamus Kelly and another by Takudzwa Ngwenya -- had the Scots rattled further.
The Americans ended the half firmly in control as an impressive 15 phase move provoked the Scots into an infringement. MacGinty slotted the penalty over for a 13-6 lead at the break.
- Half time rocket -Cotter must have given a dressing down at the break for the Scots immediately hit back. Hogg's pass this time to Visser was inch perfect and the wing ran it in for a try -- the 99th in the tournament.
Russell missed the conversion to leave the USA still 13-11 to the good.
The century of tries came when a well-worked move by the Scots ended with Russell feeding Maitland who thundered over -- Russell adding the extras for 18-13.
MacGinty took the States to within two points with a penalty. But only a stunning tackle by Shalom Suniula on Tim Swinson yards from the line prevented a third Scottish try. However, there was no stopping the Scots surge and Nel was next to get a pat on the head from his team-mates for their third try meaning the USA have now conceded 6,000 points in test match rugby since 1912.
Greig Laidlaw, who replaced scrum-half and captain for the day Henry Pyrgos, converted for 25-16.
There were nervous faces though in the Scottish coaching gantry when Russell was removed from the action with what seemed to be a foot injury.

Maldives President escapes unhurt from speedboat blast
Maldives President Yameen Abdul Gayoom escaped unhurt Monday from a blast on his speedboat as he returned home after preforming the Hajj in Saudi Arabia.
Minister Mohamed Shareef said the blast occurred on Monday morning as the boat reached the main jetty in the capital of Male. "Gayoom's wife Fathimath Ibrahim and an aide suffered minor injuries while a bodyguard sustained relatively serious injuries," he said.
Shareef said the cause of the blast, thought to have happened in the engine room, was not known. Boating accidents and fires are common in the Indian Ocean archipelago state.
"We are not ruling out anything, whether it is an accident or an attempt on the President's life," Shareef said adding that investigators are inspecting the boat and watching video footage of the blast.
The country's international airport is on a separate island and a short boat trip is needed to reach the capital island.
Ahmed Hamdhoon, a local journalist who was on the jetty to cover Gayoom's arrival, said he heard a huge blast as soon as the boat docked.
"The right door of the boat fell on the jetty and there was heavy smoke. People were screaming, "he said.
The Maldives, known for its luxurious island resorts, has been rocked by political infighting and disputed elections in recent years, but it is not known for serious political violence such as bomb attacks. - THE WALL STREET JURNAL

Zahira College, Matale, created a history for themselves this year when they won for the first time the boys hockey championship at the National School Games 2015 organised by the Ministry of Education and played at the Royal College astro turf in Colombo earlier this month.
This win by the Matale Zahirians came in as no surprise that last year they finished runner up to Royal College and this year they made certain that they did not end up second best.
A peep into the history of the Matale Zahirians that this school was founded in 1948 when the then Member of Parliament for Matale late V.T. Nanayakkara great efforts to donate to them 11 acre block of land in Matale at a village called Taralanda. Perhaps this was after the Muslims had agitated for a Muslim educational institution in Matale.
It was a fine gest by V.T. Nanayakkara to have helped the Muslims to reach this goal. The main block of the school took shape through a donation by a philanthropist named Cassim Had Sar. Soon a play ground was constructed and main game was hockey, football, volleyball and another similar to elle but played among the boys themselves with a tennis ball.
Former Principal of Zahira College, Matale, and one time national hockey coach A.J.M. Parook told the correspondent that it was George Mant who introduced hockey to Matale and the game prospered over the years. Thus the name of George Mant Live in the hearts of the people of Matale for Making Matale the Hockey City of Sri Lanka. This is something unique to Matale.
There was a time the under privileged children who could not afford an hockey stick used curved brunches of trees as improved hockey stick and played the game with a tennis or cork ball at a ground called Coronation ground which has been now converted into a bus stand. Their love for the game was so much.
Zahira College, Matale, has produced a very large number of national players and it is difficult to name all of them and one of them is centre half S.I. Ajward who played for the national team for ten years before discarding the hockey stick. Then there was M. Ayub, M Zarook, A.J.M. Parook and many others making the long list.
There is no doubt that hockey at Zahira was on the rise. Besides winning a number of other tournaments there the Consolation winners at the 2013 National Schools Games. Then moved up one slot higher to finish as runner up in 2014. Next in 2015 they annexed the championship which had eluded them over the years.
This year they won the Central Province under 19 schools champions defeating Christ College, Matale, quite comfortably 3-0 in the finals. At the National School Games finals they beat St. Aloycius College, Galle 2-1 after a close contest.
The team was captained b y Abdur Rasman In the finals M. Mohammed Ifras was adjudged the Best Player for his brilliant play both in attack and defence which had a decisive influence in the match.

Monuments Matter !
Ancient Sri Lanka had four long-term capitals. They are Anuradhapura (Over 1300 years), Kandy (223 years), Polonnaruwa (Over 160 years), Kotte (150 years). However, Kotte is the most neglected capital city of the country since it was never rebuilt or properly conserved after its destruction by the Portuguese.
From the time of its destruction in the 1565, it was even vandalized for recovering building materials. However, in the mid of the 20th century with the archaeological act some monuments were preserved. However the destruction was accelerated with the Kotte becoming capital for the second time in Sri Lanka during the early 1980s.
Inner city moat as of today
Rampart and moat from afar
AD board and a small portion of rampart along with the moat
Efforts of KHF failed to fence the Inner city bastion

Apart from the well-known monuments such as Alakeshwara palace, Veherakanda mounds, the most important ruins left in Kotte are the rampart along the parameter of the inner city and the two moats of inner city and outer city boundaries. If these monuments are preserved with a great sense this ancient city could be transformed to make a wonderful tourist attraction where Kotte is located at a few minutes drive from the metro capital of Colombo.
However, the pathetic side of this historically valued city is the 4.5 km long rampart and moat is in great danger of being wiped out because of some dubious approaches of the authorities.
It seems the Archaeological department has already been issued license for encroachments and destructions of these great monuments. The entrance location of the inner city gate and part of the bastion traces had already been destroyed recently.
The Director General himself has mentioned that though there are about 40 to 50 archeologies in Kotte. They have gazette only 13 locations so far. Though the DG-AD had agreed to carry out this process soon the matter had been delayed continuously. Hence little has been done to halt destruction. This legal loophole has paved way for further destruction. Proper name boards cover what is left of the ancient Kotte kingdom.
The Kotte Heritage Foundation (KHF) has stepped forward to end this process. Their primary objective is to ensure that no more monuments relating to the Kotte kingdom and situated in Kotte area are destroyed. In order to achieve this objective, the foundation hopes to engage in the following tasks:
* Persuade the authorities to identify the monuments.
* Persuade the authorities to display boards with the survey plan of the monument and other details where practicable.
* Promote the idea of protecting the monuments among the present residents of the ancient city.
* Educate the residents now occupying places of archaeological value and those having any monuments within their premises.
There is no intention of acquiring the lands and they are the proud owners of the ancient monuments. The Foundation is vigilant about their activities
The KHF was born when some residents of Kotte, who have a great sense for heritage, got together to formed a movement to pressurize authorities to preserve the Kotte heritage. Having had the awareness meeting in early May 2015 more people joined hands with the group.
The KHF held its Annual General Meeting in July 2015. The registration process is currently underway. The KHF consists of multidisciplinary professionals, such as doctors, engineers, accountants, lawyers, marketers, senior administrators, bankers etc. The membership is open to other categories of residents who have a passion to preserve the heritage of Kotte.
Three categories of memberships: Life, Ordinary and student are available. For more details call 011 2876873 or send an e mail to [emailprotected]

Most people in UK, US believe aliens exist
US: More than one in two people in the UK, Germany and the US believe there is intelligent life out there in the universe, a new survey has found.
Fifty-six per cent of Germans, 54 per cent of Americans and 52 per cent of people from the UK believe that living creatures who have the ability to communicate and do not come from Earth exist.
Between those who say they believe in alien intelligence and those who say they are not sure whether it exists, the alien nonbelievers are in the minority, according to the survey by the marketing research firm YouGov.
Only 12 per cent of Germans, 22 per cent of Americans and 20 per cent of people from the UK said they do not believe intelligent aliens exist, Live Science reported.
Among UK respondents, 46 per cent said a digital message should be sent into space in the hopes that it reaches intelligent aliens. Another 33 per cent said no message should be sent, and 21 per cent said they were not sure.
The survey also asked those who believed in extraterrestrial life why they thought aliens had not yet made contact. More than half (58 per cent) said intelligent aliens are too far away to contact Earth.
Fifty-seven per cent agreed with the notion that human technology is not advanced enough for people to reach out to aliens.
The survey also found that men are more likely to believe in intelligent aliens than are women, and also more likely to say humanity should reach out.
A majority of men (54 per cent) said humans should try to contact aliens, while only 40 per cent of women agreed.

Natural disasters get the better of technology
Earthquakes and Tsunamis have been occurring in this world since the dawn of time. Some of them have been the basis of myth. They say that Zeus angered by the arrogance of the Kings of Atlantis, that perfect Utopia, send an earthquake that sank Atlantis.
(L-R) Subinay Nandy, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Sri Lanka, S. Amalanathan, Additional Secretary for Development at the Ministry of Disaster Management, Andrew Maskrey, Coordinator, Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, UNISDR
Earthquakes and Tsunamis are the sources of destruction we cannot prevent despite all our advancements in technology. We can prevent crime, we can usher in global peace, we can fix the food problem and eradicate famine. We can solve the poverty problem in this world. But one thing we cannot do at this juncture in time is to eradicate Earthquakes and Tsunamis.
People remember the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku. Way back in 62 A.D. an earthquake hit Pompeii causing much damage, and just like in 2004 and 2011, there was a Tsunami then as well. But it was yet another natural disaster that finally sealed Pompeiis fate. The volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius destroyed the city of Pompeii in A.D. 79. On August 24, Mount Vesuvius exploded at noon, and ash began to fall. In the early hours of August 25, a fast-moving current of hot gas and rock enveloped Pompeii. The poor creatures stood no chance as they were burned to death. The city was obliterated.
Daily News recently attended the Centre for Poverty Analysis, 54th Open Forum on Disaster Risk Reduction.
Chairperson, Duryog Nivaran, Mihir Bhatt spoke of the forum as one that looks at Disaster Risk from every possible direction.
Disaster risk reduction
Invariably in our region any development program leaves the poor behind. These are poor men and poor women. Development programs contribute to increasing inequality in the region which ends up undermining economic growth. Thats the impact on the country. Leaving poor behind means their vulnerability is increased, so that when confronted with shocks (whether these are shocks related to natural disasters, or shocks related to sickness or death in the family) they are unable to pick themselves up, said Bhatt
UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka, Subinay Nandy, has served in Vietnam and China, countries very prone to disasters. Nandy said as a UN family in Sri Lanka they work very closely on issues concerning Natural Disasters.
Disasters can be used to reduce poverty itself. This is the concept of building back better. Making sure that the investments post disaster, i.e. on disaster recovery, make people less vulnerable than they were before. It means providing them better physical infrastructure (e.g. housing etc.) but it also means making sure they are not socially excluded and that they participate in the development process, said Subinay Nandy.
If disaster risk reduction is done rightly, it can be used, to not only reduce the risk that the poor and overall society faces, but it can be used to generate jobs and income.
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) done the right way increases the well-being of an economy, as it makes it more resilient. Further, an important aspect of DRR is a livelihoods approach  this means improving peoples livelihoods and diversifying them. When people are economically stable, they can withstand disasters better (they bounce back sooner), or when they have more than one livelihood option, if one is destroyed they can fall back on another.
South Asia is home to a large part of the worlds population. We are also home to a large part of the worlds poor population. We are home to a large part of the worlds young population. We are also exposed to a variety of hazards.

Nandy in his address said that this Global Assessment Report will make disaster management more integrated and that the event is timely.
The Global Assessment Report (GAR) makes the case that disasters are not exogenous (i.e external) to development, but are often a function of development activity i.e. internal to development/endogenous. So if we follow the reasoning and the recommendations of the GAR we will be looking to integrate disaster risk reduction into all development plans and into all sectors. Thats what we mean by integrated.
This is a crucial time for Sri Lanka and also in the Global landscape to have these discussions here in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Nandy commenting on the Sendai Framework pointed out that it is based on four priority areas for action.
Priority 1: Understanding disaster risk.
Priority 2: Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk.
Priority 3: Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience.
Priority 4: Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to Build Back Better in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
Basically disasters can wipe away the gains of economic and social development.
The risk of a disaster can cause economic losses even before a disaster strikes. Investing in disaster resilience, therefore, can yield a triple dividend by;
* Avoiding losses when disasters strike
* Unlocking development potential by stimulating innovation and bolstering economic activity in a context of reduced disaster-related background risk for investment
* Through the synergies of the social, environment and economic there are co-benefits of disaster risk management investments even if a disaster does not happen for many years.
In his address Nandy highlighted the importance of the availability of this report in Sinhala and Tamil. Translating these technical documents is not easy.
The Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction is one of the key documents available on this subject. This is because it gathers all the existing information and synthesizes it. It is, as the website says, a biennial global assessment of disaster risk reduction and comprehensive review and analysis of the natural hazards that are affecting humanity. It furthers the discourse on disaster risk reduction, and provides the evidence and strategic policy guidance to countries and the international community. Its aim is to focus international attention on the issue of disaster risk and encourage political and economic support for disaster risk reduction. As interesting as the report, are also the many background papers that have gone in to making it.
Coordinator, Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, UNISDR Andrew Maskrey outlined the reports that have already come out.
Note that there had already been the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in January 2005, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan and this had given rise to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) which governments had committed to.
The GAR provided evidence to help governments implement the HFA. The global development community has been leading up to 2015 which was the target year for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). World governments are being asked now to commit themselves to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Its also the year of the COP21  which is looking at Climate Change.
The report I am going to present to you today is the fourth United Nations Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction. The previous have been:
2013 - From Share Risk to Shared Value: the Business case for Disaster Risk Reduction
2011 - Revealing risk, redefining development
2009  Invest today for a Safer Tomorrow
Below is a representation by Maskrey on the processes that have taken place.
Many of your organizations who are now in charge of disaster risk management started out as emergency response organizations. And gradually over the years have been adding other responsibilities to their mandate - recovery, reconstruction, prevention and mitigation
In addition mainstreaming DRR into development has become the key. Mitigation ensures that development reduces existing risk, and as well does not contribute to creating new risk, which is something the GAR and the SFDRR (Sendai Framework) emphasizes.
Self-assessment exercise
The concept of human life years can be used to provide a better representation of disaster impact. Between 1980 and 2012, around 42 million life years were lost in internationally reported disasters each year, a setback to development comparable to diseases such as tuberculosis.
We are looking at this whole relationship between Disaster Risk Reduction and Sustainable Development. We are asking the big question. That is as to whether the approach to managing disaster and risks, weve had in the last 25 years fits the purpose or whether we need to change tracks. As we have changed into the Sendai Framework.
Every two years since 2007, the United Nations has asked its member states for self-assessments on Disaster Risk Reduction. And generally every two years we have had around 130 governments including Sri Lanka doing this self-assessment exercise.
What has come out is good progress in Disaster Management. Over the years all countries, across geographies and income levels, reports are getting better and better in contingency plans and training drills, disaster preparedness and putting in place institutional technical capacities to do so.
Over the last 25 years, we have really accumulated a large stock of risk. And every country has a share of these large stocks of risks. In this report we try to go beyond the traditional way of describing this risk in terms of locality or in terms of economic loss. We felt a much better way of describing it in terms of life years lost.

Not as indulging as it seems
Lasse Halstroms five Oscar nominated Chocolat is a conservation vs freedom movie which works towards establishing a new social order in the society. The object from which the movie derives its title is used as a metaphor for welcoming passion and delight.
Based on Joanne Harris book of the same name Chocolat centres on a tranquil fictional French village named Lansquenet in 1959. The heroine of the tale is Vianne Rocher who opens a Chocolaterie during Lent and adds a splash of colour and difference to the drab lifestyle of its occupants. The story opens with tantalizing scenes of how traditional chocolate is made are finally put on display at the window. After such enticing displays the camera focuses on the drab environs of the village where life seems mechanical. The occupants are made to curb their desires in the name of religion and these rules are enforced on them by the Comte de Reynaud who is the villain of the story.
Just when the situation seems hopeless Vianne enters the scene with her charming young daughter, Anouk. The two have been moving from city to city, weaving their magic and spreading cheer into the life of other human beings.
Viannes act of opening a chocolate shop in the pious village during holy Lent itself is a shocking novelty. Later the second shock comes because Vianne reveals that she is not one who would attend the traditional Mass dutifully like the other villagers. This element adds further distaste to the Comtes opinion of her but the generous lady slowly begins breaking down some of the prejudices of the villagers through her goodwill.
Judi Dench as the landlady
Apart from an amusing tale, Chocolat also reveals how its namesake came to be. Vianne tells the folklore of how her ancestors, the Mayan Indians, make ancient formulas for remedies. Though Viannes mother was a Mayan woman who had been brought to France by her husband, she could not bear the conventional life and was lured away by the mysterious call of the north wind to travel from place to place curing other living beings with her chocolate formula.
Though the characters are amusingly etched, the storyline is presented a slow pacing fashion which does not generate excitement. Humour is hardly present except in instances such as when a local couple is able to rekindle their marriage when the man eats some of the magical chocolates left near the bin by his affection-starved wife.
The story also reminds us of Chitra Banerjee Divakarunis 1997 novel The Mistress of Spices which was made into a movie by Paul Mayeda Berges in 2005. However unlike Divakarunis Tilo who is on the verge of losing her own magical powers because of her desire for love, Harris Vianne does not shy away from indulging in a romance with Roux. However like Tilo, Vianne too helps repair family ties like in the case of bringing an artistic young boy to break free from his mothers rigid rules and unite with his roguish grandmother. Much like Tilo, Vianne also saves an abused housewife from her husbands tyranny and helps her to find a voice for herself.
However unlike in The Mistress of Spices Vianne is able to continue with her life in the village once its inhabitants begins to accept her. Even the Count falls under the chocolates spell and learns to let bygones be bygones and look towards a brighter future. With him succumbing to his natural instincts the whole village is liberated. Though the north wind returns after her deed is done and calls the half-Mayan woman to another designation, Vianne throws her wanderlust to the wind and decides to make her home in Lansquenet.
There are several underlying themes in the movie: the nobility using the church as a means of exercising their power of the common folk and the need to liberate repressed instincts to lead a life worth living.
Juliette Binoche makes a lively Vianne. She captures her characters warm eccentricity with zest. Her slight, knowing smirk is infectious and says what needs to be said without using words or gestures. Judi Dench is fitting as the difficult landlady who eventually wins her love and trust because she is not a conventionalist. Alfred Molina, Lena Olin and Carrie-Anne Moss are convincing in their characters. Hugh OConor provides comic relief as the young priest who is hounded by the Count. A disappointing element in Chocolat is that the dashing Johnny Depp is not given enough screen presence. His talents are wasted in brief appearances as the guitar-plucking traveler Roux.
Chocolat is alluring wrapped with some of the finest actors taking part in the production. Yet the movie is too lengthy and monotonous to make you develop an appetite for it.

Ravi to make special statement on countrys financial situation
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said he will make a special statement about the financial situation of the country within the next two days. It will also reveal the manner in which world economic trends influenced Sri Lanka.
Their main responsibility is to strengthen the countrys economy notwithstanding the world financial situation. They were presently discussing these (situations) with economic experts and asking them to make proposals to be included in the government budget to be presented on November 20. They are prepared to include all sound proposals in the budget.
Karunanayake was speaking to the media after meeting CIMA President Mrs Myrian Maddem who called on him at the Finance Ministry yesterday. During the meeting Mrs Maddem congratulated Minister Karunanayake for being the first CIMA qualified Finance Minister in the world and wished him success in all his future endeavours. She said this was a great source of strength to Sri Lankas economic development process.
Minister Karunanayake also told the media that the bankrupt opposition parties were directing various false accusations against the government saying there were moves to privatise certain institutions.
He wished to categorically state that they had removed the word privatisation from their vocabulary, and what they intend doing was to subject certain state institutions to proper management. It did not mean divesting state ownership.
For instance the loss incurred by Sri Lankan airways amounted to Rs 132,000 million. They were now trying to correct this wrong. Similarly they were prepared to probe bribery and corruption in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. It was certain opposition elements talking about privatisation who tried to sell prime land in the country to foreigners in various ways during the previous regime.
Mrs Maddem was accompanied by CIMA Executive Director Charles Tilley, Director Radley Stephen and CIMA Sri Lanka President Vipula Gunathilake.

Vocal Enigma launches website
Seeking to inspire by being inspired
Having being confined to the parameters of social media, Vocal Enigma will now have the capacity to expand their reach with the launch of their website thereby bridging the gap between the group and the target audience.
Vocal Enigma was formed purely out of the want to share the love of music with others. It is the reality of a multifaceted idea that took root in Sri Lankan musician Maneesh Dasanayake. Starting out as a certificate course at St. Josephs College of Arts and Science Bangalore India, the choir grew from strength to strength. It was a dream come true when Maneesh, with the support and guidance of then Principal of the College Rev. Fr. (Dr.) Ambrose Pinto, formed Vocal Enigma on November 16, 2010.
Within a short span time, they became Bangalores leading choral group by winning the citys most prestigious choir competition Basel Mission. On completing his degree in India, Maneesh returned to Sri Lanka and brought together friends he had worked with in various choral groups to form Vocal Enigma Sri Lanka. Under his guidance, Vocal Enigma Sri Lanka hosted their first fund raising show From a Distance in September 2012 in aid of cancer patients. The Playlist and Kennel Rock in 2013 raised funds for orphans and physically challenged children and AWPA Sri Lanka respectively. Apart from hosting their own shows, the choir has also worked on projects with the likes of Jith Pieris, Roshini Stanley, Sherin Jacob and Bridget Halpe.
Driven with passion brought together in a common love for music, Vocal Enigma is unrestricted with the music they perform. Their performances are inspired from genres of Gospel to contemporary to the 60s and 70s and all the way to Broadway. This approach gives the choir a versatile and a choral twist which will cater to the musical taste buds of all generations. As the choir stands as a beacon of how music transcends all barriers for the greater good their goal is to make a difference, even if it means to put a smile on a childs face.

The slings the thing for one heck of a fling!
Pssst! Over here, boys! Dont tell spoilsport adults, but the catapult could soon be making a comeback! The humble slingshot has been a fixture among boys across cultures and across generations. For us baby boomers any boy who did not own a sling was considered a sissy.
I noticed new versions of the toy are being marketed as a way to encourage boys to make contact with their inner Dennis the Menace image. My brother Denis whose name is spelt with a single n was far more menacing than his comic book counterpart as a kid.
The Dennis of fiction was depicted as just a normal five and half year old, realistically thoughtless and reckless for his age. His status as a menace was entirely due to the unforeseen consequences of his adventures and Dennis was usually responsible and mature enough to own up when he realised hed done something wrong.
Incidentally, the sibling Denis was around the same age as the American cartoonist Hank Ketchams pint-sized hero when he first hit the news-stands. It was synchronously a sort of unexpected phenomenon. However, it did occur and in a universe as big as ours strange coincidences are bound to happen.
Now some six decades later, brother Denis says he is relieved that slingers have the promise of making a comeback despite parental safety regulations that are destroying childhood. The Yanks call these weapons slingshots but we called them cattys or catapults, while in the local Sinhala vernacular they were referred to as catapols.
The comic book Dennis was the archetypal badly behaved schoolboy with a touch of innocence that appealed to readers. I must admit that my brother Denis, the bother of my life, was far more anarchical in his outlook. Besides, if the truth be told, I was no cherubic angel either, not by a long sling shot.
In similarity to the fictional brat you could picture us little bounders roaming the range of shrub land with handmade catapults dangling from our back pants pockets. Our side pockets bulged with rounded pebbles we used as ammunition when we set our sights on a tempting target. Actually glass marbles were more effective projectiles but too precious to sling away at worthless targets.
Like the gunslingers of the old wild West we were equipped and ready to draw and fire at a split seconds notice. Through constant practice we developed the necessary muscle, memory and instinctive aim for taking fast shots as they presented themselves. Make no mistake about it catapults are weapons. There is no gainsaying the fact that they could be lethal as well. Now I am certain that many protective and unadventurous parents may wonder why our parents let their kids wander around armed and dangerous!
In mitigation I can say that they could never be considered responsible for our actions because we manufactured our own weaponry at absolutely no cost. The lethal aspect was determined by the choice of ammo one selected. And our parents were never truthfully apprised of the lethality of the projectiles.
Obviously, common sense is required whenever you use a catapult, and serious injuries can occur if they are misused. That bit of advice was drummed into our heads with repetitive regularity. Other warnings included, always ensure that you have a safe backstop to catch the projectiles during target practice and always treat a catapult in the same way as you would treat a gun. Never point it at anyone.
Still like all good hunters we used different calibre ammo for different targets. Big round pebbles were fair for targeting rats. But two-legged rats deserved less deadly missiles such as hard, green jam fruits.
Nonetheless, it was the type of ammo whose zing caused a nasty sting, to prompt tattle-tale victims to scream out the common painful epithet, Budu Ammo! - which has nothing to do with ammo!
During the vacations, when my brothers Denis, Lance and countless cousins such as Arlen, Ralph and Bambi came to visit, we would organise war games. We divided ourselves into teams and used these hard jam fruits to stock our armouries with before the battles began. And what pitched battles they were! We unleashed broadside after broadside of improvised shot and shell at one another amid a cacophony of war-whoops and painful yelps.
During our time catapults were traditionally made using a forked tree branch and two bands of bicycle rubber inner tubing to provide the spring for projectiles. You also needed a piece of soft leather for the pellet pouch  for which old shoe tongues were the ideal material. The best wood for catapult handles were found in hedgerows. The ultimate choice for a handle was a forked Y shaped branch with U or Vshaped arms of equal diameter. The handle, or karu in local parlance, should be thick enough to provide a good grip. Goda kaduru or the poisonous bitter nut tree provided the ideal wood for the purpose. It is also best to allow the wood to season for a few months. But in a survival situation green wood will work fine.
The catapult is held and used in a similar way to an archery bow. The projectile in its leather pouch is held between the folded index finger and thumb of your right hand. Occasionally when practicing you will hit your hand when it shoots forward, this hurts, but serves as a good reminder to hold the catapult straight next time.

Special driving licenses for school vans
From January 1, 2016, a new special driving license will be issued to all public transport drivers.
School van drivers, three wheel drivers (at a later stage) etc., will be included in this category, DIG Traffic, Amarasiri Senaratne said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday he said that from January 1, 2016, this special driving license will be a must for all school bus/van drivers.
The drivers who wish to obtain their driving license (new drivers) must have driven for a period of three years in order to obtain the special public transport driving license. The system that add marks to the driving license for every traffic rule violation, other offences etc will be introduced soon with the assistance of the Motor traffic Commissioner.
According to DIG Senaratne, the childrens seat will also be made compulsory soon when transporting children in private vehicles. Seat belts have already been nade compulsory for the passenger who sits next to the driver (front seat) in all vehicles with English numbers. But all the other (old) vehicle owners who know the importance of safety have already installed seat belts for their old vehicles.
DIG Senaratne pointed out that a request has already been made from all three wheel manufacturers to install a new belt for the rare seat of all three wheelers in order to make sure that no child is being thrown out from fast moving three wheelers in future. Fifty two percent of the total number of accidents are caused by motor bicycle riders and 18 percent of the total number of accidents are cause by three wheel drivers. By August 31 this year, a total of 2442 accidents had been reported.

Sri Lankas war crimes controversy
Earlier this month, the UNs Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released its long-awaited investigation into alleged crimes during Sri Lankas civil war. The conflict, which began in 1983 and lasted nearly three decades, pitted the Sri Lankan government against various ethnic Tamil rebels, most prominent the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which were fighting for the creation of a separate state in the countrys north and east.
The 272-page report makes for grim reading. Focusing on alleged abuses committed by both sides between 2002 and 2011, it documents numerous crimes, including unlawful killings and sexual violence, especially at the hands of the military during the last phase of the war in 2009, under the administration of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The report contains few factual surprises, after years of drip-by-drip accounts of atrocities from journalists and human rights groups, and a previous United Nations investigation in 2011. But it is arresting for the disconnect between the seriousness of the abuses it documents and the mildness of its recommendations.
The report offers a slew of proposals better designed for strengthening human rights protection in the future than for prosecuting past atrocities. Its most salient proposal is a call to try suspected criminals before a hybrid special court with both international and Sri Lankan prosecutors and judges - but the idea is a nonstarter, as its proponents well know.
LTTE leaders
This outcome is a political compromise. The Western states that clamored for the U.N. investigation, especially the United States and some European countries, will push for accountability in Sri Lanka today only so far as doing so will not weaken the countrys fledgling pro-Western government. They will not force the administration of President Maithripala Sirisena, who defeated Mr. Rajapaksa in elections earlier this year, to take actions that the Sinhalese majority cannot tolerate, or that look like the government is turning its back on the armed forces and inviting foreign meddling.
The OHCHR report was ordered by a 2014 resolution from the U.N.s Human Rights Council, after Mr. Rajapaksas government spent several years stalling on conducting a comprehensive probe of its own. His government also refused to cooperate with the U.N. team, never even allowing it into the country. But investigators managed to collect substantial evidence through affidavits and interviews with witnesses and secondary sources.
The report states that thousands, and likely tens of thousands of civilians died, mostly as a result of indiscriminate government shelling and bombardment. While the LTTE forcibly recruited adults and children and used civilians as buffers, according to the U.N. investigation, government forces systematically committed grave abuses, especially in early 2009 after they cornered the LTTE in a small pocket of coastal land in Mullaitivu district.
The report found evidence or reasonable grounds to believe that the army shelled hospitals and facilities where civilians were sheltering, that government troops raped Tamil women and that LTTE leaders who surrendered were then executed.
The report does not implicate the countrys new leaders. Mr. Sirisena served as Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Health under Mr. Rajapaksa and had no direct role; Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe initiated the peace process in 2002.
It is Mr. Rajapaksa, his brother the former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, and the former Army Chief Sarath Fonseka who have the most to fear.
Yet there seems to be little appetite among Sinhalese, who make up three-quarters of the population, to investigate even their culpability. Although Mr. Rajapaksa was voted out of office this year, largely because of perceived corruption, nepotism and an increasingly autocratic style, he is widely credited with having ended the war. And in a 2014 poll by the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a Sri Lankan NGO, 35 percent of Sinhalese respondents said the government had already done a lot to address the root causes of the ethnic conflict, compared with 3 percent who said it had done nothing.
Of the Tamils surveyed, however, 40 percent said the Rajapaksa government had done nothing, compared with 2 percent who said it had done a lot. As though responding to these divisions in public opinion, the Ohchr report provides little to bring to justice the main suspects  mostly field commanders, in addition to the former defense secretary and the former army chief. Instead, its recommendations are geared toward mitigation and prevention.
Human Rights Council
Proposed measures include returning private land seized by the army, ending the harassment of human rights defenders, passing legislation criminalizing war crimes and enforced disappearances, establishing a witness-protection programme, developing a national reparations policy and providing psychosocial support for victims - mostly policies the Sirisena government could pursue without risking a major public backlash.
Whether to create a court, and what kind, to try alleged perpetrators would be a different matter. In March, the Centre for Policy Alternatives conducted a poll asking respondents whether there should be a credible mechanism to look into what happened during the last stage of the war. Only 32 percent of Sinhalese said yes (while 44 percent said no), compared with 84 percent of Tamils who said yes (with only 9 percent saying no). Opinions were also divided over whether any such process should be domestic or international or a combination.
The OHCHR reports central recommendation to set up a hybrid tribunal was thus the most controversial  which may be why almost as soon as it was made, its backers signaled their willingness to endorse something less. On Friday, the United States and Britain, among other Western states, joined Sri Lanka in proposing a draft resolution that will be presented for a vote at the Human Rights Council later this week.
Instead of a hybrid court, the document endorses the Sri Lankan governments idea to create a domestic judicial mechanism with a special counsel, with the participation of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers.
These Western states appear to be going along with the Sirisena government on the strength of its promise to conduct a credible domestic investigation - even though its predecessor failed to do so and the countrys legal system seems to lack the capacity to address wartime abuses effectively.
But after years of obstruction under Mr. Rajapaksa, this watered-down proposal is the most tangible expression yet of the Sri Lankan governments willingness to cooperate with the international community in reckoning with the war. And if Sri Lankas new leaders reject the hybrid special court, they may be in a stronger position to sell the OHCHR reports other recommendations to the Sinhalese population.
This would be some measure of progress  perhaps more on strengthening Sri Lankas human rights regime in the future than on accountability for past crimes, but it would be progress nonetheless.

Tonga take aim at Namibia in race for third place
Tonga face Namibia on Tuesday with their aim reset on finishing third in Pool C to seal automatic qualification for the 2019 World Cup while the southern Africans will simply be after a first-ever win.
Tonga went down to a shock 17-10 defeat by Georgia in their opening match, throwing the scrap for third place wide open behind heavyweights New Zealand and Argentina.
While Tonga mathematically remain in the hunt for second place, they have still to play the All Blacks and the Pumas, who finish up their pool campaign against Namibia.
Namibia have made eight changes to the starting line-up that lost 58-14 to New Zealand last week.
Indefatigable Saracens flanker Jacques Burger will captain the side coached by Welshman Phil Davies to make his 10th World Cup appearance, which leaves him one shy of the team record of 11 held by Hugo Horn.
Tonga, an ever-present at the World Cup bar one absence in 1991, have nine changes, coach Mana Otai explaining that decision by pointing to the short timespan between the next games.

The Diyasara Student Circle is a unique project in that light, having only winners and no losers. In this competition the loser is as good as the winner, as the objective behind the programme is to impart knowledge relating to environmental concerns and the need for water conservation to the students who are the future leaders of this country. Thus, the knowledge gained through this initiative is of great importance and it is something that is invaluable."
Mohan Bharara, Group Director/CEO, The Capital Maharaja Organisation Ltd, addressing the gathering commented.

Tourist Focused!
Taking into account, the robust growth of the global tourism industry, this years World Tourism Day celebrations, which fell on September 27th was themed One Billion Tourists and One Billion Opportunites. Taking this theme as an impetus, the students of the first batch of the Executive Diploma In Tourism, Event and Hospitality Management (EDETHM) of the University of Colombo (UOC) organised the Tourism Leaders Summit on Billions of tourists, billions of opportunities in MICE tourism and sustainable tourism development in Sri Lanka, which was successfully concluded at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH). John Amarathunga, Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Affairs participated as chief guest while many other dignitaries including academics, professionals of the tourism sector and the local business community were also present at the event.
One of the highlights of the event was a demonstration by Sri Lankas culinary master Chef (Dr) Publis Silva who presented his expertise on how Sri Lankan culinary could be projected in promoting Sri Lanka tourism. Further, in recognition of his decades of dedicated service in urging people to foster an enthusiastic attitude towards traditional Sri Lankan cuisine, he was felicitated with a token of appreciation, as a mark of respect for his illustrious career.
The summit, organised with the key objectives of identifying new opportunities in order to create diversified MICE and other tourism businesses, and promoting innovative and analytical thinking to develop such business and thereby exploit emerging markets, was an ideal knowledge sharing platform for industry stakeholders, which enabled them to deliberate on stressing issues of Sri Lanka tourism. Moreover, it brought together the public and private sector institutions such as the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB), Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLIATO) and Sri Lanka Association of Professional Conference, Exhibition and Event Organizers (SLAPCEO), paving way for an forum, which gathered the inputs of both these sectors on strategizing the way forward for Sri Lanka Tourism.
In his address, Minister John Amarathunga said that tourism is one of the most dynamic sectors that contribute towards the global economy. It is a leading sector that makes a contribution of 10 percent to the global GDP and six percent of the worlds total exports. I am extremely thankful to the university of Colombo for organising this event. In order to develop tourism sector of Sri Lanka, it is important to develop synergies between government agencies, academic institutions and industry stakeholders. This gives an immense opportunity to address the challenges we face in tourism industry at present. Sri Lanka is marching towards a new era of prosperity after 30 years of ethnic crisis and civil war. Hence, tourism industry plays a pivotal role in the economic growth of Sri Lanka. Development of this industry is crucial to the country to earn the much needed foreign currency.

UN Security Council must be reformed - Merkel
GERMANY: It is high time the United Nations Security Council is reformed to reflect the real distribution of power across the world in the 21st century, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday.
We need a new method of work to solve problems, Merkel said. That makes reform of the Security Council necessary, reform which reflects the real power in the world better than the situation today.
The appeal was in a summary of Merkels opening remarks at a meeting with her counterparts from Brazil, India and Japan provided to reporters by the German delegation.
We have to proceed very wisely, she added, according to the summary. We have to find allies to reach our goal of reform.
Merkel is in New York for a summit meeting of world leaders on global development at the UN General Assembly.
The Security Council, the most powerful UN body, has 15 members, five of them permanent. It has the ability to issue legally binding resolutions imposing sanctions or authorizing military action to enforce its decisions.
The 10 temporary members are elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly.
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, key allies from World War Two, are permanent veto-wielding council members.
Germany, Japan, India and Brazil say the world is very different from what it was in 1945 and the Security Council should reflect that. Germany and Japan, which are global financial powers and top contributors to the United Nations, argue that they deserve permanent council seats.
The current atmosphere is that not only we four but many others dont agree with the structure and the working method of the Security Council, Merkel told the other leaders. We want to take others with us to reach a modern working structure of the Security Council which suits the 21st century.
The goal of expanding the council to include additional permanent and temporary members has long been an elusive one. Many UN member states routinely call for Security Council reform and have been working for decades, so far unsuccessfully, to find an acceptable formula for expanding the council.
The five permanent council members can block any such moves. Britain and France say they support council reform. The United States has also cautiously backed it. UN diplomats say China, and to a lesser extent Russia, are the principal opponents of the idea.

The UK's only permanent ice bar, this location is simply unforgettable. Everything inside is carved from crystal clear ice from the Torne River in Jukkasjrvi, Northern Sweden, absolutely EVERYTHING - the bar, the walls, tables and even your own personal glass. As it's a chilly -5C, you are handed a hooded thermal cape and gloves before going in.
Every year the icy architecture is taken down and transformed for a new theme.This year, the upcoming theme is ICEBAR LONDON ROCKS, featuring a "rocktastic" 6ft tall Ice Skull sculpture, a punk rock ice-studded bar and specially created cocktails: "November Rain" and "Dirty Little Secret".

Surrounded by tropical banana trees, the open air view is simply spectacular

Fancing trying to eat in complete darkness Dans le noir (French for In the dark) has five restaurants in London, Paris, Barcelona, Nairobi and St Petersburg, where you will be served simple, fresh food by blind waiters. The company claims: "By suppressing the dominant sense of sight, you will enter a whole new world in which one is uncertain of their surroundings."
The only question is, how do you go to the loo
The Modern Toilet, Taiwan
This definitely might not not be to everyone's taste. The Modern Toilet restaurant is a venue where everything is bathroom-themed. From toilet-shaped seats to bath tables, you can't seem to get away from the washroom. The owners claim this venture began when one of them was "reading manga on the toilet - and the rest is history". They began solely selling ice cream, where the bowl was a mini-toilet, and the ice cream was all brown in colour (regardless of the flavour) and shaped like - well, like poo.
Since then, they have developed into a fully-fledged themed chain with branches all over Taiwan.
Alice in Magic Land, Tokyo
Fall down the rabbit hole at one Diamond Dining's six Alice in Wonderland-themed venues throughout Japan. Featuring playing card tables, hedge maze booths, heart-shaped chandeliers and waitresses clad in Alice-style dresses, you will not find anything here without at least a hint of Wionderland.
Volcano House, Hawaii
Dining on the rim of a volcano has to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The Rim at Volcano House, Hawaii sits on top of Kilauea Caldera, with spectacular views of the majestic Halema'uma'u crater.
Nearly all of the meat, seafood, fruit and vegetables used in the traditional dishes are sourced from local Hawaiian farmers and suppliers. Make sure to try the Hilo-coffee rubbed lamb.
