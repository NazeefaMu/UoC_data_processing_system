96 taps into nostalgia
There is a lot to fall in love with 96, a wistful romantic film about a past romance, like Autograph and Premam. But what sets Prem Kumars film apart from the others is that it gives equal importance to the romance of its female lead. It does begin as the story of its male lead, Ram (Vijay Sethupathi), a travel photographer. A chance visit to his native, Tanjore, triggers a flood of memories for him the places that have defined his childhood, like the bus stand where his parents landed at after their marriage, the hospital where he was born, the place that was the first major shopping centre in his town, and most importantly, the school where he met the love of his life, Janaki Devi (Trisha). That is the only place that he chooses to drop by, and this leads to him connecting with his old classmates, and they all decide to have a reunion. And that is where he meets Janaki, his Janu, once again, after a gap of 22 years.
The Tamil film 96 is screening at Capitol, MC Jaffna, MC Colombo, Cine City and other film halls

Aan Devathai
Filmmaker Thamira made his directorial debut with the film Rettai Suzhi following which after a long hiatus is back with the film Aan Devathai.
The film features Samuthirakani and Ramya Pandian of Joker fame in lead roles. With the film hitting screens on October 5, filmmaker Thamira says, The film has come out decently well!
I see this film as a reflection of the present society and its people.
The movie depicts the trials and tribulations as to how the people of the current generation and even the future generation are subjected to due to factors such as globalization.
A film can achieve success in two different ways. In the first place, it follows the existing successful formula and wins.
In the 2nd category, the film attempts something unique, different from the usual tend, and thus becomes a new trend-setter! So, I am confident that Aan Devathai would be a sure success and will be a trendsetter.

Aan Devathai will be screening at the Capitol, Chelva Jaffna and other film halls from October 12

Drought in Anuradhapura
Cabinet proposal for more irrigation wells
Development was not limited to education and the supply of water, electricity and transportation, but to improving disaster management measures as well, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a gathering while inspecting the renovations being done on an anicut at Elayapaththuwa in Mahamankadawala, Weliamuna. He said, The Good Governance Government has been doing its best to assist people in distress. I was a minister during the previous regime, which neglected this responsibility during the droughts that occurred in 2013.
Minister Dissanayake said that although Anuradhapura had recently received rain, around 150,000 drought-stricken families were still suffering. Hence, under the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, the Disaster Management Ministry had decided to provide dry food ration parcels worth Rs.5,000 to those in need, and Rs. 9 billion would be allocated for the purpose.
I have submitted a Cabinet paper requesting funds valued at Rs.200 million for excavating irrigation wells in the main areas where droughts had hit, the minister said.
The President had ordered the restoration of 20 dilapidated tanks under two tank networks in Nochchiyagama and Mahawilachchiya, at a cost of Rs.100 million. Rs.1.4 billion would also be used to undertake the Gamperaliya infrastructural development project in the Anuradhapura district, Dissanayake added.

Dont be misled by reports on elections
Various ideas are expressed and news items are published about the formation of a coalition or caretaker government. Some say that discussions are held in this direction. Some of these stories tend to upset peoples minds. But no one should get agitated about these things because there is a long way to go for an election, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He was addressing the Badulla District SLFP Youth Conference held at the Badulla James Peiris hall on October 7.
Minister de Silva said President Maithripala Sirisena had reiterated that he will not call a Presidential election even one day ahead of the scheduled date. When time comes for an election, political forces would field a common candidate or separate candidates of their own to contest the Presidential election, he said.
Let us then decide as to which candidate we should lend our support, Minister de Silva said.
Let us wait till nominations are submitted to contest the Presidential election. By that time, we would conduct open discussions and seminars to decide on the suitable candidate. The SLFP Central Committee will then decide on the candidate who will receive our support, he said.
The minister said if you took five sections of the media into consideration, they published five different views on the same subject.
The identical news item should appear in all five sections of the media for it to be true. As such, no one should get agitated or upset over various news items as it would only harm unity and their organizational strength, he said.
Minister de Silva said that even though other people were inviting them to join hands with them, they in the SLFP had no intention of joining hands with others, although others are free to join hands with the SLFP.
The UNP and the SLFP were the two major political parties in the country. Unless others come and join hands with the SLFP, they were not prepared to leave the SLFP and join any other party, he said.
Minister de Silva said the President, as their party leader, was rendering a colossal amount of service towards the countrys development. The Gamperaliya programme had ushered in a development revolution in the villages.
The SLFP was taking decisions in the interest of the youth generation in particular because it was their bounden duty to ensure a bright future for the youth.
Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dissanayake and SLFP Youth Federation President Shantha Bandara were also present.

Economy picking up, criticism without data harmful
Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy yesterday said Sri Lankas economy is growing and is on an upward trend although the growth has been slow.
He said the growth in the second quarter was higher than the first quarter and he expected the growth in the second half to be higher than the first half. Headline inflation in September was 4.3 percent and food price inflation extremely low because of pretty decent Maha and Yala harvests, he told a World Bank forum to launch South Asian report on regional trade yesterday.
Talking about criticisms by certain groups on the present economic situation, the governor said, those who are saying economy is collapsing is actually acting as anti-nationalist act. 
They have to back that claim up with data and data on growth. Current inflation and reserves do not point to any collapse, he said.
Inflation has stabilised and reserves have improved. Sri Lanka will also receive US$ 1 billion this week. The current reserve level stands at US$ 7.1 billion. We are also hoping to finalise Panda and Samurai bonds which would bring another US$ 500 million shortly.
Last week, the Central Bank officials said they expect to close this year with around US$ 8.3 billion of reserves.

The exchange rate of the US dollar was Rs.49.50 in 1994; but by 2014, it had risen to Rs.138.59. That was when the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) was in power under Mahinda Rajapaksa, Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.

It was the same Mahinda Rajapakse who recently suggested the formation of a coalition government resolve the alleged chaos in the present regime, he said and added that Rajapaksa should realise that chaos was only present when he was in office.
The currencies of certain countries have recently depreciated by more than 50 percent. Our government managed to maintain the depreciation rate at seven to eight percent, the minister said.
Minister Hashim said that people suffered during the Rajapaksa regime: prices of essential commodities were high, and those commodities were scarce.
Especially lentils, sugar, dried fish, and milk powder were overpriced. A new tax was also imposed during the previous government, which only contributed to an inflationary spiral, the minister added.

The operation is just to keep everything in the right place so the bone can heal of its own accord.
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said he expected the World Cup winning loose forward, who has played 60 Tests, to return to top-level rugby.

APRACA forum in Colombo: Focus on SMEs, entrepreneurship and developing value chains
The inauguration ceremony of the Asia Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Associations (APRACA) regional policy forum was held at Hilton, Colombo yesterday. The forum will be continued till October 10 at the same venue. Foreign delegates from member countries are also participating in the event.
It is after many years that Sri Lanka is hosting the forum which will discuss challenges and tools to enhance access to finance by MSMEs (Micro Small Medium Enterprises) in the Asia Pacific Region. Recommendations emanating from the regional forum will guide APRACA member on enhancing strategies to enhance MSME financing. It is a privilege to host the regional policy forum, said General Manager, CEO of Bank of Ceylon and the Vice-Chair APRACA Senarath Bandara. He further addressed that this event offers opportunity for local banks and financial institutions to expand and strengthen their network with other similar institutions in the region.
This year we are participating in the policy forum on financing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises: Solution for missing middle, said Shiba Raj Shrestha, Deputy Governor, Nepal Rastra Bank and Chairman, APRACA. According to Anushka Wijesinha, Advisor, Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, SMEs are key to inclusive growth due to their wide geographical spread and wide sectorial coverage. Altogether majority prefer government banks for financing. However low GDP growth context, lack of specialized credit lines, continued over reliance on concessionary credit lines are some issues faced by SMEs. The National export strategy target of US $ 28 billion by 2022, Innovation and Entrepreneur strategy and trade adjustment program are some new national initiatives to benefit SMEs.
According to Nimal Fernando, Chief Risk Officer, Bank of Ceylon, weakness in cash flow, irregular supply chain, lack of infrastructure for data security and too much dependency on key person are some risks faced by SMEs.
APRACA is a non-governmental international organization. It involves central banks, agricultural and development banks, commercial banks, apex organizations, federations of financial institutions and rural development institutions in the region. The headquarters is situated in Bangkok, Thailand. It has been praised as an association that has worked for the rural growth and development to uplift the rural poor in the Asia-Pacific region.

Australia face tough task after Sohail hits maiden Pakistan ton
Dubai, Monday: Australias openers survived a torrid 13 over spell to finish on 30 without loss after Haris Sohails maiden century guided Pakistan to 482 on the second day of the first Test in Dubai on Monday.
Usman Khawaja was unbeaten on 17 and debutant Aaron Finch was 13 not out as Australia negotiated some tight spin bowling from Pakistan on a pitch which has started to show signs of turn.
Pakistan unleashed four overs from leg-spinner Yasir Shah and a combined three from off-spinners Mohammad Hafeez and Bilal Asif, but both Australian openers looked assured.
Australia trail Pakistan by 452 runs with all ten wickets intact, but they face a big battle ahead of them with Yasir expected to pose the main threat.
A sparkling hundred from left-hander Sohail and a polished 80 from Asad Shafiq enabled Pakistan to build on an overnight score of 255 for 3, with nightwatchman Mohammad Abbas (one) the only wicket to fall in the morning session.
Sohails patient six-hour knock featured eight fours and two sixes, as he added 150 for the fifth wicket with Shafiq who was unlucky to miss out on his 10th century.
The pair frustrated the Australian attack with some solid batting as Pakistan reached 329-4 at lunch, with both in sight of centuries.
But Shafiq fell to the leg-spin of Marnus Labuschagne minutes before tea as he edged a turning ball to wicketkeeper Tim Paine for the debutants first wicket.
Shafiq hit nine boundaries and a six in his 278 minutes at the crease.
Sohail did to get to three figures though, hitting a six off spinner Jon Holland before cutting him to third man for two to complete his century.
He was finally dismissed by Nathan Lyon, caught behind as he tried to cut the off-spinner, having easily surpassed his previous best of 76 made against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi last year.
Sohail was pleased to go on and post a big score after regularly making several promising starts before getting out earlier in the year.
I was getting out on 30-40 runs on the tour of England (in May-June this year), said Sohail. So I wanted to get out of that panic situation and I am happy that I have done that today. AFP

They managed to beat all the famous teams such as SSC, NCC, Colts and so on. There were six medical students in the cricket team.
Buddy Reid and Mano were the outstanding batsmen at the university and they were selected to play for Ceylon in the Gopalan Trophy match against Tamil Nadu. Mano and Buddy were again in the team against the visiting Australians led by Bobby Simpson. Mano scored a laboured 64 in that match.
Mano recalled that both he and Buddy Reid were stodgy batsman who were technically excellent. Thereafter it was Pakistan they played against and Michael Tissera was the captain since C.I. Gunasekera had retired. They beat the Pakistanis and Mano opened batting with T.C.T. Edwards another Thomian who was flamboyant. There were 7 Thomians in that team that included Buddy Reid, Michael Tissera, Lareef Idroos, Neil Chanmugam and P.I. Peiris. Mano recalled that the Ceylon team then had struck a purple patch. There was another trip to India. Ceylon lost two Test matches and won in Ahmedabad. By now Mano was more interested in his cricket than studies. Mano noted that he was obsessed with cricket and he wanted somehow to balance his studies and cricket. He was eyeing to play for Cambridge because the prestigious Universities like Oxford and Cambridge were the nurseries for budding international cricketers.
He mentioned a few famous names that walked the portals of these two universities like the Nawab of Pataudi, Javed Burki, Gamini Goonesena, Peter May, Colin Cowdrey and Imran Khan and the list goes on. They were all well to do.
Mano was fortunate to join Cambridge to study architecture mainly due to his international exposure in playing for Ceylon. Gamini Goonesena was also at Cambridge before him reading Estate Management.
Mano played with Vijaya Malalasekera who was a flamboyant cricketer and Mano recalled that he was a more serious cricketer. Vijays father was our Ambassador in London, G.P. Malalasekera. Vijaya joined Cambridge one year before Mano and played under Derek Murray the West Indies wicket keeper.
During this period Clive Inman and Stanley Jayasinghe were entertaining the crowds in the county scene and Mano noted that their cavalier approach to batting was home made from Ceylon those days. Stanley Jayasinghe came back to Sri Lanka and contributed immensely to Sri Lanka cricket but Mano noted that Clive unfortunately was never heard since he had faded away thereafter.
Cambridge Blue Mano played some memorable knocks and one was against Middlesex a 90 and the other was an unbeaten century against Hampshire. He notched 800 odd runs for Cambridge in one season and he was earmarked for the aborted tour to England.
Mano was perplexed when the tour was aborted and he was unaware of the dealings back home. However Mano stated that Dhanasiri Weerasinghe and H.I.K. Fernando had become the selectors and Dhanasiri being the chairman there were some disagreements.
When Mano represented Ceylon against India they were paid Rs 50 a day and Mano said without any malice that now the boys are getting big bucks.
Mano never played club cricket in Ceylon even when he got back he was working for his charter both as an engineer and as an architect.
He mentioned that he had played several times for the MCC and has been an MCC member for 50 years. For the tsunami match the MCC gave one million dollars for the Tsunami fund and Mano was a trustee for them. He did some work for Kushil Gunasekeras Foundation of Goodness, as an architect in Killinochchi.
Mano is disappointed about Sri Lanka losing to teams such as Afghanistan and Bangladesh. He was of the opinion that cricket has been diluted with many teams below par playing in the top tournament.
On the contrary he was emphatic that exposure should be given to talented players in the age group of 19 to 24 where they are malleable to change their technique.
Mano has two sons living in U.K. and one is a banker and the other is into H.R. His wife spends six months in U.K. and 6 months in Sri Lanka with Mano. He said that he prefers to stay in Sri Lanka, where he is a much sought after architect.

China shares weigh on regional markets
Shares in Asia stumbled in early trade on Monday as investors waited with bated breath as Chinas markets prepare to reopen following a week-long holiday and after its central bank cut banks reserve requirements in a bid to support growth. MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent, after major stock markets around the world fell for a second straight day on Friday. European markets were also set to weaken, with financial spread-betters expecting the FTSE to open 0.07 percent lower, Frankfurts DAX down 0.03 percent, and Paris CAC down 0.1 percent.
The Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday cut the level of cash that banks must hold as reserves, aimed at lowering financing costs as policymakers worry about fallout from the tariff row with the United States.
Reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) - currently 15.5 percent for large commercial lenders and 13.5 percent for smaller banks - will be cut by 100 basis points effective Oct. 15, the PBOC said, matching a similar-sized move in April.
Asian shares were also hit on Monday as investors in Chinese stocks reacted for the first time to new pressure from Washington and a report that Chinese spies had compromised U.S. hardware.
At 0540 GMT, Chinas blue-chip CSI300 index was 3.5 percent lower while the main Shanghai Composite Index was down 2.9 percent. The tech-heavy ChiNext board fell 3.08 percent.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (09-10-2018)]
Residents plead: Open the drain before heavy rains
The residents who are also taxpayers to the Ja-Ela Urban Council and whose elected Member represent them as the Member for the Ward No 1, Thudella, want authorities concerned to take steps to reopen the drain or waterway, before the next heavy rain, which is around the corner.
The residents who were seriously affected by heavy rains in the early months of this year, opined that the waterway or the drain in question, goes through the Gama Meda Paara and St. Annes Mawatha, crossing the Vijaya avenue, has been there for decades, letting the rainwater pass through without causing damage to lives and property and houses to remain safe, when heavy rains occur.
When the UPFA was in power, the former Social Service Minister Felix Perera, the Gampaha District Member who represented Ja-Ela in Parliament, issued a letter dated December 17, 2010, addressed to the then Ja-Ela UC Chairman requesting him to take appropriate action to keep the drain open as it was in the past. But the UC authorities seem to have ignored the Ministers request and as a result, the situation has turned worst eight years after the said letter was issued due to the inaction of the authorities concerned.
The files relevant to the issue maintained by the JUC shows that the UC had issued a warning letter in the year 1991 to some of the residents of the area, whom the UC suspected culpable, for getting involved in this unwarranted action of closing the drain. The report states that the drain in question had been closed permanently, since November 2010, with gravel.
Responding to the constant reminders and representations made by the taxpayers, the pleading-public, it is on record that the authorities had conducted street surveys from January 1 to February 21, 2011, and had verified that there had been a natural drain/ or passage to let rainwater pass through without causing damage to houses or properties of the residents of the locality of Thudella.
At the UC meeting held on July 27, 2012, the Members present unanimously passed a proposal made by the then Chairman of the UC, to resolve the pestering problem, and on September 25, the same year via a letter, to the Ja-Ela Police, sought the police protection, when authorities take action to reopen the drain, on October 4 of the said year. But this never took place and high hopes of the taxpayers were dashed to the ground.
There was no people representation to the Ja-Ela Urban Council for some years.
The residents of the area heavily affected by floods for almost five long decades, met the present authorities, pleading for help. They had met the present leaders of the Urban Council, jointly run by the Podujana Peramuna and the UNP, and once more had put forward the same complaint. In addition to that, they also had made representation to the Ja-Ela Provincial Secretary, seeking his assistance as well, for immediate relief.
The authorities running the affairs of the Ja-Ela Urban Council at present and the Ja-Ela Provincial Secretary had promised to reopen the said drain, closed by unauthorized persons, before heavy rainfall. The signs of heavy rains are now visible and the residents fear that they would be affected severely once more, with heavy rain, as the drain still remains closed.
The authorities have promised to take appropriate action to open the drain and let the rainwater flow down without the families in the area having to suffer from flooding, as they did for decades.
The files maintained at the Urban Council also indicate that on a number of times in the past, the UC has informed the Department of Local Government (Western Province), that steps would be taken to resolve the pressing problem.

CMC pays Rs. 100 mn, SLLRDC to resume garbage collection
Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) made an advance payment of Rs. 100 million to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) yesterday in order for the latter to resume garbage collection in the CMC area.
Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake vehemently condemned the conduct of the SLLRDC on this matter and added that there was no outstanding payment to be made.
SLLRDC is extorting payment for garbage management, she said. SLLRDC informed on Sunday (7) that they would temporarily quit collecting garbage in the CMC area from yesterday (8) as the CMC had failed to make an outstanding payment of Rs. 207 million to them for garbage management.
Senanayake said that the CMC was not aware how the figure mentioned by SLLRDC was computed.
We asked the SLLRDC for a months time to figure this out because the letter they sent does not have any details of the outstanding payment that needs to be made, she said.
Senanayake further mentioned that she did not like the conduct of the SLLRDC on this matter and added that the decision to make an advance payment was decided unanimously by CMC officials and council members considering the inconvenience the public might have to face as a result.
Since September 28, official letters have been shared between the SLLRDC and the CMC, but the SLLRDC never called us for a meeting to discuss these issues. They suddenly pointed to an outstanding sum and informed us that they are going to quit collecting garbage, she said.
Responding to a statement made by SLLRDC Chairman Roshan Gunawardena that the SLLRDC never increased the charges, that resources used were owned by SLLRDC and that the SLLRDC was managing the garbage collection since 2017, the Mayor refuted the claims and said that SLLRDC has been handling the garbage collection only from March 2018 and emphasised that it was the CMC that managed the garbage collection from 2017 to March 2018.
She pointed out that there is no outstanding payment to the SLLRDC as per CMC records.
Senanayake further said that in every letter they wrote to the SLLRDC, they clearly mentioned that if there was any dispute regarding these payments, to kindly give the CMC time until the end of October to sort out the issues.
CMC took all efforts and settled all the payments once the invoices were received. We are yet to receive the invoice for August 2018, she said.
Referring to the letters sent to the SLLRDC Chairman, Senanayake said that it was agreed that the payments will be made at the rate of Rs. 3,000 per MT for sorted biodegradable and perishable waste.
Senanayake asked why the SLLRDC was not taking any payment from the Kaduwela, Ja-Ela and Wattala Municipal Councils for garbage collection.
Why are they demanding money only from the CMC she questioned.
She further said that the central government should find a long-term and sustainable solution to the garbage issue and added that she planned to have a discussion with the President and Prime Minister on this matter soon.

Colette Lust for life
Keira Knightley has dished out some performances in a number of period films such as the Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana Cavendish in The Duchess and as Anna Arkadyevna Karenina in Anna Karenina. So taking on the role of celebrated French author is familiar grounds to her.
A pioneer in womens rights, an author who was nominated for the Nobel prize in literature six years before her death in 1954 Colette set a benchmark in history that many women find difficult to match. Taking on the role of the young wife to a much older Henry Gauthier-Villars brought Colette to Paris in the 1870s. This was the background in which she published her highly popular of Claudine novels, published under Henrys nom-de-plume, Willy. As Colettes work gains fame her husband locks her in a room and orders her to produce more content. However Colette is fiery spirited and would not lay low as the silent victim. Her character grows throughout the film and Knightley is able to put her acting talents into practice by portraying this growth in a convincing manner. Colettes fight over creative ownership and gender roles drives her to overcome societal constraints, revolutionizing literature, fashion and sexual expression.
Though the film cannot quite be put in the Oscar category Colette is still makes an admirable work of art. The haunting settings and seedy characters set the tone of what is to follow.
Colettes plight is evident as the setting shows how the society perceives women. However neither we nor the rest of the public are ready for the manner in which she rebels against her intended destiny.
The chemistry is palpable between Knightley and West, whether they are in love or estranged. Knightley gives one of her best performances as a girl with spirit and talent who becomes a woman with ferocity and a voice.
Kudos to Director Wash Westmoreland who refrains from keeping the material from becoming melodramatic or overwrought.

Colourful flower petal bee nests
With the news of a global decline in bee populations, many people are working to help save the precious pollinators from extinction. But its not just humans that are making an effortone particular type of bee has its own special way of protecting its rare species. Known as Osmia avosetta, these typically solitary bees cant rely on the support of other worker bees to safeguard their young. Instead, the female insects have taken it upon themselves to craft colorful bees nests from flower petals.
With nest sites discovered in both Antalya, Turkey and Sepidan, Iran, the Curator of Invertebrate Zoology at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) Dr. Jerome Rozen conducted extensive research on the phenomenon. He describes the colorful cocoons: [The] cells are unusual in that they are lined by two layers of colorful flower petals that sandwich a thin middle layer of mud. He reveals Its not common for bees to use parts of plants for neststheres a demand for biologists to know bees nowadaysthey are the foremost animal pollinators of plants, and tremendously important for maintaining ecosystemsnot only crops but also for conservation.
Both practical and beautiful, the mother bee first sources the perfect petals and brings them back to her nest site. She then digs a 1.5 cm-deep burrow and lays down multiple layers of overlapping petals and mud. After filling the nest with nutritious pollen and nectar, she then lays her precious egg on top. Finally, she seals the cell by folding the scale-like petals inwards and plugging the hole with mud. While the exterior drys like a hard shell, the interior stays humid, allowing a cozy environment for the larvae to grow and mature as they wait out the winter. The process is proof that no matter the species, a mothers love is unconditional!

Compensation to displaced by Yan Oya project
When the Yan Oya reservoir project commenced, there was no proper plan in place. The selection of stakeholders was decided hastily and the enthusiasm, shown at the beginning of the project, dwindled later on, Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
This caused delays in paying compensation to evacuated families, resettlement, providing alternative land for livelihoods etc., the minister said.
He was addressing the gathering following the laying of the foundation stone to set up the Kadjuwatta Seva Piyasa building to accommodate Grama Niladari, Samurdhi Niladari, Development Officer and the Agriculture Research and Production Assistant in Kadjuwatta new resettlement village, built under the Yan Oya reservoir project. The building costs Rs. 4 million.
The minister said under the short-sighted planning of the previous government, families who lost housing and property under the project were not counted when providing compensation and other relief.
Earlier, Cabinet approval was sought to pay compensation only for permanent families and this is not at all justifiable. He said to correct this lapse, a new Cabinet paper was submitted to obtain approval for compensation to be paid to 100 families.
Referring to discrepancies in the manner of paying compensation, Minister Dissanayake said those who should be given priority must be reconsidered.
He said, however, already a batch of 120 families have been paid compensation worth Rs. 125 million.
He said he would accelerate the payment of compensation for lost property to those who were deprived of it.
There are new settlement villages emerging under the Yan Oya reservoir project which is to be commissioned soon. Each new village would be equipped with a Seva Piyasa community centre, pre-school, school, water supply scheme, sanitation, access roads, and a protective electric fence to thwart wild elephants from invading new settlements. The minister said the construction work of the right bank main canal is reaching its final stage and the 22km-long left bank canal construction, entrusted to the Chinese CAMSE Engineering Company would be completed within six months, allowing Yan Oya farmers to obtain the full benefits of the reservoir project. They would obtain irrigation water to nearly 50,000 acres paddy lands in both the Yala and Maha seasons.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 05:
To create a successful business, find one that fulfils market need
Starting, owning, and running a successful small business is one of the great joys in life. There are no guarantees. But, if your business is - one suited to your strengths, one that you are passionate about, one which fulfils a specific market need, and (of course) one that allows you to make a nice profit - then there is no telling how far it can take you.
In the past four instalments, we tested your strengths and talents, your aptitudesand abilities and prepared you to face reality. Now, we are ready to begin the challenging entrepreneurial journey. Come aboard!
In this series, you will find tips, examples, and strategies that have been proven to help small businesses grow and that can help your small business also grow.
Love with the idea
When it comes to choosing a small business, there are two types of entrepreneurs.
The first is the person who is in love with the idea of starting a very specific business. This person may be a gardener who envisions opening a nursery or a chef who has long dreamed of owning a restaurant. The other potential small business person is someone who is also in love, not with a specific business but with the idea of being his or her own boss. As there are risks and rewards associated with each path, both warrant further discussion.
In life, we tend to succeed and perform well when we are engaged in something that we really enjoy. Your business should be no different.By now, you know what excites you, what it is that you love most. You know what you like to do, what your passions are, what is fun for you, and how you like to spend your time.
That is your first assignment: deciding which of your passions you love enough to start a business around. Remember, your business will become your baby, and like any baby, it will require a lot of love, time, money, and attention if it is to grow strong and healthy. Of those resources, right now, you should be most concerned with time. Your new business will take a lot of time, so pick something that you love doing because you will be spending a lot of time doing it.
What are your choices You could, for instance: Start a nursery. Open a flower shop. Start a garden care business. Grow organic vegetables. Buy a small farm. Start a bakery.
This is the time for one of those anything goes brainstorming sessions. Go for it. Write down any kooky idea that you have. No limits! There are few times in life when the stars align themselves just so and we have a chance, not only for a fresh start, but for a fresh start that is completely of our own choosing. Usually, money is tight, the opportunity passes, or something else conspires to interfere with a brand-new beginning.
Assuming, then, that you have decided to pick a business that is a passionate practicality, the last question to be answered is whether you will be able to make sufficient profit from it. There is no sense in starting a business, however much you might love the idea, if you will not be able to make a good living. One reason we go into business for ourselves is the chance to make more money.
Finding a good idea is just the beginning - in fact, it is the easy part. The trick is being able to successfully implement that idea. That is much more difficult. As Thomas Edison said, genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration. That is as true in business as it is in science. Not only must you come up with a good idea, it must be a good idea that you can move on. That is what you are looking for.
Maybe your idea is so cutting-edge that no one else has thought of it. Innovative businesses have the chance to become market leaders. Being first gives you something called the first movers advantage. Simply put, by being first, you have the chance to shape the marketplace. The potential profit from such a business is enormous. The problem, as you may have surmised, is that it usually takes a lot of money to successfully create such a business. If you do not have the drive to do so, or the risk tolerance, or the capital, then you would be best advised to follow and not to lead.
In love with entrepreneurship
Now we come to the second sort of entrepreneur - the individual who is more concerned with being his or her own boss than with starting a particular business. Jeff Bezos did not start Amazon.com because he was in love with books. He started it because he discovered that Internet use in the early 1990s was growing at a whopping 2,300 percent per year.
Armed with that valuable insight, he analysed the marketplace and the opportunity and concluded that the best way to tap the commercial power of the Internet was through book sales. Because it was not about the books but rather the opportunity, Bezos is the prototypical second category of entrepreneur.
There is no shortage of people who start their own business because, simply put, they want to be their own boss; that is as great a reason as any. The ability to make your own decisions, the chance to rise or fall by your own ingenuity and hard work, the opportunity to make more money, and the freedom that comes with being a small business person are some of the great joys in life. It is no wonder that many people long to start their own business. When done right, it is successful.
The question is, what is the best sort of business for you to start If you want to create a great business, a successful business, then here is a critical tip: find a business that fulfils a market need. Thatstatement should become your mantra. The best businesses find an unfulfilled need - a niche - and fill it. Do that, and almost everything else will fall into place.
If you are looking for a business to start, the number one thing to discover is whether that business can sell something that people need. Figure what pain or need the customer has that you can solve.
Six steps
Here are six steps to take to come to the correct decision and find that great business idea.
1. Research and research
After research then do some more research. Your first step is to analyse both the marketplace and the opportunities that are available. Look around, find some businesses that are doing something that looks good to you, and learn about those businesses. How hard are they to create How much money do they make How much money would you need to start the business The options are many, and there is no shortage of associations and websites that are ready to help you find the right business to start.
2. Product or service
When it comes down to it, your business will provide people with a product or a service. Service businesses tend to be less expensive to start, as there is no inventory to buy or products to stock. Whereas product businesses mark up prices on scores of products and profit from the difference, service businesses, such aslawyers, doctors, consultants, gardeners sell time and expertise. An initial decision, then, is which of these businesses best suits your temperament, skills, and goals.
3. Analyze your skills and experience
Suppose you have spent your career doing marketing for major comapny. That is an invaluable skill, and it should be tapped when deciding what business is right for you. Even if it is not a marketing business, you would be foolhardy not to choose a business that does not somehow tap into your well of knowledge and skill. Now, it may be that you are tired of doing whatever it is you have been doing, and that, in fact, is why you want to start your own business. Understandable, for sure. Just be open to the option of finding a business that gives you a leg up on the competition because of your background.
4. Consider your options.
You could create a business from scratch. You could buy an existing business. You could start a franchise. You could create a home-based business. The possibilities are many. It is important to realize that there are, in fact, a variety of options when choosing a business and learning about the pros and cons of each. We will be talking about them in later instalments. But research the industry, and speak with people in those sorts of businesses.
5. Narrow your choices
Once you have analysed the market, the opportunities available, your skills and experience, and your goals, you should be able to narrow your choice down to a few types of businesses. The next step may be the most important one. You must go out and find people who own and run these sorts of businesses. Theories and books are great, but nothing beats speaking with someone who lives that business every day.
6. Start your engines
Whether you want to start a business because you want to start a business or because you want to spend your time pursuing your passion, it is important to do your homework and to find a niche that fills a market need. Do that, and you are on your way.

Cricket great Hayden fractures spine in surf accident
SYDNEY: Test great Matthew Hayden said Monday he had dodged a bullet after suffering head and neck injuries, including a spine fracture, while surfing during a holiday in Queensland.
Hayden, a top-order batsman who was last year inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, fractured his spine near the base of his neck, tore several ligaments and hurt his forehead after being dumped into a sandbank while surfing with his son Josh off North Stradbroke Island on Friday.
Fractured C6, torn C5, C4 ligaments safe to say I truly have dodged a bullet, Hayden wrote in an Instagram post beside a photo of his battered face.
Thank you everyone. On the road to recovery. The 46-year-old, who retired from international cricket in 2009 after a 103-Test career, told Brisbane's Courier Mail he was bloody lucky to escape serious injury.
It was an hour into the session and we had had half dozen waves together and I got this one right handed wave which I sort of ducked under and that is pretty much all I can remember, he told the newspaper Monday.
I wasn't knocked out. I was speared into the top of the sandbank onto the top of my head. Then it twisted my head with my own weight and the weight of the wave. AFP

Crocodile caught in garden
A 9 feet-long swamp crocodile which crept into a home garden in Hidogama following heavy rains which lashed the area on October 7 night was caught and tied by the residents of the housing.
This was following an alarm raised by their pet dog with its barking. As the residents awaited the arrival of wildlife officials from Anuradhapura to remove the reptile and release it to a water body, curious crowds flocked around to have a glimpse of the rare visitor.

Designing new horizons
House of Fashion has risen again. It is back! House of Fashion has been created in the image of what owners Preethi Jayawardena and Neela Jayawardena think fashion is. It has been made in the image of what these two owners want fashion to be. They cater to all forms of masculinity and what it means to be a woman in all forms. In addition to all of this they also cater to children. There was a time when House of Fashion Duplication road ceased to be. But there was a clamor for its return. And now it is back bigger and better!
Preethi and Neela Jayawardena are always concerned about this friendship they have their clients and their clients are their top priority. The clients comes first in their minds. They are extremely sensitive to the desires of their clients.
House of Fashion the trendy clothing store re-opened its branch at the original location in Bambalapitiya on September 29. The fashion store now opened for business at their store in No. 28, R. A. De Mel Mawatha (Duplication Road) is equipped with the latest trends in fashion in the world. The store is one of the largest such fashion stores to be operated in South Asia as a sole proprietorship, and is unchallenged leading clothing store in Sri Lanka.
At the opening there was a large number of customers and well-wishers and one had to push his or her way through the throng to see the opening of this fashion store.
Daily News spoke to Chief Operation Manager, Prabath Kulatunga, called House of Fashion the Home of Fashion!
The Opening of House of Fashion was a humble request of our Sri Lankan customers. We also have a branch in Borella of considerable size which is bigger than the Duplication road branch. House of Fashion is always sensitive to how its clientele thinks and want. There has been a huge push by our clientele to re-open this branch. One reason why there are now VIPs is because the customers are our VIP! We want them at this opening because of the fond memories they have of us, said Kulatunga
The first House of Fashion outlet was opened in Wellawatte around 27 years ago. And they have come a long way since those times when they operated in a location small in size.
But because of our desire, dedication and discipline and our passion to serve our customers House of Fashion started to grow in size and popularity. As you can see from the crowd gathered here with or without advertising people, they have not forgotten us. After Wellawatte, House of Fashion moved to the Duplication road premises. We offer quality at reasonable prices, said Kulatunga.
The vision of HOF is to give quality service to the customers.
This branch was closed four and half years ago and now has been reopened because of popular request. Now in this reopened branch there are new variations. There is a lot of innovative and fashionable items.
There are different choices which will create more customer satisfaction. Earlier House of Fashion Duplication road was closed because we wanted to go to a better place. And that as Borella. Borella is running smoothly very well. But the customers implored us to reopen duplication road. We cannot ignore our customers.
Our clientele is local and foreign. The House of Fashion brand is known internationally. We are now going the extra mile, explained Kulatunga.

Dogs are much stupider than we thought
Dogs are loyal, loving creatures  but theyre also dumb as a bag of rocks, scientists have said.
Dogs arent (despite what their loving owners might believe) exceptionally clever compared to other animals, researchers found.
Many of the unique skills of dogs, such as following human pointing, are in fact matched by other species.
Researchers from the University of Exeter and Canterbury Christ Church University reviewed more than 300 papers on animal brain power.
The studies compared the cognitive abilities of dogs with other domestic animals, social hunters and carnivorans such as wolves, bears, lions and hyenas.
Professor Stephen Lea, of the University of Exeter, said the research identified several cases of over interpretation in favour of the abilities of dogs in studies.
During our work it seemed to us that many studies in dog cognition research set out to prove how clever dogs are, Prof Lea said.
They are often compared to chimpanzees and whenever dogs win, this gets added to their reputation as something exceptional. Yet in each and every case we found other valid comparison species that do at least as well as dogs do in those tasks. The review focused on sensory cognition, physical cognition, spatial cognition, social cognition and self-awareness.
Dr Britta Osthaus, of Canterbury Christ Church University, said dog cognition does not look exceptional when compared with other domestic animals, social hunters and carnivorans.
We are doing dogs no favour by expecting too much of them. Dogs are dogs, and we need to take their needs and true abilities into account when considering how we treat them, Dr Osthaus said.
So which animals are actually clever
Goats, pigs, dolphins, seals and sea lions do at least as well as dogs at following human pointing.
Pigs are equally able to identify humans by smell, while sheep, pigeons and chimpanzees can identify humans by their faces. Cats do at least as well as dogs at identifying humans by their voices.
Donkeys, mules and horses are as able to find their way around barriers as dogs, while wolves, raccoons and hyenas can pull a string to release food. Dolphins, chimps, giant pandas, American badgers, two species of bear and sea otters can use tools at least as well as dogs.
Unlike dogs, animals including pigs, pigeons and chimpanzees have the ability to remember the what, where and when of an event.
The research is published in the journal Learning & Behavior.

Edible illustrations inside bread
Imagine cutting through a loaf of bread from @konel_bread and being pleasantly surprised by a work of art in each slice.
Its hard to imagine how much planning ahead goes into each of the Japanese bakers creations.
She posts pictures and videos of her loaves on Instagram, and explains in the captions that she took a page of inspiration from sushi roll art.
She bakes at home, and gets her son to help out filming for some of her posts. Bread art like this is typically made with separate rolls of coloured dough. The dough is arranged in long tubes that will eventually puff up into larger shapes as the bread bakes, so the baker needs to plan ahead for the way the dough expands.
Her designs stretch from leopard print patterns, to lemon slices  with pinches to make it look more lemon-like  to cute cartoon characters like Snoopy and Charlie Brown, Keroppi, Totoro and Miffy.

Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad are now known as 2018s Nobel Laureates for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict. Plus, George Smith, Frances Arnold and Greg Winter have been announced as the winners of Nobel Prize in Chemistry. These laureates are now the subject of wide discussion across the globe.
But then thats not what triggers curiosity. No literary stalwart has been announced as the Nobel Laureate for 2018. The curiosity comes to the fore with the admission of the much revered Swedish Academy that unacceptable behaviour in the form of unwanted intimacy had occurred in its ranks, but its handling of unseemly allegations has shredded the bodys credibility, called into question its judgment and forced its first female leader to resign. If the sexual violence has earned Mukwege and Murad the Nobel Prize, the same phenomenon has postponed the announcement of a literary laureate for 2018.
The internal feud stems from a sex-abuse scandal allegedly linked with Claude Arnault a cultural stalwart in Sweden. The troubling factor is that he is married to Poet Katarina Frostenson, a member of the Academy. Arnault could be deemed as the miniature Trump as 18 complaints of sexual misconduct have been received against him. Arnault has, of course, denied connection with any such complaint.
The Nobel Foundation itself says the Nobel Prize in literature risks losing its dignity from the scandals. According to Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for literature is generally based on an overall assessment. Its a lifes work that is rewarded more than individual books. Novelists have received the most prizes. The reason may be that it is the most practised literary genre, Englund adds.
According to King Carl XVI Gustaf, the ceremonial patron of the academy, the members are compelled to resign though they have no technical grounds allowed. About 12 people are required to vote in a new member. If the academy chose to go ahead and pick a winner for 2018, it would have formed a blotch on the escutcheon.
This is not the first instance that the Nobel Prize has faced controversy. The prestigious prize allocated for other fields such as science and medicine and peacemaking in addition to literature have been withheld 49 times. The prize was not given during the World War II period (1940  1942) that followed 1914, 1918 and 1935. The years 1914, 1918 and 1943 witnessed the prize awarded to the fields of science and medicine. 1935 also saw no suitable candidate worthy of the award in literature.
Of the last 10 winners, just Mo Yan and Svetlana Alexievich live outside North America or Western Europe. The 2010 laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, is Peruvian but has resided in Spain, primarily, for more than two decades. The only Arab writer to take the prize was Egypts Naguib Mahfouz in 1988. Of the three African Nobel recipients, two, Nadine Gordimer and J.M. Coetzee, were white.
In 2008, when Horace Engdahl, the then-permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, declared that you cant get away from the fact that Europe still is the centre of the literary world.
All the same, no Nobel in literature in 2018 It could come as an insult to the literati and the readership alike.

Literature Nobel Prizes that caused a stir
2017: The Prize goes to a songwriter.
Bob Dylan became the first singer-songwriter to obtain the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, shocking quite a few literature purists. Then Dylan didnt even seem that interested by the recognition. He didnt show up at the awards ceremony and simply sent a brief thank-you speech instead of the traditional Nobel lecture. He finally collected his prize in Stockholm in March 2017.
2004: Too many people for Elfriede Jelinek
When she was honoured with the prize in 2004, Austrian author Elfriede Jelinek also refused to go to the awards ceremony. I cannot manage being in a crowd of people. I cannot stand public attention, the reclusive playwright said. The Swedish Academy had to accept her agoraphobia, but she did, at least, hold her Nobel lecture  per video.
1997: Not literature: Dario Fo
When Italian comedian and playwright Dario Fo won the prize in 1997, the announcement came as a shock to many literary critics, who saw him as just an entertainer and not a real literary figure with an international standing. The satirist fired back with his Nobel speech, which he titled Against jesters who defame and insult.
1989: Resignations in support of Salman Rushdie
While the famous author of The Satanic Verses never won the Nobel Prize in Literature, some members of the Swedish Academy felt their organization should denounce Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeinis fatwa calling for Salman Rushdies assassination in 1989. The Academy refused to do so, and three members resigned in protest.
1964: Did Jean-Paul Sartre want the money
The French philosopher and playwright was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, but he declined it, saying that a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution by accepting official honours. It was rumoured that he later asked for the prize money anyway  but that story was never confirmed.
1958: Boris Pasternak couldnt accept the prize
The Soviet author, world famous for his novel Doctor Zhivago, obtained Nobel recognition in 1958. However, Soviet authorities forced him to decline the prize; he wouldnt be able to re-enter the country if he went to the Stockholm ceremony. Even though he followed his governments orders, he was still demonized afterwards. His son picked up the award in 1989, 29 years after the authors death.
1945: Literature, not Peace: Winston Churchill
Although British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945, he actually obtained the award for his written works  mostly memoirs, history volumes and speeches  in 1953. The jury praised his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values.
1929: A late tribute to Thomas Mann
Thomas Mann received the prize in 1929, but it wasnt for his most recent work, The Magic Mountain (1924), which the jury found too tedious. The distinction instead recognized his debut novel, Buddenbrooks  published 28 years earlier. Time had apparently added to its value. The jury said, it has won steadily increased recognition as one of the classic works of contemporary literature.
1907: Rudyard Kipling, the youngest winner
Winning the award in 1907 at the age of 41, British author Joseph Rudyard Kipling, best known for The Jungle Book (1894), remains the youngest Nobel laureate in literature to this day. However, his legacy has since been marred by the fact that Kipling, who spent his early childhood and some of his adult life in India, vehemently spoke out in defence of British colonialism.

Farah wins at Chicago in third marathon start
Chicago, Sunday: Britains Mo Farah won the Chicago Marathon with a spectacular finishing surge Sunday, shattering the European record to serve notice his distance-racing dominance is far from over.
In only his third marathon start, Farah won in 2hr 5min 11sec under cool and rainy conditions to defeat Ethiopias Mosinet Geremew by 13sec with Japans Suguru Osako third in 2:05:50.
It was amazing to cross the line first, said Farah, who pumped his fists and blew kisses to the crowd as he neared the finish line.
The 2012 and 2016 Olympic and three-time world 5,000 and 10,000-meter champion, who switched to the marathon distance a year ago, became the first British man to win at Chicago since Paul Evans in 1996. Farah smashed the former European mark of 2:05:48 set by Norwegian Sondre Nordstad Moen in Fukuoka last December and easily improved on his former British record and personal best of 2:06:22 from a third-place showing at London in April.
Farahs marathon debut was an eighth-place showing at London in 2014, his only prior competitive test at the distance until six month ago.
In slick and windy weather that was far from ideal, novice marathoner Farah averaged 4:46 miles and delivered the eighth-best time in Chicago Marathon history.
The conditions werent great and everyone was thinking about conditions rather than time, Farah said.
But toward the end we picked it up. I felt good toward the end of the race. At the beginning I felt a bit sluggish but overall Im very happy.
The 35-year-old Somalia-born Briton stayed with the lead pack most of the race, fell back at 30 kilometers but charged directly back among the leaders then outlasted every rival to the finish, dispatching Geremew with a strong closing kick.
Kenyas Brigid Kosgei won the womens title in 2:18:35, also a personal best. Ethiopias Roza Dereje was second in 2:21:18 with compatriot Shure Demise third in 2:22:15.
Each champion took a top prize of $100,000.
In the first major marathon since Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge smashed the world record in Berlin last month in 2:01:39, Farah stole the show in what was billed as a battle with his former training partner, 2017 Chicago winner Galen Rupp of the United States.
Farah and Rupp weathered the wet and windy conditions that greeted 45,000 runners, hanging in a pack behind the pacesetters that battled early headwinds.
Rupp and Farah, who once trained together in Oregon under Alberto Salazar, stayed together until the American slowed at 35km and slipped from the lead pace.
Geoffrey Kirui, who won the 2017 Boston Marathon and World Marathon Championships crowns, faded before 40km to set up the final duel.
Rupp, who still trains with Salazar, finished fifth, 70 seconds off Farahs time and 24 seconds adrift of fourth place Kenneth Kipkemoi of Kenya. AFP

Get ready to experience Country Swing at its finest when the incomparable fiddler Harald Yendis takes the stage at this year's 30th anniversary Country Roads concert for children, to be held on October 20, from 6.30 pm.
Sure to wow the audience with his fiddle solos and as part of the already raucous Mavericks ensemble, Harald Yendis is without doubt a spectacle to behold, as well as being an exciting addition to the concert's 2018 line-up.
This year's show is headlined by the Mavericks from Germany and UK's Astrid Brook while featuring hometown heroes Anno Domini, Country Revival Band with Feizal and Jury, and Cosmic Rays, adding a local flavor.
We are excited by the presence of a fiddle player in the Mavericks band. Harald is also said to be a top quality fiddle player and guitarist in Germany, said FeizalSamath, the President of the Country Music Foundation, the organizer of this long-running concert series.
An entirely charitable undertaking, staffed fully by volunteers, the Country Roads concert series or children always has, and continues to, donate 100% of its proceeds to childrens charities in Sri Lanka.
Over the past 30 years, this has resulted in several million rupees in funding, all of which has directly aided only the most pressing causes that help children, a common practice since the concerts first performers took the stage in 1988. In fact, in 2017 alone, donations amounting to Rs. 1.27 million were contributed to eight child-related charitable causes.

Four-star Mbappe helps PSG break 82-year-old record
Paris, Sunday: Kylian Mbappe tore Lyon to shreds on Sunday with four goals as a 5-0 thrashing at the Parc des Princes saw Paris Saint-Germain set a new French top-flight record of nine straight wins to start a season.
Thomas Tuchels Ligue 1 leaders broke the 82-year-old record of eight consecutive wins set by Olympique Lillois in 1936, having equalled the mark with their 3-0 victory at Nice last weekend.
Fantastic, incredible. It was super hard in the first half, it was a crazy match, PSG coach Tuchel told Canal+.
A Neymar penalty gave PSG a ninth-minute advantage, but Presnel Kimpembe was sent off just after the half-hour mark to give Lyon hope.
Bruno Genesios side threw away their man advantage, though, as Lucas Tousart was dismissed, and after missing a string of chances, the sensational Mbappe capped an virtuoso display by scoring four times in 13 minutes to seal history for PSG.
The capital-city giants, bidding for a sixth title in seven seasons, are already eight points clear of second-placed Lille at the top of the table, with Lyon five points further back in sixth.
Lyon endured the worst possible start to the match, as star man Nabil Fekir was forced off injured in the seventh minute, and the hosts were awarded a spot-kick just seconds later.
Mbappe raced to reach a loose ball, and visiting goalkeeper Anthony Lopes needlessly charged off his line to bring down the teenager.
Neymar stepped up and sent Lopes the wrong way with a stuttering run-up to score his 11th goal of the season.
Lyon responded well, though, with veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon having to shovel a Memphis Depay free-kick over the bar, before Di Maria was fortunate not to concede a penalty for handball.
The reigning champions thought they had got lucky again when Kimpembe was only shown a yellow card for a nasty tackle on Tanguy Ndombele, but with the young midfielder lying stricken on the ground, a video review resulted in the centre-backs punishment being upgraded to red.
But Lyon shot themselves in the foot on the stroke of half-time as Tousart tripped Mbappe inside the PSG half and was given a second yellow card.
OL should have equalised early in the second period, but Maxwel Cornet contrived to miskick with the goal at his mercy.
Cornet, who came on for Fekir, almost scored in bizarre circumstances shortly after, as a Silva clearance ricocheted off his back and bounced back off the base of the post.
Eight-minute hat-trick
Mbappe almost put PSG out of sight three times in the space of five minutes -- powering clear after Cornets unwitting effort and drilling against the far post, seeing Lopes dive at his feet as he ran through one-on-one, and shooting too close to the Lyon keeper.
But the World Cup-winners persistence finally paid off in the 61st minute as he latched onto the ball inside the area after Neymar had burst forward, turned his man and smashed the ball in off both posts.
Confidence was coursing through PSG, and the floodgates opened as centre-back Marquinhos drove into the box and squared for Mbappe to stab in his eighth goal of the campaign.
Neymar soon sent the 19-year-old bearing down on goal yet again, and Mbappe lofted the ball into the net to complete an incredible eight-minute hat-trick.
He was not done there, though, as he pounced to slam home his fourth with 16 minutes left after Neymar had seen a low shot blocked. AFP

The government plans to increase business, trade and investment with India with a new initiative that draws on the experience of companies who have succeeded in the tough, hard-to-enter Indian market.
As a first step the government has set up a committee called Break into India Strategy Committee comprising leaders of top Sri Lankan enterprises who have succeeded in the Indian market, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama said.
They are helping us to distill the key lessons learnt and formulate a strategy to help Sri Lankan firms export to, and invest in, India, he told a forum to launch A Glass Half Full: The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia report by World Bank yesterday. The World Bank report, suggested, Sri Lanka has the potential to more than double its exports to South Asia. Increased intraregional trade will provide a greater variety of goods and services at cheaper prices for Sri Lankan consumers, better access to inputs for producers and exporters, increased investment, export diversification and growth.
Talking on Sri Lankas initiatives to increase trade within the region, the Minister said, within South Asia we have to keep our eye on the big prize which is India. The Indian middle-class consumer market alone is forecast to soon be 10 times larger than Sri Lankas whole population  200 million.
Even if we tap into a small slice of that, it would be a game changer for our exporters.
We all know that the Indian market isnt easy. The Government is aware of what needs to change, and on top of that list is non-tariff measures. It is also on top of our list of things we are working on in the ongoing ETCA negotiations. Samarawickrama added the government is pushing strongly on this agenda and hoped to have some breakthroughs in the coming months. The government is also working with the Food Safety and Standard Authority India (FSSAI) to accredit Sri Lankan labs so that the food and beverage exports to India dont face difficulties like in the past. The Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Technical Barriers to Trade (SPS - TBT) established by the Ministry is now working on further measures like this.
Sri Lanka has to see itself as a collaborator alongside the other regional economies, rather than a competitor in the narrowest sense.

Govt to integrate SMEs into formal sector - Mangala
Sri Lanka plans to integrate Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) into the formal sector and also to establish hard and soft infrastructure frameworks to facilitate their growth, Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera said.
Measures are being taken to improve access to credit, access to markets, and encourage integration of value chains connecting SMEs and large firms, he said.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking on the theme Financing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise; Solutions for Missing Middle at the inaugural session of the Asia-Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association forum at the Hilton Colombo yesterday. The event hosted by Bank of Ceylon will conclude tomorrow.
The forum was attended by Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary General of Asia Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA), Members of the APRACA Executive Committee and delegates and representatives of APRACA member institutions.
Globally, SMEs represent a significant component of all enterprises. In Sri Lanka, the majority of companies are of the SME category and contributes the bulk of employment as well.
Every country in the world has identified the importance of SMEs in their economies as a practical instrument in achieving sustainable economic growth.
Nevertheless, they persistently face difficulties in setting-up and running businesses. In fact, in most surveys done around the world, access to finance is a striking obstacle faced by SMEs, and this is no different in Sri Lanka and the rest of our region, the Minister said.
Referring to Sri Lankan experience, the Minister said, We will encourage project-based lending rather than collateral based lending, rationalize upfront taxes that hinder expansion, and encourage knowledge sharing between R & D institutions and SMEs.
Towards this end, as part of Vision 2025 policy document, our government has identified the importance of the SME sector and initiated the Enterprise Sri Lanka scheme to address some of these obstacles and minimise the SME finance gap in Sri Lanka. Some of the issues targeted by this programme would be to make market interest rates more affordable by subsidising interest payments and addressing the pervasive issue of, lack of collateral.
Youth unemployment is addressed partly by enabling young graduates to start-up companies, through access to interest free loans.
There are several subsidised loans for the agricultural sector, at various points of the value chain, in an effort to improve productivity and value addition in that sector.
He added other targeted investments are - technology, funded through Enterprise Sri Lanka, which would enable SMEs to be more competitive in their industries.
Inclusivity is a priority in this programme. The scheme promotes inclusivity of, often disadvantaged groups of society. For example; preferential interest rates are given for enterprises headed by women and those who are differently-abled.
Furthermore, through specific incentives provided, Enterprise Sri Lanka promotes investments in good business practices.
Investments in solar power for SMEs signify a transfer to a reliable and sustainable source of power for SMEs. Concessionary loans are provided to invest in public transport to ease road congestion and reduce negative externalities.
Up to now, nearly 20,000 have applied to the participating banks for these loans since its inception and the government anticipates further growth in these figures. Through these schemes and associated multiplier effects, the government expects that one million new jobs will be added to the economy.
As much as access to finance is promoted through government programmes, I believe the government also should focus on encouraging responsible lending practices.
The proliferation of unethical lending in microfinance, in particular, led to a crisis situation in some parts of the country. To address this, the government of Sri Lanka has written-off micro-finance debts of more than 45,000 women that amounted to more than Rs. 1.25 billion. It is essential that steps are taken to prevent such irresponsible lending recurring in the future.
Towards this end, the government is drafting new measures for the microfinance sector, stipulating industry standards in protecting borrowers from exorbitant and unnecessary charges and other malpractices commonly seen in the industry, he said.

House you can place almost anywhere without a permit
If you enjoy living off the grid and are eager to embrace a minimalist lifestyle, a tiny house may be a perfect fit for you. For such a seemingly simple concept, however, there are a lot of things to consider when purchasing your own humble abode, including how much itll cost, how it will reach its final destination, and what permit it will require. Aiming to take the guesswork out of the process, DROP Structures has designed a prefab house that can be placed almost anywhere in North America for less than $25,000.
Called Mono, this little home is DROP Structures sleek and stylish signature model. While the $24,500 cabin boasts a beautiful aesthetic characterized by a long, linear floor plan and large, double-paned windows, its major selling point is its size. At just 106 square feet (including a 4-foot covered deck), it does not require a permit in most of North America. That means that this plug and play property can be placed in a myriad of locations without restriction.
Additionally, this tiny house is entirely pre-fabricated. DROP Structures will even deliver it to its new locationno matter where you choose. The Mono can go in a backyard as an exercise room, an office, a play room, or a guest room, the company says. It can go to the country for glamping, or act as extra space at a family cottage.
By default, each Mono is lit by LED pot lights and heated by an electric heat source. It also features a Baltic Birch interior finish, vinyl flooring, and a Douglas Fir deck, though alternative materials are available at additional charge. Similarly, the model can be upgraded with a bathroom, kitchen, loft, Murphy bed, cabinets, and blinds. The prefab possibilities are endless!

Kim, Pompeo agree to second summit
SOUTH KOREA: Kim Jong Un has agreed to hold a second summit with US President Donald Trump as soon as possible, Seoul said Sunday, after Washingtons top diplomat held productive talks on denuclearisation with the North Korean leader in Pyongyang.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Kim on Sunday morning for around two hours of talks followed by a lunch in the Norths capital, before flying to Seoul on a whirlwind diplomatic visit to the region.
Pompeo said he agreed with Chairman Kim to hold the second US-North Korea summit at the earliest date possible, South Koreas presidential office said in a statement, although no specific time or location has yet been agreed.
Pompeo and Kim also discussed denuclearisation steps that will be taken by North Korea and the issue of attendance by the US government, as well as corresponding measures to be taken by the United States, the statement said.
The visit was Pompeos fourth to North Korea.
Trump met Kim in Singapore in June for the first-ever summit between the two countries, resulting in what critics say was only a vague commitment by Kim towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
Kim expressed his gratitude to President Trump for making sincere effort to implement the Singapore agreement, according to a report on the Pompeo visit by North Koreas state news agency KCNA.
Kim Jong Un appreciated the positively developing situation on the Korean peninsula... (and) explained in detail the proposals for solving the denuclearization issue, KCNA said.
The North Korean leader also invited inspectors to visit the Punggye-ri nuclear test facility, which Pyongyang took apart in May, to confirm that it has been irreversibly dismantled, the State Department said.
Kim praised their nice meeting, telling Pompeo via an interpreter following the mornings talks that it was a very nice day that promises a good future... for both countries.
But since the Singapore summit, the road towards warmer ties has been bumpy.
Washington and Pyongyang have sparred over the exact terms of the vaguely-worded agreement in Singapore, with the US pushing to maintain sanctions and pressure against the North until its final, fully verified denuclearisation.
Last month, the Norths foreign minister told the United Nations there was no way his country would disarm first as long as tough US sanctions remain against his country.
After a previous visit to Pyongyang in July, Pompeo had said the two foes made progress on key issues -- but within hours of his departure the North condemned gangster-like demands from the US, raising questions over how much the two sides really saw eye to eye.
Another planned trip by Pompeo to Pyongyang was scrapped after what Trump said was insufficient progress towards implementing the terms of the Singapore declaration.
An official on Sundays latest visit to Pyongyang with Pompeo said the trip was better than the last time, but added: Its going to be a long haul. Following his arrival in Seoul from Pyongyang on Sunday, Pompeo said at a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in that he had a good productive conversation with Kim, in talks which represented another step forward.
The dovish Moon, who held three summits with Kim this year and also brokered the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, said Sunday the whole world was watching with keen interest the outcomes of Pompeos trip.
I hope your trip to North Korea and the upcoming second US-North Korea summit will provide a good opportunity for achieving irreversible, decisive progress in terms of denuclearisation and the peace process on the Korean peninsula.
Analysts say Washington may now consider new options as China, Russia and South Korea seek to relax sanctions.
North Korea took some steps towards denuclearisation and the US will face criticism from the international community if it continues to demand complete denuclearisation without any lifting of sanctions, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
We cant rule out the possibility that Washington... may move in the direction of partial easing of sanctions based on progress in denuclearisation, he said.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has given a hint of what a grand bargain between the two countries could look like.
In an interview with the Washington Post, she said the North could agree to dismantle Yongbyon, its signature nuclear site.
In exchange, the United States would declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War -- which concluded with an armistice rather than a peace treaty -- but North Korea would stop short of delivering an exhaustive list of its nuclear facilities, she said. After Seoul, Pompeo ends his trip Monday in China, North Koreas political and economic lifeline.
The Beijing stop could be tense as it comes days after Vice President Mike Pence delivered a blistering speech accusing China of military aggression, commercial theft, rising human rights violations and electoral intervention against Trump. - AFP

Li Na says Osaka needs desire to go further
HONG KONG: Chinese tennis great Li Na said US Open champion Naomi Osaka can go on and win multiple Grand Slam titles -- if she can find the inner desire to match her physical abilities.
Osaka has admitted feeling burdened by expectations after last months stunning victory in New York, saying she puts pressure on herself to do more, do better.
The 20-year-old world number six was also in tears after her bittersweet US Open win, which was marred by Serena Williams explosive row by the chair umpire.
I believe with her abilities and strength, she can win many (Grand Slam titles) -- that is if she really has the desire to be a champion, Li told AFP ahead of the Hong Kong Open.
Osaka, Asias second Grand Slam singles champion after Li, has pulled out of the Hong Kong tournament with a back injury.
Williams, 37, brought a halt to her season after the US Open final, where her latest attempt at a record-equalling 24th major title ended in acrimony. But Li, the former French Open and Australian Open winner who retired in 2014, cautioned that it was unwise to judge Williams, who is back on the circuit after becoming a mother last September.
Looking at the players from the sidelines, we might not really understand some of their psychological goings-on on the court, said Li.
Ive always thought she is a very strong player. There are very few players who can give birth and then immediately come back out, she added.
For me, its really hard to find a balance between family and the tennis court, but she very quickly got into the US Open final. Li is often credited with igniting tennis interest in Asia and especially in China, but she said the sport still had a long way to go. Tennis in Asia is still in its adolescence. We have just passed the infancy stage, so we can still go a lot further, said Li.

Nehwal said she did not have to break the news to her parents as they had sensed it already.
I didnt have to tell them. We used to be together most of the time and my parents also travelled with me, so they understood who I was close to.

The wedding, to be held on December 16, will be the latestafter a string of high-profile sports couples tied the knot.

Making it a better place
Recycling waste is one of the best ways to create a nourishing environment for your garden. As most areas in the isle experience long, dry weather climates, gardening activity is at the minimum. The ideal thing to do is to set up a composting unit that will be a long term asset to your garden.
This is also the answer to the issue of waste management which Sri Lanka is facing in recent times. Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo 8, is the first school in Sri Lanka to have zero solid waste in its premises. The school has launched the Zero Waste project in which they collect the waste from their garden like dried up leaves and flowers and kitchen waste from the hostel. They use 100 percent natural ingrediants to make compost which they use to nurture their school garden. The left over are sealed in packets of 1 kg and 2 kg and are sold for Rs 70 and Rs 140 each.
The Zero Waste project is the brainchild of the school Principal Pradeepa Samarasinghe. She developed the concept of making the school premises sans waste after the Meethotamulla garbage dump disaster occurred last year. Though the school has become a no polythene zone a few years back, they still had some waste to fill their bins for the Colombo Municipal Council to take away. Since the CMC refused to collect the garbage, they carried out a garbage audit and found that its green environment alone generated about 50 to 60 kilograms of solid waste daily, in the form of fallen leaves.
After many experiments and attempts they got in touch with Anuradha Wijayawardhana, an expert in the Takakura Method of Composting. His work has won him many accolades including the JICA.
A team of 10 students from grade 12 and 13 involved in the Bio System Technology stream handle the Zero Waste project today. They are guided by the teacher in charge Kanchana Weerakoon.
Speaking to Daily News TnC Chamodi Kaushalya of grade 13 said that the success of the project is due to a united effort.
This was a new experience for us too. Everyone does their bit to make this project a success. We enjoy being involved in it because it is for a good cause, she said.
Amasha Kushani too has been a part of Zero Waste from the start. She noted that the product is free of odour and leakage. Though the school chemical fertilizer in the garden earlier they are able to use their own home grown compost today.
Any school or individual can engage in this as it involves only a few simple techniques and equipments. The initial cost might be a bit high but the end product is well worth it, she said.

He had helped the OTSC in all the musical happenings for the past 12 years especially at the Royal Thomian Big Match in the OTSC tent with the band Wild Flowers. He was one of the instrumentalists who made the OTSC a family club. The way he starts an event taking off his hat and mentioning Mang Hithuway Mang Witharai Thattayek Kiyala Balang yanakota Methana Inne Thatta Sansthawak is unforgettable.

Nadal, Djokovic to play exhibition in Saudi Arabia
PARIS, Sunday - World number one Rafael Nadal on Sunday said he has agreed to play an exhibition match against fellow Grand Slam title winner Novak Djokovic in Saudi Arabia in December.
The match between the two stars will take place at Jeddah's King Abdullah Sports City on December 22.
Thanks for the invitation and looking forward to playing and visiting for the first time, Nadal said on Twitter.
Nadal, the reigning French Open champion, has 17 Grand Slam titles to his name.
Former world number one Djokovic, now at three in the rankings, won Wimbledon and the US Open this year to take his majors collection to 14.
Djokovic and Nadal have played 52 times in their careers with the Serb leading their head-to-head 27-25.
Saudi Arabia has hosted a series of international sports events in recent months.
The first women's professional squash tournament took place in January while last month saw Britain's Callum Smith knock out compatriot George Groves in a World Boxing Association super middleweight boxing bout in Jeddah.
The moves are seen as part of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's drive to open up the conservative kingdom after being named heir to the throne in June 2017.
But despite moves by the young prince to modernise the economy and society -- including lifting a ban on women driving -- the country has stepped up repression of religious, intellectual and feminist dissidents.

Navaratri festival begins today
The annual Navaratri festival will take place from October 9  19.
The word Navaratri means nine auspicious nights and celebrations are held in honour of the Hindu Goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati.
The nine nights symbolise the three avatars of the Devi in the forms of Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati. In other words, Malai Magal, Alai Magal and Kalai Magal. Malai Magal means Durga Ma (Mother Durga) who bestows courage and grants victory.
This festival begins between the end of September and beginning of October. The second three days are in honour of Sri Mahalakshmi: the Goddess of Wealth. The last three days are dedicated to Maha Saraswati: the Goddess of Education, Art and Music.
During the festival, nine varieties of grains are planted and most devotees fast. Idols of the three goddesses are kept at pooja sites called kolu vaithal. The 10th day of this festival is known as the Vijayadashami, on which an auspicious time is selected to teach children the alphabet. The Navaratri festival is mostly celebrated in India, Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
Devotees take part in religious rites and sing bhakthi geetha, as well as offer sweets, fruits and flowers to the goddesses.

No training conducted at Dubai apartment hired by SriLankan - Witness
SriLankan Airlines (SLA) had paid AED 76,366 (Approximately Rs.2.4 Million) for an apartment hired in Dubai in 2012 to conduct management training, but, no training had been conducted there, it was revealed yesterday.
The payment for this apartment had been made in advance for the entire period until July 2014 and therefore, the company was unable to recover the payment although the contractual agreement was terminated in October 2013, Head of Financial Management of SriLankan Airlines Yasantha Dissanayake said yesterday. He was testifying before the PCoI on Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering and Mihin Lanka.
Then SriLankan Airlines Chief Executive Officer Kapila Chandrasena via e-mail, in 2012 had informed the Sri Lankan Airlines Country Manager in Dubai Angelo Punchihewa to find a suitable place to accommodate management trainees that are to be sent to Dubai as the company does not expect to accommodate them at hotels. Accordingly, the above mentioned apartment had been hired by the company but, there is no documentary evidence to prove that management trainees had been sent to Dubai.
Dissanayake said that the relevant invoice to pay this amount had been sent in the name of Shehani Rodrigo, a female employee of the company in Dubai, but not in the name of the company.
He said when he inquired from the CEO regarding this apartment and the payment made, the CEO had said that then SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickremesinghe wanted this apartment hired.
However, considering the uselessness of the apartment, Country Manager Punchihewa in October 2013 had informed the CEO via e-mail that the contractual agreement should be terminated as it was to expire in July the following year. Based on this reminder, the contract had been terminated by the company, but, no payment was recovered as they had been paid in advance, Dissanayake added.
The Commission also inquired into the additional payments made to Shehani Rodrigo, who was a Sales Support Officer at SriLankan Airlines Dubai Office.
Rodrigo was appointed to her position on July 1, 2012 for a period of one year. She was approved a posting allowance of Rs. 1.3 Million, housing allowance of Rs. 1.3 Million, and a transport allowance of Rs.539,000.
But, it was revealed yesterday that, she had been paid an additional allowance of Rs.826, 509 for the entire period, which was not approved for her appointment.
However, according to the Manager of HR Operations and Administration of SriLankan Airlines Lasantha Liyanage, such a payment cannot be made without the knowledge of the HR Department of the company.But, no document was provided to the HR department in this regard. These all are actual losses to the company,he added.
Shehani Rodrigo resigned from her post on July 31, 2013 but, until then no steps were taken to recover this additional payment, Dissanayake said.

Open warrant on former Irrigation Min. Sec. in alleged fraud case
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Irrigation Ministry Secretary Ivan de Silva over a Rs.4012 million financial fraud alleged to have taken place in the Gin-Nilwala Diversion Project.
The Magistrate also instructed that the warrant be issued in English to Interpol and for a copy of it to be sent to the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration as well.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order pursuant to a request made by the FCID who requested that the open warrant be reissued since there was no responses from Interpol to the previous warrant.
The FCID has informed the Courts that the suspect has evaded the investigations and he is now reported to be living in New Zealand.
His banking records have shown that Rs.7,822,000.00 of this money has being circulated through 11 cheques. It has also been revealed that Rs.2,220,000.00 from this money has been encased and allegedly deposited in the suspects sisters husbands account some time back.

## Title: Oversupply in the vegetable market
## Supertitle:

Oversupply in the vegetable market
Vegetables and fruits were reported to be in oversupply at the Dambulla Market. Farmers who brought their produce from long distances failed to find buyers. It was said that 50 tonnes of the produce were thrown to elephants and other animals for their consumption (A modest compensation for encroaching upon their habitat!).
This is not the first time it happened. Some time ago there was an excessive supply of pumpkins. An irregularly recurring incidence has been the mismatch between demand and supply reaching extremes. Producers fail to recover the cost of production and fall into debt.
Pauperization of the poor peasant continues quicker.
Lack of planning
Why did it happen Was it inevitable and unavoidable Lack of planning is the principal reason. Discarding planning as a socialistic practice and dismantling the excellent planning apparatus that existed, we have laid the ground for such oversupply.
In the absence of reliable and timely information the peasant is guided by his personal experience to plan his future crop. For example, if he finds that others who have planted a crop X have made better profits this season he is also tempted to switch over to the production of that crop instead of what he had done earlier. If considerable producers act like him it could produce an oversupply of X.
Introduction of superior seeds and new varieties also could cause an excess. The case for an islandwide agricultural extension service cannot be therefore overestimated. Such a service could have provided timely and correct information about optimum numbers of acres under different crops that could be grown. It is unpardonable to allow a situation to develop where the producers are denied the opportunity to obtain such information in time.
Let us look at this phenomenon further and try to find out the strengths and weaknesses of our agriculture that lie hidden beneath such phenomena. Naturally climatic conditions have been conducive for the surplus crop. But it was achieved with the same old technology. If new technology is introduced it would make the surplus still more.
The surplus product could be either exported or kept in cold storage to be released to the market when prices escalate. This brings to the fore the question of building large cold storage plants in agricultural districts. Sri Lanka is behind other developing countries in agricultural product preservation. It is necessary to embrace high technology driven food preservation methods besides developing native traditional methods.
Land fragmentation
From the foregoing it is apparent that Sri Lanka has a positive potential for food security, if necessary managerial and policy decisions are taken in time. Two factors are important here.
One is the need for a modern communication set up linking the markets and producers. Other is to maintain rational proportions between subsistence agriculture and commercial agriculture, our food security. While the latter is more profitable the former is the backbone of our food security.
There have been attempts to persuade farmers to abandon subsistence agriculture and engage in commercial agriculture by interested parties including the World Bank. Such an action would endanger the food security of the people.
Problems of subsistence agriculture such as land tenure, the fragmentation of land, the huge debt burden of the peasantry, low productivity of land and oflabour, huge cost of inputs including fertilizer, shortage of labour and poor water management need to be resolved urgently.
Unlike in industry, agriculture, especially the production of fruits and vegetables has the potential of mobilizing the masses. Home gardening, including urban home gardening could assist the food production drive in a big way. This has not been pursued with interest.
Sri Lankas agricultural research is minimal. Even the once thriving plantation agriculture research institutes lack staff and facilities. In view of climate change and regularly occurring or alternating floods and droughts we need to find new varieties of rice that could withstand flood waters or that need minimal water such as drip irrigation. Even such simple solutions as rainwater harvesting are not practiced on a scale.
Even in commercial agriculture our performance is not healthy. Tea, rubber and coconut industries are in a state of neglect. Obsolete technology and lack of value addition plague them.

PLANNED INVESTOR-FRIENDLY REFORMS  TO BE MAPPED OUT IN Sri Lanka 2019 Report
A drive under way in Sri Lanka to highlight sectors of the economy for investment and tackle the challenges that the country has faced in the first half of 2018 will be explored in a forthcoming report by the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
The Report: Sri Lanka 2019 will chart the results of national efforts to attract investors to the country as part of the governments broader bid to make the shift to an upper middle-income, knowledge-based economy.
There will be wide-ranging coverage of planned legislative reforms aimed at enhancing the countrys investment climate, which are expected to be announced in the forthcoming budget.
The publication will also consider the positive effect that free trade deals with key trading partners have had on the economy, enabling Sri Lanka to sharpen its focus on exports as a means of galvanising growth, which has felt the weight of rising levels of public debt over the past year. As part of its analysis, OBG will map out the measures introduced to help tackle the countrys debt levels.
First Capital Holdings PLC has signed a further memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under this fourth MoU, First Capital will help OBG to research and produce the Capital Markets chapter of The Report: Sri Lanka 2019.
Commenting after the signing, Dilshan Wirasekara, Director and CEO, First Capital, said that reports such as those produced by OBG were playing an essential role as a source of credible and independent information on Sri Lanka for both companies looking at expanding overseas and international investors eyeing the many openings available on local projects.
We are confident that by focusing on the various opportunities emerging across Sri Lanka, Oxford Business Groups report will play a substantial role in boosting local economic development and, in turn, facilitating robust levels of capital inflows to the island, he said.
Nathan Thadani, OBGs editorial manager in Sri Lanka, added that while the national economy had faced several challenges in the early part of 2018, ranging from political uncertainty, a slowdown in some reform initiatives and rising commodity prices, to the further depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee, the outlook for the second half of the year appeared to be brighter.
Forecasts point to a gradual pickup in business activity and consumer demand, which are expected to lead to higher GDP growth in the fourth quarter, he said. With any changes in activity across Sri Lankas capital markets also of significant interest to the business community, Im delighted that we will once again benefit from the input of First Capital Holdings experts as we begin the next phase of our research on Sri Lankas economy.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2019 will mark the culmination of more than six months of field research by a team of analysts from Oxford Business Group. It will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments. The publication will also contain interviews with leading members of the business community, including: Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; Hiran Cooray, Chairman of Jetwing Hotels and Krishan Balendra, Deputy Chairman of John Keells Holdings.

President will not allow the return of state terror - Sajith
President Maithripala Sirisena, who risked his own life to save the country from despotism, will never betray the peoples mandate and allow the return of state terror and dictatorship, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The Minister, at a ceremony to open newly constructed Madeena Nagar in Anuradhapura yesterday, made the above observation with reference to speculation that the President together with the Joint Opposition (JO) was discussing to form a caretaker government.
He noted that the return of the JO to power would only mean the dawn of a Hitler era where dictatorship and state terror rules.
The President, knowing the bitter truth that he would be six feet under if he lost the January 8, 2015 polls, bravely came forward to end the destructive rule of the previous regime. He put his country before his party and left the SLFP in which he was the General Secretary. He was well aware of the terror, suppression and cruelty of the rule that prevailed.
He had seen the price former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka and former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake had to pay for going against the then administration.
Yet he accepted the challenge to be the Common Candidate on behalf of the country when nobody else dared to. He restored democracy and social justice by toppling the then Government with the peoples franchise. We have a tendency to forget that past, Minister Premadasa recalled.
I am convinced that the President is well aware of the ambitions of the JO and that he would not sell the hard-won peoples mandate for a cheap price. While we are ever grateful to the President for the sacrifice he made, we also see that those who were defeated in the elections are conspiring to come back to power through a caretaker government. The JO members greed for power is for their own selfish reasons of maintaining their opulent lifestyles and special privileges. This defeated group is having meeting after meeting to form a caretaker government, but I am confident that the President will not betray his mandate at any cost, Minister Premadasa remarked.
The Minister however warned the public to understand the political theatrics and the duplicity of some UPFA MPs who struggle for their political survival.

However, after being informed that this could harm wildlife, a new location for garbage dumping was identified at Serakuliya. Protestors say that if the minister can give priority to wildlife, he should give more consideration to people living in the newly proposed dumping area.
Meanwhile, on Friday, teachers from Puttalam gathered in protest also marking Teachers Day.

A roast and a toast to an angry  escape goat
Goats and humans have a long and productive history together. Over the millennia, weve found a range of interesting uses for these incredible animals, which are also capable of some unbelievable feats of their own. The lives of goats, by all appearances, consist mostly of eating, climbing, frolicking, butting heads and human bottoms.
As my late friend Dommie who created a farmyard in his Colombo back garden remarked: Having a goat is like having a child. True, like children, they are delightfully cute, tons of fun, and extremely affectionate. But if you have had a goat, at one time or another, you will regret making some or all of these odes to the species.
That is because on the flip side, the bucks or Billy goats, as the males are called, can be exasperating, cantankerous and even lewd. Bucks particularly like to pass water on their own faces and stick their heads in the urine streams of other goats. They also like to perform crude acts on themselves that are rather, um, difficult to explain to children or visiting friends and relatives.
A buck in rut, or ready to mate with a doe, will basically urinate all over himself. I guess to a nanny goat that would smell like Chanel No. 5, but to humans it is not as pleasant. Even petting a buck can leave that smell all over your hands.
Dommie took his buck home despite reservations by his home folk. Because of a lack of a shed on the premises he tethered the animal with a rope by the side of his verandah for the night. It was the monsoon season and Dommie had the presence of mind to tie his buck Rocky with a reasonably long rope which would afford the animal a roof over its head in the event of a storm.
The story goes that this arrangement was the beginning of the downfall of Rocky staying in Dommies parental home verandah. That was because Dommies wastrel brother Vince came staggering home much the worse for drink. Little did Vince know that Rocky was around the vicinity waiting for him. The sloshed Vince did not find anything funny about the goat sneaking up on him in the dark, horning him in the bottom and kicking him in the rear for good measure.
There was further evidence for the prosecution by morning to suggest that Rocky had to be deemed persona non grata and banished from the premises forever. For one, he had destroyed most of the familys fancy flower beds and prized orchid plants which brought in pretty useful revenue. Vince, in particular insisted that the buck be exiled from the family home the same day.
Despite pleas by the owner of the recalcitrant buck, the family tribunal decreed that the accused animal because of its destructive and violent character had to be deported from his new environment with immediate effect. There were no ifs, or ands or butts about the verdict. As the victim, Vince with an impediment in his speech cried out: For goats sake, thats enough!
Conventional wisdom experienced after certain painful events teach us never to turn our back on a ram or bend facing the opposite direction because he will plant his head into the small of your back or nail your butt. And dont think you can teach him a lesson by returning the favour with anything short of lethal force. Rams love getting hit in the head. I think it gives them a pleasurable wave of tingling sensations.
After his traumatic ordeal, Vince and the family questioned Dommie as to why he had bought such an unpredictably vicious animal home. He told them that he planned to purchase a bunch of nanny goats to get with Rocky, after whatever courtship that goats required. Rocky would then beget little Rockys, who would beget more, till the whole world was covered with ill-tempered mutant goats.
For some reason, in all agrarian cultures, nothing is as funny as seeing a buck send a dairy man flying into a pile of manure. It has happened to nearly everyone who has raised goats. However carefully you keep an eye out, the moment you forget and turn your back, BAM! Most of the time no harm is done which I suppose is why it seems so comical.
But ram attacks are not funny. Rams can maim and even kill humans. So if you are new to the business, I am, right now, going to proffer some tips to save you embarrassment or possibly your life. Never try to run away from an attacking ram. He can outrun you. If you watch two bucks about to deliver head collisions on each other, they will face off and take a few steps backwards. Then they charge, colliding head on with enough collective force to make a heavy truck bleed. Then they quiver with pleasure and do it again.
There were other bucks of my acquaintance such as the intolerable cross-bred overgrown Jamunapari buck named Angora, belonging to my classmate Vijays family. Now, Angora was not a regular goat and neither was he your customary loveable pet character. Given his size and temperament he was more part goat, part rhinoceros. He was about the size of a small horse but with devils horns.
For sure, he was a billy goat, and an unlikable one at that. You see, Angora like Rocky, had this annoying fetish of liking to head-butt people and even vehicles. Yes, he found it irresistible butting people or taking a moving vehicle head on without much effort. No one after an initial painful encounter with the charging beast ever bent down when Angora was around. The point I am trying to make is that Angora was a goat not to be messed with.
The funniest goat story is one concerning a former classmate nicknamed Loony Lennie, the joker of the pack who was the class clown. Lennie joined a gang of classmates to our friend Vijays sprawling home garden which was the preserve of Angora and his harem of nanny goats. Lennie claimed he had milked cows and would milk the goats so as provide fresh milk at tea time.
He returned from his milking expedition battered, bruised and limping and smelling of goat manure after being severely attacked by the goat he had attempted to milk.
What he did not realize was that the goat he had picked for milking was the dreaded male buck, Angora!

Low water levels in tanks
Rs. 2,537 m fertiliser subsidy to Apura farmers
Anuradhapura District Agrarian Development Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa told the Daily News that the water levels of nearly 3,000 minor irrigation tanks were very low and no water was received to a majority of small tanks yet. As such no decision is taken with regard to the cultivation of 2018/2019 Maha Season, he said.
It was expected to cultivate 132,000 hectares in the district during the 2018/19 Maha season. Now we have limited it to 121,170 hectares and it may drop depending on the monsoon rainfall.
We are preparing to distribute fertiliser subsidies such as MOPT.S.P. and Urea amounting to 36,384 mt. for nearly 150,000 farmers expected to take up paddy cultivation.
The commercial value of the fertiliser for the Anuradhapura district is Rs. 2,537 million and farmers are only required to contribute Rs. 364 million on subsidy basis, such as 50 kg bag at Rs. 500, Somawansa said. Resulting from the long-prevailing drought, a majority of the 73 major tanks coming under the Irrigation Department had reduced water levels, especially in the Anuradhapura district.
However, water in major reservoirs had increased by one percent from the recent rainfall overall, Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Director Wasantha Bandara Palugaswewa said.
He requested the farming community who faced continuous cultivation losses to use every drop of rainwater for preparatory agricultural processes such as land preparation, ploughing etc. without depending on tanks as a water quota of 35 percent out of the tank water is required for such work, which poses a risk concerning seasonal water management for cultivation in Anuradhapura.
Farmers have shown reluctance to start cultivation work as they had lost a few 'Kannas' due to drought although some showers were received in the last few days. The distribution of drought-relief dry food packs worth Rs. 5,000 is continuing. According to the Irrigation Director's office, the water level of Padaviya, which should be 85,000 acre-feet is now one acre-foot (a.f.), Walkada which should be 43,000 a.f. is now four inches, Abayawewa which should be 2,000 a.f. is now 72 a.f., Maha Kanadarawa which should be 36,250 a.f. is now 5,600 a.f., Maha Wilachchiya has become 9,200 a.f. from 33,000 a.f., Tisa wewa now 660 a.f. from 3,500 a.f., and Nuwara wewa is 6,120 a.f. from 36,500 a.f.

Sizable section within JO opposed to Caretaker Government- Vasu
There is a sizable section within the Joint Opposition (JO) who are opposed to the idea of a Caretaker Government by SLFP, JO and other stakeholders, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday said.
Addressing a press conference of the Socialist Peoples Front at the N.M. Perera Memorial Center in Borella, Nanayakkara, said if such a move takes place, it may result in a split in the JO.
A powerful section within the JO is opposed to an alliance with the SLFP and the President, he said.
He said however if the right conditions are right, which can be agreed by all stakeholders, an alliance can be formed between President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said the best way to overcome the political imbroglio in the country is to hold a Parliamentary election and let the people choose a stable government.

A Glass Half Full: The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia report launch
Sri Lanka has potential to more than double its exports to South Asia - World Bank report
If trade barriers are overcome, trade within South Asia can increase three-fold, from $23 billion to $67 billion, suggests a new World Bank report. Sri Lanka has the potential to more than double its exports to South Asia. Increased intraregional trade will provide a greater variety of goods and services at cheaper prices for Sri Lankan consumers, better access to inputs for producers and exporters, increased investment, export diversification and growth.
South Asia is the worlds most rapidly growing region. It is also the worlds least integrated region. Man-made trade barriers have hampered intraregional connectivity and kept South Asian countries from maximizing their prospects. Trade within South Asia accounts for only 5 percent of the regions total trade, compared to 50 percent in East Asia and the Pacific. Sri Lankas exports to South Asia are equivalent to only 11 percent of its global exports.
The report, A Glass Half Full: The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia, launched yesterday, highlights four critical obstacles to regional trade- border tax distortions, nontariff barriers, connectivity costs, and trust deficits- and offers options for policymakers to address them. The report helps to quantify commonly known benefits associated with a more integrated South Asia. For example, the actual value of Sri Lankas exports to South Asia is $1.2 billion, but the potential value is $2.8 billion. This $1.6 billion gap between the two is equivalent to 15 percent of Sri Lankas total global exports. Closing the gap will not only enhance but also help diversify Sri Lankas trade.
There is evidence that Sri Lanka will benefit financially and improve its services sector and human resources if it removed trade barriers and invested in better connectivity, says Dr. Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
In addition to tariffs, para tariffs such as port and airport development levy and cess create an anti-export bias. Para tariffs more than double the average import tariff in Sri Lanka. Additionally, 44 percent of Sri Lankas imports are not provided concessional treatment under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA). And about 23 percent of its exports to South Asia suffer from the same non-concessional treatment. Non-tariff measures further increase the cost of imports.

SLIC successfully educated thousands of parents about the benefits they can obtain from Suraksha free health insurance cover and the procedure to obtain their claims.
The Suraksha health insurance policy will ease the financial burden when students are faced with illnesses, accidents and disabilities in and out of the school. It will help students to continue with their education, overcoming any health-related obstacles they may encounter, irrespective of financial status.

SriLankan employee transferred without due procedure - Witness
A female employee of SriLankan Airlines (SLA) had been transferred to the an overseas position in 2011 without following the due procedures, including the HR Manual of the company, it was revealed yesterday.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering and Mihin Lanka also learnt that she had been appointed based on the direction of then Chairman Nishantha Wickremesinghe.
The employee, Shehani Dilusha Rodrigo had been working at SLA since 2005 on contractual basis as a Flight Attendant and was appointed as a Flight Steward in 2007. In 2008, she was made permanent as a Flight Attendant in Grade C2 and was promoted to Senior Flight Attendant in Grade C3 the following year.
However, the afore mentioned controversial appointment was made on June 09, 2011 transferring her to the Airport Services Delivery office in Singapore.
SriLankan Airlines Manager of HR Operations and Administration Lasantha Liyanage testified before the Commission yesterday.
Shehani Rodrigo, who was under the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), in May 2011 had asked for a one-year period of no pay leave on compassionate grounds from then Chairman directly via e-mail bypassing even the HR Division. In response to her request, Chairman Wickremesinghe in June, 2011 had directed the CMO, S.Jeyaseelan to grant her the no pay leave as requested and also to transfer her to the Airport Services Delivery office in Singapore.
According to the witness, the normal process of such transfers is that the company requests the employee who was selected for the overseas appointment to apply for no pay leave and then give the appointment.
This is to prevent the duplication of payment, he said. But, in this case, there is no such request from the company and referring to her personal file in the company, the witness told that there are no justifications for her transfer as well.
He said that he couldnt find documentary evidence on the interviews conducted to select her for this post. This appointment had been made by his department on the instructions given by then Company Secretary and the CMO.
There had been no communication with the Board of Directors regarding this appointment, it was revealed. She was appointed to the post of Commercial Support Officer of Grade V for a period of one year from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012.
When asked by the State Counsel whether she had sufficient educational qualifications on Sales and Marketing to work at that overseas office, the witness said that she had no such qualifications but, the educational qualifications she possessed at that time were enough to deal with it as it was just a supporting job.
However, with the conclusion of the contract period in 2012, the SLA had appointed her to another position in Dubai till 2013.

A stinking spat
At a time when the garbage problem in the City has assumed critical proportions we have the Colombo Mayor and the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) locked in a right royal battle, resulting in garbage collection within the Colombo Municipal limits coming to a standstill and Colombos ratepayers reduced to mere spectators in the ongoing drama.
The reason for the spat: the SLLRDC has refused point blank to collect the garbage within the Colombo Municipal area until an outstanding bill for Rs. 207 million is settled by the CMC for the collection and treatment of garbage, a task which the SLLRDC had undertaken following the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump over two years ago.
Mayor Rosy Senanayake and Chairman SLLRDC Roshan Gunawardana had chosen the ideal time to play out their little act when the rains are lashing out in all its fury and mounting garbage piles creating an eyesore in the commercial capital.
Summoning a media briefing, Senanayake accused the SLLRDC of extortion saying it had been overcharging the CMC above the agreed sum of Rs. 3,000 per metric ton of segregated garbage while Gunawardana claimed that the CMC owes the SLLRDC Rs. 207 million for 15 months commencing from 2017, adding that his organisation was not inclined to dish out charity and its services could not be equated to a Dansala.
While the ball is being passed on by the two State bodies which are expected to work in harmony for the benefit of the public, citizens of Colombo are being swamped with massive garbage piles as shown on television, made worse by the present rainy weather which needless to say will lead to the spread of epidemics such as dengue if this prestige battle is going to continue indefinitely. Therefore both the Mayor and the Chairman should get down from their high horses and arrive at a compromise. After all, both are State organisations affiliated to the Government in power which will make it that much easier to negotiate a compromise.
The duo should also realize that they owe their positions to the present Government and their actions could only lead to the Government becoming more unpopular with the voting public, adding to its current woes brought about by the fall of the rupee and the resultant high cost of living. Besides, both are paid by the public purse and this alone should motivate them to attach priority to the public rather than trying to win ego battles.
As already mentioned, the rains can only aggravate the situation and the Mayor will have her work cut out in trying to provide relief to the displaced flood victims in the City without having to contend with a garbage problem.
The SLLRDC Chairman too should think of arriving at a short term solution in connection with the outstanding dues without sticking to his guns. After all Rs. 207 million is peanuts considering the billions of rupees owing to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation by the CEB and the National Carrier. For her part, the Mayor too should not default on payments, if that indeed that is the case, especially considering accusations of extravagant spending for renovation of her official quarters, hurled by the Joint Opposition.
Besides, the Colombo Municipal Council as the countrys premier local body, should show the way to other local bodies through example and clashing with fellow State organs is not the best way to get about things. It is important that the stalemate be broken by the parties concerned, lest the capital city be reduced to a stinking mess. It would be better therefore for the President or the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter before serious consequences could ensue.
Stop this torment
President Maithripala Sirisena said a mouthful when he maintained that the present year five scholarship examination had driven both the students and parents nuts, or words to that effect. Speaking at the Annual Prize Day ceremony of the Kandy Model School last week the President said that the countrys child generation had been pushed into great hardship since the parents consider the year five scholarship examination the one and only barrier standing in the way of their childrens future. Therefore the parents put all their efforts to ensure their children surmount this barrier and secure their future.
The year five scholarship examination today has become one whole prestige battle, with the media spotlight focused on the best performers islandwide forcing the parents to groom their children for the limelight. In this exercise they go to great lengths to prepare their children for the exam, in the process over-straining the young minds.
Former Education Minister Bandula Gunawardana at one time was toying with the idea of doing away with this exam due to the pressure it exerted on the children. With current Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam going to the extent of slashing the number of GCE (OL) subjects to six it is time that a decision is made on the year five scholarship exam as well.

Present to accept the wheelchairs were Yaas Hewage, Ajith Fernando and Dr Gopi Kiynasamy.
Threads of Time while visually, creatively, and fashion wise, was a fashion show which will go down in the annals of Sri Lankan fashion history, made its mark more by the good that resulted from it .

World Mental Health Day falls on October 10
Tackling mental health issues
World Mental Health Day 2018 falls on October 10 with the theme Young people and mental health in a changing world.
Global medical statistics reveal that half of all mental illness begins by the age of 14. There is also growing evidence that the transmission of these disorders can be reversed through early recognition and intervention. And yet shockingly, though 38 per cent of Sri Lankas population consist of the young people, the majority of those who are having mental disorders do not receive any form of professional care. (The term young people refer to persons between 1024 years, as used by WHO and others to combine adolescents and youth.)
There are reasons for this negligence. First relates to our social attitude. Most Sri Lankans, even the adolescents, hold negative attitudes towards people with mental illness. Often the negative attitudes involve a perception that people with mental disorders are violent and dangerous. This perception is fuelled by media stories which paint violent perpetrators as mentally ill (without providing the context of the broad spectrum of mental illness).
The bias is not limited to people who are either uninformed or uneducated; in fact, even the highly educated people hold these very same stereotypes. The end result, however, manifests as social distancing from the persons supposed to be having mental illness.
Family attitude
The second reason relates to the family attitude. The average Sri Lankan parents, when their children show signs of mental disorder, seek help from local spiritual healers to get rid of the bad influence of evil spirits.
Only very little systematic examination has been done of the effectiveness of spiritual healing in treating mental illness or alleviating psychological distress. Certain evidence suggests that it may provide some psychosocial intervention and might help to relieve distress. However, no evidence exists to suggest that they change the course of severe mental illnesses such as bipolar and psychotic disorders.
Important facts
A report commissioned by the Ministry of Health on Mental Health Status of Adolescents in Sri Lanka, 2017 reveals some interesting facts. (1) Suicidal behaviour is a serious problem among the young in Sri Lanka. The percentage of that reported attempted suicide at least once in 12 months was 7% while suicidal ideation was 9%. (2) The percentage of young people who have reported feeling lonely most of the time or always in the past 12 months was 9% and anxiety (could not sleep because of being worried) was reported by 5%. (3) A substantial proportion of the young also have reported having no close friends. Female students were more likely to report feeling lonely, anxious and not having close friends than male students. (4) The current use of smoking cigarettes among the young were 9%, alcohol users 3%, marijuana users 3%. (5) Overall 10% of the students in Sri Lanka use multiple substances or one of these substances in the past 30 days.
The report adds: This data shows that a significant proportion of children had the warning signals of mental health problems highlighting need for early intervention. Appropriate measures need to be taken to prevent suicides by observing the factors significantly linked to suicidal behaviour. Steps can then be taken to identify adolescents who have serious suicidal ideation so that interventions can be taken to reduce the suicidal rate.
Suggestions
While those recommendations needed to be considered seriously, this writer wishes pen down few of his thoughts also.
Any effective mental health care is closely linked to the culture of the community, thus culturally-sensitive programmes should be developed, e.g. in Sri Lanka we have deeply religious beliefs, strong family ties etc. At the same time, we must also understand that a substantial proportion of mental health care is provided by the informal sector (faith healers, religious healers, traditional healers). This sensitive issue needs to be addressed carefully by the Government, professionals and civil society. The practices should be scientifically evaluated and if appropriate and effective, they should be promoted.
Sri Lanka has a well-knitted community mental health model. It is the optimum direction for future development of mental health services and based on following proven observations: (a) Evidence that community-based mental health care is superior to psychiatry hospital-based care. (b) Great scarcity of qualified mental health professionals to meet all the needs of the community. (c) Problems in transportation of patients from their homes to tertiary-care hospitals. (d) Preference of people to seek health care locally in the community.
However, community mental health services should meet all the mental health needs of the community, including mental health promotion, prevention of mental illness, psychosocial needs of the community, needs of special groups (adolescents, elderly etc.), prevention of harm from substance abuse, etc.
Community mental health service should be integrated into the existing primary health care delivery system to ensure its long-term sustainability.
To make the above aspirations achievable, an essential component is the establishment of community awareness programmes. They need to focus on issues such as: (a) Medical nature of mental illness (b) Changing the health-seeking behaviour of the community (c) Stigma removal (d) Removal of myths and misconceptions (e) Ensure community ownership of the programme (f) Preparation of communities and families to care for persons with mental illness.
Prevention
Prevention of mental disorders begins with being aware of and understanding the early warning signs and their symptoms. Parents and teachers can help build life skills of children and the youth to help them cope with everyday challenges at home and at school. Psycho-social support can be provided in schools and other community settings and, of course, training for health workers to enable them to detect and manage mental health disorders can be put in place, improved or expanded.
Spending time with the family, friends and other loved ones is one of the best predictors for psychological well-being and protection against mental health issues.
The responsibility to address the needs of young people with social, emotional, and behavioural challenges often falls initially on teachers as the school is where many of them are spending a large portion of their day. Many teachers do not feel equipped to meet their students emotional needs, which results in many of them being under-referred for mental health treatment.
Teachers should be trained to recognise symptoms; to educate students about mental health; to administer guidance and support, and to refer students to outside services for special assistance when necessary.
This also amplifies the call to incorporate learning that focuses on students mental health and well-being into daily classroom activities - something that can be beneficial for all students, not just those with diagnosable conditions. The classroom teachers can make mental health a more robust part of the school day is by integrating mental-health topics, including self-esteem, body image, resilience and life-coping skills, into the existing school curricula.
Society, too, must play a role. Adults must be fully aware of the young people in their surroundings and know how to overcome the obstacles that prevent these youngsters from seeking help.

Tourism summit highlights need for digital platforms
Tourism and Christian and Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga praised the annual Tourism Leaders Summit and International Tourism Research Conference at the BMICH on Friday.
Because of events like this, he said, Sri Lanka will get more popular and make tourism the number one development area.
The Tourism Leaders Summit took place at BMICH on Friday and Saturday. The minister explained how international conferences expose Sri Lanka to global ideas and drive the evolution of the tourism industry.
A number of new tourism conventions are coming up, he said, adding that next year, we are also having a conference, which will also comprise 5,000 international heads of state and delegates.
The Tourism Leaders Summit was host to 20 experts from countries including India, China, the UK, the US, and Australia.
To highlight the summits diverse thoughts, the minister was preceded on stage by two international speakers: Audrey Kitagawa, Chair Elect of the Parliament of the Worlds Religions and Trustee, and Akvile Pareigyte, founder of Volt Lab-Regional Google Trainer.
The two shared distinct insights into the future of Sri Lankas tourism industry. Kitagawa spoke about the nature of religious tourism and Paregie offered advice on the technological necessities for a successful tourism industry.
The huge resource that exists within the realm of communities of faith had long been recognised as an untapped and important resource, said Kitagawa. She said that rather than seeing faith as an impediment to development, if you want to make a modicum of change, you work with the leaders and the community leaders of faith. So communities of faith become important vectors for the programmes that we want to unfold.
Paregie took a different perspective to the factors of tourism development, starting off her speech with contemporary realities of global tourism.
Around the world, more people are using their mobile phones or tablets to book their flights, hotels, and other tourist packages. In India, she said, 87 percent of customers are comfortable using mobile phones throughout every stage of the booking process. In that vein, 53 percent of customers will abandon a mobile site if it takes longer than three seconds to load, she said. So, if your site doesnt load in three seconds, you will lose half of your potential business.
Paregie highlighted the significance of developing technology and tourism simultaneously.

Tway wins first US PGA Tour title in playoff as Snedeker fades
Los Angeles, Monday: Kevin Tway birdied his last five holes, three in a playoff, to win his first US PGA Tour title on Sunday at the Safeway Open, where Brandt Snedeker squandered a five-shot lead in the final round.
Tway rolled in a 10-foot birdie putt at the third hole of sudden death to win the first event of the US tours 2018-19 season over Ryan Moore at Silverado Resort in Napa, California.
Snedeker, who started the day with a three-shot lead and led by five with 11 remaining in regulation, fell by the wayside with a par at the first playoff hole.
Moore matched Tways birdies at the first and second playoff holes, before succumbing at the third -- the par-four 10th.
Im kind of at a loss for words, said Tway, the 30-year-old son of 1986 PGA Championship winner Bob Tway.
I think I birdied my last five holes -- that always helps.
He had birdied 17 and 18 in regulation to complete a one-under par 71 at Silverado Resort in Napa, California, finishing tied with Moore and Snedeker on 14-under par 274.
Snedeker started the day with a three-shot lead and stretched the advantage to five after birdies at the fifth and seventh before slumping with four bogeys on the back nine.
That included three in a row at 10, 11 and 12, and that was enough to see his lead evaporate as Moore birdied 15, 16 and 18 to reach 14-under with a five-under par final-round of 67.
I was just able to put together a round of golf, said Moore, who had six birdies and just one bogey. On a day like today its not about necessarily how youre swinging, its about how you just get the ball in the hole and somehow I managed to do that.
Snedeker briefly regained a one-shot lead with a birdie at the par-five 16th, where he rolled in a 10-foot putt. AFP

UNP can form government of its own-MP Thushara Amarasena
Commenting on the so-called 'Caretaker Government' proposed to be established by the SLFP and SLPP, UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena said if this happens then the UNP has the capacity to form a government of its own before the formation of 'Caretaker Government'.
"Around 10-12 SLFP ministers who do not want to work further with the corrupt politicians rejected by the people of this country in 2015 are willing to join with us to form a UNP government," he said. Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Amarasena said that since January 8, 2015, various attempts have been made by the Joint Opposition to topple the government. But, all these attempts hav neen futile.
"Therefore, this is another gimmick by this group to mislead the public," he said.
"If they really want to send this government home, they can easily do it by defeating the Budget 2019 without resorting to such chikdish acts to mislead the public," he added. The group of 16 SLFPers those who cannot live without power are trying to use this topic to latch up with the SLPP.
Commenting on the plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, MP Amarasena said that there is an attempt to put this in to UNP account. "This is a discussion between an idler and a police officer. If this police officer had contacts with idlers like this, he is not suitable to hold his position," MP Amarasena added. The MP charged that Namal Kumara is getting a monthly salary from a leading institution. "So, it is suspicious that he is fulfilling a contract of that institution," he added.
He further stressed the importance of conducting an inquiry in to the alleged January 8 conspiracy of the former President and former Defence Secretary to retain power through military intervention.

Vijayakala gets bail
Former State Minister and Jaffna District Parliamentarian Vijayakala Maheshwaran arrested for allegedly exciting or attempting to excite disaffection through a controversial statement in Jaffna was yesterday ordered to be released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrates Court.
Accordingly, the suspect was ordered to be released on a surety bail of Rs.500,000 by Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake. Parliamentarian Vijayakala Maheshwaran was arrested by the Organized Crimes Prevention Division for allegedly committing offences under Section 120 of the Penal Code.
Addressing an event held at the Weerasingham Hall in Jaffna on July 2, the former State Minister had allegedly said she would like to see the resurgence of the LTTE.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Kamal Silva appearing for the Organized Crimes Prevention Division informed Court that the prosecution would not object to the release of the suspect on bail. The Chief Magistrate queried as to why the police were not objecting to bail while seeking an order to remand the suspect through a further report. In reply, DIG Kamal Silva informed that there is no reason to raise objections for bail in terms of the Bail Act and no evidence to prove that she evaded courts being a Parliamentarian. DIG Silva further informed court that the Police have concluded investigations into the incident and sought the Attorney Generals advice regarding the incident. The Attorney General had instructed to institute legal action against the suspect under section 120 of the Penal Code.
Section 120 of the Penal Code states attempts to raise discontent or disaffection amongst the People of Sri Lanka, or to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such People, shall be punishable with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years.
Meanwhile, the Attorney General had decided to take legal action against Vijayakala Maheshwaran under Article 157/A (3) for alleged violation of the provisions of the Constitution.
On July 6, the Chief Magistrates Court issued an order directing several media institutions to produce their unedited video footage and paper articles pertaining to this controversial statement. Filing a B report regarding this incident, the Organized Crimes Prevention Division alleged that the former State Minister could be charged under the offences that appear to have been committed under Section 115 and 120 of the Penal Code, violating the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and provisions stipulated under Article 157A of the Constitution. Article 157A of the Constitution provides Constitutional provisions for prohibition against the violation of the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
Article 157A(1) of the Constitution cites that no person shall, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka.
The Organized Crimes Prevention Division informed court that Police have commenced investigations into this incident pursuant to a complaint made by Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Ven. Magalkande Sudaththa Thera. State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheshwaran decided to temporarily resign from her ministerial portfolio following a huge outcry in the country. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva with Senior Counsel K.V. Thavarasa appeared for the suspect.
