Combating corruption, improving governance
Corruption and Governance was uppermost in minds of most during the two elections held in the country last year. Whilst responses have been seen, perceptions on the success is subject of mixed reviews. In some quarters there is now growing impact of corruption on the country.
Corruption has debilitating and corrosive effects on progress, stability and development of the continent. It impedes economic growth by discouraging foreign investments, creates distortion in resource allocation and competitive markets, increases the cost of doing business, and reduces the net-value of public spending. It also reduces the quality of services and public infrastructure and the volume of tax revenues, and encourages the misappropriation and misallocation of scarce resources. In the political realm, it undermines the rule of law, respect for human rights, accountability and transparency and weakens government institutions. This in turn erodes public legitimacy in government and compromises good governance.
The public sector is often vilified as being inept, corrupt and inefficient and the private sector regarded as the most efficient, reliable and implicitly less corrupt sector of the economy. However, this assumption is not necessarily correct. The private sector can also be a haven of corruption, and in some instances, even worse than the public sector. The private sector also often times is in league with the public sector on corruption in the latter sector.
Features
Definitions of corruption abound, but the most commonly used one refers to the abuse of a public position for private gain. Corruption is facilitated by bribery, embezzlement and theft but also by nepotism and cronyism. Corruption affects both the private and public sectors and is often subdivided into grand and petty corruption which ranges from the provision of small 'gifts' in the former to the misappropriation of public assets at the highest levels in the latter. Further classifications distinguish between incidental, institutional and systemic corruption and between political and bureaucratic corruption.
The size and incidence of corruption might be attributed to four key factors:
(i) the level of public benefits available; (ii) the discretionary power of officials; (iii) the level of risk associated with corrupt deals; (iv) the relative bargaining power of the corruptor and corruptee (Rose-Ackerman 1997).
In terms of the causes of corruption, experts representing higher and lower income countries are unanimous on the three most important causes of corruption and in general agreement on the importance of a number of other factors. These are: norms and values of politicians and public servants; lack of control, supervision, auditing; interrelationships - business, politics, state.
It is argued that corruption is in fact largely self- sustaining as a result of the action and reaction of certain elements within a given society. Key elements include payments to political parties and control over appointments which can increase the number of civil servants on lower salaries.
Responses
First, interventionism, in which the relevant authorities wait for the corrupt action to occur and then intervene to capture and punish the offender. This school stimulates retribution, rehabilitation and deterrence but there remain a number of obstructive variables including: the harm has already occurred and cannot be undone; the majority of crimes remain unreported;the demand on finite resources will inevitably be infinite given the degree of supervision necessary to ensure that the deterrence effect operates.
Second, managerialism, in which those individuals or agencies seeking to engage in corrupt behaviour can be discouraged or prevented from doing so by establishing appropriate systems, procedures and protocols. In essence, managerialism advocates the reduction or elimination of opportunities such that those who generally benefit from them cease to be able to do so. There are limitations with this school of thought also, key amongst which are the fact that individuals do not necessarily operate according to the predetermined principles of managerialism.
Organisations contain three broad categories of people who will react differently to corrupt influences:
Category I: people who want to do the right thing and require guidance on how to achieve this
Category II: people who are too timid to take the risk of operating outside set rules
Category III: people who are corrupt and will operate outside of the rules entirely.
Managerialism attempts to provide one set of rules to deter a number of differently motivated individuals. The consequences of this approach are that the success of the anti-corruption effort is fragmented, intercepting the less scheming corruptee but not the more damaging highly planned exploits of others. Equally, managerialist control of corruption ignores market forces. If, for example, public officials are approached to provide confidential information in exchange for money, some may deem the risk too great and refuse. Those who are willing to engage in the activity however, will be able to raise the price of that information which will increase the attractiveness of corruption and sustain its existence.
Finally, organisational integrity which involves the integration of an organisation's operational systems, corruption control strategies and ethical standards so that a norm of ethical behaviour is created. This school of thought presupposes that deviance stems from the organisation rather than the individuals of which it is comprised, as if the breach of ethics involved in corrupt practices occurs almost by osmosis from the malfeasant organisation to the innocent individual within it. Arguably, targeting individuals in anti-corruption efforts is likely to be less successful than targeting the organisational context in which individuals operate. Equivalent examples of individual malfeasance within an organisational dynamic can be seen in corporate crime cases. It has been suggested that the organisation must provide a structural framework that removes the possibility of corrupt practices. In short, the ability of the individual to interpret the rules or to decide whether to apply a particular protocol should be circumvented by a system which cannot be manipulated (Larmour and Wolanin 2001)
Strategies
Huberts (1998) has distinguished six strategies:
Economic - emphasises the need for the economic stimuli for corruption to be reduced and suggests that such might be achieved by, inter alia, paying higher civil service salaries;
Educational - aims at altering the attitudes and values of the populace and civil servants alike via training and education campaigns and engagement of the media;
Cultural - ensuring that the behaviour and attitudes of those in power are subject to stringent codes of conduct and their behaviour filters down to civil servants;
Organisational or bureaucratic - strengthening internal control systems such as auditing to detect corrupt activity, and staff rotation to reduce the propensity for individuals to establish themselves in entrenched corruption;
Political - increasing in transparency in terms, for example, of the monitoring of party finances and more broadly, a clearer and more definite separation of powers in terms of the judiciary and the state;
Judicial or repressive measures - advocates harsher penalties for corrupt practices but also the creation of independent anti-corruption agencies.
There is a gap in the response of Government to fight corruption on a broad front. For example when public institutions make losses due to corruption it is the Treasury which ultimately bears the losses. Practically one wonders the challenge of the Budget division to foresee losses whilst estimating growth in the country.
Whether we have institutions who would crusade for change which eradicates the menace is left to be soon. The malaise is deep seated and corrosive. If we are not careful money will ultimately takeover our systems. It does not have too much to do given current indications.

Sebastianite Sandaruwan going great guns

Sandaruwan Fernando scored an attractive unbeaten 101 runs against Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya in their inter-school around first elevent cricket match worked off at Moratuwa.
During the course of his epic knock he had fourteen hits to the rope and faced 161 balls and occupied the crease for 271 minutes and Palians replied with 271 with their Skipper Himasha Liyanage too missing a very well compiled knock of 195 runs which is their highest score versus either schools.
Sandaruwan was mainly responsible for the Sebs big score of 321 for 8 declared which enabled Sebs to beat Palians on first innings by 50 runs. In their first essay he was unlucky to be run out and missed a well deserved century by three runs and had he scored a century in the first innings he might be the first Sebastianite to achieve this rare feat to score twin centuries in a school encounter at their home grounds. He is coached by Imal Boteju, a former Nalandian cricketer.
Chief Scores
St Sebastian's - 321 for 8 dec in 67 overs (Praveen Perera 53, Nawaindu Fernando 82, Sandaruwan Fernando 97, Praveen Jayawickrama 27,m Vishan Perera 3/65, Pasindu Keshan 2/120 and 203/7 at stumps (Sandaruwan Fernando 101 n/o, Praveen Perera 43, Tharusha Fernando 25, Pasindu Keshan 4/57)

Theatre of the absurd in local politics
Adolf Hitler claimed that Germans are of Aryan stock and that they are superior to other races. That is why he wanted to purify Germany by destroying the Jews. The world knows how this doctrine of racial superiority ended. It developed into the dangerous doctrine of fascism. In his crusade for world supremacy hundreds of Jews and others were put in concentration camps and executed. Of course Hitler appealed to the people in the name of patriotism and socialism to grab power "democratically". The most deplorable factor in that situation was not the acquiescence of the ignorant but the silence of those who knew where Hitler was heading.
This foray into history, in my opinion, is not out of place in view of certain developments in the local political scene today. If you are travelling on the road you could see a label painted on the back windscreens of cars and three wheelers with the words Sinha Le (lion blood) with the second word depicted in blood red, implying that the Sinhala people have lion blood in them. It is based on the unscientific belief that lion blood denotes superiority.
It is for scientists to investigate the similarities and dissimilarities of lion blood and human blood. For the moment it would be interesting to ask whether a transfusion of lion blood would be accepted by the human body. However, science categorically shows that all humans have the same blood whatever their ethnic, religious, class or social differences are. The human race has existed for thousands of years long before these historically evolved divisions including race and religion appeared.
Communal tensions
Sinha Le has become a signature line of a new brand of rabid racists who want to consolidate a Sinhala hegemony over the non-Sinhala population of the country. Propagation of such superiority is certain to exacerbate communal tensions and disturb the current atmosphere of peace and goodwill among communities. It is sad that these divisive and dangerous policies have not been rebuffed categorically by State and political party authorities. On the other hand, there seems to be collusion between chauvinist forces led by the former President and his followers. If inter-communal relations worsen to the level of impending racial riots these adherents would be willing partners of hit squads that would be released to create mayhem. The resurgent antics of Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena notoriety is also a harbinger of possible escalation of chauvinist activity.
This dangerous new trend in rabid racist politics should be nipped in the bud. Failure to do so would have dangerous consequences including Sri Lanka once again being relegated to the position of a pariah state by the international community and serious constraints on economic development with obvious repercussions on the living standards and the future well-being of the people, particularly those of the future generations.
Misappropriation of public funds
Time and energy of those who hold high office as well as the media that should be concentrated on solving much more urgent and vital problems of the people are dissipated by another diversion. This is seen by a quick perusal of the media these days. A disproportionately large space is being occupied by spokesmen of rival factions within the SLFP on matters of their internal politics with the result that discussion and debate of such vital matters as Constitution making has been relegated to a secondary place.
The President in his other capacity as the President of the SLFP is compelled to devote much of his valuable time to internal party politics of the SLFP than attending to matters of State. Moreover the majority of SLFPers both inside and outside Parliament are campaigning for continuation of policies of the last regime that immense pressure is brought on him to compromise on principles. It is necessary to remind that some of the demands of these elements run counter to the aspirations of the people expressed on both January 8 and August 17, 2015.
In this situation issues of good governance has been placed in the back burner. For example, the pledge to institute clean Government is being obstructed by two factors. One is the lack of progress against public servants and politicians of the former regime who have been charged on various counts of bribery, fraud and misappropriation of public funds. One year has passed and we are yet to see any trial, leave alone a conviction. Instead what we witness is a long trail of the accused being summoned to get statements recorded and their public statements with full media glee implying unjust harassment. They also have the audacity to challenge the law enforcing authorities and claim political vendetta. Street demonstrations are also staged obstructing proceedings of probing and judicial authorities. All these go on with full impunity.
Local government polls
The other is the alleged corruption and misdeeds by members of the Yahapalana Cabinet itself with no credible follow-up inquiries. In this situation the public is justified in concluding that there ought to be collusion between the accused and some members of the Government. The sooner such follow-up action is taken and matters cleared the better is for the Government and the country. It is nave to think that in this age of all pervasive digital communication technology and an alert civil society any miscreants could escape public gaze and wrath.
The situation is further complicated by the forthcoming local government polls. As is the usual practice among political parties and politicians issues of local governance are relegated to the background and instead the campaigns focus on national politics and its international repercussions. For example during the last regime local government elections were used to send a message to the international community showing people's supposed solidarity with a leader that alleged he is facing death by electrocution following an international trial. This time it is supposed to be about the nature of the State and Constitutional reforms. The whole campaign is being orchestrated on wrong lines even before nominations are called for in order to use it as a platform for the defeated forces to stage a comeback and reverse popular gains of January 8.
It is much better for local polls to be conducted on ward basis by individuals instead of by political parties and groups. In the latter case it is the allegiance to the party and not the credentials of the contesting individual that would be decisive in voting. This would prevent a pluralistic grouping of councillors who would cooperate in administering the local government area.
