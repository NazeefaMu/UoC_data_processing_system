No regrets for Morgan as he resumes captaincy
Mumbai: England's Eoin Morgan insisted Monday he had no regrets over his controversial decision to skip last year's tour of Bangladesh, ahead of his return to the one-day captaincy in India this week.
Morgan, skipper of England's Twenty20 and 50-over sides, came in for criticism for opting out of the Bangladesh series over security concerns, with several commentators saying his decision had damaged his authority.
But speaking to journalists in Mumbai, where England play two warm-up matches this week before their first ODI against India on Sunday, Morgan said he was comfortable with the decision and it was now time to move on.
"I don't regret that at all. It was a decision I'm very comfortable with," Morgan said.
"It was a decision I considered all consequences (to) when I did. Sitting here or sitting at home I would have been very comfortable with it."
Jos Buttler stepped up to the captaincy when England played three ODIs in Bangladesh in October, with Morgan opting out of the tour in the wake of a deadly attack on a cafe in Dhaka which was popular with foreigners.
Former England skipper Nasser Hussain said Morgan had "let England down" by staying at home. Another ex-captain Michael Vaughan wrote in the Daily Telegraph that players would not forget how their leader "went missing at a difficult time".
Morgan, who has recently been playing T20 cricket with the Sydney Thunder franchise in Australia's Big Bash League, denied it had felt weird to link up with his international teammates again.
"No, not at all, I was extremely excited. I think a major part of that was getting some cricket under my belt in the run-in to the series, which I've managed to do," said Morgan.
"I'm really excited about the upcoming series and the next five, six months, which is going to be a big part in our lead towards the World Cup" being staged in England in 2019.
After the Bangladesh tour, England were hammered 4-0 by India in a five-match Test series under the captaincy of Alastair Cook.
But England's short-form cricket has shown a big improvement since they crashed out of the 2015 ODI World Cup. They were the beaten finalists in last year's World T20 tournament in India.
Senior batsman Joe Root is expected to be back in the side for the first ODI in Pune after staying back for the birth of his child, although Morgan indicated that he could be rested at some stage.
After the three ODIs, the two teams will play three T20 internationals. AFP

Additional Magistrate chides FCID over alleged property belonging to Yoshitha
While ordering to release Daisy Forrest, 89, the grandmother of Yoshitha Rajapaksa on bail over a money laundering case into a 31.5 perches of land with a house valued at Rs. 36 million in Ratmalana, alleged to have been purchased by Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala reprimanded the FCID for failing to arrest real culprits involved in the incident.
The FCID conducting investigation into an incident where a property had been purchased by Rajapaksa under his grandmothers name for Rs. 24 million, complained to Court that Forrest did not appear before the FCID on six occasions and further sought a Court order directing her to be appear before FCID today.
However, the FCID informed Court that they have already concluded investigation into the incident and expected to refer the investigation reports to the Attorney General for his advice.
The Additional Magistrate observed that the investigation conducted by FCID failed to arrest any other person or name as suspects other than an elderly woman who could be a witness in the case. The Additional Magistrate reprimanded the FCID, stating that it is obvious that Forrest had been used by someone else in this transaction and she may be a witness in the case.
The Additional Magistrate further observed that there was a possibility of releasing the suspect from the case owing to shortcomings of investigations if the FCID acted in an irresponsible manner. Forrest was ordered to be released on cash bail of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of Rs. 1.5 million.
Meanwhile, Court refused to accept Rajapaksa, the second son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a surety.
The Additional Magistrate observed that when perusing the documents before Courts, Rajapaksa could be considered as one of the persons responsible for the alleged offence.
The suspect was released on bail after being appeared before Court through a motion.
Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the suspect.

APM Terminals Mumbai embraces DPD service
Indias container terminal APM Terminals Mumbai has accepted the Direct Port Delivery service initiated by the Indian government as part of its Ease of Doing Business Program to enhance the countrys access to the global logistics chain.
In the past, import containers were sent to Container Freight Stations (CFS) 1-1.5 days after arriving by vessel. Depending on the completion of import procedures and clearances with shipping lines, custom house agents, Customs, consignees and CFS operators, the cargo was then delivered to the end user after an average dwell time of 9- 10 days.
APM Terminals said that with DPD, these can be bypassed through a streamlined procedure, allowing import containers to be delivered directly from the port with an average dwell time of only 1.5 days.
We are committed to support Ease of Doing Business initiative the Government of India has championed. We were among the first terminal operators in India to offer Direct Port Delivery service in 2006 and since then have continued to support the reforms and initiatives of the Indian Ministry of Shipping and JNP, as well as the Jawaharlal Nehru Customs House, APM Terminals Mumbai CEO Kamal Jain, said.
Containerized trade has expanded at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% percent over the past ten years in India, and is projected to continue growing at a similar pace as India undertakes infrastructure expansion projects.
Jawaharlal Nehru Port, serving Mumbai, is Indias busiest container port, accounting for 44% of the countrys containerized cargo traffic of 10 million TEUs in 2015.
APM Terminals Mumbais 2015 container throughput was 1.9 million TEUs.

BMW has told the BBC that it is absolutely committed to a new plant in Mexico despite Donald Trump's hostility to imported cars.
The president-elect has threatened to impose a border tax on firms that make cars in Mexico for the US market.BMW is spending $1bn on a plant in Mexico, while other firms are investing in the US or moving production back.
On Sunday Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced a $1bn (816m) plan to produce three Jeep models in the US.FCA will also move the production of a Ram pickup truck from Mexico to the US.Last week Trump criticised General Motors for building cars in Mexico for the US market. General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers tax-free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax! he tweeted.BMW sales and marketing director Ian Robertson told the BBC that the firm was absolutely committed its new plant in San Luis Potosi, which will make its 3 Series cars for sale across North America.
He added that the company was investing $1bn in its plant in South Carolina and pointed out that BMW was the biggest exporter of cars, in terms of value, from the US.

Boring roll of grief : Collateral Beauty
The thing with films that are seemingly brainless and breezy is that we dont expect much of craft or technical excellence from them. Or a real story.
Its only a problem when they start taking themselves too seriously and try to add more weight with terms such as Butterfly Effect or (in this case) Collateral Beauty; we realise a good 120 minutes of our lives are wasted.
Struggling actors
So Will Smith is Howard, a New York-based ad agency executive; his business partner is Whit (Edward Norton) and their senior employees are Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Pea). They all happen to be good friends as well, up until Howard loses his daughter of six years to cancer (this is known about 10 minutes into the film). What we get for the rest of the film is a visibly pissed Howard who refuses to communicate with anyone and instead decides to write letters (actual physical letters) to Time, Love and Death.
So heres a question: what would you do to make a friend like this get back on track If your answer is to steal those letters, read them and get three struggling actors to personify those concepts and confront him, then have someone clandestinely record those meetings, digitally erase the actors and play the videos to your company board to prove that the man is insane, so that he isnt in charge of taking important decisions anymore ... Collateral Beauty shouldnt bother you at all.
Best solution
The movie tries to show how most of the cast are coping with some form of loss, and how talking it out is undoubtedly the best solution. But with such a lazy screenplay (rejected footage from Planet Earth II would be more interesting) and the actors (save for Smith, perhaps) giving as much effort as football players would during practice sessions, there really is nothing much to root for. Id rather have streamed something like Love, Actually again to pass time.

Factories should be set up in Hambantota

Massive destruction prevented due to PM meeting the Sangha

The setting up of factories in Hambantota with foreign investment with the mediation of the government is commendable, former Speaker and Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Chamal Rajapaksa said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the debate following the special statement made by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena.
Rajapaksa said the harbour was constructed not to keep it without setting up factories.
The factories should be set up in Hambantota and it is beneficial for the country, Rajapaksa said. But they should be brought in a manner that would not be harmful to the country and it should be decided by way of discussions.
He said that land has already been acquired for the industrial zones in Hambantota.
Rajapaksa said if there is a need for more land, they should be acquired from suitable places. He added that there are lands in Monaragala, Matara and Embilipitiya.
However an agreement was entered into with China Harbour Company in 2014 which granted lands to them only for the operation, Rajapaksa said. I can submit it to you for your information.
He said Oppositions in a democratic country always stage some kind of protest against whatever move taken by a government whether it is constructive or not.
The people had a suspicion over the statements of taking over 15,000 acres, frame work agreement and 99 year agreement with the China Merchant Company, Rajapaksa said. However since the Premier met the Tissamahararama Nayaka Thera, a massive destruction was prevented.
It was laudable that he met the Maha Sanga. But it did not clear the peoples suspicion. That is why the people decided to stage a peaceful protest.
He said the theras who went there from Colombo were assaulted.
If you see the videos on a private television channel you could see who had stones and poles in their hands, Rajapaksa said. They were assaulted in the presence of the Police. The former Speaker added that the people from Colombo had been taken to the Hambantota conference hall and the following day, assaulted the protestors under the influence of liquor.
He said he hoped the Prime Minister would look into this matter.

Cibulkova,  Wozniacki  win in Sydney
Sydney: Slovakia's world number six Dominika Cibulkova dropped just two games in blistering heat to win her opening match at the Sydney International on Monday.
The diminutive Cibulkova, who upset world number one Angelique Kerber to win the WTA finals in Singapore last October, swept past Germany's world number 31 Laura Siegemund 6-2, 6-0. Cibulkova, who lost to China's Li Na in the 2014 Australian Open final, will next play Canadian wild card Eugenie Bouchard in the second round of the WTA lead-in tournament to next week's Australian Open.
When you start a season, you always start with some confidence, not doubt, but you always need to get into this match rhythm, said Cibulkova.
It's not easy if I would expect myself to play like I did in the (WTA) final against Kerber, I think that would be too much expectation.
Cibulkova, who lost to Agnieszka Radwanska in the Sydney final four years ago, was knocked out in the quarter-finals of last week's Brisbane International by France's Alize Cornet in straight sets. Kerber and Radwanska, the top two seeds, have a bye into the second round at Sydney. Former world number one and seventh seed Caroline Wozniacki dumped Olympic champion and last year's finalist Monica Puig out of the tournament 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
Puig, who lost to Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova in last year's final, had 12 break point opportunities but could only convert three, while Wozniacki put away three of four break points.
British sixth seed Johanna Konta was too strong for Australian Arina Rodionova 6-3, 6-4 and fellow Australian Samantha Stosur again bombed out in the first round, going out 6-3, 6-1 to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. AFP

Commercial Mediation from Ceylon Chamber of Commerce
The introduction of Commercial Mediation will offer Sri Lankas business community an optional dispute resolution mechanism in addition to litigation and Arbitration, both of which are riddled with delay and expense.
Mediation, if practiced in strict compliance with its intrinsic principles offers a process that will hopefully be devoid of those evils, said Dhara Wijayatilake, CEO of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
She made this observation, at a preliminary briefing convened by the CCC during last week to discuss the steps that are required to be taken to provide Mediation services for commercial dispute resolution in terms of the Commercial Mediation Centre of Sri Lanka Act No. 44 of 2000 as amended by Act No. 37 of 2005.
The briefing was attended by members appointed to the Board of Management of the Centre by the Minister of Justice on the nomination of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), the National Chamber of Commerce (NCC), the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FCCISL) and the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) and other representatives from private sector Companies. Representatives of The Asia Foundation (TAF) which has provided assistance for the Community Mediation programme of the Ministry of Justice from its inception in 1990, was also present at the briefing and provided technical support.
Wijayatilake observed that if Sri Lanka is serious about inspiring investor confidence, there was a need to look at alternative dispute resolution methods that are more efficient and effective than the adversarial process available through litigation.
The business community looks for processes that have the potential to deliver on both of those features, ie. effectiveness and efficiency.
Dinesha Wickremanayke, resident representative, TAF spoke of the importance of training for Mediators and highlighted the assistance given to the Ministry of Justice to train Mediators for community mediation as well as for the special land mediations conducted in the North.
Speaking on the current status of community mediation in Sri Lanka, Ramani Jayasundere, Senior Technical Advisor of TAF explained that the Mediation Boards function in every Divisional Secretarys division in the Island to resolve community disputes. She presented statistics that pointed to a greater use of the community Mediation Boards for the resolution of money matters after the increase of the monetary threshold which required that disputes upto Rs. 500,000 in value, must mandatorily be referred to these Boards before action could be filed in a court of law.
The Board of Management of the Centre also includes a nominee of the Minister of Justice and a nominee of the Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The members also discussed the several steps that the Board would need to pursue to offer Mediation services to the private sector and noted that training of Mediators would be an essential step and that the four Chambers would have to ensure collectively that Mediation services are sustained, if successful.

Deshapriya laments  delay in LG poll
The Elections Commissioner yesterday said the continued delay in holding the Local Government elections was harmful for democracy and detrimental to the universal franchise of the people.
Independent Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, however, added that it was not in his power to call for elections and that such power solely rested in the hands of the minister in charge. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris paid a visit to the Elections Commission yesterday morning to insist that the Local Government elections be held soon.
Deshapriya informed Prof Peiris that he did not have the authority to push for such action.
Prof. Peiris asked me what use was the Elections Commission if I could not call for early elections but we have not been vested with such powers, Deshapriya said.
The powers to call for elections rests with Parliament and Parliament has in turned vested it in the minister in charge. Just because we have an Elections Commission, it does not mean we have been given these powers. No country has done that. The establishment of an Independent Commission does not guarantee us such powers, he added.
The Elections Commission hopes that this election would be held soon and the peoples universal franchise is protected.All parties want the local government elections to be held soon, Deshapriya said.

EDB impetus for product, tech upgrade for the export sector
The export sector of Sri Lanka which contributes nearly 20% to the countrys GDP, plays a vital role in achieving the development objectives of the government in terms of, employment generation poverty alleviation and enhancing foreign exchange earnings.
The Government is pursuing an outward looking economic policy and is taking measures to integrate with the rest of the world to connect and compete to reach wider market access through deepening the existing FTAs with India and Pakistan, working on new trade agreements with Asian economies like China and Singapore and possible preferential trade agreements with Thailand, Malaysia and Turkey. All the above and the restoration of GSP+ in the year 2017 and initiatives to boost trade with USA will open up new opportunities for the export sector.
All these measures will create opportunities for high tech products to be exported to the world. Moving into high tech products will provide considerable thrust in achieving product and market diversification simultaneously and thus reduce the vulnerabilities associated with dependency on a few products and markets.
Sri Lankas exports are basically composed of primary goods with relatively low technological sophistication compared to those of most emerging market economies which have successfully achieved high economic growth through the adoption of technology oriented policies.
Majority of exporters, especially the SME category pays less attention to improve and upgrade the quality of their products on a regular basis. Limited awareness, constraints in accessing technology, high financial cost involved in effectively adopting of new technology, lack of trained human resources at enterprises level and lack of motivation to adopt new technology have weakened the technological capabilities of most exporters.
The net effect of these factors is lack of innovativeness and hence low productivity and low competitiveness in the international market.
Therefore, upgrading production processes and capacity building of export enterprises is vital at this juncture to place Sri Lankas exports on a more technology driven path if the country is to enhance competitiveness in the global market and achieve export targets, through enhanced market access.
The EDB has initiated a number of programmes to encourage manufacturers/producers of value added products to upgrade product quality, technology and sustainability of productive processes in this regard.
Some such initiatives are:
System Development Programme for the Rubber and Plastic Industry to obtain-ISO 14001 and ISO 50001
The Rubber Products Industry is a key industry contributing 7.6 % to exports in 2015. Sri Lanka produces a wide variety of rubber products and the major markets are USA, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Canada, UK, and Brazil.
Sri Lanka supplies to major international brands such as Continental, Solideal, Wonder Grip, Mapa, Safety work etc. Companies in the rubber industry use state of the art technologies for manufacturing the above international brands. Plastic industry although not a major export sector at present has the potential to grow in the future.
Currently, companies have access to overseas markets for polythene bags including door knob bags, shirt bags, and food wrap bags. In addition, many plastic processors supply packaging accessories such as hangers, buttons for garments, and packaging for tea, spices, processed foods and perishables.
The energy consumption in the manufacturing process is high in both industries compared to other industries and also having significant environmental issues in the manufacturing process. Considering the global requirement for sustainable and environmental friendly production and also to be competitive in the international market obtaining ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 is considered vital and important.
In order to address the above, EDB has commenced the implementation of a System Development Programme for a selected group of companies of the rubber and plastic sectors by obtaining services of a professional organization. The programme will include awareness seminars, preliminary audits, capacity building programmes to train consultants, consultancy on systems development, energy reviews with complete evaluation of energy flow, internal auditor training and mock auditing etc. to enable companies to obtain ISO 14001/ISO 50001.
The main objective of implementing this programme is to introduce and establish manufacturing excellence practices in order to improve sustainability and the resource efficiency resulting in substantial cost reduction to enhance the competitiveness of their products in the international market.
Product Development Programme on Shoe Engineering for Manufacturers and Exporters of Footwear - To Develop a Technically Specified and Improved Product Line to Suit the International Market.
The footwear and leather sector has been identified as a potential sector by way of creating employment opportunities and earning and saving foreign exchange earnings.
Since the local market is limited, exports are essential for the sustainability of the industry. This industry clearly has a significant potential for being a key contributor to the economy of the country, if empowered by appropriate support and guidance.
Inferior quality of shoes is one of the major barriers to promote Sri Lankan products in the international market. The main reason for this is the lack of knowledge of the Sri Lankan manufacturers on shoe engineering and shoe designing mainly due to the non availability of a proper mechanism and or institutions to provide appropriate knowledge to local manufacturers. Therefore, strategies have to be developed to provide this knowledge to the industry, which is vital in improving the quality of the product to international standards.
Taking into consideration the above the EDB has embarked on a product development programme to enhance the product quality of a selected group of footwear manufacturers /exporters by providing experts knowledge on shoe technology, targeting the international market, especially EU, UK and USA.
The programme will be implemented in two stages. During the stage I, the experts will work with the selected companies to provide knowhow on shoe engineering with suggestions to improve/upgrade Products and Production Process. The Stage II of the programme will be implemented after 3 months of the completion of stage I to provide further advice to develop a technically specified and improved product line to suit the international market and advise the participants in solving problems which they may encounter in implementing suggested modifications to meet the international standards in their products.
Technology Upgradation Programme for the SME Apparel Sector
The export oriented apparel industry plays a vital role as a key driver of the national economy and has grown to be the most significant contributor to the countrys economy over the decades. In order to maintain the sustainability of the industry it is vital that the SME companies are supported and be developed.
The EDB has taken steps to facilitate small & medium scale manufacturers/exporters in the apparel sector to obtain international compliance certification envisaging the GSP plus concession to be granted to Sri Lanka by early next year and thereby to be export ready.
The Sri Lankan exporters are required to adhere to various stringent requirements as specified by the buyers of these major international brands. Each buyer has established a set of standards to be fulfilled by each supplier which includes specifications appropriate to the industry and countries manufacturing the products.
Therefore, it is vital that the apparel factories obtain international certification such as SEDEX, BSCI, WRAP etc to be eligible to supply to these buyers.
Although large companies are able to invest in obtaining these certifications, this has become a difficult exercise for the SME exporters in view of the costs involved in upgrading the factories as required by compliance audits in obtaining international certifications. A compliance audit is a comprehensive review of an organizations adherence to regulatory guidelines.
Many SMEs have failed to secure orders from international buyers due to their inability to obtain international certifications. Some SME companies have completed compliance audits but are unable to invest on the requirements stipulated by the compliance auditors in view of financial constraints.
Therefore, it is essential for the SME companies to upgrade their production facilities and obtain relevant international certifications to gain confidence and build long term business relationships with their buyers.
Against this background, EDB implemented a programme in the year 2016 to facilitate 7 - 8 SME apparel companies to upgrade their production facilitate and obtain relevant international certifications to gain confidence and build up long term business relationships with buyers.
Development and Promotion of Green Products - Technology Upgradation and Capacity Development for Companies Manufacturing Red Clay Roof Tile Products
The world at present is speedily growing more fond of environment friendly and people are health conscious. Therefore, the consumer preference has shifted to eco-friendly and healthy products. This increasing demand for eco friendly products and health consciousness of consumers have opened up new opportunities for the clay tile industry as other alternative products in the market are not in a position to meet these parameters.
Clay tile is eco-friendly and associated with an aesthetic value which improves appearance and add value to buildings especially residential and recreational. Also, because of absorption of heat, it provides a cooling effect naturally which is environmental friendly and lower the energy consumption. Heritage related reason is another factor for the increased demand for clay tiles. Houses are built on architectural structures depicting different eras where clay tiles plays a major role, mainly in European countries such as Belgium, UK, Poland, Netherlands and Italy. As usage of Asbestos is banned in many countries, there is a demand for clay roof tile. Therefore, it is timely for the roof tile industry to make use of the opportunities rising from the developments taking place both in domestic and international markets.
Sri Lankas Red Clay roof tile industry has been existing for many centuries with little change in technology. A thriving industry in mid-nineties, with more than 500 roof tile factories operating profitably. However, around 300 factories have been closed down and the factories that are presently in operation are facing problems due to competition from asbestos and metal roof sheets, use of traditional technology and lack of institutional support for the advancement of existing technology.
The main raw material (clay) is available in Sri Lanka.The only clay roof tile exporting company Samson Rajarata Tiles based in Anuradhapura uses silt of the reservoirs as their raw material to manufacture clay roof tile.
In order for the industry to be sustainable, it has to move into manufacturing of innovative products and adapt their products to suit the export market.
Although the sub sectors of the Ceramic industry i.e. ceramic tile, tableware and ornamental ware have developed to a high tech industry over a period of 25-30 years, the roof tile industry has remained with the traditional/ primitive technology. Using of this outdated inefficient technology has lead to low productivity, low quality and high cost of production.
Given the opportunities that exist in the international market, the EDB together with the Sri Lanka Ceramic and Glass Council and CENTEC is working closely with the Red Clay, Roof Tile industry to upgrade the production process especially, and the quality of the product to make the industry export ready.
As the initial step EDB will facilitate a few red clay roof tile manufacturers to upgrade their production process firing and drying in the year 2017 by way of assisting them to purchase High tech machinery.

Expressway  development  will lead to  large-scale  economic growth
Nihal Sooriyarachchi has been Chairman of the Road Development Authority for 13 months, and he is overseeing the ongoing Central Expressway project. While some claim that the project is taking too long and becoming too expensive, Sooriyarachchi argued that the highway is progressing on schedule in a cost-effective manner. He is also confident that continued expressway development will lead to large-scale economic growth for Sri Lanka while also relieving traffic in major metropolitan areas.
Excerpts follow:
Q: What is the progress on the Central Expressway project going How far has it proceeded
A: The Central Expressway project is going on in four phases. Section one runs from Kadawatha to Mirigama, section two is from Mirigama to Kurunegala. Section three splits off midway from section two, and goes from Pothuhara, which is before Kurunegala, towards Kandy and to Galagedara, a few kilometers away from Kandy town. And then section four is from Kurunegala to Dambulla. We are currently doing feasibility studies on the stretch from Galagedara to Kandy because it is a very mountainous area. There will be a lot of tunnels. We are looking at the economic as well as the technical feasibility of this stretch. When we do this road, we think that it will decrease the traffic congestion in Kandy, which is currently very bad. Too many vehicles currently have to pass through Kandy town, but when the expressway is done, there will be alternate routes available.
Nihal Sooriyarachchi
Q: Who is building the section with the tunnels
A: Section three is earmarked for Japanese companies, because the terrain is very difficult to manage. There will be long tunnels and high viaducts.
Q: Why is the project split into four parts
A: We have divided this into affordable sizes so that we could complete the project between two and half and three years. If this is given to one whole contractor, it would be a huge contract sum and a massive project. To avoid that, and to complete the project in a timely manner, we had to split it up.
Q: And how is the central expressway project being financed
A: We have signed an agreement with the Chinese EXIM Bank for section one, and this stretch will be built by the MCC, the Metallurgical Corporation of China. We have given section two to our own contractors, which will be the first time in Sri Lanka's history that local contractors build a highway here. We have divided that portion of about 40 kilometers into four sections, and we have had expressions of interest from local contractors who are capable of building the highway and who are doing the subcontracting for foreign companies. We along with the relevant ministers, the Prime Minister, as well as other government officials thought that we should assess the capabilities of local contractors so that they can go out and do other projects. We have also selected a local consultancy firm. We identified the capable consulting firms in Sri Lanka, and we have followed the proposals to amalgamate these Sri Lankan companies and form a joint venture consortium. The financial arrangements for section two are currently being drawn up, but local banks will finance it. With regard to section four, we are evaluating a proposal from a Chinese contractor with the assistance of Chinese EXIM Bank. Those are on a proposal basis now. And the Kandy leg will be handled by the Japanese Mitsubishi Company. We are still evaluating the proposals made by Japanese contractors.
Q: What are the main challenges of building this highway
A: Funding is always a challenge with these large projects. Then figuring out how to maximise the use of resources is important. We also have to be mindful of the social impacts of highway construction. We have done Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for sections one, two, and four which have come back very positive. They are approved. For the third section, we have come to the final stages, and we might get the approval today or tomorrow. That is for section three. Arranging the soil extraction and removal sites was very difficult, but we have managed so far. Land acquisition, not only with respect to the Central Expressway, is complicated and ongoing. We have to deal with human thinking and human lives, because many have ancestral properties that they do not want to give up. So, that is a challenge.
Q: Have you figured out how to minimise the environmental impact of this project
A: We are building in some flood-prone areas, and we are using viaducts to minimise the impacts of our digging. We have avoided embankment filling in flood-prone areas. In this development we have no choice but to disturb the environment.
When building the Southern Expressway, we had to disturb the Dandeniya Aparekka Forest Reserve. We promised to plant 100 trees for every single tree we removed to make up for cutting some of the forest. That was a mandate given to us, and we agreed and have taken action to do that. We want to do the same thing with the Central Expressway.
Q: Please explain the mechanism for land acquisition.
A: We are going under the Special Provisions made under the Land Acquisition Act. When we identified the route and mapped out the ROW (right of way) measurements, then we marked the route on the ground and identified the blocks which would be affected by construction. Then, with the help of surveyors, we surveyed and got the details of the acquisition that needed to be done. People make objections to the land acquisition procedures, but most people, between 90 and 95 percent, are satisfied with the compensation package we are offering. The Lands Director is finally responsible for the acquisition.
Q: Can you tell me about the maintenance and tolls What will that money be used for
A: During the operations, we keep some toll money to pay salaries and for future maintenance.
Q: Are the rumours that costs keep going up true
A: We have done a lot of analysis on this question. Now, people say that costs have risen per kilometer. But that is not the way to assess cost increases. What we have done is we have identified the major construction items we will be using, concrete and steel, things like that. And we have to compare the cost of those individual items. One can say that from A to B, the cost was this much per kilometer. But recently, even with respect to the Central Expressway, we had to raise route heights due to the recent flood in 2015. In some places, it was raised by as much as four meters. The average increase was 1.5 meters. Now, for that, if you want pillars to support the roadway, you have to increase the height of the pillars. If you want to increase the height on embankments, you have to enhance the quantity of filling. The best and most sensible comparison will look at the rates from that period and this period for the newer, safer plans. The higher pillars and embankments would have been more expensive a year or two ago. When we compare it this way, costs have decreased by about 30 percent. But we have to apportion about 8 percent decrease to the fall of costs on the world market. But, if you want to say that costs have increased per kilometer, you can say that. But it is not the best way to measure projects like this.
Q: Can you discuss the long-term overall highway and expressway plan in the country
A: Yes. We have to build highways to Jaffna, Trincomalee, and to Batticaloa via Polonnaruwa, which will all branch off from the Central Expressway. We are just building the first stage of the Central Expressway now, but it will be extended. We have four phases so far, but the fifth will be to Jaffna via Anuradhapura, the sixth is to Trincomalee, and the seventh is towards Batticaloa via Polonnaruwa. Then we have identified a road called Ruwanpura Expressway, which will stretch from the Kahatuduwa exit on the Southern Expressway to Ratnapura via Ingiriya. Then it will go from Ratnapura to Palmadulla. This project has not yet started, but we have done the design and marked the road. We are taking action to do acquisition for the first leg up to Ingiriya. We have expressed that we want to build an expressway towards Uva, to Badulla, and we are doing feasibility studies to determine whether to extend the Ratnapura highway to that area or to extend the Southern Expressway. Currently, that road is in operation up to Matara, but we want to extend it to Hambantota. Work is progressing on this section, though there were delays due to land acquisition. But we are sure that we can start work by mid-2019 up to Hambantota, and that extension would go to Mattala airport and the harbour. If the government plans to develop Hambantota, we need a workforce, and the best workforce available for that area is from Uva. We are doing the feasibility of extending the Southern Expressway to Badulla, and we are doing a comparison between doing that and or extending the Ruwanpura Expressway. I think it is more likely that we extend from the Southern Expressway because of the need for a workforce.
RDA Chairman Sorriyarachchi exchanging a contract agreement with representatives of Maga Engineering.
Q: Are there plans to connect the Southern Expressway to the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway
A: Yes, it is being done. We call this the Outer Circular Highway. There are only about nine kilometers to be done, and it has started with Chinese EXIM Bank funding. It has to be completed by 2019. 2019 is a big year for us, and we need to get public support for our projects. We had a meeting yesterday with our Minister Lakshman Kiriella, who is giving us a lot of support. When we are stuck, he intervenes on our behalf, as are the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister. All are supporting us because they know that big infrastructure development is crucial. And we are encouraging business leaders to position their industries near the exits of our highways because that will allow them to benefit. We are looking to have industrial parks near the expressway exits. We hope that we can meet the many challenges we are facing.

Fuel prices hit 18-month high, after Opec production cuts
The price of petrol and diesel in the UK has risen to its highest since July 2015, following a three-pence-a-litre increase in December alone.
The average cost of unleaded petrol hit 117.23p at the end of the month, with diesel reaching 119.63p, the RAC said.
The wholesale price of both fuels has risen significantly, following the production cuts announced by Opec.
Brent crude jumped by 10% on 30 November, the day the cartel announced a cut of 1.2 million barrels a day.
As a result, the oil price is now double what it was a year ago, rising from a low of $27.88 in January 2016 to more than $55 this month. The fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote has also increased UK fuel prices, as oil is priced in dollars.
Production cuts
Over the next two weeks, the RAC expects the price of unleaded to rise to 118p, with diesel going up to 121p a litre.
Thereafter, the price will be mostly determined by the cost of oil and whether Russia in particular will adhere to the production cuts it agreed with Opec.
It promised to cut 600,000 barrels a day from January, but in the past it has been reluctant to co-operate with such deals.

So far the price rises weve seen are purely down to the announcement at the end of November that Opec and non-Opec countries would be cutting oil production this month, said Simon Williams, a fuel spokesperson for the RAC.
Everything now depends on the strength of the deal and each country sticking to the agreed production levels. Russia will be of particular interest as it is currently producing at near record levels.
Over the next few months, the price of fuel will also be determined by political events, such as policies introduced by President Donald Trump, and the success of Brexit negotiations, which are due to begin in March.
Both could affect the value of sterling against the dollar.
Some experts believe the price of oil could also rise to $60 a barrel or more later this year.

GMOA demands doctors transfer system be implemented
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will be forced to take trade union action if the Health Ministry does not take immediate action to implement the doctors transfers and transfer system. The transfer list for 2017 is still not ready, (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Transfers granted since 2012 are held up due to the non-implementation. Some state hospitals face the danger of closure due to the non-implementation of doctors transfers as directed by the Public Service Commission and the Health Ministry Secretary, he said at a press conference held at the GMOA Head Office, Colombo.
According to Dr. Zoysa, hospital directors of some state hospitals ignore and overlook the directives issued to them by the Public Service Commission and the Health Ministry Secretary. Action should be taken against them according to the Establishment Code as stated by the Health Ministry Secretary, he said.
The Directors who implement the orders of the Commission and the Health Secretary are now in trouble because they do not get doctors for their hospitals once they implement and transfer doctors attached to their hospitals, Soyza said.
The Hospital Directors who obey the rules and regulations and follow the orders of the Commission and the Health Secretarys orders get into trouble and face various difficulties, he said.
The GMOA is now in the process of collecting details of the Hospital Directors who do not implement the orders given to them by the Public Service Commission and the Health Ministry Secretary.
The details will be handed over to the authorities soon, he added.

GMOA intervention delays 2017 doctor  transfer list: Health Ministry
The Health Ministry is unable to release the list of doctor transfers for 2017 due the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) intervention, Health Ministry sources said. According to the sources, the ministry requested the GMOA to post doctors in order to re-open 40 rural and peripheral state hospitals closed down due to lack of doctors, but the GMOA is not responding to the request, the sources said. The real reason for the shortage of doctors at some state hospitals is lack of new doctors, and they are undergoing training now. The ministry will recruit more new doctors in future, the sources added.

Iran Air finalizes airbus order
Agreement has been reached between Iran Air and Airbus over a firm order for 100 aircraft.
The deal includes 46 A320 Family, 38 A330 Family and 16 A350 jets and follows an initial commitment signed last January.
Iran Air considers this agreement an important step towards a stronger international presence in civil aviation. We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration, said Farhad Parvaresh, Iran Air Chairman and CEO.
The Tehran-based airlines initial commitment also included a requirement for 12 A380s, but the super jumbo has been axed from the final deal.
Fabrice Bregier, Airbus President and CEO, said, This is a landmark agreement not only because it paves the way for Iran Airs fleet renewal. Our overall accord includes pilot training, airport operations and air traffic management so this agreement is also a significant first step in the overall modernisation of Irans commercial aviation sector.
The European manufacturer says the agreement is subject to US Government Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) export licences, required for products containing 10% or more US technology content, which were granted in September and November 2016.

It took five years to make Sing
Director Garth Jennings already has a very energetic personality, but having spent five years developing and making the animated movie Sing, he admits hes now just a big ball of nerves leading up to its December 21 release.
Its been very emotional, actually, and I dont use that word lightly, Jennings recently told Business Insider about showing the movie to preview audiences for the last month.
Known for his music video work in the 1990s, he took on directing the adaptation of a book regarded in the industry as an unmakeable movie, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy in 2005, which ended up being a critical dud (though it earned over $100 million at the global box office). Jennings rebounded with the inventive indie Son of Rambow in 2007, about two boys obsessed with the first Rambo movie. Since then, hes been trying to develop an animated movie.
But having never made an animated movie, Jennings was a little naive on how its done.
So five years ago Jennings had a meeting with producer Chris Meledandri, the man behind the Despicable Me movies and this years animated hit The Secret Life of Pets, and by the time it ended Jennings agreed to make Meledandris next movie.
Chris just started talking about his thoughts and they just smashed together with my sensibility and my hopes and dreams for making an animated film, Jennings said.
The idea Meledandri had was for a movie about a shifty theater owner whose only way to save his business is to put on a singing competition to give notice to an unknown talent. And seeing as this was an animated kids movie, it would be filled with pop songs and all the characters would be animals. Business Insider

JVP lashes out  at Govt. over  Hambantota clash
The Janatha Vimukthi Preramuna (JVP) yesterday said what happened in Hambanthota on Saturday mirrored intensification of mass suppression.
The Peramunas Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said just as the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime used aggressive repression against the people during its administration, using force, arrest and detention, the present Maithripala-Ranil government too is using repressive action against the public.
Herath was speaking at a press conference at the JVP head office in Battaramulla where the JVP higher-ups criticised the government for the situation that in Hambantota on Saturday where at least 21 persons were injured during a protest.
The JVP was categorical in stating that the incident was the result of the government using brutal force to suppress the voice of the people who had taken to the streets to prevent their lands being seized by the government against their will and leased out to a Chinese company to set up an industrial zone.
Herath said: Our country should have more industries, there is no question about that, but there is no point in setting up industries at the cost of people losing their ancestral lands in Hambantota. The government is wielding a heavy hand on national lands, and trying to forcibly acquire these lands. We will not let that happen.
The government is trying to gain an advantage over their ineptitude of governance by selling the peoples lands for a song to foreign companies so that they may survive yet another day in the government, he said.
The JVP is demanded that the government stop forcible acquisition of peoples lands in Hambantota and also wrap up their plans to sell the Hambantota harbour.
He said a group of bankrupt politicians are igniting the situation on behalf of the government to pave their way into political office. We will not let that happen, Herath said .

All signs point to Katy Perry releasing new music this quarter. The Rise hitmaker has been trolling/updating fans via social media with snippets of new music, progress reports and now references to a lead single and video. She also had a brief bout of leaky laptop syndrome (a demo called Witness has been doing the rounds since June), which is a sure sign that somethings coming. Oh, and Katy Cats are convinced that their queen is about to drop a surprise album after a mysterious Hits Daily Double post heralding the return of a star.
As for Katys new direction Expect the unexpected. Im working with a lot of unexpected writers and producers and  thats bringing out a lot of different things sonically, she told InStyle in September. Even when I was working with my go-to producers, Id always push them to play me a beat that was reserved for Three 6 Mafia or something like that. Not that shes about to drop a rap record. I know exactly how to write a lyric over that because my strengths are melody and lyrics. Im putting myself in unexpected situations and that is breeding a lot of new color. Im very ready.

LOLC aims to plant 2,000 trees in 2017 and hopes to continue with its tree planting effort annually to enhance the forest cover, island wide. In doing so, LOLC also hopes to reward and recognize the Group companies and staff members who are committed to this campaign over a period of time.

Maradona backs 48-team World Cup  ahead of crunch FIFA meeting
Zurich: Diego Maradona on Monday backed controversial plans to expand the World Cup to 48 teams, a day before world football's powerful governing council faces a key decision on the issue.
"It sounds like a fantastic idea to me," the 56-year-old, who inspired Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986, told reporters at FIFA's Zurich headquarters.
"This will give more possibilities to countries that have never reached that level of competition."
FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who took charge of the scandal-tainted world body last year, has made expanding the World Cup from the current 32 teams the centrepiece of his administration.
But his plans have faced criticism including warnings that it will dilute the quality at football's showcase event.
"The quality will not fall," said Maradona, dripping with sweat after rumbling his way through a mini tournament of former football greats and current executives. Infantino has been courting support from the game's most powerful figures ahead of Tuesday's meeting.
Among those playing on the snow-lined pitch Monday was UEFA boss Aleksander Ceferin, who has voiced scepticism towards expansion, and CONCACAF chief Victor Montagliani, who is open to a bigger tournament.
Former French international David Trezeguet said more World Cup berths could give "possibilities to countries and especially players who have never experienced this beautiful competition", while acknowledging that details still needed to be worked out. Among the major concerns from critics is that a longer tournament would increase pressure on an already strained club schedule.
The influential European Clubs Association, led by German great Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, has come out against an enlarged World cup, citing football's overloaded calendar.
Infantino says that money should not drive any decision, but a confidential FIFA report seen by AFP projects that a 48-team tournament would bring a cash boost of $640 million (605 million euros) above projected revenues for next year's finals in Russia. The influential council will review five proposals on Tuesday: leaving the World Cup unchanged at 32 teams, two proposals for a 40-team competition and two 48-team scenarios.
Infantino is said to be backing a 48-team option with 16 groups of three, which would come into effect for the 2026 competition. Any decision made Tuesday will have to be approved by FIFA's full 211 members at the body's next congress. AFP

The park premises are owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the renovated park was handed over to the Ports Authority for future management and maintenance.
The MCUDP has identified the importance of opening up Beira Lake as a showpiece and a scenic water front area for recreation.
Accordingly, the park is the first of the central parks around Beira.

The Park layout incorporates the three lock gates which connects to the Colombo Harbour, a marine museum, restoration of the historic artifacts situated within, and site-specific landscaping. The park also provides a shady resting place including restaurants, sanitary facilities, and parking for the general public.

No amount of protests can topple the government: Rajitha
The Joint opposition will not be able to topple this Government despite staging protests, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the Ruhunu Development Zone commenced last Saturday. The Hambantota harbour has no ships as there is no oil storage facility. The previous regime had spent a colossal amount to construct this harbour. Annually the Government pays Rs. 9,500 million as interest for the loan. The income of this harbour is only Rs. 200 million, he said after launching the Happy Villages programme at Halkandawila, Beruwala.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that although international waters are just 12 km away from the Hambantota harbour no ships come into the harbour due to the lack of facilities. The company which constructed the harbour says they had bid for US$ 1,100. More than this had been spent to construct the harbour and someone had pocketed Rs. 50 billion.
The previous regime spent a huge sum to construct the Mattala airport, no income is being generated. It is but a white elephant. The former President said there will be an environmental disaster if oil storages are constructed at Hambantota. it is an utter lie. He did not construct it because of a transaction issue. He tried to form a military government but the Attorney General opposed it. This government will turn the country in the right direction before handing it over, he added.

This is the concluding episode of a script for a teledrama sitcom. The cast includes a family, the father, a leading Colombo lawyer Vijay Gansabhapathi PC, the mother Vimala, a housewife, and son Harin, a university student. A busybody next door neighbour, Rasawathie Ginipella. The Ginipella husband (not in the cast but is often referred to) and wife are portrayed as political opportunists, who sway with any favourable gust of political wind. A smaller cameo role is intended for a Mrs Gutiweera, a battered opposition activist seeking legal help from Mr. Gansabhapathi following a beating.
Continued from last Tuesday
Script: By Gaston de Rosayro
Concluding the continued sitcom
Rasawathie: I am only begging of you all not to tell Maraman what I said and did. You know what that rascal can do especially if he knows that I went against him. But he can be a useful bugger when it comes to helping you make money and giving political protection. You dont worry Guti, I will get him to pay you top damages.
Gutiweera: But Rasawathie, you promised. You promised that you will help me file a case and get that man jailed. Now you are saying just the opposite and running off to entertain the man who you said didnt raise a finger to help your husband. What you really wanted was not to help me but to take revenge on Maraman for not using his influence to give your husband a top state posting.
Rasawathie: Sorry, Gutiweera. No use in explaining to you. You cant understand. He is coming to say he is sorry and to offer Gini something very big. Sure, must be Ambassadors job or something like that. I can feel it. I can feel it in my heart.
Gutiweera: Heart Heart I never knew you had one! Go and dance the devil with your yakka poiltikka. You and your husband! Anyway I must thank you for introducing me to a brave and honest lawyer. For Gods sake go and do your thovil dance with that devil!
Harin: (In an aside to Mrs Gutiweera). Someone must have mistaken her thyroid gland for her heart!
Rasawathie: (Ignoring the taunt). Vijay, what is the use of putting FR case. These things are common, they are happening everyday, no. No one is taking any notice now. These are small things, no After all Maraman is a powerful man, chile. I will ask Gini also to speak to him about a settlement. What is the use for anybody if he goes to jail. Nothing for nobody then. We can all profit if he settles the case. I told you he is steamrolling in money. 
Vimala: (Disappointedly wagging her finger at Rasawathie). To tell you the truth Rasawathie I am shocked at your attitude. You have absolutely no principles, no morals and keep changing your opinions like a chameleon. I actually thought that you had some sympathy for your friend here and that is why you brought her to Vijay to see that justice is done. I now realize that both you and your husband Ginipella are nothing but opportunistic political bootlickers.
Vijay: I suppose the minister might offer Gini a post as chief ministerial shoe-shiner. That would be a most suitable post for him. Anyway, Rasawathie, it would be wise to remember that money and power cannot buy happiness or a good name by any stretch of the imagination. Besides, it is because of people such as you that our society has descended to such low depths.
Rasawathie: (Stamping her foot): What low depths, men With money and power people will put you high up on the murunga aththa. That is the problem with you calling yourselves happy independent people. You dont give two hoos for power and big bank accounts just because you are a big shot lawyer. But as far as we are thinking we will do anything to stay on top and be rich. Why cant you understand that All you people are pretending to be goody giddy or something and for lies you are telling that money is a dirty thing!
Harin: Understand what That you have convinced us that people like yourselves are thoroughly greedy and selfish. That you are the type who will sell your name for a mess of pottage. You will sell your friends and perhaps yourself and even your grandmother for a filthy pile of money! You are the most amoral type of person it has been my misfortune to ever encounter.
Rasawathie: Aiyo you stupid brat. What pottage This is not the kussiamma age of pottage or pottery or chatty pots. Nowadays we are cooking in all steel pans and modern kitchen applications. Values, values. What values The only value these days is money, big, big money. How it comes does not matter, chile. Everybody is taking no.
Why not us You are a fool just like your parents. Principles, values, decency What is the use of all this if you dont have money If you dont have money you are miserable, you are a beggar. Ask anyone, will you! You will soon learn that in Sri Lanka happiness only cannot buy money!
Exit Rasawathie. Flaunts out without looking back. Camera cuts into bewildered group in living room. They all look at one another.
Harin: Bye, bye you miserable, opportunist. Aunty money-bags!
Harin suddenly begins to laugh uncontrollably. The laughter turns infectious as the others join in. Camera quietly fades as the rollicking theme song is played to a baila beat. The lyrics go:
Aney, Aney, magey paney,
Aney, Aney watch the cabaret,
Sure to take your breath away,
Making hay, come what may,
Everyday is commission day
We only have the devil to pay,
So gangway to go astray,
When betrayal is your sobriquet.
The gathering is convulsed with hilarity as Mrs Gutiweera prances to the beat of the music raising her skirt slightly while screaming with mirthful exuberance. The others clap to the beat while Harin joins Gutiweeras dance routine.
Periphery titles appear on the screen as the music fades and the scene diminishes.

Oak Spirit delivers first US LNG to Japan
Oak Spirit, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, delivered the first cargo produced in the contiguous United States (US LNG) to Joetsu LNG Terminal of Chubu Electric Power Company in Japan on January 6, 2017.
Jera, a joint venture created by Japan-based electric companies Tepco and Chubu Electric power, and the Houston-based LNG provider Cheniere Marketing International have entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the cargo, which was loaded onto the ship at Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana, operated by Cheniere Energy Partners on December 7, 2016.
On its way to Japan, Oak Spirit traversed the Panama Canal.
The 173,000 cubic meter ship was handed over to its owner, Teekay LNG Partners, from South Korean shipbuilder Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) in August 2016.
Oak Spirit joined its sister vessel, the Creole Spirit, which was launched in June 2015.
Following its delivery, Oak Spirit started its five-year fee-based contract with Cheniere Energy, lifting volumes from Chenieres Sabine Pass LNG export facility alongside the Creole Spirit.

Obama admits underestimating impact of Russian hacking
US: US President Barack Obama on Sunday admitted that he underestimated the impact misinformation and hacking can have on democracies, a remark that follows an intelligence report on Russian meddling in the US Presidential election.
In an interview on ABC's This Week, Obama also warned his Republican successor Donald Trump, who takes office in less than two weeks, about the difference between governing and campaigning, saying the president-elect won't be able to run his presidency the way you would manage a family business. The interview, which was taped Friday, took place the same day that US intelligence agencies released an unprecedented report saying Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign of hacking, leaking, and media manipulation aimed at undermining the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boosting Trump.
Although Obama said he was not taken in by Russian hostility to the United States, I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating. Obama ordered the intelligence report, released to the public Friday, partly to make sure that we understand this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe, initially in the former satellite states where there are a lot of Russian speakers, but increasingly in Western democracies. We have to pay attention, he said of upcoming elections in European ally nations, warning of possible interference.
Russia initially aimed its unprecedented cyber campaign at damaging a potential Clinton presidency, and then turned to supporting Trump after a victory by the real estate billionaire appeared possible, the report from the Director of National Intelligence said.
Trump, who met the country's leading intelligence agency chiefs to hear the full report, has accepted the possibility of Moscow's involvement in hacking US targets, including the Democratic National Committee, but rejected the conclusion that Russia interfered in the election.
He has also ridiculed US intelligence agencies over their findings and promised he would establish closer ties to Moscow.
Obama urged him to develop a strong relationship with the intelligence community. If we're not vigilant foreign countries can have an impact on the political debate in the United States in ways that might not have been true 10, 20, 30 years ago in part because of the way news is transmitted and in part because so many people are skeptical of mainstream news organizations, he said.
In that kind of environment, where there's so much skepticism about information that's coming in, we're going to have to spend a lot more time thinking about how do we protect our democratic process. Obama also emphasized focusing a lot more on cyber security.
Obama described his talks with the incoming president as cordial. He has been open to suggestions, he added, describing Trump as very engaging and gregarious. I've enjoyed the conversations that we've had. He is somebody who I think is not lacking in confidence, which is probably a prerequisite for the job. However, Obama believes Trump has not spent a lot of time sweating the details of policies, something he said could be both a strength and a weakness. If it gives him fresh eyes, then that can be valuable. But it also requires you knowing what you don't know and putting in place people who do have the kinds of experience and background and knowledge that can inform good decision making, he said. Obama also weighed in on Trump's constant use of Twitter.
Clearly this worked for him, and it gives him a direct connection to a lot of the people that voted for him, he said. .

Over 55 Chinese investors eye Hambantota Industrial Zone
Chinese financiers are ready to invest US$ 5 billion in the Hambantota Industrial Zone in the next few years and 55 of them have already committed to invest in the industrial zone, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at the foundation laying ceremony for the Sri Lanka-China Industrial Zone Development project in Mirijjawila, Hambantota.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the development programme launched in Hambantota under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena will be even bigger than former President J. R. Jayewardenes Mahaweli Development Programme.
The government has signed a framework agreement for a 99-year lease of the Hambantota port with a company in which China will have 80-percent ownership. Officials also plan to set up the nearby industrial zone where Chinese companies will be invited to set up factories.
The Premier said 1,235 acres have been allocated from this zone in Hambantota for Chinese investments to enable them to set up industrial ventures.
We are only giving it on a 99-year lease and not selling the port fully to the Chinese company, the Premier added.
Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Ministers Sajith Premadasa, Mahinda Amaraweera and Dilip Vedaarachchi were entrusted with the task of identifying land for Chinese investments in Hambantota, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe disclosed.
He said that the Hambantota port incurred losses amounting to Rs 983 million while the following year it incurred losses of Rs 449 million. He said that from 2017 the loan payments would have to be added to these losses.
He said that the government was facing a large crisis as it was unable to pay off the loans and also unable to turn the port into a more profitable venture.
Wickremesinghe said that by the year 2017, in one side the port would have collapsed due to losses and on the other side the economy will collapse due to the inability to pay loans. He said that on September 16, 2014 Chinese president Xi Jinping and then Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa signed an agreement phase 2 of the Hambantota Port project to development the Hambantota Port into an international harbour.

Pakistan-Sri Lanka trade will increase six times with FTA: Muneer
Pakistan and Sri Lanka have the potential to increase bilateral trade over six times from the current $ 247 million to $ 2.7 billion by just effectively utilising their Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) CEO, S. M. Muneer said.
Pakistan and Sri Lanka signed a Free Trade Agreement in July 2002 and it became operational in June 2005. The terms of the FTA were comprehensive and granted 100% immediate concession to major Pakistani exports such as cotton and cement and major Sri Lankan exports such as rubber and coconut products.
By 2010 both countries were required to have removed tariffs on all items barring those listed in their respective no-concession lists or those facing Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQ). Given these facts, I would say that at present there is still a tremendous amount of untapped potential available for companies and entrepreneurs from both nations.
After signing of FTA between Pakistan and Sri Lanka Pakistans exports to Sri Lanka grew from USD 154 million in 2004 to USD 316 million in 2013. However Pakistan could only claim 1.7% of total Sri Lankan imports from the world in 2013, he noted.
Sri Lankas exports to Pakistan grew from USD 46 million to USD 63 million between 2004 and 2013, and Sri Lanka claimed only 0.14% of total Pakistani imports from the world in 2013. More recently our exports have decreased to US$ 247.145 million in 2015-16 while import from Sri Lanka increased to US$ 74.59 as compared to 57.801 million in 2014-15.
There are certainly encouraging signs that these engagements are gaining greater momentum however, given the remarkable synergies that we see between our two nations, we remain convinced that we have barely scratched the surface in terms of our bilateral trade relationships, particularly given the FTA.
Top Sri Lankan exports to Pakistan include vegetable products, rubber, fibreboard and coconut products while we have been able to build a small but vibrant set of exports based primarily around cotton products, cement, refined sugar and potatoes.

Police to probe Hambantota incident
The Police have been directed to make an investigation into the incident that took place in Hambantota when people and the Maha Sanga staged a protest in connection with the agreements between the government and a Chinese Company, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday. He said following the investigation, everybody could have access to them via the authorities.
He made this observation in response to a query by Opposition Member Chamal Rajapaksa and MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
The Prime Minister responding to MP Rajapaksa said ministers and himself went to meet the Ven. Maha Sanga in Thissamaharamaya.
He said when the monks made their queries, they were told the matter was handled by a Committee led by Minister Sarath Amunugama. They were to meet the Theras to discuss the issues.
He said when government representatives met the Chinese President, he had offered two companies: The China Harbour Company and the China Merchant Company. The government selected the China Mecrchant Company. Later the China Harbour Company had withdrawn their documents. The one that MP Chamal rajapaksa was referring to would be one of them, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe assured that the lands would be acquired in a manner that MP Chamal Rajapaksa suggested. He said the Chinese government commenced a vocational training institute. It will turn into a large institute.

Agreements on development programmes will be presented to Parliament: Kiriella
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella assured the House that the agreements entered into with the Chinese company on the Hambantota Harbour and other related development programmes would be presented to Parliament.
He said the government will give a debate over these agreements.
He made these observations yesterday in response to query by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake following a special statement by Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament.
Minister Kiriella said however, the incident took place as the people did not act in line with a Court Order.
A Court Order prevented illegal gathering. Opposition members were on the road during the incident. They urged the people to protest and they led it, he said.
Joint Opposition Member Namal Rajapaksa said the media reported the previous day the Prime Minister saying that following a discussion with Thissa Mahanayake Theras, he would take measures to cancel the Court Order for people to attend the ceremony.
However, a conflict might have taken place between the people who went from Colombo and protesters.
Thugs went into houses and assaulted even children, Namal Rajapaksa said.
An investigation should be held into the incident, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Thissamaharama Nayaka Theras could attend a funeral due to an order.
I told them to inform the matter to the IGP and get it removed, he said. I did not have any involvement other than that,he said.
The Prime Minister said he expected that Namal Rajapaksa would participate at the ceremony. Several other UPFA Ministers like Vijayamuni Soyza, A. H. M. Fowzie, Rajitha and Amunugama attended the ceremony, he said.
Opposition responsible for disrupting event attended by PM: Sagala
The Opposition was responsible for disrupting an event that was participated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Hambantota, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake said.
Minister Rathnayake made this observation in Parliament yesterday when opposition members queried of the conflict between protesters and others in Hambantota.
The Minister said they too staged protests while in opposition, but they did not level a threat to the VIP security of a President or a Prime Minister.
MP Namal Rajapaksa said protestors were not given a place to protest.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma said among the peaceful protesters were Omalpe Omare Kassapa Thera.
Minister Kabir Hashim said this was not a planned attack by our side. It was planned by the opposition side.
They came there with stones and bricks to assault us, the Minister said.
The Police were silent. But later the Police had to respond.
They had preplanned it. They attacked even two ambulances. Who attacked ambulances Those who came to attack learnt a lesson, he said.
Amaraweera invites Opposition to support Htota development
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday invited Opposition members in Parliament to support the setting up of the Hambantota Industrial Zone and continue with the programme they initiated during the previous regime.
He said it should be their responsibility to empower the youth in Hambantota and get employment opportunities to the country and not to disrupt the development process.
He made these observations yesterday following the special statement by Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena on the agreement between the government and a Chinese Company on the Hambantota Harbour.
Minister Amaraweera said they would not offer the outright ownership of lands to China as the Opposition said. He said the government neither gives one million visas to Chinese people nor makes it a Chinese Colony as the Opposition said.
He said the government would not take over 15,000 houses or remove 35,000 families from those areas to acquire land. The people would be allowed to remain in their houses. Arid lands would be taken over for an industrial zone, he said. Minister Amaraweera said a mistake was done by the government side by making various statements on land acquisition.
He said the construction of the Hambantota harbour and the Mattala airport was commendable. The South is being developed due to those constructions.
He said the previous government and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also said that Hambantota could be developed by setting up an industrial zone. The minister said he stood against the decision of making the Mattala Airport a Paddy store.
People have doubts over land acquisition: Anura Kumara
The government should present agreements it had entered into in connection with the Hambantota Harbour to Parliament before the harbor is handed over to the Chinese Company, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He said the previous government had entered into an agreement in September 2014 with the China Harbour Company for 35 years while keeping 35 percent to the government.
He said this government had entered into several agreements, including the Framework Agreement.
However, none of them have been presented to Parliament, MP Dissanayake said.
They should be presented to Parliament before the harbour is handed over to the Chinese Company, he said.
People were removed from their lands to acquire lands for these projects. They are again removed from resettled lands, MP Dissanayake said. They have a suspicion over the agreements as one said 15,000 acres are acquired while others said otherwise, he said.
Dissanayake said due to suspicion, the people came to protest.  The people went from Colombo hurled stones at protestors, Dissanayake said. I saw pictures that one Local Government members wife had stones in hand. A Parliamentary debate should be held in this connection, he said.
Joint Opposition Member Wimal Werawansa said the members who said before January 8 that the Hambantota Harbour was a swimming pool.
Haunted house in Gampola: Elvis has left the building!
CHAMIKARA WEERASINGHE
Police in Gampola are investigating reports of an apparent poltergeist fires in a house.
A father had reported to the police that mysterious and spontaneous fires have been springing up in their home, Gampola Police OIC Upali Senarath Yapa said yesterday.
The police recorded it under miscellaneous complaints and are looking into it, he said.
The house is in Umagiri Uyana area of the Gampola Atabage Gramaseva Division. The complainant, whose job is carpentry, lives there with his wife and two boys.
The fires mostly caught up the clothes of the children, he had told the police.
There were some marks of fire inside the house, Gampola Police MisceIleneous Unit OIC IP Gamanayaka said.
Our sources in Gampaha said several residents in the neighborhood told them they too have seen the fires appearing and smoldering the clothes lying around inside the house.
The owner of the house said yesterday that he felt things were returning to normal after they had made a prayer to a certain devamaniyo, IP Gamanayaka said. That is what he believes, but the police cannot form any theories on that, he said.
Our sources in Gampola said that the house owner is refusing to allow anyone inside the house to witness it or to make any photographs of the house on the advice of a voodoo doctor (kattadiya).

Pears Baby launches trilingual parenting web portal
Pears Baby has launched a trilingual parenting web portal.Being the first trilingual local website on parenting www.pearsbaby.lk contains information such as insightful articles on nutrition, health and recommended bonding activities for you and your toddler. The site also offers discount coupons from featured merchants month on month.
While there are many websites that provide information on parenting and childcare, most of these are foreign sites that are challenging to adapt to as they do not address matters from a Sri Lankan context.
Identifying this need in Sri Lanka, Pears Baby launched Sri Lankas first trilingual web portal on parenting sharing a wealth of knowledge to address the concerns of local mothers.
The website has been developed with the expert opinions of doctors, mothers and other specialists on the topic and is an assured, up-to-date and reliable source of information that all parents can resort to.
We realized that Sri Lanka did not have an all in one web portal that provided information on how to prepare for pregnancy, what physical and mental changes a mother would experience during the three trimesters of pregnancy, how to care for your new born and have sufficient information on what to expect during the first 6 years of your childs life. Before laying out this website we researched about many parenting websites and were able to design this web portal to international standards while remaining locally relevant to our audience, Pears Unilever Sri Lanka Senior Brand Manager Rehani Barsenbach said.
Barsenbach said this is the only parenting website in Sri Lanka which features a Pregnancy Calendar. This all-important Calendar will walk you through a week by week growth pattern of your baby and the emotional and physical changes you would experience as a pregnant mother through the trimesters leading up to the date of delivery. The site will prepare you to embrace the blissful moments of motherhood with joy.
Informative articles in the website are sourced by an expert panel of specialist pediatricians, nutritionists, dermatologists, child psychologists and obstetricians; who provide up to date advice that is relevant to Sri Lankan mothers.
Additionally, the site also hosts a list of baby names along with their meanings which includes over 1000 name suggestions for your baby. Adding more value to the content of the web portal is the expert advice written by renowned pediatricians on food choices and symptoms to look out for in toddlers at various stages of their growth.

The President             settles it
President Maithripala Sirisenas firm assertion at the second year anniversary of his inauguration that the Unity Government will run its full course until 2020 and that those planning to topple the government before this was only day dreaming has driven the point home that the Joint Opposition project to claw back to power with Mahinda Rajapaksa at the helm is doomed from the very outset. The Presidents observation that he is quite happy with the present government led by the UNP, and implying in the process that he can well do without a government led by the SLFP at this juncture, is also revealing .Garrulous SLFP MPs such as Dilan Perera has been clamouring for a SLFP led government, once the pact forged with the UNP for a Unity Government comes to an end this August, though how he proposes to do this has not been revealed.
Equally, JO stalwart Kumara Welgama who is still a Central Committee member of the SLFP has also advocated a SLFP led government by severing ties with the UNP as a condition for the Joint Opposition returning to the fold of the mainstream SLFP. Gampaha District UPFA and JO front runner Prasanna Ranatunga has gone a step further. He has asked President Sirisena to take Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by his ear and throw him out of the Unity Government and form a regime led by the SLFP, pledging their full support for such a move. President Sirisena, by rejecting all these calls and deciding to stick with the UNP led Unity Government, is sending a clear message to the JO that he is quite satisfied with the way things are proceeding under the current dispensation and is a declaration of the trust placed in the ability of the UNP to steer the ship of state out of the current economic storm into tranquil harbours.
The President in the process has read the riot act to those planning to topple the government by a head count in parliament. He said even for a headcount to triumph it has to have the concurrence of both himself as the President and also the Speaker. He showed how the impeachment motion against the President Premadasa came a cropper once both the President and the Speaker joined forces.
Now that President Sirisena has shown the impossibility of constitutionally toppling the government it is time that the present administration got down to business in earnest and redeem all its pledges made to the people before the end of its term. No doubt it will have herculean task getting the country out of the present debt trap and more hardships to the people cannot be ruled out. But the government has to draw the line somewhere. It cannot remain in perennial debt and be branded as a failed state. There is no reason to doubt Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes claim that he would leave a debt free country to the next generation by the end of the first term of the Yahapalanaya government. It is important that the UNP be given a free hand to run the economy of the country. The Grand Old Party, after all, is known to be well equipped to handle the macro economy. The SLFP, while holding firm to its core values, should not strive to rock the boat at this stage by making unreasonable demands or putting forward impractical proposals.
There is no indication yet if the SLFP will fight the upcoming LG elections in coalition with the UNP or go it alone. It is reasonable to expect it to make some noises in favour of populist measures, in the case of the latter. But with the President now firmly indicating he is happy to continue with the present government (led by the UNP), the SLFP members in the government should temper their demands and work as a unit to take the country in one direction.
Gota must spill the beans
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in a newspaper interview says that the government has got the wrong end of the stick with regard to the murder of Sunday Leader founder editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and that it is questioning the wrong persons on purpose. This clearly shows that Rajapaksa is privy to certain information. Hence it behoves the former Defence Secretary to come out in the open and provide whatever secret knowledge he possess pertaining to the assassination. By doing this he would not only win the kudos of the journalistic fraternity, particularly, those who were close to Lasantha but ease the anguish, at least to some degree, of the family members of Wickrematunge, who have been crying out for justice for the last eight years. Wickrematunge was assassinated in a high security zone under constant surveillance when Gota was Defence Secretary and there is no doubt he must be privy to some knowledge as to who the assassins were or under whose directions it was carried out, to make such a statement of the interviewer.

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday emphasised the need for a national policy for the construction sector.
The President said it was important for a national policy for the construction industry and added it should be implemented with the cooperation of both the private and public sectors.
He made these observations at the launch of a green government buildings code and evaluation system at the BMICH.
President Sirisena pointed out that Sri Lanka was currently facing a number of issues due to population growth and added that several challenges have arisen due to the non-availability of a national policy on housing and building construction.
The programme to encourage maintain green buildings, while preserving the environment has been prepared by the Urban Development Authority and the Environment and Mahaweli Development Ministry under the guidance of the Presidential Secretariat. The President said haphazard construction paved the way for a number of challenges and issues and has posed a threat to the environment.
He said such construction will also affect the availability of land for plantations and cultivation in the future.

Rajapaksa supporters behind Saturdays unrest: Bandara
The UNP yesterday charged that some Hambantota residents who received state lands courtesy of the Rajapaksa family as an inducement for their support were behind Saturdays unrest when the China  Sri Lanka Industrial Zone was inaugurated.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara said information has surfaced that Rajapaksa gave away state lands to some of their supporters illegally and they were the ones behind Saturdays mayhem. These Rajapaksa supporters had misled other people with canards and had instigated them to protest against the industrial zone which will bring unprecedented benefits to the people in the area, Bandara, told media in Colombo.
He said the government will take steps to acquire these illegally distributed lands in the future. We are also planning to reveal the names and other details of this fraud," he added. He said a Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman in the Hambantota district had been given 34 acres illegally and another 53 persons who are members of an organisation run by the Rajapaksas were beneficiaries of state lands, given illegally.
Bandara said these lands had been given as an inducement for supporting Rajapaksas and performing various tasks for them.

Rigid Tyre Corp invests US$ 75 mn for tyre plant
Rigid Tyre Corporation said they will invest US dollars 75 million for the Sri Lankas largest integrated tyre manufacturing plant for which ground was broken at the BOI Industrial Zone, Wagawatta Horana last week.
The company will manufacture Italian branded Marangoni tyres as well as other tyres for both Sri Lanka and the export market.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who was the chief guest at the foundation lying ceremony said the government will be able to create 20,000 job opportunities with the opening factories that has good visionary leadership and modern technology such as RIGID. Wickremesinghe also said that Rigid Tyre Corporation has not only brought in Foreign Direct Investments but also new technology.
He said that he started the Biyagama Investment zone as a Member of Parliament with 300 acres and today there are over 100 companies mostly targeting exports. This zone too will resemble similar to that zone and are being set up all over Sri Lanka to usher economic prosperity.
The Premier said that in addition to new local foreign and local companies, several local companies like Richard Pieris and MAS Holdings have requested for land to set up factories similar to this.
The investor for the project Nandana Lokuwithana is the Chairman of both Rigid Tyre Corporation and Ceylon Steel. Lokuwithana told Daily News Business that they have already started construction and it will be completed in 16 months. Next we will install machinery and then the first tyre manufactured in Horana will be ready by the third quarter of next year.
The tyre plant, being the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, is commissioned to manufacture the whole gamut of tyres including off-the -road (OTR) tyres, passenger car radials and truck and bus radials.
The venture will create over 3000 job opportunities, both direct and indirect.
This new venture is tipped to be the biggest fully integrated tyre manufacturing plant in the country.
It is an initiative with far reaching benefits for the country and certainly can roll out many a profiting mile.We will also use as much as local raw material (rubber) which in tunr would
help to increase price for local rubber industry.
Marangoni Tyre President Vittorio Marangoni said they will provide the technical knowhow for the project and Marangoni tyres too will be manufactured in Horana. Our main business intention is to capitalise on the European market. All RIGID Tyre products take on the tag, Licensed by Marangoni.
Marangoni is famed not only for its superlative breeds of tyres but the process of manufacture as well and its carbon footprint is small and clean.

Rolls-Royce debut for Emirates
The Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) has approved plans to launch a new European leisure carrier under a joint venture with TUI.
The deal, which remains subject to regulatory approval, will see elements of several airlines merge together under a new brand, operating a combined fleet of 60 aircraft and flying point-to-point services to key leisure markets across the Continent.
The Vienna-based airline, expected to launch services in April, will come about through the wholesale reorganisation of Etihads strategic partner airberlin.
The German carrier is set to surrender its 49.2% stake in Austrian subsidiary Niki to the joint-venture.
This will be complemented by 14 Boeing 737s, owned by TUI offshoot TUIfly, but currently operating under a long-term wet-lease to airberlin.
Ownership of the joint venture will be split between TUI (24.8%) and Etihad (25%) while the remaining 50.2% will be retained by the existing private foundation NIKI Privatstiftung.

Sarath Kumara Gunaratne  further remanded
Former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne arrested for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project, was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till January 13 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Bandara.
The former Fisheries Deputy Minister was arrested by the CID on December 2 for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to the Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) during the last Presidential election.
Rejecting a bail application submitted on behalf of the former minister on medical grounds, the Chief Magistrate observed that the medical reports submitted in Court were unreadable and unable to understand and the defence was directed to submit fresh medical reports in due course.
Defence Counsel Sampath Mendis appearing for the suspect, had earlier informed Court that there is no summary of evidence against the suspect alleging that he had committed anything wrong and moved Court that his client be released on bail as he is suffering from diabetes.
On a previous occasion, CFHC former Chairman Upali Liyanage, CFHC General Manager Piyal Abeysekara, Deputy General Manager Chandana Palpita and Lakmuni Munidasa were ordered to be released on bail regarding this incident. In this case, the CID had named six individuals including Gunaratne as the suspects following the instructions of the Attorney General. The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney Generals advise be sought to institute legal action against persons responsible for the alleged financial frauds.
The Attorney General is expected to file indictments against the suspects in the High Court.

Shashikala Siriwardene the  queen of Sri Lanka cricket
Shashikala Siriwardene started to play cricket at the age of six at Kotikawatte, a suburb of Colombo in Sri Lanka. She had the unstinted support of her father even at that tender age and with that guidance she has never looked back. She was only a slip of lass, but packed into her tiny frame it was evident that she had loads of guts, coupled with determination and dedication which enabled her to reach stardom thus far. The sudden success she gained by leading Sri Lanka with distinction at the Womens World Cup in 2013, has not changed her life style by even an iota. She is still humble and down to earth and this she states was due to her upbringing based on good moral values inculcated into her from her early days.
Sri Lankan women cricketers stamped their authority in their vastly improved World Cup campaign 2013, where they surprised defending champions England and throttled India down the relegation path from the Super Six. To cap it all Sri Lanka also had the better of the much fancied South Africa to capture the number 5 slot then.
She also gives a word of thanks to Gwen Herath, who was a live wire behind womens cricket from the very inception.
At the time I interviewed Shashikala, the Sri Lankan womens cricket team was an unknown quantity. The names like Shashikala Siriwardene and Kaushalya became household names overnight not only in Sri Lanka, but also in countries like England and India. All this Ha Ho came about, when our lissome lassies beat the English and the Indian women cricketers in the Womens World Cup 2013; they entered the Super Six Stages of the tournament.
The Sri Lankan team beat the World Cup title holders England by the skin of their teeth in the last ball of the match and then went on to beat India as easy as a walk in the park, this victory was by a handsome margin of 138 runs in the 43rd over, with 7 overs to spare. Those who were fortunate enough to witness these matches on our famous cricket channel were in for pure unadulterated entertainment at its very best.
Whilst Shashikalas then aspirations to succeed at the highest level should be admired, it is interesting to note the present Sri Lankan teams dismal performance in South Africa.
In my opinion the void left by Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara will take some time to fill but all is not lost since we have two promising young batsmen whose technical inadequacies should be sorted out and together with the right exposure, they should go a long way.
Dhananjaya de Silva if he can reduce his back lift and get used to the change of pace could go far; he shows class when he drives with his head still. Kusal Mendis the pocket rocket should be persevered with in all formats as well. He unfortunately gets exposed to the moving ball outside the off stump time and again.
Lahiru Kumara is another find who could form a devastating combination with Dushmantha Chameera if he gets his rhythm back. The future does not look too bad for Sri Lanka if the fitness levels of the players could be sustained!
It is interesting to note that a friend of mine G.C. from U.K. had to say about the present happenings in the Test arena, he goes on May I share with you one of my views on our SL Test Cricketers: Generally, only a handful of them have been blessed with that special combination - Talent with a Cricketing-Brain. I believe, to become a top quality international player today, one needs this combination. Among the recent SL players, Mahela, Sangakkara, Murali and Vass were good examples of this fact. They had the skill to gauge the opposition during a match and make quick adjustments to counter the challenges presented by the opposition, most of the time quite successfully.
When watching the current SL team in action, in South Africa, it was obvious, although some of the SL players have good talent, they appear to lack awareness of what the opposition team was getting up to, and therefore were unable to make necessary adjustments (e.g. to their style of playing) to deal with the challenges in the matches whilst batting, bowling and fielding.
The difference between the two teams could be described simply as SL being Amateur or non Professional.
Today, with so much electronic information available about players and teams in all sports, to compete successfully consistently and particularly against quality opposition like the SA cricket team, one need to have the above combination in abundance, I feel.
All our present players are desperately in need of quality professional help and encouragement to develop this skill - how to THINK in cricket during the game, concludes my friend in UK.

Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam: Patriot par excellence
A reproduction of the Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam Memorial Oration, delivered by Dr. Brendon Gooneratne on January 19, 2009
Ponnambalam Arunachalam was the youngest son of Gate Mudaliyar A. Ponnambalam. He was born on September 14, 1853 to a highly respected and very well-educated, professional family from Manipay.
His eldest brother Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy had a distinguished career as a Proctor and was the Nominated Tamil Member of the Ceylon Legislative Council from 1893.
The next eldest child of the family, his brother, Ponnambalam Ramanathan, an Advocate, succeeded their uncle, Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy, as the Nominated Tamil Representative, serving from 1879 to 1893, and later on from 1921 to 1924.
Ponnambalam Ramanathan was also elected to the Legislature as member for the Northern Province (Northern Division) seat and occupied it from 1924 till his death in 1930. In addition to this appointment, Ramanathan was the islands Solicitor-General from 1893 to 1906 for a period of 13 years, acted as Attorney-General on several occasions, and retired as a pensionable officer in 1906.
Education
Both the elder brothers of Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam were educated at the Colombo Academy (now Royal College), and then at Presidency College, Madras.
Like his older brothers Ponnambalam Arunachalam, had his early education at the Colombo Academy, but, having won the English University Scholarship in 1870, entered Christ College, Cambridge.
He took with him a reputation as a student of exceptional merit, recommended by Sir Walter Sendall, Director of Public Instruction.
Arunachalam was now appointed to the Government Agents office in Colombo and then to a series of judicial posts in various parts of the island. This was a policy unofficially adopted by the British Government of the day, which effectively debarred outstanding Ceylonese from taking high office in Government and instead appointed them to various parts of the island in different capacities, such as District Judges, Police Magistrates and Commissioners of Requests.
Another talented person who was given the same runaround was Paul Pieris, later Sir Paul, the scholar and historian.
Sir Paul Pieris put his time in the provinces to good use, by researching and writing excellent books on successive periods of Ceylons history, of such distinction that he was later to become the first Asian to receive a Doctor of Letters degree from Cambridge University.
In 1906, Arunachalam was appointed to the Legislative Council. In 1912, Governor Sir Henry McCallum nominated him to the Executive Council, as a personal appointment; and on his retirement from the Public Service in 1913, he was Knighted in recognition of his distinguished service to the country.
Politics
In 1913, a new phase in Arunachalams life began: In this year he joined a political movement demanding self-governance for the people of Ceylon. In an historic lecture entitled Our Political Needs, given at the insistence of D. R. Wijewardene, Arunachalam crystallized the arguments for self-government.
In 1915, he was elected the first President of the Ceylon Social Service League for uplifting the poorer classes in Ceylon.
In 1917, he founded the Ceylon Reform League, and in 1919, he delivered an address to a Sinhalese conference under the patronage of F. R. Senanayake, for the purpose of organising Peoples Associations throughout the Sinhalese districts of the island for political, social and economic improvement. This movement directly gave birth to the Lanka Maha Jana Sabha.
(I make mention of these activities and of Arunachalams continuous association with them, because they illustrate the strong unity that existed at that time amongst the peoples of Ceylon, when Sinhalese and Tamils were united in their approach to social reform, while indicating Arunachalams unflagging devotion to the ideal of national unity).
Meanwhile, other matters occupied his mind. He became the first Ceylonese to be elected President of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. As President of the Saiva Paripalana Sabai, he took much interest in Hindu cultural matters. And notably, he was the first person to start agitating for a University for Ceylon.
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalams contribution to the field of education was that of a pioneer. In his notes to the Director of Public Instruction, he stated that the fundamental defect in the system of elementary education in Ceylon was that English was employed as the medium of instruction. In a real sense, as has been pointed out, he was the father of the concept of Swabasha.
Unfortunately, this idea was worked upon by later politicians who misread it, totally rejecting English, which could have been the link language unifying the different ethnic groups of Ceylon. Since at that time the people of Ceylon were still functioning as a united family, the need for a link language did not assert itself. The paths of history are littered with missed opportunities and sadly, this was one of them.
Another missed opportunity was listed in a book by a Sinhalese journalist published two years ago. I would like to repeat this in verbatim, as published in the book:
When I was detained in the Magazine Prison after the 71 Insurgency, I met five Tamil youth who were arrested for leading a black flag campaign protesting the standardisation of education. Among the detainees was Kasiyanadan, who aroused Tamil nationalist sentiments in the younger generation with his poetry. His had a calm and composed disposition and his full beard and lean body made him look like a yogi.
A story he told me, in jail, with deep emotion, shocked my Sinhala psyche to the core. Before 1956, both Sinhala people in the South and Tamil people in the North received telegrams in English. Members of both communities who could not comprehend the language, would need to go in search of someone conversant with the language in order to have the telegram read. The leaders of both communities had come to an agreement to remedy this humiliating situation; they agreed to moot Swabasha or the indigenous language policy.
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalams contribution to the field of education was that of a pioneer. In his notes to the Director of Public Instruction, he stated that the fundamental defect in the system of elementary education in Ceylon was that English was employed as the medium of instruction. In a real sense, as has been pointed out, he was the father of the concept of Swabasha. Unfortunately, this idea was worked upon by later politicians who misread it, totally rejecting English, which could have been the link language unifying the different ethnic groups of Ceylon. Since at that time the people of Ceylon were still functioning as a united family, the need for a link language did not assert itself. The paths of history are littered with missed opportunities and sadly, this was one of them 
However, when contrary to the agreement, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike implemented the Sinhala Only Policy, the Sinhala people received their telegrams in their native language, but the Tamil people were given no choice but to have their telegrams sent to them in Sinhala, a language which was alien to them. He explained how under this new policy, the Tamil people had to go in search of someone who understood the Sinhala language in order to have their telegrams read. Kasiyanadan asked how something which was judged to be an insult to the Sinhalese people could not be considered an insult to the Tamil people as well.
What is clear is that simple issues, not resolved in the initial stages, were permitted to multiply into complex crises, ending in bloodshed.
Another example of a lack of foresight on the part of the majority is what we still see on the roads everyday. Signboards stating the roads in Colombo and elsewhere are STILL in English and Sinhalese only. Rarely, if ever, do signboards contain the names of roads in Tamil. Why cannot officials who are paid to do this job, rectify this
Lessons
Thoughtful persons would agree that the lessons of history, if studied with attention, could be used to avoid the mistakes made in the past, so that with foresight, the destinies of nations and peoples could be guided in a proper direction. It is my firm conviction that even at this moment it is not too late to rectify the glaring errors that have divided our society. Goodwill and magnanimity from the majority Sinhalese, reciprocated by other communities, could still heal our wounds and point the way to a saner, safer world in the years to come.
Academia
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam has been rightly called the Father of the Ceylon University Movement, as he was responsible for the Ceylon University Association which was formed in January 1906. In his memorandum to the Governor, Sir West Ridgeway, requesting the government to appoint a commission to report on educational progress and needs, Arunachalam appealed to the government to create a Ceylon University; or at least to raise Royal College to the status of a University College, which would be of lasting benefit to the people and a fitting monument to His Excellencys rule in Ceylon. He suggested that Ceylon and Indian history and geography could replace English history and geography on the curriculum of such an institution. His Excellency on October 15 decided to take no action, was the negative response he received from the Governors Secretary.
Passing
When Professor Marrs, the first Principal of the University College, heard of Arunachalams death at Madura on January 9, 1924, while on a pilgrimage worshipping at the Hindu temples in South India, he summoned the students of the University College to the main hall and addressed them in these words:
Gentlemen, I have asked you to assemble here at this hour as a mark of respect to the memory of one who was in a very real sense the Father of the University project in Ceylon. Little or nothing has been said of that side of his activities, which to those who were in close touch with him was the inspiration of his latter days - the side which concerns you and me as members of an institution so dear to his heart, the Ceylon University College.
I may remind you that Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam presided over the public meeting which was called to consider the question of the establishment of a University in Ceylon on January 19, 1906. From that day to the day of his demise, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam has pursued his objective, to use his own words, without let or restraint, undeterred by the doubts of men without vision or the delay to which an untried project must, I suppose, always be subjected by conservers of tradition.
Legacy
Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam has been honoured by a statue in the Parliament Square in 1930 and by the unveiling of his portraits at Royal College and at the offices of both the Ceylon National Congress and the Ceylon Social Service League. His name graces Arunachalam Hall, the first Hall of Residence to be opened to students at the University of Peradeniya in 1951 and a commemorative one-rupee postage stamp was issued in his memory on March 10, 1977.
His philosophical and religious contributions were collected and published in 1937, with the title Studies and Translations. Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyar in his foreword to this anthology wrote: The world cannot be sufficiently grateful to Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam for having in his philosophical and religious Studies and Translations unlocked these treasures of thought and of language to those wholly or partially unacquainted with the wonders of Tamil thought and Tamil poetry.
Looking back on Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalams career, we contemplate a life studded with immense contributions, in a range of different fields of endeavour. Sri Lanka has been bereft of statesman-like leaders, who put national interests first, since the demise of D. S. Senanayake and Sir Oliver Goonetileke in the 1950s. We have however not been short of politicians of every hue clamouring to become Members of Parliament and Cabinet, crawling out of the woodwork. Sri Lanka, we must remind ourselves, has the largest Cabinet in the world, over 100 odd Cabinet Ministers and Junior Ministers, living off the fat of the land with massive perks of office and this in one of the poorest countries in the world!
In this light, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam stands out as an outstanding leader of honesty, integrity and achievement and is a beacon to us all. Most of us would have been satisfied by association with one or other of such monumental endeavours. But Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam seems to have been a human dynamo - a true nationalist and patriot of Ceylon.

Smoking will kill 8m people a year by 2030, WHO study warns

The number of people who die from smoking is going to rise considerably in the coming years, according to a new report.
Tobacco use currently kills an estimated six million people worldwide every year - but by 2030, the World Health Organisation (WHO) believes this will increase to eight million.
The study also suggests that the global economy is losing at least $1tn (820bn) a year because of the impact smoking has on productivity levels and health services.
More than 80% of smoking deaths occur in low and middle-income countries, where the number of smokers is continuing to rise.
The WHO claims most governments are failing to use cheap and effective tools which can reduce tobacco use and save lives, such as complete bans on tobacco marketing, prominent warning labels on cigarette packets and price increases.
Global revenues generated from tobacco taxes only stood at $269bn (221bn) in 2013/14, it said, which is nowhere near enough to recoup the economic losses caused by smoking.
Health experts say tobacco use is the single biggest preventable cause of death worldwide.
The WHO's report, produced in conjunction with the US National Cancer Institute, said: "Government fears that tobacco control will have an adverse economic impact are not justified by the evidence. The science is clear; the time for action is now."
Its authors claimed that governments would be able to fund more expensive anti-smoking schemes, such as mass media campaigns and cessation treatments, if tobacco taxes were raised.
Within months, all cigarettes in the UK will be sold in standardised green packaging with large, explicit photographs which show the harmful effects of smoking.
Several tobacco-producing countries have opened a trade dispute against Australia, which first introduced the plain packaging rules and outlawed distinctive logos or colourful branding.
The World Trade Organisation is expected to rule on the complaint later this year.

Solar power generation will help  reduce countrys colossal debts: Ravi
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that converting current expensive power sources into new energy sources through conserving environment is a turning point of the ongoing rapid development agenda. He said that introducing solar power will help the government to manage its cost factor, specially in repaying the existing colossal debts. He said the Finance Ministry expects to cut its monthly electricity bill by Rs.200,000.
The minister was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the national project to convert all state sector buildings into solar power generating centers within two years was officially held with the patronage of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Ministry of Finance on January 9. The project was launched following a proposal by Budget 2017. The project will be implemented under the initiative of President Maithripala Sirisenas Beginning of 3rd Year of a Sustainable Era, and the Prime Ministers concept to build a powerful Sri Lanka under his Economic Policy Statement. The first solar power generating scheme under this project was fixed on the Finance Ministry building. The project was commenced by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
A huge amount of debt had borrowed haphazardly when we took over the government on January 8, 2015. We found as a government two methods to come out from this colossal debt trap. One is to leave them as they were and continue our activities. The second remedy is to go ahead by minimising public costs, managing the economy and look for new sources of revenue.
"We have been implementing the best remedial measures. The national project that we inaugurated today will protect environment on one hand and, on the other hand, it will convert the current expensive energy sources into cheap solar system thereby cutting the state sector energy costs. Therefore, we believe that all will extend their support to make this venture a success. Our aim is to set up solar panels on all state buildings by 2019 to enable them to meet their electricity demand by solar power, the Minister said.
State Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said the previous regime which foresaw two imminent crises called snap elections two years ahead of its mandate. One crisis was the international allegations against the previous regime. The second was the looming economic challenges. Under the rule of the current good governance, democracy was already established in the country and minimised international influences as well. However, the economic crisis is still prevailing. Today, a special milestone was achieved in the journey towards the economic goals, the State Minister said.
Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said economic development and environment conservation cannot be separated as both are of paramount importance. He said it was welcoming sign that the Finance Ministry inaugurated such a programme of national importance.
MP Nalin Bandara, Finance Ministry Deputy Secretaries S.R. Atygalle, A.R. Deshapriya, Chandra Ekanayake, and Director General H.G. Sumanasinghe and several department heads participated.

Sovereign right to decide on foreign judges with Sri Lanka: Health Minister

Deciding on the participation of foreign judges with the investigations on Sri Lankas war crime allegations and human right violations is a sovereign right of the Sri Lankan government and will be decided by the Sri Lankan government, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He said that no foreign judges would join the investigations on war crime allegations and human right violations.
The UNHRC High Commissioner during his recent visit to Sri Lanka said that he proposed the participation of foreign judges in the judicial process on alleged war crime. Although he proposed it, he said that it was the sovereign right of Sri Lanka to decide. Accordingly, it proves that the Government of Sri Lanka is the authority that decides the participation of foreign judges, Senaratne said.

SriLankans codeshare partnerships contribute to 2 mn tourist milestone
The smooth functioning of SriLankan Airlines codeshare partnerships in the Western and Central European region contributed in a significant manner to the growth of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka in 2016, which expanded by 14% and crossed the 2 million milestone.
SriLankan made a significant change in strategy in the fourth quarter of 2016 by expanding services to the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia which included the launch of 11 new destinations and the increase of frequencies to existing destinations, while suspending services on three loss-making European routes. The changes resulted in SriLankan expanding its global route network to 101 destinations in 47 countries. It is also now the largest foreign carrier into India where it serves 11 cities with over 100 frequencies, as well as being the largest airline operating to both Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
SriLankan arranged efficient codeshare agreements with its partner airlines to carry passengers to Colombo from much of Europe, as it suspended services to Paris, Frankfurt and Rome in November 2016. Significantly, each of these tourism markets recorded significant increases in growth of tourists to Sri Lanka and growth was not affected by the suspension of direct air services, due to the convenient codeshare services offered by SriLankans partner airlines.
Arrivals from Germany for December 2016 totaled 11,994, an increase of 5.9% over December 2015; and arrivals from France in December 2016 totaled 7,061, an 11.5% increase over the 7,871 of December 2015.
SriLankan has codeshare arrangements with many airlines around the world, which provide air services that strengthen the national carriers global network and help market Sri Lanka as a tourism destination.
Western and Central Europe was the largest tourism generating region to Sri Lanka in 2016 by contributing 643,333 visitors, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, with a 16.5% growth over 2015.
This was even more than South Asia (513,536) and East Asia (425,161), despite those two regions having the two single largest tourist market countries - India and China.
Western and Central Europes contribution came mainly from the United Kingdom (188,159), Germany (133,275) and France (96,440), but significant numbers of tourists also came from the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Denmark, Austria, Belgium and Norway, each of which generated more than 10,000 visitors. Russia, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Poland, although classified by the SLTDA as Eastern European countries, also made significant contributions totaling a further 161,171 tourists.

Statesman in motion
That was a beautiful, clear, morning. Don Stephen Senanayake comes to Galle Face Green for horse-riding with his close allies, Richard Aluvihare and G G Ponnambalam. While riding the horse, they have a small talk on development plans for Ceylon, an independent state yet to be sovereign.
Saman Weeraman delivering the welcome speech at the Muhurath ceremony.
Everything turns upside within a few seconds.
Don Stephen Senanayake has a fall unexpectedly. Before his allies could understand anything, Senanayake faces his fate. And that indicates the beginning of Suneth Malinga Lokuhewas latest cinematic venture, Nidahase Piya, the first political biopic of Sri Lanka.
Nidahase Piya introduces a host of personalities dealing with Don Stephen Senanayake including Oliver Goonetilleke, Ponnambalam Ramanathan and S W R D Bandaranaike. History-based films have once been the pinnacle of Sri Lankan film-making. However, Lokuhewa makes an attempt to buck that trend. He treads a not-so-easy path.
When we made Sinhavalokanaya it was a new experience to the audience. If we made this film in 1997, immediately after the 1996 World Cup win, we could have raked in blueblood profits. But we made that film in 2010 to encourage the 2011 World Cup.
Nidahase Piya shooting will begin towards the end of January and will be released to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Independence in 2018. The shooting will take place in areas such as Colombo, Mirigama and Ranmihithenna.
While digging for information, the Nidahase Piya team found out that the film will be an ideal pathway for the younger generation to familiarise the Sri Lankan history. However, he was not short of challenges.
The casting was the main challenge. All the lead characters are known personalities in the Sri Lankan history. And the people have already seen them in pictures. Some of them are on youtube too on brief video clips. Their audio clips are also available. That means we cannot cheat our audience. So we had to choose characters with some resemblance to those key figures.
Lakshman Mendis will perform as elderly D S Senanayake
Lakshman Mendis will perform as elderly D S Senanayake, while Tumindu Dodanthenna will perform as the statesman in his younger days.
Nidahase Piya offers a cinematic interpretation to Sri Lankas historical incidents such as formation of the Temperance Movement in 1912 as well as some other minor, yet very much intriguing, incidents in the iconic premiers life.
Suneth Malinga Lokuhewa
The scriptwriting was teamwork with contributors aplenty, including Justice and Buddhist Affairs Minister Dr Wijedasa Rajapakshe who is also the producer of the film. About 20 percent of the script is in English, which used to be the main medium of expression between DS and his colleagues. The research executed by an academic team of Kelaniya University has also been instrumental in drafting the script.
Believe it or not, I have had the timeline of DS. It included the trivia that many of us had not known before, Lokuhewa notes.
That was the very first activity: filling the gaps in the timeline up to the untimely death of the protagonist.
Exploring other personalities who dealt with DS was quite important. One such major figure is Henry Pedris, who was shot down at the Welikada prison. If not for that historical incident, gaining Independence would still have been confined to talks. The local politicians, irrespective of their ethnic origin, leagued to fight for Independence.
Next, the camera pans to portray the world situation. DS Ceylon was struggling amid two major World Wars which took a huge toll on the little island. The world situation offers a better picture to local events. For instance, E W Silva sailed to England. That he had a letter tucked inside his shoes is common knowledge. The sailing was not, however, recommended during the period as there were constant attacks of torpedo.
One may naturally place this film under the documentary genre. However, Lokuhewa loathes that genre.
This is essentially a feature film. There have been a number of biopics such as Lincoln, Gandhi, Queen, Iron Lady and Kings Speech. They are categorised as features films at the Oscars, Lokuhewa observes.

But a post-mortem examination, conducted on December 30, proved inconclusive.
Messages posted on Fawazs Twitter account on January 1 suggested George had committed suicide, but the hairstylist insisted he was not responsible for the tweets and blamed hackers for spreading the false rumours.
Now Georges family members have issued a new statement, insisting they are still struggling to come to terms with the loss of the former Wham! star.
George Michaels family refusing to speculate on cause of death.
In the week since his tragic death there has been much comment and speculation concerning George and the circumstances surrounding his death, reads a statement issued by his loved ones to BuzzFeed News.
There will inevitably be more in the future. The family remain devastated by his passing and have no wish to comment in relation to any such speculation, whether current or in the future.
Thames Valley Police officials previously ruled out any suspicious circumstances surrounding Georges unexpected death, and after the inconclusive autopsy, revealed further tests would be carried out to determine the nature of his passing.
The results of these tests are unlikely to be known for several weeks..., they continued in a statement.

Sunhill Group celebrates Silver Jubilee on Jan 16
The Sunhill Group of Companies which has made a mark as one of the leading Hotel and entertainment enterprises in the country would be celebrating 25 years on January 16.th
From the day he could remember Wasantha Perera had a passion for the entertainment industry. His character was such that he always thought big and this may be the reason for him to take wing to Japan not only to pursue his studies but also to get employed. After being in Japan for three years he came back to unleash his dream.
Filled with ides and hungry for opportunities Wasantha stuck a right note when he decided to convert their family home (Mahagedara) in Nuwara Eliya to a star class hotel. The experience gained in Japan helped him to add a rich class of touch to this Rs 12 million venture. He names this 12 room property 'Sunhill Hotel'.
The quality of service that was offered at the hotel with the personal touch from Wasantha saw Sunhill gaining popularity and it soon became the talk of the town. With Sunhill maintaining high occupancy levels he decided to introduce excursion packages and bought a fleet of vehicles including jeeps.
Through his counter parts in Japan. Wasantha moved in to car sale and leasing business, becoming the first entrepreneur in the hill country to do so. He then diversified in to the real estate and even today he maintains his venture offering lands in prime locations for a competitive price.
Next in line was the establishment of 'Sunhill Property Development (pvt) Ltd' a real estate and property development venture which has successfully maintained to this date. In 1996 Wasantha bought over a seven room hotel property in Kandy and moved down his car sale and leasing business to Kandy. In 1996 he moved down the releasing and car sales business to the hill capital.
With the war raging he observed that Colombo city was lacked entertainment and decided to move in. His first investment was 'After Dark' Night Club in Kollupitiya and then bought over the 'Pier Three' Property.
He also pioneered winter place in Colombo 02 to add the entertainment blitz to the city of Colombo. He also pioneered Lush Night Club, Bristo Latino and several ventures.
Sunhill Group also diversified in the telecom industry by setting up business in Colombo 3 and Kotahena. One of the biggest investments he made during that time was to acquire a 12 room hotel in Mount Lavinia and reinvested to upgrade it to a 25 room hotel with a swimming pool.
With intention of adding a city hotel to his profile he invested on a 25 room neglected hotel in Colombo 3 in 2007 and turned it around to a star class hotel. Today Sunhill Hotel Colombo in marine drive offers 80 rooms, two restaurants serving both Chinese and western cuisine. It also has facilities to host conferences and private parties and a spa.
Two chefs from china are also working in the restaurants making it one of the most sought after restaurants for Chinese food both by locals and foreigners.
Later he built two hotels in Mount Lavinia and Katunayake mainily targeting tourists ,airport transit passengers and airline Crew. The European concept of entertaining was introduced to Colombo with the opening of the Texas Pub Colombo 03. Texas would take up 120 guests and today it is one of the most sought after entertainment spots in the city.
His pioneering venture Sunhill Hotel Nuwara Elya also won Global accolade when it was nominated best economy class hotel in 2011.
Under the Sunhill group nearly 400 are employed and the Group also allocates millions each year for CSR initiatives.

Suspect further remanded for  assaulting doctor
A suspect who allegedly assaulted a doctor at a private hospital in Colombo further remanded by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday till January 23
The mentally unfit suspect who attacked psychiatrist Nirosha Mendis was arrested by Slave Island police.
Police said Dr. Mendis was severely injured in the incident and admitted to the ICU and the suspect, 31, a resident in the Boralesgomuwa, had gone to for consultation to the doctor.
The suspect had allegedly harassed the doctor while he was treating him on October 9. The suspect had allegedly assaulted the doctor at another time as well when he was walking along the corridor. Security guards on duty had tried to overpower him and hand him over to the police, but the doctor, taking into consideration the suspects mental condition, had prevented them from taking him to the police.
In this particular incident, he had tried to stab the doctor in his room. The Defence Counsel appearing for the victim said the suspect had waited for three hours to carry out the attack. He had stabbed the doctor eight times.
The seriously injured doctor is receiving treatment.

Tourism arrivals affected by airport closure, SriLankan pull out from Paris, Frankfurt
Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka will definitely be below the target in 2017,Sri Lanka Tourism Chairman, Paddy Withana said.
He said that one reason for this will be the closure of the Colombo airport for repairs and also the discontinuation of SriLankan Airlines flights to Frankfurt and Paris. Tourists always prefer a quick connection and German arrivals are likely to reduce due to this.
He also said that the airport closure too will have a negative impact on arrivals. All these will not allow us to go for the target of 3 million arrivals.
Sri Lanka recorded around 2.1 million arrivals for 2016 and 224,791, for the month of December alone.
Meanwhile in contrast an official from Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators Association said the re use of the Mattala Airport by SriLankan Airlines to Chinese destinations will allow Chinese tourists to use the Deep South as well. Its now up to the hotels in the South and Tourist associations to capitalise on this and pick up passengers from Mattala.
He however said that the Hambantota Harbour special economic opening negative publicity had damaged the image of Sri Lanka to some extent. A fresh international marketing campaign is needed to heal this wound.
Tourism Minister John Amaratunge predicted that the industry will record an income of $ 4.5 billion in 2017 with 2.5 million tourist arrivals as Sri Lanka gains much attention from tourists globally next year.Sri Lanka has earned a record revenue in the excess of US $2.5 billion up to the end of September. Withana, a professional hotelier with over 30 years in the industry said that due to various tourist spots being opened up in the North East and the Deep South, today the average room night stay too has increased to almost 11 nights per stay.
The country also maintained high occupancy levels for 2016 and ended the year with around 77%. He also predicted that the industry would collect around Rs. 2.2 billion from CESS for 2016.The Chairman said that tourism today is on an upward trend and one of the key drivers for the tourism growth was the peace dividend in Sri Lanka. I must also add that the volatile situation in some of the popular tourist destinations especially in Europe too has helped Sri Lanka to attractadditional tourists.
This is also the reason why big global players like, Hyatt, Movenpick, Shangri-La, OZO, Anantara, Dusit Thani, and several others have opened in Sri Lanka.
In addition existing hotels are adding capacity while several local players too have entered the industry which is very encouraging. Today we have 33,000 star class rooms and these will significantly increase after opening of several new hotels next year.
Withana said that job creation too has increased and today tourism is a major contributor to the GDP.

One of the advantages of the industry is that the benefits as well as revenue trickles down to the grassroot levels and dependents from the industry too have increased.
He also said that the Port City project will have a major positive impact for the tourism industry. The proposed Marina, shopping complexes, apartments and recreation facilities will not only bring huge foreign direct investments but also additional tourists.
Withana said that the pulling out of SriLankan Airlines from Europe and the airport closure for three months will have a negative impact for the industry. But this is short term and the runway repair is a crying need to stop a would be airline disaster. Commenting on the World Tourism Market (WTM) next month in London he said it is a very important event since they will be able to aggressively market Sri Lanka not only in London but in the entire Europe. For the first time we will conduct three road shows in London to promote Sri
Lankas tourism, Withana added.

Uncapped pace bowler Duanne  Olivier  to replace Abbott: Third and final Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday
JOHANNESBURG, Monday : Uncapped pace bowler Duanne Olivier has been included in South Africa' squad for the final Test against Sri Lanka starting in Johannesburg on January 12 following the axing of Kyle Abbot, who quit international cricket in favour of a Kolpak deal with Hampshire.
Oliver, 24, is the leading first-class wicket-taker for the season with 28 wickets at 21.60 in the Sunfoil Series. Wayne Parnell has retained his place in the squad, and there is a chance South Africa could consider an all-pace attack at the Wanderers, a venue which is likely to further challenge Sri Lanka's vulnerabilities against pace and movement, after they conceded the series with a 282-run defeat in Cape Town.
Uncapped Theunis de Bruyn also keeps his place as the reserve batsman, although there are unlikely to be any changes in that department unless injuries occur. The match will mark Hashim Amla's 100th Test.
Meanwhile, AB de Villiers and Morne Morkel will play for Northerns next week with a view to them being available for selection for the final T20 against Sri Lanka ahead of the one-day series.
De Villiers, who quit the Test captaincy prior to the Sri Lanka series, has not played since the CPL in July due to an elbow injury.
Morkel has been recovering from a back injury which has limited him to one first-class outing this season.
South Africa squad: Faf du Plessis (capt), Duanne Oliver, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Stephen Cook, Theunis de Bruyn, Quinton de Kock (wk), JP Duminy, Dean Elgar, Keshav Maharaj, Wayne Parnell, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada.

USAID water project benefit 100,000 in disaster prone areas
The United States Government joined State Minister Sudharshini Fernandopulle and MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena on January 5 to launch an approximately Rs. 150 million programme to provide safe disaster-resilient drinking water to local communities.
This programme expands upon several previous USAID projects since 2012 that have provided sustainable access to drinking water to those areas in the South, East and North prone to droughts and floods. The United States is committed to help Sri Lankan families who face daily struggles with reliable sources of clean drinking water, said U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap.
The projects scope includes building rainwater harvesting tanks, providing pipe-borne drinking water facilities, and renovating local infrastructure to reduce the effects of floods and droughts. Locations of rainwater harvesting tanks will be prioritised for families and hospitals affected by the rising challenge of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), supporting the efforts of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Sri Lankan government to address this critical health concern.
The programme will support national and regional-level policies to minimise the impact of such disasters, while helping local communities adopt sustainable solutions for disaster-related water and hygiene needs.
Over 100,000 people are expected to benefit directly from this project.
I also take this opportunity to thank USAID for the excellent support provided to Sri Lanka in promoting rainwater harvesting and improving new technologies, said City Planning and Water Supply State Minister Sudharshini Fernandopulle at the launching ceremony.
This project will target communities in the North, East, and Uva province exposed to frequent natural disasters. Since 1956, the U.S. Government and USAID have worked in Sri Lanka to improve the lives of Sri Lankans, investing over $2 billion in agricultural and business development, education, health, energy and natural resources, good governance, and humanitarian assistance.

Waste not, want not
Recently I was waiting to board a bus from Dehiwela to Boralesgamuwa at around 9.45 pm. At this time there were no private buses. The last bus came to the halt at 9.50 pm. I asked the conductor what time the bus would be leaving.
He said 10.30 pm. The driver and conductor went to a close by hotel keeping the bus engine on. Till the bus left sharp at 10.30 pm, the engine was running for 40 minutes.
I asked the conductor as to why they had kept the engine on, wasting fuel.
The guy replied that the battery is weak and they have to push the bus if they did switch off the engine. I said I would complain to the relevant depot and conductor said no problem. The depot foreman has written in their log book to do Nonawathwa Dawanaya which means not to switch off the engine till the work is over. The funny conductor added that no one would have done it if they owned the vehicle.
This bus belongs to Maharagama depot. It would have run like this the whole day between Maharagama and Dehiwela 119 route.
How many buses run without the engine being switched off, I have no idea. But one thing is clear.
It is a colossal waste of state funds. I am writing this letter for your information, Transport Minister, please!
To make things worse, no one else was bothered about the running engine. Most passengers consisted of young boys and girls.
While the engine ran without the driver and the conductor, this young crowd was bothered only about the smartphones held on their palms.

## Title: Where justice  prevails

Where justice  prevails
Concerns have been raised about the preliminary report of the Consultation Task Force (CTF), particularly about hybrid courts and foreign judges.
It should be remembered that this report and its recommendations have not been finalized. Additionally, at the very beginning of the report, the CTF write that they are not making extensive recommendations themselves, but that this is merely a collection of ideas from various people to whom they have listened.
This whole discussion that has created some controversies about hybrid courts should, I think, require a little bit of thinking.
First and foremost, this issue must be looked at from the point of view of law and justice. After all, the idea of the court is to mete out justice at the end. If it fails, then all this talk is worth nothing. A court can deliver justice only if its judges meet the requirements in terms of their experience, education and, above all, their integrity and their being commitment to justice and not to do anything else. The motto should be: let the heavens fall, but justice will prevail.
Kangaroo courts
The independence of the judiciary does not require that only local judges can sit at a court. Local and
international does not apply. The reason for the blindfolded image is that they simply dont have
nationalities, their genes dont matter, they go by certain qualities. This is the only profession of that type, where we dont give any priority to anything but justice. Let the heavens fall, but justice must be done. They cannot say that they think in a particular way, that their ancestry guides them, or astrology or anything else
If we can find such judges in Sri Lanka, lets find them. There is no special requirement to bring anybody from outside. But if we cant find them, or we cant find enough of them here, then we should either bring them from somewhere else or we should not engage in the exercise at all, because there are only two types of courts: courts of justice, or kangaroo courts.
What we dont want to have are kangaroo courts. That is what we have to avoid. In order to do that, we need to advertise the required qualities and get people from wherever. This is not about genes. This is not about colour or about what country you come from. A judge, acting in their professional capacity, has no nationality. A judge has nothing else but justice. That is why Lady Justice is blindfolded. Once you sit as a judge, you dont belong to normal categories. It doesnt matter whether you are Indian, Sri Lankan or from elsewhere. There are many courts all over the world where there are mixture of people. For example, in Hong Kong, as a matter of practice, you always have judges from developed jurisdictions working with Hong Kong judges in the Court of Final Appeal. The goal is to maintain quality.
What we should have is justice of a quality that no one can challenge it. It will not listen to governments, it will not fear any repercussions; it will just be justice. If justice cannot be done, the judges would say that they cannot do justice here, and that they cannot do something false.
We can again reach global standards. This is happening in many other fields. See how many engineers are in this country who are foreigners. Suppose you say that no engineers should come from abroad: what would happen to all their enterprises See medical teams. This is happening all the time in every field.
Suppose we one day say that all foreigners are banned from participating in anything at all. What would become of us In the world today, it is not like that anywhere. There is some absurdity in this whole discussion.
International Court of Justice
The second thing is that nothing is of greater value by being called hybrid. The mere fact that you add a foreign judge to a team of others does not make it a good court. The best example is where I used to work, in Cambodia, where there was an experiment with a so-called hybrid court. It was a complete failure.
The issue is the ensure quality. If the quality can be ensured by the talent we have, so much the better. Otherwise, open it up like any other employment opportunity and ensure that those people abide by quality.
If there is a fear that some foreigner may try to bring an agenda into this, it should be remembered that judges do not have agendas: judges do not have nationalities.
Many courts in the world have foreign judges. Many developing countries have in the past deliberately brought them in so as to raise their quality. Some of our judges, people from our system, are in other courts, such as in Fiji. There are so many of our judges there, including sitting judges. We have also sent prosecutors and judges to the International Court of Justice.
Sri Lankans have played their parts in other courts, and other people can also do the same thing here. The idea that any foreigner would be someone who is biased is, I think, a very false notion.
Of course, on the one hand there is the substantial issue, and on the other there is the political issue. Politically, the opposition tries to say that foreign judges will try to put our national heroes into jail, and other such allegations.
The government is then put in an embarrassing position, so they say they wont have the judges. Thats a political debate, but these are not issues that politicians can decide purely on political terms. The judiciary is not something that should be decided on political terms.
The independence of the judiciary does not require that only local judges can sit at a court. Local and international does not apply. The reason for the blindfolded image is that they simply dont have nationalities, their genes dont matter, they go by certain qualities. This is the only profession of that type, where we dont give any priority to anything but justice. Let the heavens fall, but justice must be done. They cannot say that they think in a particular way, that their ancestry guides them, or astrology or anything else.
In terms of the CTF objectives, it is essential to start with the issue of investigations. We cannot find the truth without investigations. Before we talk about judges, we should emphasize the need for proper and impartial investigations because, whenever a crime is reported, it is an absolute obligation to begin investigations immediately. The crimes reported include one of the most heinous crimes: enforced disappearances. People have already complained. The obligation of the government is to begin investigations. If the investigations bring out the truth, whether in favour or against the complaint, that determines what happens next. We should therefore concentrate all our efforts into that first step, which we simply cannot avoid: the issue of investigations.
Criminal justice system
This issue must be addressed step-by-step. Our experts, even those involved in transitional justice, look at books, but they dont look at the contextual issue. What is missing here in this country What is wrong Not only regarding crimes related to the civil war, but in normal crimes Our investigative system is in a serious crisis. In a normal murder or rape case, making a complaint doesnt mean that there will be an investigation. Sometimes there are. In many cases, it doesnt happen. There is something wrong in our basic criminal justice system. Making use of this larger issue, we should deal with our basic system. Correcting this is in everybodys interest. If something happens to me today, it is in my interest that there is a system where a complaint can be made and where complaints will be investigated.
This is not a matter for speculation. We dont speculate about crimes. We investigate crimes. It is a serious art and science.
Rather than borrowing some terms from elsewhere and putting it into a report, we should look at the local situation and see what is wrong with it. A critique should be made of the local situation. If someone is not happy with the local judiciary being able to do this job, make a proper critique of that and explain why.
Politicians may raise obstacles to foreign judges, but no question is being asked about what the people want. Would the people want justice or a farce Some kind of bluff, followed by conviction or acquittal We dont want courts that are committed to convicting or acquitting people without due process. It should be according to justice. So do you want a court of justice, or some kind of bluff This is a matter for the people, primarily, and if the people begin to demand this, all these parties will have to listen.
Political parties should listen to the people. Here we have it the other way: we borrow our ideas from political parties. The whole nature of democracy is to get the people to say what they want to the political parties. That should not be turned the other way.
In the Sri Lankan mentality there is almost an inability to go beyond surface politics and into the realities of how things happen. Everything is just for the newspaper or the media, for talk, and not about how to get things done. Justice is done by people involved in justice. That is, investigators, prosecutors, judges; these people do justice. Politicians dont do justice. In fact, fighting against injustices done by politicians was how the justice project came about. In England, you had to fight against the King, to the point that one of first heads of states to be killed was in England, in search of justice. Justice will never come from the hands of politicians alone.
Justice institutions
If the whole country can only be run by politicians, then we dont need any other kind of professions. We wouldnt need accountants or doctors, only politicians.
People must be able to rely on justice institutions. That brings out the real question: Do we want anarchy to prevail in this country Lawlessness Or do we want the rule of law back That is kind of issue that should be central issue in these reports. The core question should be: what is happening to the rule of law Will this court, whichever court it is, be respected within the framework of the rule of law Will they help to stabilize this country Will they make it a country that is safe for everybody, where it is safe for people speak out and participate Will that happen or will it just be people living in fear
The greatest assault on the dignity of a victim or their family is to deny the truth of what happened to the victim. We cant resolve that by any other means, including giving facilities, though that is indeed necessary. Nobody disagrees on the fact that infrastructure and other necessities should be provided. But that does not restore dignity to a person. If my brother was killed and I dont know what happened, if he was arrested and then disappeared, I would suffer all my life with that idea, asking what happened. That would go to the very depth of my dignity.
Justice is more important to a nation than anything else, and that is what we are rapidly forgetting. We had that idea up until the 1978 Constitution. We believed that justice was fundamental. Without justice, we will not have a sense of dignity at all. Today, the whole nation suffers from the fact that we are unable to have a system of justice that we can look at and say: even if everything fails, if politicians fail, at least in the sacred vicinity of a court of justice, we get justice.
