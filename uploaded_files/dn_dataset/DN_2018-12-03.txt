IMPLEMENTING ACCESSIBILITY LAWS IS IMPERATIVE
The International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD), since 1992, has been annually observed around the world on December 3.
The theme for this years IDPD focuses on the Empowering Persons with dis-Abilities for inclusiveness, equal opportunity and equality in daily life.
Life is all about accessing with equal opportunity and safety to what you need and what you desire day-to-day.
Hence, accessibility with SAFETY to all parts of Buildings and Services (includes Transport) the public needs to access and use in daily life, is not only an inherent right but an essential prerequisite.
The right to enjoy meaningful participation in the economic and social life as FULLY FLEDGED CITIZENS involves easy and safe access to key parts of buildings (steps and railings, toilets, entrances, floors, etc.) used for commercial (hotels, restaurants, banks and ATMs, etc.), educational, health (hospitals), recreational (shopping complexes, sports stadia, etc.), social (places of religious worship, etc.) and travel (railways, buses) purposes.
Therefore the degree to which you could meaningfully enjoy the RIGHT TO ACCESS with Safety shall determine the quality of ones life.
It is thus the single most indispensable right on which meaningful enjoyment of several of these other rights depend heavily.
It is also the right to empower the widest range of people to unlock their varying abilities and enjoy the optimum use of gainful opportunities afforded by development programmes and thereby live life to its fullest.
It shall also benefit wider sectors including pregnant mothers, persons carrying small children or heavy luggage and those convalescing after surgery or illnesses.
Consequences of denial of meaningful enjoyment of this indispensable right include: marginalisation, unwanted dependency, push towards poverty, loss of productive opportunities and thereby potentially CRIPPLING precious human life, economically, socially and mentally.
Real world you live
An estimated 20% of Sri Lanka population  i.e. 4 million people  for different reasons, experience restrictions and limitations to physical mobility, stability and dexterity, even to eye sight.
This includes our fastest ageing population (over 65 years are almost a sixth of our population), a wide range of people inclusive of those convalescing, living with numerous debilitating medical conditions (that often go unnoticed), using wheelchairs and sticks and even the pregnant.
With a blink of an eye, ABILITY could change to varying degrees. Every one of us, for different reasons, is certain to spend some of our time living with limitations in ability - physical, sensory and intellectual.
In day-to-day life in Sri Lanka, STILL, tens of thousands of people with restricted abilities often remain largely marginalised in the man-made environment. They are forced to fight an uphill battle, even at NEW public buildings.
Have you yet not realised that the chances are now very high that, at any stage or any moment in life, for a short time or for a long time, for different reasons, YOU or your loved ones, could experience physical and/or sensory limitations
With continual infringement of your inherent right to Access you will soon be amongst a most vulnerable and fast increasing, VOICELESS, UNDERPRIVILEGED and marginalised group of nearly 4 million people who are unable properly to access even NEW Buildings.
You will then realise that the world around once you knew to be cheerful and kind, is NO MORE so; and most of your essential needs that were easy doing, are now a burden and you are unwantedly depending on others.
The world around would marginalise you and discriminate against you beyond expectations, perhaps for lifetime.
Poor implementation of Access Laws
Sri Lanka enacted the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No: 28 of 1996. Clause 23(2) of this Act stipulates:
No person on the ground of Disability, be subjected to any Liability or Restriction with regard to access to or use of ANY BUILDING or Place which any other Member of the Public has Access to or is entitled to use.
Under Clause 23(2) of this ACT, by Gazette No: 1,4657/15 dated October 17, 2006, the Ministry of Social Services promulgated a very comprehensive detailed set of Regulations clearly stipulating: Design and Space Requirements and Safety Measures to be adopted in NEW Constructions.
These Regulations were then approved unanimously by our Parliament on March 20, 2007.
Despite three extensions of the deadline by the Social Services Ministry and valiant renewed endeavours, compliance with these Regulations remain poor, except for bits and pieces, here and there, even after 12 years.
Worst offenders include many 5 and 4 star hotels and upper-class restaurants, numerous places of higher education institutes and universities, private sector hospitals, high-end shopping complexes, supermarkets and all forms of transport.
The parts affected most are toilets, steps and railings, signage and ramps at entrances. Even the design of tables and desks at receptions and in restaurants continue to pose inaccessibility.
The regulatory authorities have continuously failed to ensure compliance BEFORE issuing Certificate-of Conformity.
Construction companies obtain Certificates-of Conformity in the absence of due compliance well.
Compliance with design specifications that take into consideration human safety is a low cost and feasible indispensable investment bringing rich dividends to everyone in society.
The colossal waste and the threat to safety of human life caused by the failure to comply with the Laws, is huge compared to the money needed.
The long term mega-development projects are inextricably entwined with the future of the next several generations of Sri Lankans. With this on-going adverse trend there is imminent national disaster, as the next generation of persons suffering from inevitable mobility impediments - numbers of whom will be much larger than at present  will also be prevented from freely accessing and using the facilities there in at a wide range of numerous NEW buildings and enjoying this next phase of development of Sri Lanka.
Back-peddling of the UN Convention (CRPD)
Based on a proposal made by the Social Services Minster, on February 8, 2016 the Government of Sri Lanka ratified the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
Near three years have passed but nothing yet has resulted - even to make a start to implement such a legally binding agreement!
Article 9 together with Articles 6 and 7 concerns Accessibility and easy measures to start implementing the CRPD.
The International Community, the UN in particular, who are much concerned about several other rights in this part of the world, in their actions, regretfully, appears to have overlooked the worlds largest minority  the people with dis-Abilities - and allow countries such as Sri Lanka to remain stuck at CRPDs birth itself for so..long - as near three years - without even starting to crawl in the right direction.
Root causes and remedial action
Although comprehensive sets of Regulations are there since 2006, continual absence of a rightly identified and clearly stated set of steps enabling effective implementation, remains the stumbling block.
As the first step to arrest this trend, in 2009 I appeared in person on a wheelchair at the Supreme Courts and successfully pursued a public interest litigation fundamental rights application under SCFR 221/2009. With continual close observations over the last seven years (2012  2018), on the enforcement of the Accessibility Laws and a Court Order dated April 27, 2011, a set of 23 professionals of us possessing the widest practical knowledge on this subject, have not only identified the root causes for continual failures and significant lapses but formulated a technically sound set of 10 remedial measures - with each proposed action focusing to arrest and solve a specific major problem.
On this International Day it must be encouraging news for the 4 million Sri Lankans with limited mobility - the largest minority of people of Sri Lanka  that I have already moved the Court to re-activate invocation under SCFR 273/2018 to seek redress in this regard.
We are positive that the APEX Court, in the larger national interest, shall soon incorporate all these measures in full to the anticipated comprehensive judgement and thereby enable us to start implementing more focused measures WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY, towards achieving realistically our long felt dream, Accessible Sri Lanka for All.

## Title: The innovative entrepreneur will find reliable ways to fund his start-up

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 13
The innovative entrepreneur will find reliable ways to fund his start-up
Our previous instalments were intended to help you put the foundation of your small business in place: coming up with your best idea, figuring out what it will cost to create a business, drafting a business plan, and choosing the right legal structure are the basic building blocks of any successful small business.
Now you can build on that solid foundation. Getting the money to realize your dream can happen only if you have a solid foundation in place; any lender or investor will want to see that those pieces are set.
As emphasised by us earlier, even if you are going to self-fund the business - through savings, credit cards, or some other plan - this foundation is no less important, as it is the basis for creating a small business that will last. If you have done the work suggested in the previous instalments you know exactly how much money you will need to get started and stay open, which puts you far ahead of most new small business entrepreneurs, who have only a vague idea of how much money they will need.
Now the difficult question is where will you find the money to start your business.
Sources
There are many sources of funding - which is good, because it is highly unlikely that you will secure all of your required funding from one place. Maybe you will combine personal savings and credit cards with a small industry loan and a gift from an uncle. Who knows While finding the money to fund the dream is always a challenge for an entrepreneur, it is part of the job.
Yes, it will be tough, you may get discouraged, and you may not raise as much money as you want; but remember, countless new business owners have found the money to start their businesses, and if they did it, you can, too. If you have a good idea and a solid plan, you can do it.
The vast majority of small businesses are started, at least partly, using the entrepreneurs own funds. Indeed, even if you are looking to outside investors, most will want to see that you are sharing some of the financial risk. Yes, tapping your savings for a new, untried venture is a scary thought, but remember, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing to take a risk with money to make money.
Risking some of your own money, then, is part of the job description. Where do you find that money
The Friends and Family
The next most common method of funding your start-up is to find friends and family members who believe in you and your vision and are willing to invest in your new company. Again, this is where your business plan will be necessary. If you can show potential investors a plan that makes sense, the chance of getting them to invest greatly increases. A great thing about this option is that friends and family tend to lend or invest either interest free or at very low interest rates, which makes your job much easier.
Especially at the beginning of your venture, capital is precious and must be,if not horded, at least highly respected. You need to keep your overhead as low as possible; low interest on debts helps, and that is why this can be an attractive option.
The danger, of course, is that most small businesses are not home runs. Far more likely, you will create a successful business that makes a nice profit and affords you some freedom and a good standard of living. But if that does not happen, if the business does not fly, owing money to friends and relatives for a failed business venture is not a pleasant experience.
You have been warned. For the banks lending money to an untried, brand-new start-up is just about the riskiest. Home loans are secured by collateral, as are car loans. Loans to existing businesses offer some security because the business has a track record. But the new start-up has none of those things, and so getting a conventional bank loan for a new business is not always easy, especially in the past few years. But the good news when it comes to bank loans is that banks want to lend you money.
That is their business, and many are working hard to get money in the hands of their small business customers. Other entrepreneurs get bank loans for their new ventures every day, and if they did, so can you. Of course, that often means using your home as collateral or signing a personal guarantee for the loan. The problem with a personal guarantee is that incorporating to reduce your personal liability will be a waste of time if you sign a personal guarantee for a bank loan. Then again, entrepreneurs have been known to do almost anything to get the show on the road, and that may be the price you have to pay. The upshot is that to get a business loan, you need to think like a banker.
The Four Cs
When lenders look to extend credit, they are most concerned with the four Cs:
1. Capacity. Do you have the ability to repay the loan A bank will want to see that your business has sufficient cash flow to service the loan, and thus it will ask to see your financial statements. A bank is much more likely to loan to a business that has been around for a while and has a track record. New start-ups with little history fail this test.
2. Collateral. Can you secure the loan with some sort of collateral If the answer is yes, then the likelihood of getting a loan is much greater. Just as banks do not make home loans without securing the loan by getting a deed of trust on the property, they also require some sort of collateral to secure a business loan. If you do not have collateral, you will likely need a co-signer who does.
3. Character. Does your business have a history of repaying loans on time Do you have a history of paying on time Because you will likely be asked to sign a personal guarantee for any business loan you get, your personal credit history is important.
4. Capital. How much money do you need, and why do you need it Youll need to come to the bank with financial statements, a business plan, and a solid explanation for the exact amount you want, how it will be used, and when it will be paid back.
Other considerations
Aside from the four Cs, banks may also look at two additional factors when determining whether to give you a loan (called underwriting).
Lets call these the two Es:
1. Equity. When you buy a home and begin to make payments, you build equity. If your house is worth $100,000 and you owe $75,000, then you have $25,000 in equity. It is the actual cash value of the property. Well, the same is true for your business.
Ironically, one way to get a business loan is to prove that you dont need one, and the way to do that is to build equity in your business. This can be done by retaining earnings or by receiving a cash injection from someone. Most banks like to see that your debt is no more than four times your equity. You need equity to make sure your ratios pencil out.
2. Experience. More relevant to a new start-up, your experience in the business and your experience in the area that the loan is going toward is a final factor that a banker will look at when conducting a lending analysis. So, do you qualify for a business loan
Lets find out. Do you have a good credit history (personal bank loans, outstanding credit card payments etc) Are your taxes up to date Do you have a financial plan showing how to repay the loan Does your business have equity Does your business have any debt Do you, the owner, have your own money invested in the business Does the business have collateral Would you be willing to personally guarantee the loan Do you have a solid management team Do you have a solid business plan
Unless you answered Yes to all questions, you may have a hard time getting a loan.
The government knows how important small businesses are to the Sri Lankan economy.
Therefore, it encourages commercial banks to offer SME loans. For example, Sanasa Development Bank offers SME loan scheme which allows successful micro-entrepreneurs to graduate to SME status through existing SME clients, the provision of credit facilities for expansion of business activities and a range of support services. All commercial banks provide credit facilities to Micro Small and Medium scale Enterprises and constructors to purchase related machinery and equipment and other requirements.
The good news is that your credit need not be perfect to get a microfinance loan.
The final option is to find a partner. Finding a partner with the money when you provide the great idea and sweat equity is a tried-and-true business funding option. There are risks involved in partnerships but those depend on the type of partners you select.

## Title: Local canned fish producers in dilemma

Local canned fish producers in dilemma
The government must support the local canned fish industry to be self-sufficient, urged Canned Fish Manufacturing Association of Sri Lanka (CFMASL) President Shiran Fernando at a press briefing held at TESS Group of Companies head office in Colombo recently.
With some relief, we could develop the industry and save the country US$ 64 million annually which is spent on the import of canned fish from overseas. The canned fish consumption is approximately 175,000 cans per day in Sri Lanka and we have the capacity to provide 75 percent of the total requirement, he said.
Fernando said the previous government had earlier agreed to purchase their products and sell them through the Lak Sathosa network granting an Rs 20 concession for each can from last July. However despite this promise, neither the Lak Sathosa nor the Treasury had taken meaningful steps to settle the arrears accumulating to Rs. 26 million till date. This has severely hampered their production ability, he cautioned.
Fernando said in February 2015, the then government reduced the import duty levied on canned fish by more than 50 percent. This had a negative impact on locally produced canned fish. He therefore urged the government to reinforce the duty on imported canned fish to at least the level that existed before February 2015 to safeguard and uphold the local industry.
He said they had also prepared a five-year strategic plan for the Sri Lankan canned fish manufacturing industry and expressed optimism that the plan could be carried out for the benefits of the industry. Fernando was upbeat that the plan will boost the production capacity as well as the living standards of the fishing community in Sri Lanka
Fernando noted that four companies were engaged in canned fish production in Sri Lanka currently and the countrys capacities were thoroughly under-utilized due to large stocks being imported from countries such as China, Chili and Thailand. He added that the local canned fish industry has purchased over Rs 100 million worth fish from the local fishing community for the past seven months itself and about 250,000 people were engaged in fishing industry at present.

National security thinned under UNP - Dullas
Fridays execution-style killing of two police officers in Battcaloa that shocked the country calls into question the extent to which the national security in the country has deteriorated over the last three years, the government top brass yesterday conceded.
The officers were shot dead while manning a checkpoint in the former war zone. Their hands were tightened behind their backs and their weapons seized.
Minister Dullas Alahapperuma said, the incident will not be taken in lighter vein by the government.
Meanwhile, a high level investigation is underway to hunt down the criminals.
Minister Dullas Alahapperuma said, this is the result of the former governments failure to address the problems related to national security then and there when they occurred.
Not only that, the former UNP regime were in the habit of politicizing the issues,he said.
The Aava group issue is a good example. When this criminal gang surfaced from Jaffna, the ministers of former government said that Aava is a gang cooked up by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for political mileage.
They said there is no such a gang and that the Joint Opposition members were spreading rumours. The UNP ministers told the country that there were no such security threats, he said.
They also dismissed a request from the then Army Commander to control the situation, he said.
The former government had also taken steps to remove the names of some LTTE sympathisers from terrorism blacklists, he pointed out during a talk show on a national TV channel.
The former government allowed leaders of those LTTE sympathizer organisations to come into the country, he said.
The UNP-led government offered their full support to these groups. They even went on to direct the media not to report incidents in the North, he reflected.
One must not forget that the former government had taken steps towards paralyzing the countrys intelligence service. Many security intelligence officers were put in prison during their time, he added.
It may not happen overnight, but we will bring the situation under control, the minister stressed.
The minister also extended his condolences to the families affected by the deaths of two Police officers.

Panadura Bar Society claims police B report false
Panadura Police Special Crime and Fraud Bureau (SCFB) OIC SI Jayanath had filed a B report before the Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandana Liyanage stating that Lawyer Udeshika Jayasinharchchi obstructed the duties of a constable at the SCFB on October 9, 2018.
When the report was called before Court, the lawyers of the Panadura Bar Society objected and appealed Court to hold an inquiry under the IGP.
The Chief Magistrate ordered the IGP to hold an inquiry into the alleged incident and submit a report to Court. On orders of IGP Pujith Jayasundara, Nugegoda divisional ASP Kavinda Piyasekera held and inquiry and submitted the report to Court on Thursday.
He stated in his report that the B report by the OIC had given a wrong impression to Court and that the constable had not obstructed the duty of the lawyer who visited the SCFB on the day. Panadura police Chief Inspector Sujith Priyantha represented the SSP and sought court permission to withdraw the B report.
The magistrate did not permit to withdraw the B report as the Panadura Bar Society had complained against the police stating that it was a false B report.
Senior lawyers Vajira Kavisinghe, Sugath Handunge and Panadura Bar Society Secretary Premarathna Jayasinghe objected the removal of the B report. When the B report was called on November 29 Colombo Police Head Quarters Superintendent Chula Jayasinghe along with the lawyers of the Law Division of the Police appeared before Court and attempted to settle but the lawyers of the Panadura Bar Association did not consent to settle the matter.

President Maithripala Sirisena has sent condolence messages on the Passing Away of the 41st President of the United States George H.W. Bush to US President Donald J. Trump and to President George H.W. Bushs son, former President George W. Bush.
The messages:
His Excellency Donald J. Trump President of the United States of America
Your Excellency,
It is with profound sadness that I learnt of the passing of the Honourable George H.W. Bush, the forty-first President of the United States of America.
A distinguished American in many fields and a devoted public servant for long years, President George H.W. Bush is most remembered by the people in my country for the visit that he undertook to Sri Lanka, along with President Bill Clinton, following the unprecedented devastation faced by us as a result of the December 2004 Tsunami.
During the visit, he spent much time with child survivors and listened to their experiences, addressing the emotional impact on the youngest survivors of the disaster. His empathy and kindness are entrenched in peoples minds.
On behalf of a grateful nation, I convey to you and to the people of the United States of America, our deepest condolences at this time of national mourning.
****
The Honorable George W. Bush Post Office Box 259000 Dallas, Texas 75225
Honorable George W. Bush,
It is with profound sadness that I learnt of the passing of your beloved father, the forty-first President of the United States of America, the Honorable George H.W. Bush.
He will be remembered by the American people as well as people all over the world, for his life of devoted public service, not only as President and Vice President of the United States of America, but as a decorated Naval aviator, Ambassador to the United Nations, US Envoy to China, a prudent leader, and a person who exuded kindness and respect to all those whose lives he touched.
Your father is most remembered by the people of Sri Lanka, for the empathy, kindness and thoughtfulness he demonstrated at a time when we faced unprecedented devastation as a result of the December 2004 Tsunami. Leading fund raising efforts on your behalf, President George H.W. Bush travelled to Sri Lanka with President Bill Clinton, days after the disaster.
Apart from examining the physical damage caused and meeting US troops involved in relief efforts, they took the time to interact with child survivors. President George H.W. Bush listened patiently to their stories and provided them much needed courage to rebuild their lives. The kindness he showed at a time of great despair, will always be treasured by all those who interacted with him.
On behalf of the people of Sri Lanka, I convey heartfelt condolences and thoughts and prayers to you and to the entire family of President George H.W. Bush at this time of personal grief.

According to the records of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, 45 cruise ships have called at the Port of Colombo in the last 10 months of this year which is 28.8 % increase against the corresponding period in 2017.

These years have been declared to ease the planning for the next three years to overcome all challenges in the fields of hotel and tourism in Sri Lanka by 2020.
Meanwhile, the Port of Colombo has witnessed the highest growth of 19.5% in transshipment container throughput for the first 10 months in 2018 as against the corresponding period in 2017. During the first ten months of 2018, the Port of Colombo handled 4,717,746 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of transshipment containers as against 3,948,163 TEUs handled in the corresponding period in 2017.
Under the leadership Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe, and advice by the Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Dr Parakrama Dissanayake the positive increase at SLPA controlled terminal, Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), and Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), and South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) collectively resulted in this increase.
Following Minister Samarasinghe assuming office as the Minister of Ports and Shipping, an exclusive 3-year plan was introduced to develop the entire port sector to establish Sri Lanka as the most preferred maritime gateway to South Asia.

National carrier SriLankan Airlines will continue its ongoing operations to all existing destinations, but amid stringent financial controls.
The first Board meeting of the airline held last Monday decided on a stringent cost cutting exercise amid overwhelming losses of the airline, SriLankan Airlines Chairman G. S. Vithanage told Daily News Business.
He also said that the new Board, under his stewardship as Chairman, decided to study the areas in which costs could be pruned which will also mean that there will be no salary increments or bonuses this year.
The approval has been given in principle to slash costs but the Board will be studying which areas would come under the aegis of this operation, the SriLankan Airlines Chief said. While conceding that there will have to be new recruitments in certain areas, the Board will also study areas in which staff could be reduced.
He added that there may be a Voluntary Retirement Scheme for those areas of the airline which will be planned as well.
He said that the National Carrier will also submit a report to the Treasury in due course to maintain the airline as a going concern with the accumulated staggering losses.
However, he stressed that the airline will not be applying to the Treasury for capital infusions at this stage. He also remarked that there will not be slashing of the existing route network at this stage. He said that he approved some routine payments yesterday at the first Board meeting which had been made for food purchases.

Transport Minister warns BIA contractors against delays
Delaying and failing to complete airport development projects on time would necessitate cancellation of contract agreements and cessation of payments, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva told contractors on Friday.
The Minister was speaking to contractors during an observation visit to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) where he looked into the progress of ongoing airport development projects.
He said the projects were scheduled to be completed by mid-2019, but construction has been delayed by the contractors.
The Minister visited the construction site of the new apron of the airport and also inspected renovation work at the passenger terminals. These projects are being carried out through a Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) concessionary loan.

Historic Army initiative
Tri-Service WOs, SNCOs come together for one-day workshop
A monumentally unique assembly of a few more than 2,000 Tri-Service Warrant Officers (WOs) and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) under one roof on a conceptual notion of the Army Commander for the first time in military history took place at Attidiya Eagles Lakeside Convention Hall last Monday (26).
The officers in a spirit of comradeship participated in a full-day seminar to receive updates on logistics and improved performance of their tasks, responsibilities, inter-relations, capacity, leadership skills, professional conduct and accountability issues.
The seminar, inaugurated by President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces as the chief guest, themed on the professional role of Tri-Service WOs and SNCOs, was also designed to mould those attendees to be role models for their junior rankers who would often interact at first with WOs and SNCOs for resolution of their concerns while on duty.
The ceremonial event was also graced by Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe and Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy. Recital of the National Anthem, Army song and the two-minute silence to honour the memory of fallen war heroes set the stage for the days proceedings.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, extending a warm welcome spelt out why an educative seminar, targeting this category of Tri-Service personnel was launched for the first time under one roof. SNCOs are the backbone of the armed forces and it is you who steer the direction for those serving with you and you are the one who is the ombudsman for other ranks sharing their duties with you. Mutual understanding among the Tri-Services is essential and portends fellow-relationships.
You are the guiding light that provides guidance and relieves them of their grievances and burdens at first before they reach higher command. This attempt is therefore meant to expand your capacity which would help simultaneously elevate the capacity of the soldier with whom you are working. Cooperation with overseas regional partners too will broaden your horizons, the Commander said.
In his brief speech to the gathering, President Sirisena lauded the services rendered by these NCOs for conduct of logistics in the three service wings which in the post-conflict period have thrown their full weight behind realisation of the governments development and reconciliation goals. I would like to bow my head to all of you for your services before the war, during the war and in the post-war era. These were the major three sectors in the recent military history. Your services are much more required, but your retirement age does not permit you to continue. You are part of an Army recognised by the UN. Not every Army in the world is recognised in this way, the President said.
Speaker of the first session of the seminar, Brigadier S.N. Halangoda (retd), one of the most respected veterans in the Army, elaborated on how disciplined leadership skills of Tri-Service WOs and SNCOs impacts the progress of establishments. Eastern Commander Major General Aruna Jayasekera, Rear Admiral W. E. M. Sudarshana and Air Vice Marshal K. S. R. Fernando, in their separate presentations in the second session dwelt on dedication to nation-building through military experience while Kuma Iddamallena, reputed personality development and leadership trainer delivered a comprehensive lecture on promotion of professional efficiency through positive thoughts.
In the final session, Defence Services Command and Staff College (DSCS) Commandant Major General Ruwan Kulathunge added a new dimension to the seminar, touching on the subject of life after retirement and planning for retired life, in which he spelt out how the Army is geared to train potential Army retirees as well as those still serving the Tri-Services.
The days mega event drew to a close with the award of certificates of participation to all Tri-Service participants.
After Lieutenant General Senanayake assumed the mantle of command in the latter part of 2017, he took steps to implement a variety of capacity-based projects to elevate professional standards of the Army WOs, SNCOs and Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) who the Commander regards as the heavy-weight in the making of a soldier. Overseas interactive exchange programmes, introduction of pre-retirement vocational training slots, sending officers for overseas sports events, public appreciation of their achievements, and award of special monetary grants are among the most prominent, to cite a few of those projects.

Since the Impressionists, many artists have opted to leave the walls of their studios and instead paint on-the-spot. While this approach brings most people outdoors, diving instructor and professional painter Olga Belka has taken it to new depths with her underwater paintings.
Immersing herself in her two passions - scuba diving and painting - the Thailand-based creative crafts works of art while exploring under-the-sea ecosystems. Taking anywhere from two to six dives to complete, each piece offers viewers a glimpse into what Belka sees while below the surface, from colorful coral reefs to friendly schools of fish.
As a diving instructor, Belka is aware that not everyone has the means to see what she sees. And, she notes, photographs and videos cannot replicate the magic of the sea. Through art, however, she feels that she can best capture the indescribable beauty of what lies beneath.
Every time, while scuba diving, I want to capture the underwater beauty and share [my] impressions with other people, she says.
I want to share my vision of the underwater kingdom with the world.
While she doesnt divulge the exact mediums she employs, she explains that she has developed a unique technology of painting in salt water.
She also notes that her methods are eco-friendly, ensuring that she leaves a positive impact on the sea, her boundless resource of inspiration and energy. My Modern Met

UNP accepts Mahinda Rajapaksha as the PM
The United National Party has officially accepted that Mahinda Rajapaksa is the current Sri Lankan Prime Minister, the President of the National Alliance for Lawyers Associations and the Former Director of the National Livestock Development Board and the Industrial Technology Institute R.Manoj Gamage (Attorney-at-Law) said.

Addressing media in Colombo yesterday he said that the UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim had sent an official letter withe his signature to the TNA Leader R. Sampanthan stating that MP Ranil Wickramasinghe (not PM Ranil Wickramasinghe) will be nominated as the candidate for the Premiership from the United National Front. He had clearly mentioned the designation of the UNP Leader as a member of the Parliament.

According to the Attorney-at-Law Gamage, the letter is now being circulating all over the country through the Internet and anyone can see and read it. But still the UNP Leader is staying at the Temple Trees saying that he is the Prime Minister while his own political party's (UNP) General Secretary Kabir Hashim says he is only a member of the Parliament. This reveals the truth to the country.

UNP Leader condoles demise of President George Bush (Senior)
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has sent a condolence message to President George W. Bush on the demise of President George Herbert Walker Bush.
Dear President Bush,
It is with deep sadness that I write to extend my sincere condolences to you, to the entire Bush family and to the American people on the passing of your father, the forty-first President of the United States of America, the Honorable George Herbert Walker Bush.
He was an extraordinary leader, and his life was one that was dedicated wholeheartedly to public service. As a decorated Naval aviator, diplomat, Vice President, and President of the United States, he fulfilled the multiple duties, tasks and assignments he undertook and were called upon to undertake in his life, with a sense of commitment and dedication that inspired us all, and will continue to inspire many generations of Americans as well as young people around the world.
With remarkable diplomatic skill, President George H.W. Bush mobilised a multinational force in August 1990, working with the United Nations and ensuring the leadership of the UN in the liberation of Kuwait.
An active member of the International Democrat Union, he always stood and worked for a world order based on democracy and the rule of law. His contributions to the transition of the world order with the end of the Cold War, as well as arms control, will always be recalled with much gratitude by people around the world. He earned the trust and respect of world leaders and all those whose lives he touched. In so doing, he raised the stature of the United States of America in the eyes of the world.
Always during his Presidency and thereafter he maintained an interest in Sri Lanka, visiting our country on your behalf following the December 2004 Tsunami. Apart from leading fund raising efforts, he took the time to interact with child survivors, providing them solace and much needed inspiration when they were suffering from deep anguish.
The loss of two great leaders of stature, your father and Senator John McCain, within months of each other, is a grievous loss not only for the United States of America, but for the world at large.
At this time of loss and national mourning, while offering you and your family, our thoughts and prayers, I hope that your fathers life of dedicated service will inspire generations of young people in the United States of America and throughout the world to embrace the noble values that he stood for.
Ranil Wickremesinghe, Leader of the United National Party

## Title: Welcome measures to the export industry

Welcome measures to the export industry
It was said in a recent newspaper article that in the early 1990s the export earnings of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were roughly on par, approximately about 9 Billion US dollars. Today, a quarter of a Century later, the writer points out that our exports are a little more than twice that figure, whereas Bangladesh has increased their exports several times over.
A countrys achievements, as much as an individuals, can be gauged from those they measure themselves against. Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, emerged as an independent country only in the early 1970s, and that too after a devastating civil war. When the country was part of what constituted Pakistan, it was the poorer half, a common complaint being that they were discriminated against by the politically as well as militarily dominant West Pakistan, receiving only a small share of the national wealth; disproportionate to its size and contribution.
In its early years, Bangladesh was a synonym for hopelessness; huge population, grinding poverty, dim economic prospects and unusually subject to the vagaries of nature. So dire was the state of the newly created country that even small scale fundraising in its name were welcome, including musical shows. We recall the Concert for Bangladesh bringing on one stage the worlds most famous musicians of the era like Bob Dylan, George Harrison and Ravi Shankar, a musical plea for a peoples plight.
Export market share is not the only area of endeavour where Sri Lanka has yielded. Although, with the progression of time, there is a natural improvement in economic indicators, there is hardly any area of economic activity in which we have overtaken any comparable country. In fact, we have fallen behind in most aspects, which in real terms mean, losing market to our competitors. Even in the perennial tea, rubber and coconut, other producers have overtaken us. In the case of Bangladesh, it is mainly their garment industry that led them forward, an industry in which we had a two- decade lead start.
Social indicators
When it comes to social indicators, like education and health, although statistically nearly everyone has access to them in Sri Lanka today, the actual quality of these services is questionable.
There is no better pointer to their doubtful value than the choices made by the empowered; the rich folk and the powerful politicians, for whose health issues and the education of their children, Sri Lankan facilities are simply not good enough. It is said that even for a mere medical check-up our leaders fly to Singapore. It is very unlikely that children of any of the high and mighty are studying at any of our so called institutions of higher education.
They want the best; only an education in countries like USA, UK or Australia will suffice for their dear children.
Flagrant hypocrisy of the elite aside, the failure to keep up with international educational standards impacts every aspect of society, including the competitiveness of our economy. In many fields today, our professions function as closed shops; face competition, the whole structure will be shown as only a pretence at competence.
Nothing is left untouched by the pervasive failure; at the recently held Asian Games, Sri Lanka failed to win a single medal, while several smaller countries, with much less spending and no fanfare, managed to win medals. For several decades Cricket has been our only boast. Here too, we are now dropping our catches, it seems.
For many years, our failings were explained away by reference to the instability brought about by terrorist activity. We ignore the fact that prior to or even after the defeat of terrorism, our overall performance has been unimpressive, failing to achieve a growth rate which could propel us towards a Developed country status.
In a modern State, it is not possible for the people to decide every issue directly, so they vote in their representatives such as the President, parliamentarians and local-level members to run the affairs of the country on their behalf. But in an unmade society, that mandate is easily abused, the choice before the people is reduced to merely deciding between a robber and a blackmailer, Twiddle Dee or Twiddle Dum.
The two major political parties dominating the voter are more akin to mafia organisations, everyone is a businessman, manoeuvring only for financial and other benefits and anything goes. Experience has shown that representative democracy functions best, where a certain culture can be assumed. In the absence of such a culture the electoral process can become a sham, a manipulated endorsement of a process of abusing power.
When the economic and social power of the leader is far ahead of that of the voter, the relationship inclines towards one- that of patron /client. In our country there are political dynasties and families. Inevitably, they are wealthy or accumulate wealth by the power of politics. Like in the old caste system, we seem to interpret politics as a family vocation. Very many of the present members of parliament are children of former members. If a member is a newcomer, with no history of family politics, you can be sure that he is now grooming his child to succeed him, so launching a new dynasty.
A person taking to politics in Sri Lanka commences a life-time occupation, starting a life of service in his late teens he continues till the end, there is no retirement age. He is not held to a performance standard, nor a moral code. He may distribute goodies, jobs and favours in order to win votes. The system is of the politicians; created by the politicians for the politicians. Once elected to parliament, the MP becomes a valuable asset; he is deferred to; doors will open for him. In a corrupt and a cynical culture, they are the only ones who matter.
Decisive issues in parliament
When there are decisive issues in Parliament, it is said that a member may be offered inducements by either side, to vote their way. The MP may cross party lines, and at the next election quite easily obtain nominations from the other side.
Even a member who is defeated at the elections could be appointed to Parliament again through the prevailing list system. If not, there are many top public positions open for him, including ambassadorships. There is blanket disillusionment about the rotten system that prevails, but there is no will to break out. With a vulnerable economy, weak growth rate, constitutional confusions (constitutions created by the politicians, only with their subjective interests paramount) unwieldy laws, social disorder and corruption defining the country, none can claim a leadership equal to the task.
To the eyes of the world we display many of the recognized forms of a democratic system; regular elections, political parties, a vibrant media and a public service said to be impartial. But this is only a half-truth, the form belies the substance.
For example, our taxes, like in any democracy, are imposed by the parliament made up of peoples representatives. But the emoluments of the parliamentarians are tax free and they award themselves duty free vehicles and other benefits, including a substantial development budget.
The persons who impose taxes on society, with that tax money, obtain a plush lifestyle; bungalows, cars with drivers, servants, jobs for family members, bodyguards and much more; comforts that a tax payer may only dream of.
As Shakespeare would say something is rotten in the state of Sri Lanka; the country is broken and disillusioned, bereft of the spirit to overcome.

 No major FDI in Jaffna region
Very little development has been done by the former government to develop the North accused former President Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yalpanam and Founder Chairman - Jaffna International Trade Fair, K. Pooranachandran.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the launch of 10th Jaffna International Trade Fair, which will be held in January in Jaffna he said that only major notable development was the re constructing of the roadways and recreating the Colombo Jaffna railway line. (During the Mahinda Rajapaksa government.)
He said that the much talked about Achchuveli Economic Zone too is a major disaster as there are only five factories in it making it the smallest zone in the island. He said that one of the main reasons for this is that the lands in it were expensive and also no infrastructure is provided by the government.
If an investor wants to build a factory he has to pay large amounts to obtain land and then reinvest for this own electricity and water facilities. In contrast other BOI zones offer these facilities when an investor sets up a factory.
An entrepreneur himself Pooranachandran said that the red tape too is very high. I invested Rs. 5 million to build a bottle water plant three years ago but to date I have not got final approval as authorities come up with various point to discourage investors like us.
Though there is a Board of Investment office in Jaffna there services are not up to standard since there is no major FDI to the region. The 10th edition of JITF is to take place from January 25  27, 2019 attracting over 60,000 visitors each year, the event will have over 2,500 products on discount with entertainment and opportunities for all age groups. For the first time Chinese companies too would participate.
Chairman CCIY, V.K. Vignesh recalled that when they started the event in 2002 they faced tremendous hardships since the goods transported to the exhibition had to go through over 10 check points manned by both the Sri Lanka Army and LTTE.

Majority in House should be respected
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanyake speaking at a meeting in Tangalle said that the Tri-Forces should come forward because the Constitution is not upheld. The Tri-Forces must support the parties that protect the Constitution and not the parties that cause its desecration.
At the moment, there exists in the country a pseudo prime minister and a pseudo cabinet. The ministers of this pseudo cabinet do not attend Parliamentary sessions. As such, rules and regulations cannot be passed. The present pseudo regime has not been recognised by international leaders around the globe, the JVP leader said.
If any party shows a majority of 113, that majority has been obtained by offering bribes. The JVP will put an end to the present conspiracy and urge for dissolution of the present regime and holding of a general election to obtain the peoples mandate, he said.
Dissanayake said there is no necessity for the JVP to make either Ranil Wickremesinghe or Mahinda Rajapaksa the prime minister of the country. He said that if they allow President Maithripala Sirisena to destroy or curtail the provisions of the Constitution, future presidents will also do the same thing.
The JVP leader said the sole aim of Mahinda Rajapaksa was to crown Namal Rajapaksa and make him ether the prime minister or president of the country when the time is ripe. He said Mahinda Rajapakss wife also dreams of such an eventuality.

America mourns George H.W. Bush
US: Flags flew at half-staff across the United States on Saturday as Americans prepared for a week of solemn tributes to George H.W. Bush, in his home state of Texas and in the US Capitol, a day after the former president died aged 94.
Tributes poured in from world leaders in memory of the 41st US President, who guided America through the end of the Cold War and launched the international campaign to drive Iraqi strongman Saddam Husseins forces from Kuwait. Many of those same leaders are expected to attend Bushs state funeral next week, alongside President Donald Trump and his wife Melania. Trump paid the late leader a gracious tribute, saying he had inspired generations of his fellow Americans to public service. His accomplishments were great from beginning to end, Trump tweeted.
Declaring a national day of mourning for December 5 -- when the federal government and New York Stock Exchange will close in Bushs honour -- Trump also signaled his respect by calling off a press conference planned at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.
The days-long national farewell to Bush will begin Monday with a commemoration in Houston, where the Bushes lived for years and where he died on Friday surrounded by friends and family.
Bushs remains will travel back to Texas late Wednesday, where he will lie in repose at St Martins Episcopal Church in Houston with a funeral service the next day preceding his internment at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station. He will make his final journey aboard a funeral train.
At the Presidential library on Saturday, people came to sign the memorial book in Bushs honor, or lay flowers at the feet of his statue.
Bush was a decorated World War II pilot, diplomat and onetime CIA chief who saw his son George follow in his footsteps to the Oval Office -- making them only the second father-son duo in American presidential history, after John and John Quincy Adams.
From former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to current heads of state, leaders praised Bush both for his strength and his moderation, as well as the commitment to internationalism typified by his assembling of a global coalition to oust Iraqi invaders from Kuwait in 1991.
The oldest surviving former US president Jimmy Carter said Bushs administration was marked by grace, civility and social conscience. Britain took the rare step of lowering flags in government buildings, while Germanys President Frank-Walter Steinmeier praised Bushs unwavering support for the countrys reunification. Gorbachev called him a true partner in winding down the Cold War.
French President Emmanuel Macron mourned the loss of a leader who strongly supported the alliance with Europe -- drawing an unspoken contrast to Trumps frequent criticisms of the Old Continent.
Suffering from Parkinsons disease, Bush had been wheelchair-bound and in failing health. He is survived by his five living children and 17 grandchildren. According to Bushs longtime friend, the former secretary of state James Baker, quoted by The New York Times, Bushs final words were to the younger George, who was put on the speaker phone to say goodbye, to tell him he had been a wonderful dad and that he loved him.
I love you, too, Bush replied.
Born on June 12, 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts into a wealthy political dynasty, Bush left school to join the US Navy during World War II.
He flew 58 combat missions and was shot down over the Pacific by Japanese anti-aircraft fire. He returned home and graduated from Yale University before briefly working in the Texas oil industry. - AFP

Ada Patricia Jayawickreme
She was selfless and kind
It is with lots of love and affection that I write this appreciation of the wonderful life my mother led bringing up the three of us: myself, Hiranthi and Hemal. She was a wonderful mother and even with all her difficulties, she never said anything harsh to hurt the feelings of anyone, but bore everything during all difficult situations with a smile.
I can still remember the times when Hiranthi and Hemal were born; the way she cared for them. Later on, when Hiranthi and her husband Dr. Lalith began the Brookside Community Church, she became a live-wire of it to the end. It all started in Anuradhapura and then expanded to Bambalapitiya.
With those humble beginnings, the tree grew new branches, though Amma is no more with us to see it grow. So I write this with such wonderful memories of my mother who did such a lot of services to the underprivileged.
Amma was always concerned about our family and she was also very keen to know not only the progress of our studies, but later, the progress of our childrens studies as well.
She led a beautiful life, selfless and caring for others and touched the lives of the many whom came for blessings to the church. She was always willing to help those who were in need, especially those who came to listen to the word of God.
Though it has been a long time since you entered Eternal Glory to be with your maker, Hiranthi, Hemal and I remember you in our prayers; that you will be with the angels in paradise.

Sarath Malalasekera
He was phenomenal
Sarath Malalasekera always called everybody either sweetheart or dear; it was quite common in his vocabulary. In fact, he was a gentleman and kind helper to everyone.
I had associated with him for more than 30 years and never saw him angry. Sarath was always conversant, and most lawyers and judges were his close friends. He made it a habit to talk to them in the morning, before court proceedings commenced.
Sarath was a clever reporter who never missed any important court cases, and throughout his long career as court reporter, he upheld his credibility.
Reporting court proceedings is a tough job because even the littlest of mistakes may lead to contempt of court, but Sarath was a clever reporter who knew how to handle it. It is difficult to find people of his calibre.
Sarath was a very good friend; he was a kindhearted person. He departed from us forever, and I wish that he would attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Ajith Samaranayake
A dedicated journalist
The untimely death of Ajith Samaranayake, one of the foremost and renowned English journalists who was also a one-time Editor of the Sunday Observer and the Sunday Island, is an irreplaceable loss to Sri Lankan journalism.
Ajith was a distinguished old boy of Trinity College, Kandy, which was the cradle of many a brilliant Sri Lankan writers. Ajith was greatly respected for his informative writing which went into the hearts and minds of readers throughout the country.
He was also a prolific writer on arts, drama, cinema and literature. Apart from these, he was an eminent English editorial writer whose editorials were masterpieces of his forensic skills.
Ajith dedicated himself to the cause of gentlemanly journalism. His name became synonymous with English journalism for well over 20 years. He mesmerised the public with his well-selected vocabulary and maintained a friendly relationship with even those who opposed his views.
In addition to his dedicated service to journalism in Sri Lanka, he rendered an outstanding and unforgettable service through his brilliant writings. He enlightened many readers on various worldly topics.
He valued our national culture and heritage, about which he wrote so much. The demise of this popular journalist shocked and saddened the hearts of all those who had come in contact with him through print and electronic media.
Ajith used an inimitable style in writing and readers of his columns craved to read them daily. His life was rather short, but the imprint he has left on our society, especially in English journalism, is great.
Ajith lived a calm and collected life. His death is admittedly an irreparable loss to Sri Lankan journalism at a time his services were required the most. Nevertheless, he has become legendary in the annals of English journalism in this country.

Dr. Sinnathamby Thadsanamoorthy
Compassionate doctor
None of us can escape death. When we here of some deaths, we begin to think that some of them deserved to live for the sake of our society it was the same when we heard of the sudden passing of retired Medical Superindent Dr. Sinnathamby Thadsanamoorthy of Batticaloa. We lost a true patriot.
Dr. Thadsanamoorthy was a kind, charitable and sympathetic medical practitioner both in the government service and private practice. He treated everyone who came to him with kindness and understanding.
After retirement, he set up a private dispensary, but never charged from those who could not afford. He diligently served as a Medical Services Director in villages at the borders of Valaichchenai, Kaluwanchikudy and Vakarai.
He retired from the government service as Medical Superintendent of the Valaichchenai Base Hospital. Hailing from Palukamam, he had his education at the Kallady Shivananda Vidyalaya and later, graduated as a medical officer from the Jaffna University.
From 2010, he turned to spirituality and embraced the philosophy of the Bramhmakumaris; he received spiritual training in Rajasthan, India. He was also devoted to the Bramhmakumaris centre in Batticaloa and helped several others on the path to spirituality.
We express our grief and condolences to his wife, children and other members of the bereaved family.

Sunil S. Abeysundara
Leader with a warm heart
Sunil S. Abeysundara was a leader with a warm heart. He was insightful, courageous and determined, and was a father who advised and directed us to the correct path. He wore a smile wherever he went and to whomever he spoke to. Sunil Abeysundara was a gentleman.
He became the mayor of Kadugannawa in the early 1950s. Obtaining electricity and water supplies to the town was one of his first efforts to make Kadugannawa a better place to live in. He stepped into Parliament defeating two major personalities: Hector Kobbekaduwa and D.B. Wijethunga, in March, 1960.
He was defeated by U.B. Weerasekara in July, 1960, but regained his status as the representative in 1965, defeating the same. In 1970, Hector Kobbekaduwa won against Abeysundara but in 1977, he secured his seat and became the Deputy Minister of Fisheries. From there onward, he was a permanent member until 1988, while claiming the ministerial positions of Deputy Minister of Agriculture, as well as the Minister of Telecommunication and Postal. He retired from his post after opening the doors to his third son Gemunu Abeysundara. He left us in 1989, completing his life journey at the age of 63.
He advised us to be honest and follow our leaders before walking the path of one. He asked us to listen and understand rather than respond. He taught us to absorb everything like a sponge and learn from it. He made us realise the importance of humanity before anything. He was inspired by leaders such as A.E. Nugawela, Dudley Senanayake, J.R. Jayawardene, E.L. Senanayake, Ashoka Karunarathne, N.H. Keerthirathne and many others. We, as the younger generation at that time, followed his path and have become responsible adults now.
He was in the second year of medical college when he had to carry the responsibility of his family and the family business after his fathers sudden demise. Even though it seemed like bad luck, it was the best thing which happened to the Yatinuwara people. His courage and determination in carrying out his responsibilities and giving back to the people, made him a commendable person.
Sunil S. Abeysundara initiated a project to provide nutritious food to underprivileged families in the 1950s. He also transformed the Kadugannawa Maha Vidyalaya to a national school during his tenure. Furthermore, he provided facilities to all schools in the Yatinuwara electorate. He was a pioneer in uplifting the quality of life of villagers, and supported many religious activities.
He was a father to all of us. In his office room, where we had the chance to peek in when we were young, he had the songs of the Hindi film Abhimaan. He always had time to take us to a film theatre and again, to walk with us around the Kandy lake.
One in all, he was a role model and a father, who unconditionally loved us; he was a path creator with his honesty and dedication to everything he did. I am lucky to have been inspired by this great personality. I would like to wish that he will be born amongst us again to lead a blissful nation.

Point of view
Sri Lankan equities regained positive momentum for the first time since early November, with the ASPI gaining ~89 points (or 1.5%) during the week to breach the psychological 6,000-mark for the 1st time in 3-weeks.
Although the Index recorded an initial sharp rise (+4.5%) immediately after the political developments on Oct26th, these gains were wiped off over the subsequent weeks as the countrys political standoff worsened over the period.
The Broadshare Index lost ~2.7% in the last 3 weeks, but gains on all 5-days of this week helped the Index record a weekly gain of 1.5%, to end ~19 points above 6,000 for the first time since early November. Activity levels on the market also improved during the week, with average daily turnover amounting to Rs.0.8Bn cf. just Rs.0.5Bn last week.
Local HNI and institutional investors were also active throughout the week, with crossings accounting for 48% of the total weekly turnover (cf. YTD avg. of 42% so far this year). Local HNI and institutional buying interest were mainly focused on bluechip JKH (~39% of the total crossings) particularly with the approach of the entitlement date for the 1 for 20 share repurchase next week (JKHs share price has increased ~10.7% to Rs.160.50 since the announcement of this share repurchase). Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to remain net sellers this week as well, with the sell-off on domestic equities amounting to Rs. 796Mn relative to last weeks net selling of Rs. 188Mn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue to look for direction from further political developments stemming from the outcome of court cases on the current political crises and next weeks parliamentary session.
Sept quarter market earnings decline 10% Y-o-Y
Corporate earnings for the total market1 declined over the Sept18 quarter, falling 10% Y-o-Y to Rs.55.0Bn (cf. Rs.61.1Bn in Sep17) amid declines in most sectors, including major sectors such as Diversified and F&B which typically account for ~25-28% of market earnings.
Although earnings in the Financial Services sector (which t ypically accounts for 40% of total market earnings) gained 29% Y-o-Y helped by a 13% Y-o-Y growth in Banks, 32% Y-o-Y growth in Finance and 146% Y-o-Y growth in Insurance (amid one-off adjustments stemming the change in insurance industry valuation rules), the earnings growth in the segment was not enough to offset the losses of most sectors.
Earnings from Diversified fell 21% Y-o-Y while earnings from F&B fell 8% Y-o-Y offsetting gains in sectors such as Financial Services (+29% Y-o-Y), Construction (+58% Y-o-Y) and Land & Property (+29%). Weak earnings performance in sectors such as Manufacturing (-44% Y-o-Y), Telco (-36% Y-o-Y), Hotels (-179% Y-o-Y), Motors (-102% Y-o-Y) and Healthcare (-17% Y-o-Y) also contributed to the overall decline in market earnings.
Cumulative earnings2 for the 6-Months to Sept18 meanwhile, remained flat, rising 1.0% Y-o-Y to Rs.115.7 (cf. 5% Y-o-Y growth in 6M17 and 15% Y-o-Y growth in 6M16). In terms of trailing 12M earnings however, market earnings rose 7% Y-o-Y to Rs. 288.4Bn aided primarily by Banks, Finance & Insurance (+34%), F&B (+27%), Telco (+25%) and Construction (+15%). Sri Lankas PER level consequently fell to 8.7x (9.3x in Sep17) allowing Sri Lanka to remain one of the cheapest markets among its Frontier and Emerging regional peers which trade between 11x to 12x.

Bridge across forever
Flashback to the year 1887. The British empire is anticipating many celebrations. Queen Victoria has reached her 50th year on the throne. As part of the Golden Jubilee festivities, she hosts dozens of foreign rulers at a lavish banquet, leads a grand procession to Westminster Abbey in open carriage, and enjoys fireworks in the royal garden. But of all the jubilees memorable events, only one encounter makes a lasting impression on her royal highness. By status and designation he is insignificant among the distinguished guests. Yet, Abdul Karim, the new servant brought all the way from Agra to join the royal retinue is the one person that catches the queens eye.
Fast forward to the 1990s. Enter Shrabani Basu, an Indian journalist on holiday. She pays a visit to the Osborne House, the former private home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the Isle of Wight. Inside the houses Indian wing, she comes across an unexpected portrait. She sees the dark eyes of the young man from her motherland, painted beautifully, in red and gold, with a book in his hand, gazing down at her. Intrigued by his presence among the portraits of the nobility, she decides to find out more.
In an interview with the TIME magazine, Basu says I knew that Abdul Karim had come from India to England to serve Queen Victoria in 1887, but the portraits told me hed been painted as a noble man. Later, in Queen Victorias dressing area, I saw two pictures: one of the Queens confidant John Brown, and below it, Karim. He was obviously someone very special to her.
Karims photos raised several questions in Basus mind. What was this young Muslim man from Agra, doing at the heart of Britains royal court And what kind of relationship did he have with Queen Victoria
In 2006, Basu committed herself to finding the answers. Her task wasnt easy. Upon Victorias death on January 22, 1901, her children had worked swiftly to evict their mothers favorite adviser. Edward VII sent guards into the Karims cottage, seizing all letters from the queen and burning them on the spot. They instructed Karim to return to India immediately, without fanfare or farewell and zealously edited the queens journals to remove references to Karim. But thanks to the documents that had somehow escaped the wrath of the royals, letters Victoria wrote to her viceroys and the diary of Karim which had recently been unearthed, Basu managed to construct the true story behind Abdul Karims controversial relationship with queen Victoria.
As Basu recounts in her book, Victoria and Abdul: The True Story of the Queens Closest Confidant, Abdul Karim, was born in Agra, north India. His father, Haji Wuzeeruddin, was a hospital assistant, a skilled position that required some medical qualifications. While this occupation did not place Wuzeeruddin in the upper class, it was a good job, one that allowed him to hire a Maulvi, or Muslim scholar, to tutor his son. Under the Maulvis tutelage, Karim learned both Persian and Urdu. He eventually secured a clerk position at a jail in Agra. It was there that Karim was handpicked to serve the somewhat recently christened Empress of India, Queen Victoria.
He was tall with a fine serious countenance, Queen Victoria recorded in her diary, after her first encounter with Karim. When their jubilee duties were over, Karim and the other Indian servant, traveled with the queen to her summer home on the Isle of Wight. There, Karim distinguished himself by surprising the sovereign with one of his favorite recipes. Using spices he had brought from Agra, Karim cooked a chicken curry with dal and pilau. It is said that the queen declared the dish excellent and added it to her regular menu rotation.
Eager to immerse herself further in Indian culture, Victoria asked Karim to teach her Urdu, or, as it was known at the time, Hindustani. Their lessons initially seemed somewhat relaxed. Am learning a few words of Hindustani to speak to my servants, Victoria wrote. It is a great interest to me, for both the language and the people. That interest soon turned to zeal. In an effort to improve communication between teacher and student, the queen doubled Karims English lessons, and he was a fast learner. Within two months, Victoria had ceased sending Karim instructions through her staff and begun writing him directly. Within a few more, she had bestowed upon him the title of Munshi Hafiz Abdul Karim, making him her official Indian teacher and relieving him of his menial duties.
There is no denying that Karim was offered perks few servants could fathom. He enjoyed homes at the royal residences of Windsor, Balmoral and Osborne and was also given a land grant back in Agra. The queen also gave him his own personal carriage and the best seats at the opera.
Not surprisingly these developments alarmed the royal household. The royal physician, Sir James Reid described Victorias warmth towards Karim as Munshi mania. Lady-in-waiting Marie Millet rued, Why the plague did not carry him off I cannot think, it might have done one good deed! Private secretary Arthur Bigge wished Karim and his father a happy and lasting retreat in the Jail!
As Karim became the most despised member of the royal court, he also became the queens most trusted confidant. The two turned heads when they spent the night at Glassat Shiel, a remote cottage in Scotland that the queen had previously shared with John Brown. (After his death, she had vowed never to return.) And yet, Karims diaries suggest nothing romantic in his relationship with the Queen. Basu notes that Victoria signed letters to Karim as your closest friend and your loving mother, and that upon hearing Karim is married, she allowed him to bring his wife over to England.
And yet, due to reasons of their own the British tried to erase from history this exalted friendship between the queen and the young Muslim man from India. Today, however, thanks to Basus work things have changed. Ever since it was published the story of Victoria and Abdul has thrown light on a friendship that lasted for fourteen years and came to an end only when the queen died. Together Queen Victoria and Abdul Karim had formed a bridge that crossed class and racial lines, a bridge that opened up the splendors of the east to a lonely, sad old lady who yet, happened to be the Queen of Britain with a whole empire at her command.
Their story is fascinating because (to quote Basu) its not some cooked-up jewel in the crown Raj nostalgia story. Its not fiction  its fact. It really happened.

Cargills Quality Dairies to increase capacity with Rs 500 mn
Cargills Quality Dairies (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of Cargills Group, has invested Rs. 500 million to increase their factory capacity and install new machinery in Gampaha. This is in addition to the Rs. 6 billion the company invested over the last few years to turn around this defunct ice cream factory run by a multinational.
Cargills Quality Dairies producers several dairy products including Cargills Magic Ice Cream and several other dairy products under Kotmale brand for both local and international market.
Cargills Dairies also introduced two new products, Kotmale Butter and Cheddar Cheese to the market on Wednesday. Director Sales, Cargills Quality Dairies, FMCG Sector, Buddhisha Herath speaking to Daily News Business said that the Rs 500 million investment was to install a new production line to produce these two products.
He said this investment affirms their commitment to the Sri Lankan dairy industry by continuously investing in the most advanced dairy facilities in the country. Through such investments, we contribute to the objective of making Sri Lanka self-sufficient in dairy sector.
He said that the annual dairy import bill to Sri Lanka is nearly US$ 280 million and Cargills Dairies by purchasing Milk from farmers and producing more local products have helped to reduce this bill by US$ 25 million last year.
Operating out of world class production facilities, our dairy manufacturing plant boasts state of the art technology, robust environmental management processes, and ISO certification for quality and food safety.
COO Cargills Dairies, Chanaka Wijesundara said that they are one of the largest buyers of fresh milk from Dairy farmers and pays the highest price for them. Asked if the management is keen to invest on their own diary he answered in the negative and said that they would keep on buying from the farmers since they have a forward buyig agreement with them.
Cargills has, for instance, assured its farmers of a steady income through the purchase of fresh milk, and supported the education of their children through Cargills Sarubima program.
When farmers outside the Cargills network in Ridiyagama in the Southern Province were unable to sell their milk, for instance, Cargills stepped up to purchase large amounts of the surplus, towards cushioning negative fall-back on the industry, said Manager, Cargills Quality Dairies Sector, Nimal Gunaratne.

## Date: Monday, December 3, 2018 - 01:00
CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, RISKS AND ADAPTATION
The text contains sections summary for the multi US Federal agency report on the impact of Climate Change in the US rejected by President Trump. Much of which would be relevant to most countries.
More frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, as well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to continue to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide essential benefits to communities. Impacts within and across regions will not be distributed equally. People who are already vulnerable, including lower-income and other marginalized communities, have a lower capacity to prepare for and cope with extreme weather and climate-related events and are expected to experience greater impacts. Prioritizing adaptation actions for the most vulnerable populations would contribute to a more equitable future within and across communities.
Economy
Regional economies and industries that depend on natural resources and favourable climate conditions, such as agriculture, tourism, and fisheries, are vulnerable to the growing impacts of climate change. Rising temperatures are projected to reduce the efficiency of power generation while increasing energy demands, resulting in higher electricity costs. The continued warming that is projected to occur without substantial and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy throughout this century, especially in the absence of increased adaptation efforts. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the centurymore than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states.
Interconnected impacts
Climate change affects the natural, built, and social systems we rely on individuals and through their connections to one another. These interconnected systems are increasingly vulnerable to cascading impacts that are often difficult to predict, threatening essential services within and beyond the nations borders. The full extent of climate change risks to interconnected systems, many of which span regional and national boundaries, is often greater than the sum of risks to individual sectors. Failure to anticipate interconnected impacts can lead to missed opportunities for effectively managing the risks of climate change and can also lead to management responses that increase risks to other sectors and regions. Joint planning with stakeholders across sectors, regions, and jurisdictions can help identify critical risks arising from the interaction among systems ahead of time.
Water
Rising air and water temperatures and changes in precipitation are intensifying droughts, increasing heavy downpours, reducing snowpack, and causing declines in surface water quality, with varying impacts across regions. Future warming will add to the stress on water supplies and adversely impact the availability of water in parts of the United States. Changes in the relative amounts and timing of snow and rainfall are leading to mismatches between water availability and needs in some regions, posing threats to, for example, the future reliability of hydropower production in the Southwest and the Northwest. Groundwater depletion is exacerbating drought risk in many parts of the United States, particularly in the Southwest and Southern Great Plains. Dependable and safe water supplies for U.S. Caribbean, Hawaii, and U.S.-Affiliated Pacific Island communities are threatened by drought, flooding, and saltwater contamination due to sea level rise. Most U.S. power plants rely on a steady supply of water for cooling, and operations are expected to be affected by changes in water availability and temperature increases. Ageing and deteriorating water infrastructure, typically designed for past environmental conditions, compounds the climate risk faced by society.
Health
Impacts from climate change on extreme weather and climate-related events, air quality, and the transmission of disease through insects and pests, food, and water increasingly threaten the health and well-being of the American people, particularly populations that are already vulnerable. With continued warming, cold-related deaths are projected to decrease and heat-related deaths are projected to increase; in most regions, increases in heat-related deaths are expected to outpace reductions in cold-related deaths. The frequency and severity of allergic illnesses, including asthma and hay fever, are expected to increase as a result of a changing climate. Climate change is also projected to alter the geographic range and distribution of disease-carrying insects and pests, exposing more people to ticks that carry Lyme disease and mosquitoes that transmit viruses such as Zika, West Nile, and dengue, with varying impacts across regions. Communities in the Southeast, for example, are particularly vulnerable to the combined health impacts of vector-borne disease, heat, and flooding. Populations including older adults, children, low-income communities, and some communities of colour are often disproportionately affected by and less resilient to the health impacts of climate change.
Ecosystems and ecosystem services
Ecosystems and the benefits they provide to society are being altered by climate change, and these impacts are projected to continue. Without substantial and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, transformative impacts on some ecosystems will occur; some coral reef and sea ice ecosystems are already experiencing such transformational changes.
Many benefits provided by ecosystems and the environment, such as clean air and water, protection from coastal flooding, wood and fibre, crop pollination, hunting and fishing, tourism, cultural identities, and more will continue to be degraded by the impacts of climate change.
Agriculture and food
Rising temperatures, extreme heat, drought, wildfire on rangelands, and heavy downpours are expected to increasingly disrupt agricultural productivity in the United States. Expected increases in challenges to livestock health, the decline in crop yields and quality, and changes in extreme events in the United States and abroad threaten rural livelihoods, sustainable food security, and price stability. While some regions (such as the Northern Great Plains) may see conditions conducive to expanded or alternative crop productivity over the next few decades, overall, yields from major U.S. crops are expected to decline as a consequence of increases in temperatures and possibly changes in water availability, soil erosion, and disease and pest outbreaks. Projected increases in extreme heat conditions are expected to lead to further heat stress for livestock, which can result in large economic losses for producers.
Oceans and coasts
Rising water temperatures, ocean acidification, retreating Arctic sea ice, sea level rise, high-tide flooding, coastal erosion, higher storm surge, and heavier precipitation events threaten oceans and coasts.
Lasting damage to coastal property and infrastructure driven by sea level rise and storm surge is expected to lead to financial losses for individuals, businesses, and communities, with the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts facing above-average risks.
Even if significant emission reductions occur, many of the effects from sea level rise over this centuryand particularly through mid-centuryare already locked in due to historical emissions, and many communities are already dealing with the consequences.

Conserving Sinharaja Forest Reserve
Sinharaja is Sri Lankas flagship for conservation of rainforests and it is the only National Wilderness Heritage area that receives the highest level of legal protection under Sri Lankan conservation laws. Despite its significance, Sinharaja forest is increasingly threatened by potential developments and calamities that occur naturally, triggered by anthropogenic activities.
It is in this regard that Environmental Foundation Ltd. (EFL) is publishing a book on the Review of the Southern Border of Sinharaja; Contemporary needs against conservation. The book will be launched on December 7at the British Council Library from 6.30pm onwards. This book elaborates a study conducted to assess the present status of Sinharaja, the gaps in conservation and current practices with emphasis on utilising Sustainable Forest Management as a means of addressing the underlying threats posed to the southern border of Sinharaja.
The publication on the Southern border of Sinharaja forest aims at rekindling the intrinsic conservation values of the readers and stimulates discussions on conservation. As the passion for conservation emanates from an understating of the core benefits embraced by pristine rainforests such as Sinharaja, this publication seeks to create awareness which would trigger effective conservation.
The event will be graced by Anura Sathurusinghe, the Conservator General of Forest while the guest speaker for the evening will be Prof. Savithri Gunatilleke, a renowned Sinharaja conservationist. The event is open to the public and entrance will be free of charge. The public is requested to RSVP by December 5 to [emailprotected]

Democracy and General Elections
The following is the text of a speech delivered by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Prime Ministers Office yesterday:
Most venerable members of the Maha Sangha, Clergymen of all religions, and my dear friends,
It is only in Sri Lanka that you will find political parties agitating against the holding of a General Election that has already been declared. In the gazette notification dated November 9, 2018, issued by the President in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act, dates had been fixed to call for nominations from November 19 to 26, to hold the poll on January 5, 2019, and for the new Parliament to meet for the first time on January 17. If things had gone accordingly, stability would soon have been restored to this country.
Last year, in November 2017, there was the danger of the local government elections being postponed indefinitelybecause certain individuals had petitioned the Court of Appeal against the holding of the local government elections citing delimitation issues. However, when the Chairman of the Elections Commission declared that he will proceed to hold elections at least in respect of the local government institutions that were not subject to litigation, the then government reluctantly fell in line and agreed to hold elections. With that the peitioners who had gone before the Court of Appeal quietly withdrew their petitions. It was quite clear in that instance, that the court procedure was being misused for a political purpose.
Today, six of the nine provinces in the country do not have functioning provincial councils. The previous government avoided holding elections to the provincial councils for more than one year. We held the Eastern Provincial Council election in 2008 even before the war had ended, immediately after clearing the province of the LTTE. Once the de-mining of the Vanni was complete, we held provincial council elections in the Northern Province as well in 2013. Today, without any war in the country, both those provinces do not have provincial councils.
Put off provincial council elections
The previous government put off provincial council elections indefinitely by deliberately refraining from fulfilling the conditions relating to the delimitation of constitutencies in Act No. 17 of 2017 which was rushed through Parliament last year just days before the Sabaragamauwa, North Central and Eastern Provincial Councils were to stand dissolved.
I am placing on record this explanation because the UNP and its affilaited political parties have been making misleading statements from the political platform with a view to deceiving the general public. From the time of our first Parliament, elections were called early whenever necessary to overcome situations of political turbulence. In 1952 when the then Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake died, a division emerged within the UNP regarding the succession. Even though the effective number two in the party was Sir John Kotelawala, the then Governor General Lord Soulbury invited Dudley Senanayake to be the Prime Minister. Within days of swearing in as Prime Minister, Dudley Seneyake summoned a general election and obtained a fresh peoples mandate to contain the divisions within the ruling party.
In 1959 after the assassination of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, W. Dahanayake became Prime Minister. When rifts emerged within his Cabinet, he too called a general election. The Governor Generals power to dissolve Parliament was provided for in Article 15 of the 1948 Constitution. Even though Parliamentary conventions like dissolving Parliament when the statement of government policy is rejected or when a government loses the budget were not expressly stated in the 1948 Constitution, those conventions applied in Sri Lanka because we closely followed the British system of Parliamentary government at that time.
Provisions relating to the Presidents power to dissolve Parliament in our first Republican Constitution of 1972, were found in Article 21. The convention of dissolving Parliament if the statement of government policy was rejected, or a budget was defeated found mention in Article 99 of that Constitution. With regard to the second Republican Constitution of 1978, the Presidents power to dissolve Parliament and the convention of dissolving Parliament in the event of a rejection of the statement of government policy or the budget, found mention in Article 70(1). I have no intention of dealing with any matter that is before courts. All these are matters that are being discussed in the media, the social media and in society in general.
The UNP and its allies claim that the 19th Amendment repealed and replaced the old Article 70(1) of the 1978 Constitution, and that according to the new article 70(1), the President cannot dissolve Parliament until the lapse of four-and-a-half years. They claim that an early dissolution will be possible only if Parliament passes a resolution by a two-thirds majority requesting the President to dissolve Parliament. All the provisions relating to the dissolution of Parliament in the 1978 Constitution, were found in the old Article 70(1) before the 19th Amendment. If those provisions have been abolished, then there are no provisions in the present Constitution to dissolve Parliament in the event of a government losing a vote of no confidence, the vote on the budget or the statement of government policy.
Restrictions contrary to Parliamentary tradition
Such restrictions are completely contrary to the Parliamentary tradition. Most countries with a Parliamentary form of government have ceremonial heads of state. Even in such countries, the head of state can exercise his discretion in dissolving Parliament. The British constitutional authority A.V. Dicey has said that if the Crown is of the view that the opinion of the public is different to that of the majority in Parliament, the Crown has the discretion to dissolve Parliament and summon a general election. In 1975, the Governor General of Australia sacked Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and called a general election entirely at his own discretion.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the founder of the Indian Constitution has said that the President of India can exercise his discretion when deciding whether to dissolve Parliament. The Governors of the Indian states, who are representatives of the President, have exercised that discretion from the very beginning. In 1970, President V.V. Giri exercised his discretion in dissolving Parliament despite the protests of the opposition which had a majority in Parliament. In 1979, President Sanjiva Reddy exercised his discretion and dissolved Parliament due to a situation of near anarchy in the Lower House.
That was in countries with ceremonial heads of state. However, the Sri Lankan head of state is an Executive President directly elected by the people. It has been clearly stated in the Supreme Court determination on the 19th Amendment that the power that the sovereign people have vested in the President cannot be removed without a two-thirds majority in Parliament and a referendum. Even though it is claimed that the Presidents power to dissolve Parliament that had been provided for in the old Article 70(1) have been removed, what has actually happened is that those provisions have been taken to another part of the Constitution.
While amending the old Article 70(1), the 19th Amendment also introduced a new subsection (2)(c) to Article 33 of the Constitution. What this new provision says is that in addition to the powers, expressly assigned to the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall have the powerto summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament. The new provision that has been introduced to the Constitution in the form of Article 33(2)(c) has not been made subject to Article 70(1) as amended by the 19th Amendment either.
That is obviously why the 2015 Supreme Court determination on the 19th Amendment did not say that the amendment made to the old Article 70(1) had reduced the Presidents powers to dissolve Parliament. If the purpose was to reduce the Presidents powers, an amendment would have been made only to Article 70(1). Legal experts are of the opinion that the reason why the Presidents powers to dissolve Parliament which were provided for in the old Article 70(1) have been reintroduced to the Constitution in the form of Article 33(2)(c) is because the Presidents power in that regard cannot be taken away except through a referendum.
The 19th Amendment shifted other provisions of the Constitution from one place to another in a similar manner. The old Article 42 which declared that the President was responsible to Parliament in the execution of his duties was repealed and the same provision without any change in the wording was reintroduced as Article 33A by the 19th Amendment. Only the drafters of the 19th Amendment will know why that was done. But the end result is that the President continues to be responsible to Parliament under the 19th Amendment just as he was before the 19th Amendment was introduced. The same applies when a power that the President had under the old Article 70(1) is reintroduced to the Constitution in the form of Article 33(2)(c).
After the 19th Amendment, Parliamentary conventions have been preserved in our Constitution through Article 33(2)(c). If we ignore that Article and accept only Article 70(1) as amended by the 19th Amendment, then we will be faced with a situation where there is absolutely no provision in the Constitution to dissolve Parliament in the event the government is defeated at a vote on the budget or the statement of government policy or a motion of no confidence is passed against a government. Such a situation is completely contrary to Parliamentary tradition. If even the ceremonial heads of state in countries with Parliamentary forms of government can dissolve Parliament and call for fresh elections at their discretion when the circumstances so require, how logical is it to say that the President of Sri Lanka who is vested with the executive power of the state on behalf of the sovereign people cannot dissolve Parliament no matter what happens in the country
How can it be said that the President does not have the power to dissolve Parliament when Article 33(2)(c) was specifically introduced to the Constitution by the 19th Amendment It took only 56 votes in Parliament to pass into law Act No. 5 of 2018 which put in place a legal framework to hand over our war heroes to foreign courts. How then can one argue that you need 150 votes in Parliament to be able to pave the way for the sovereign people to exercise their franchise I was recently given a copy of a report published by an inter-governmental organisation called the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. The member states of this organisation include Germany, Australia, Canada, Switzerland and also India and Japan.
According to that report, there are only two countries that require a two-thirds majority to dissolve Parliament  Kosovo and Lithuania. However, even in those countries, the head of state can dissolve Parliament if a no confidence motion against the government is adopted or if the statement of government policy is rejected. The only country mentioned therein which has a Parliament that cannot be dissolved under any circumstances until the end of its term, is Norway. However, the situation in Norway is very different to ours. The population of Norway is smaller than that or our Western Province. Furthermore, that country is a constitutional monarchy.
what works in Norway will not work in Sri Lanka
Even if a government is defeated in Parliament, it has to continue in office until a new government is appointed by the King. When the King in Council presents the annual budget to Parliament, it will be debated, but there is no tradition of defeating budgets in that country. Most of the time, Norway has had minority governments that do not have a majority in Parliament. That is the situation at this moment as well. It should be clear that what works in Norway will not work in Sri Lanka.
The manner in which the French Constitution evolved is also relevant to this discussion. The Constitution that France had before 1940 had made it virtually impossible to dissolve Parliament. This led to chronically unstable governments being formed in France during those years. In 1940, Hitler invaded France. After being liberated from the German occupation, France promulgated a new Constitution in 1946 which relaxed the provisions relating to the dissolution of Parliament and allowed the calling of fresh elections in the event where two no confidence motions are passed against a government within a period of 18 months. However, because even that did not suffice to ensure stable governments, the present Constitution of France which was adopted in 1958 has given the President the power to dissolve Parliament at his discretion.
We must learn from those experiences. Since the dissolution of Parliament and the holding of fresh elections will have implications for the person ordering such actions as well, no head of state will take such a decision lightly. Such a decision will be made only in serious situations. The only way to restore stability to a destablised democracy, will be through a general election. According to our Constitution, sovereignty is vested in the people and not in Parliament. The manner in which the people exercise their sovereignty is through the franchise. I invite all those who respect democracy to give careful thought to these matters.
May the blessings of the Tripple Gem be upon you, God bless you, and my best wishes for the future.

A Global Icon
Way back in September 1944, a US Submarine crew spotted a young man in a tiny life raft, frantically paddling with his bare hands to get away from a Japanese island. They popped up right beside him and the torpedo man who hauled him on board said welcome aboard, sir. Even in their wildest dreams, the submarine crew never imagined that the 18-year-old they rescued would one day become the Commander in Chief of the United States Defence Forces.
It was literally a baptism of fire for George Herbert Walker Bush, whose plane had been set ablaze by enemy fire and ditched in the ocean. His survival was perhaps a miracle and a sign that bigger things in life, such as the Presidency of the United States, were waiting for him. When George H W Bush passed away on Saturday at 94, only a few other men could boast of having such a varied career. From naval aviator to the (41st) President of the United States, his was a life that had seen it all and done it all. He even gave the world the 43rd President of the USA  his eldest son George Walker Bush.
Just a year after leaving the Navy in 1945, he took the initial step to politics by serving as the chairman of a local branch of the Republican Party. Then he won the Republican nomination for the US Senate seat for Texas.
He did not win the first time, but successfully stood for the House of Representatives in 1966, where he served two terms. He did not win in 1970 and President Richard Nixon appointed him US ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and then Republican Party chairman. After the Watergate scandal and Nixons resignation, Bush headed to Beijing as the US Envoy.
After serving as the CIA Director for a few years from 1976, politics beckoned him again, this time as the running mate of Republican Presidential nominee Ronald Reagan. Under President Reagan, he served two full terms as the Vice President of the United States from 1981-89. And in 1989, he got the promotion he wanted  the Presidency. In fact, it was after 150 years that a sitting Vice President has been elected President (Martin van Buren in 1836), as opposed to automatic promotion  e.g. Gerald Ford, following Nixons resignation.
Although he served only one term as President, he saw enough action that most other Presidents would not see for the full eight years. His first test was the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Bush moved to build an international coalition to end the occupation but delayed military action in order to give time to secure UN approval. The US and its allies swept across the desert in a ground war lasting just 100 hours and secured freedom for Kuwait.
His other major challenge was the fall of the USSR, which left the US as the sole super power. Even though it was Reagan who called on the Soviet leaders to tear down the Berlin Wall, the wall actually came down during Bush Seniors tenure. He was President during the reunification of East and West Germany, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact alliance and the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in February 1989. On July 31, 1991, Bush and Presidency Mikhail Gorbachev signed the START I treaty in Moscow. The agreement introduced major reductions in US and Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals. The two men became good friends and Gorbachev was one of the first to express condolences on Bush Seniors passing.
But domestically, he did not fare so well. After his infamous read my lips  no new taxes pledge had to be abandoned to raise taxes, he became unpopular. There was also a perception that he did not have the common touch, due to his Ivy League background.
At the 1992 Presidential election, he simply could not match the energy and charisma of the young Democratic Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton whose message resonated with the electorate. It was a bitter election campaign that tested the limits of their endurance, but Clinton won in the end.
George H W Bush will live on in the hearts of Sri Lankans, being one of the two US Presidents, serving or retired, to have visited Sri Lanka, the other being Clinton himself. In fact, they came here together in the aftermath of the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 to inspect the damage and drum up global support for the affected countries. It is said that the two men, who were bitter election rivals, developed a very close personal bond as they toured the world together for good causes. Clinton even said that Bush Seniors friendship was the greatest gift of his life.
That was George Herbert Walker Bush. Because you run against each other that does not mean youre enemies, he once said. Politics doesnt have to be uncivil and nasty. The political legacy of Bush Senior will continue to be studied for decades to come, as a leader who helped create a new world order.

WEEKLY TEA AUCTION ENDING NOV. 28
HIGH, LOW GROWN SALE AVERAGES MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
For the past eight weeks the Western High and Orthodox Low Grown averages have been moving in opposite directions.
Lanka Commodity Brokers Ltd Director Jehan Algama told Daily News Business yesterday that The Orthodox Low Growns saw a steady decline in averages from the month of February onwards. The average of Rs. 663.43 recorded in January fell to Rs. 645.98 in February and eased substantially up to Rs. 540.02 in August. There was a slight improvement in August but the sales spanning the months of September and October saw a reversal of fortunes with the auction average of Orthodox Low Growns moving up to Rs. 604.49 in October.
There has been more consolidation of prices during the past eight weeks with the average moving up further as can be seen from the following graph.
High Grown teas on the other hand have started coming down week by week during the last several auctions amidst plainer quality of offerings and less interest from the Tea Bag sector operating for Russia. Past experience would show us that Russia purchases their winter requirements much in advance due to logistical constrains that prevail during their freezing winter season, and, only limited purchases are made during the latter part of November and throughout December, although renewed interest will be seen from mid January, 2019 onwards.
Meanwhile, Asia Siyaka Commodity Brokers PLC Director/ Senior Vice President Sohan Samaranayake told Daily News Business that this weeks sale quantity of 6.4 M kgs comprised of 3.1 M kgs of Low Grown and 0.9 M kgs of High Growns sold in the Ex-Estate catalogue.

Libya and Iraq operated for below best and secondary teas. Turkey was active for Pekoe grades. Tippy teas however were only firm to sometimes easier as buying for Iran was subdued.
Another week of lack lustre demand was seen for Ex-Estate teas. Only a handful of Western High Growns with maintained quality were able to sell around previous levels whilst all others eased Rs.10-30/-.
The quality by and large of offerings reflected a drop in standard of leaf appearance and liquors.
