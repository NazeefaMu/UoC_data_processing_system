Enterprise Sri Lanka hotline
The Finance Ministry yesterday, launched the hotline 1925 to handle complaints and inquiries into Enterprise Sri Lanka.
Enterprise Sri Lanka which offers concessionary and at times collateral free loans, has thus far granted 29,389 loans worth Rs 58,817.5 million to beneficiaries around the island, said Finance and Mass Media, Minister Mangala Samaraweera addressing a media briefing yesterday. The Minister explained that the schemes of Haritha Naya, Diriya Saviya, Sonduru Piyasa, Govi Navodya, Madya Aruna and the Homestay loan were some of the popular options among beneficiaries who approach the State Banks such as ; Regional Development Bank, Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank.
From the time of the launch, in general applicants were welcomed to the banks but certain banks we hear are treating them badly and discouraging people from taking loans. They have chased away applicants, scolded the government or placed unnecessary conditions before them.
Those who face issues with accessing loans specified in Enterprise Sri Lanka thus have been asked to contact the hotline through any phone line, where they would be directed to a Dialog call center.
Complaints would be recorded and emailed to the Finance Ministry where feedback will be given. The Finance Minister however observed that loan applications from the North and East were low and he hoped that in future it would approve. Given the major issues faced in the regions with regard to micro financing, the Government, he said has also taken steps to write off and pay loans of 45, 139 borrowers in the North, amounting to over Rs 141 million in interest rates and Rs 1.23 billion in capital.

Innovation, technology key to progress
Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri said ICT has revolutionized the work of the Parliament, bringing parliamentarians and the parliamentary processes closer to the people.
He was addressing the 139th Session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) General Debate on October 16 under the theme Parliamentary leadership promoting peace and development in the age of innovation and technological change.
The leader of the Sri Lankan delegation to the IPU session this year, Deputy Speaker Kumarasiri spoke of the role of science and technology in the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. He emphasized the need for development strategies to be responsive by taking into account the opportunities and challenges arising from new technologies such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, and space technology. Harnessing these technologies would be crucial to achieving sustainable development, said the Deputy Speaker.
In Sri Lanka, the Deputy Speaker said, the government through its Vision 2025, provides a policy framework to develop strategies that encourage the use of digital and other modern technologies that could help Sri Lanka become globally competitive and drive the nation towards a digitally empowered economy.
He elaborated the recent initiative Enterprise Sri Lanka, a socio-economic advancement programme that included among its objectives the development of technology and technical and managerial skills given that this has been identified as an important constraint affecting SME and Micro sector development.

Anuradhapura receives rain after five seasons:
Plans to cultivate additional 100,000 hectares
Farmers in Anuradhapura could carry out their work to the fullest extent as droughts had ceased with the arrival of monsoonal rains after five cultivation seasons, Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M.Wanninayake told the Daily News.
Kanna meetings with regard to the 12 major tanks under the Irrigation Department had been held recently. Considering the change of weather, we have decided to cultivate 131,000 hectares of land instead of 121,000 hectares as planned earlier, Wanninayake said.
We intend to make use of all small, medium, and large-scale tanks in the district, he said, and added that farmers aimed to reap 600,000 bushels of paddy.
We have managed to store 500,000 bushels of paddy so far and we hope to obtain the balance 100,000 bushels from the Mahaweli H Zone, Wanninayake added.
He said that the government was providing fertiliser subsidies through 41 agrarian departments at Rs.500 per sack. The subsidies included fertiliser such as Muriate of Potash (MOP) and Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), the government agent said.
Wanninayake added that fertiliser subsidies worth Rs.1,5000 were also available in the open market.
Fifty thousand farmers in the Mahaweli H Zone had planned to cultivate 25,390 hectares of land and 22,000 hectares of those lands would be used for growing paddy, while the remaining land would be used to grow other crops such as bananas and papaws, agronomist Susantha Gunatilaka said.
Two hundred thousand metric tonnes of paddy is expected to be harvested during the 2018/2019 Maha season, with an average of 6.5 tonnes per hectare. The average for the previous Maha season was 6.2 metric tonnes per hecatre, whereas the previous national average paddy yield was 4.3 tonnes per hectare.
Cultivation in the Mahaweli H Zone during last year was only at 50 percent due to water scarcity, however, farmers in Anuradhapura had grown 554,568 metric tonnes of paddy, Gunatilaka said.

You must win by justice
Speech of His Lordship The Chief Justice H. N. J. Perera at the Ceremonial Sitting held on October 22, 2018.
It is with humble gratitude that I receive the warm welcome, kind sentiments and expressions of confidence that you have expressed in this august assembly today. I wish to approach this great honour with a full appreciation of the magnitude of responsibility that this office brings with itself. It is with a sincere and passionate heart that I assume this position granted to me for the service of my country.
I am painfully aware that we live in a society that is increasingly losing confidence in the ability to uphold justice. The increasing depravity of human values and practices has had its impact on the trust that people in a country may place on the judicial system itself.
We live in a world where people almost by default expect those in power to misuse the same. We are taken by surprise if those in power actually make true their promises. Public often assume that speeches such as this are merely sugar coated and loaded with empty words outside of real commitment. In a society like this we are almost programmed to look at each other with mistrust and much more at those who hold power in positions. As such I am aware that all of this makes it difficult for the general public to look to the judiciary in trust, expecting an independent and just solution.
And to this reality I speak today. I understand some may find it hard to believe that I stand here without a political bias or favouritism or a secret strategic personal agenda that brought me here.
Nevertheless, I truly hope that my tenure in this position will disapprove the same to you, if it has not been sufficiently gathered from my journey of 38 years through the judicial service. I hope that I could be a beacon of hope to those who have been silently and honestly persevering in administering justice.
My ambition has always been to be diligent in the execution of my services in this field with sensitivity towards the plight of the poorest and weakest in society. The thought of the poor general public being worn out and inconvenienced by a case being unnecessarily postponed has always bothered me. Simple as the thinking might be, it has always stopped me from dragging a case or taking an avoidable leave for my personal matters, even though I may have had the freedom to do so.
In my 38 years long and challenging journey in the judiciary, I have constantly sensed the tension between two ends that any conscientious judge will need to strike a balance. One end being the need to humbly integrate with the society as a real man with real sorrows and weaknesses; and the other being the need to keep my arms-length in such a way that personal favours are not encouraged or accommodated in my office as a judge. While this peculiar tension is not always pleasant, I believe it is something that all judges should learn to handle well with wisdom, humility and non-compromise in the normal course of life.
As in His book Judges (1987) David Pannick affirms, judges are asked to perform a function that is truly divine.
The Holy Bible brings out this idea in the following way: I quote from 2 Chronicles 19:6-7:
Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for mere mortals but for the Lord, who is with you whenever you give a verdict. Now let the fear of the Lord be on you. Judge carefully, for with the Lord our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.
Judges therefore may do well to realize and remember the seriousness of their vocation even before God. For if their office was meant to serve such a high cause, then the failure to rightfully do so on their part constitutes a grave offence.
It is indeed when truth alone triumphs in courts that we can expect people to have faith in the judicial system. As such the integrity of officers functioning in the administration of justice becomes a must. The actual good faith of judges and therefore the ability of the society to rest securely on the same is the bedrock of a successful judicial system. This truth makes the officers in this field strongly bound by a demand for the deepest form of personal and professional integrity.
Therefore, if there is any doubt about the integrity of such officers, the Chief Justice bears the responsibility to take necessary action so as to ensure that the system of justice remains unpolluted. And to this end I am deeply committed.
To the members of the minor judiciary I say- Judicial restraint and discipline are necessary to the orderly administration of justice. The duty of restraint, patience and humility should be intrinsic characteristics of our judges.
These qualities in decision-making are as much necessary for judges to command respect as to protect the independence of the judiciary. Even the humblest citizen of the land irrespective of his station in life is entitled to present his case with dignity and is entitled to be heard with courtesy and sympathy. Leave no room for any complaints from the citizens of this country about the slack or apathy in matters of duty.
No longer remain any grounds for complaints about the lack of privileges given to judges. The Government has done much in this regard. Therefore let us work- and work hard! Let there be no doubt about your actual good faith in this profession. Let us be authentic and be found worthy of this high office that we have chosen to occupy.
A voice to the voiceless
To the learned members of the Bar I say- yours is a profession which fundamentally calls for devotion to duty. We live in a time where the legal profession is viewed as a qualification coupled with skills. However the truth is that it should primarily be a calling. It should be a vocation that stems out of a passion to be a helping hand to the poor, uneducated and exploited masses. A passion to be a voice to the voiceless. As such there is a responsibility that is cast upon every lawyer to be a beacon of light through their personal and professional examples.
It must be understood that a Lawyer is the point of contact that the general public primarily has with the judicial system. As such much of their actions and character would rub off on the entire judicial system as a whole. Through a lawyers ability to act as a true gentleman or lady with a high standard of conduct, he or she will be able to strengthen the common mans belief in the judicial system. Your task as lawyers is to assist the court to arrive at the truth and dispense justice.
There cannot be an independent judiciary without an independent and fearless bar in a country. An independent judiciary is a sine-qua-non for a functional judiciary where courts are regarded as temples of justice. It has been said that the lawyers are the pillars of the temple. Therefore, the lawyers hold a paramount duty towards upholding the temples of justice. Hence they are equal partners with the judges in the administration of justice.
The necessity of this interwoven relationship between the Bench and the Bar is very much felt at this hour, where the judiciary is striving to build public confidence. I am confident that the Judges would get that unstinted support from the members of this noble profession.
The respect for the judiciary is not enhanced when Judges at the lower level are criticized intemperately and castigated publicly. Whatever complaints or grievances one may have must be first brought to the notice of the Judicial Services Commission or to the attention of the Chief Justice himself. I assure you that I will always be available as the Chief Justice of this country to give you a patient and fair hearing and to find a just solution to your grievance.
It is disheartening to note that there is a growing tendency among certain practicing lawyers to malign the reputation of judicial officers whenever they fail to secure their desired outcomes through a judgement given. It must be noted that a lawyer or counsel should never act in Contempt of Court through unacceptable language or by intimidation of judges.
In such an event a lawyer has no wider protection than a layman and must be made to face the legal consequences of the path he or she has taken by way of disciplinary action.
Your main responsibility is to preserve and safeguard the independence of the judiciary of the country. Therefore, you are obliged to give your wholehearted support and assistance to the Judges of this country, especially to the Judges of the minor judiciary to carry out their duties in a pleasant atmosphere.
I would request the honourable members of the Bar to bring any complaints you have about the conduct of a Judge to me, through the Bar Association. In the recent past we have witnessed lawyers criticizing Judges in public, overlooking the harm caused to the judicial system in general, to the litigant, to the public and to themselves through such public outcry. Let us join together and resolve our issues, without resorting to methods which in my view would ultimately bring down the reputation of the judicial officials in the eyes of the public.
As Justice P. B. Sawant observed in Vinay Chandra Mishra in re, 1995 (2SCC584):A lawyer has to be a gentleman first. His most valuable asset is the respect and goodwill he enjoys among his colleagues and in the court.
Therefore rise up to your duty with all due diligence and actively support the Judges to arrive at the truth that leads to justice. Be committed to help the court system to function in its highest efficiency.
Do not be caught up in a pursuit of personal welfare, benefits and the like, but rather serve the cause for which you have taken your oath.
No doubt that you represent the party who has retained you and your aim is to get the judgement in your clients favour. But you must win by justice. The guidelines laid down for us by Justice Thomas Edward Scrutton in 1920 are still applicable with this regard. I quote Do not make the mistake of thinking that you are to go into the profession to win for your client by whatever means you can - you must win by justice. You fight with the sword of a warrior, not with the dagger of the assassin. You are taking part in the administration of justice and if you succeed in bringing justice, you are engaging providing one of the greatest necessities of any civilized countries
Diligence, integrity and commitment to justice
At this point I would like to turn to the general public of Sri Lanka and make a humble request to take heed that judges themselves are mere mortals and are not in any way infallible. However, they can and should be expected to operate with the highest of diligence, integrity and commitment to justice.
As such any party aggrieved by the order/judgement passed by a judge may recourse to any legitimate legal remedy that is made available to the public in such cases. The legal system makes this process possible through allowing such party to challenge the judgement given by way of appeal or revision and certain other legally permissible modes.
To criticize a judgement fairly or even fiercely is no crime. When such criticism is fair, reasonable and objective and is directed to a judgement which is a public document or to a public act of a judge in duty, it would not constitute contempt. Given that judges are not perfect, a fair and reasonable criticism must be encouraged and would be a necessary right to be availed when needed.
Moreover, right to freedom of speech and expression, which is guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution is vital for all citizens to exercise and must be protected. However if any criticism directed to judicial institutions transgresses all limits of decency and fairness or displays a total lack of objectivity or when there is a deliberate attempt to undermine the dignity of the courts, then it amounts to Contempt of Court.
As Chief Justice M. H. Beg observed in S. Mulgaokar, in re (1978) 3SCC 339, para.16):
If fearless and impartial courts of justice are the bulwark of a healthy democracy, confidence in them cannot be permitted to be impaired by malicious attacks upon them.
Article 105(3) of the Constitution arms the Supreme Court with very wide and special powers as a court of Record, to punish its contempts. One of the cardinal principles of the rule of law in a democratic setup is the maintenance of the dignity of courts. Any criticism of the judiciary must arise from the highest motives and should not be colored by any partisan spirit and tactics.
This was emphasised by Justice Dr. Arijit Pasayat, in Haridas Das v. Usha Rani Banik when he stated, I quote:
Judge bashing and using derogatory and contemptuous language against judges.....tend to scandalise and lower the authority of the courts and cannot be permitted because, for functioning of democracy, an independent judiciary to dispense justice without fear and favour is paramount. Its strength is the faith and confidence of the people in that institution. That cannot be permitted to be undermined because that will be against public interest. Judiciary should not be reduced to the position of flies in the hands of wanton boys. Judge bashing is not and cannot be a substitute for constructive-criticism.
Having said that I also wish to address some critical barriers within the justice system.
I wish to remind the citizens of this country that corruption must not be tolerated at any cost. Corruption is an enemy of a nation. I call every citizen to a true commitment to remain corruption free in our daily course of life. If any person is found to be guilty of corruption, the status of the offender is of no relevance.
Corruption particularly at high places must be put down with a heavy hand. As the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka, I wish to affirm that the judicial system of this country will remain strongly opposed to corruption and deeply committed to eradicate the same.
The Holy Bible affirms that When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers (Proverbs 21:15).
Legal administrators
I appeal to the legal fraternity that there should be no place for exploitation or disrespect of the masses that depend on our services. They must not be made to feel powerless in the face of the legal administrators. The position or prestige enjoyed by legal administrators must not be used to create a power gap that leaves the masses feeling insignificant and helpless.
Measures are also to be taken to prevent the trend of increasing frivolous lawsuits. These cause much mental, emotional and financial stress to the parties concerned. There needs to be a mechanism that anyone who initiates and continues senseless litigation will need to pay for the same.
As Justice Dr. Dalveer Bhandari in Ram Rameshwari Devi vs Nirmala Devi 2011 (8SCC 249) observed Wrongdoers should not get benefit out of frivolous litigation.
Therefore, disgruntled litigants should not be permitted to vent their frustrations by cheaply invoking the jurisdiction of the court. The court proceedings ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment and persecution.
I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the trust he has placed in me by appointing me to the apex of the Judicial Services of this country. I commend and thank His Excellency the President for being willing to depart from the status quo and grant the hope of this position once again to Career Judges. It is my sincere hope that my tenure in this position will fully affirm the wisdom of His Excellencys decision in this regard.
In this occasion I cannot possibly fail to mention with deep gratitude all those who have guided me and walked by me through this long journey to the apex.
I recall with gratitude the unfailing love and affection of my late parents and their every effort to lay the initial foundation of my education.
I wish to remember with gratitude all my teachers at my alma mater St. Thomas College Gurutalawa and St. Thomas College Kotte. I am particularly grateful to late Mr. Daya Perera P.C, Mr. D.C. Priya Amerasinghe Advocate Supreme Court and Mr. Jayantha Gunasekera P.C under whos guidance I learnt the rudiments of practice.
I am deeply grateful to my wife Sriyani, who has been that constant pillar of strength in my life and for all her silent prayers for me day in and day out. To my daughters Nadishani and Amanda, sons-in-law Sharon and Sam I say a big thank you for standing by me always, with much love and support.
At this point I also lovingly recall my sister late Justice Chereen Madawala who also passed out as an Attorney-At- Law together with me and joined the Judiciary and served as a Judge of the Court of Appeal at the time of her demise.
I also extend my heartfelt gratitude to the official and un-official Bar, to my brother and sister Judges of the Supreme Court, to honourable judges of the Court of Appeal, High Court, District Court and Magistrate Court, Registrar and staff for your presence here today. I also thank all my dear friends and relatives who have made a special effort to be present here today. I truly appreciate your solidarity with me in this special occasion.
In closing there is something to which I must testify: You who know me well are my witnesses that I was unassumingly minding my own duties as a Supreme Court Judge until the 12th of this month.
It was to my own great surprise that I was called out and made to sit in this honourable chair in the most unexpected manner. I am convinced beyond doubt that this was the work of Lord Jesus Christ.
I am humbled and reminded that I am answerable to the people of this country and ultimately to God in my duties as the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. I am confident beyond doubt that God will stand by me and grant me His grace to carry out my duties fearlessly and independently.
I quote from the Holy Bible (Micah 6:8)
And what does the LORD require of you To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
And to this end I commit myself.
Thank you for your presence and patience.
May God bless you all!

Buddhist monks have to lead reconciliation - Fowzie
Buddhist monks should lead the reconciliation process in the country, National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting held in the Moneragala Public Library Auditorium on Monday on institutionalize national unity and co-existence. He said that religious leaders should work together to bring in reconciliation.
We must create a safe human-friendly environment for our young generation.
They will blame for us if we do not achieve it, the State Minister said. The State Minister said that labeling schools as Buddhist, Hindu and Muslims is the main cause for aggravating the ethnic issue and it directly affects the reconciliation process.
Politics in our country causes ethnic issues as many of the power-hungry political elements mislead the public and they become extremists to do any wrong thing for their own benefit without thinking the repercussion, Minister Fowzie said.
Minister Fowzie said Sri Lankans never become Sinhala, Muslim or Hindu by birth and these religious consciousness is within themselves because of cultural effect, but all born to serve the human beings.
It is a timely need to lead our lives sans class, creed and caste to enjoy reconciliation, Fowzie said. The teachers of religious institutions play a key role in shaping children, he said.
The State Minister urged the teachers to render their service to inculcate good morals in children. He said the government take all measures to bring in peace among all religions in the country. National Unity and Co-existence Ministry Secretary Sujan Nanayakkara, Uva Provincial Council Member Kuda Bandara Medawela and Moneragala District Secretary D.S. Pathmakulasuriya spoke.
Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim religious leaders, teachers of religious schools and other dignitaries participated.

Case against Gamini Senarath fixed for daily trial
The case against former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath and three others was yesterday fixed for daily trial beginning November 7, by the Permanent High Court-at-Bar set up to hear high-profile financial fraud and corruption cases.
The accused are charged with illegally transferring Rs.500 million from Litro Gas to Canwill Holdings Pvt Limited.
When the case came up before the Trial-at-Bar bench comprising High Court Judges Sampath Abeykoon (President), Sampath Wijeratne and Champa Janaki Rajaratne, the earlier trial date (October 30) was adjusted to November 7, since the defence did not receive several documents pertaining to the indictments.
However, this case will be taken up again on October 30 as a calling date in order to consider the defences preliminary objections regarding the courts jurisdiction to hear this case.
Four accused  former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage, former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna and Lasantha Bandara  are currently on bail. The four accused have been charged under the Penal Code, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Public Property Act.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused have committed the offence between February 1, 2014 and January 20, 2015.
The Attorney General filed indictments against the accused for illegally transferring Rs.500 million from Litro Gas to Canwill Holdings Pvt Limited.
The Attorney General further alleged that the money had instead gone into the account of Helanco Hotels and Spa that backed the proposed Hyatt Hotel in Hambantota. The first instalment of Rs. 50 million had been transferred on February 14 while Rs. 450 million was sent on February 19. Piyadasa Kudabalage, the second accused in the case, it is alleged, on October 13, 2014, again transferred Rs. 48 million from this amount to purchase two plots at Sandatenna, Nuwara Eliya. It is also alleged that another Rs. 18.9 million was spent to buy an apartment for the use of fourth accused Lasantha Bandara. Therefore, the four accused have been charged with money laundering. Additionally, some of this money was used to pay off a credit card bill amounting to Rs.700,000.
The Attorney General has listed 92 documents as evidence while 63 persons have been named as witnesses. Former Ceylinco Group chairman Lalith Kotelawala, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, the Central Banks former Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri, former Cabinet Secretary Sumith Abeysinghe, and Bank of Ceylon and Urban Development Authority officials have been named as witnesses.

The case for global unity
In the words of United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the UNs mission is to to repair broken trust, to heal our planet, to leave no one behind and to uphold dignity for one and all, as United Nations.
Today, the UN marks its 73rd anniversary. The UN Day marks the anniversary of the entry into force in 1945 of the UN Charter. With the ratification of this founding document by the majority of its signatories, including the five Permanent Members of the Security Council, the United Nations officially came into being. October 24 has been celebrated as United Nations Day since 1948 and some countries celebrate it as a holiday.
The UN and its Member States are facing a multitude of challenges today that are not easy to resolve by any means. The United Nations is needed more than ever at this time of multiple crises. Poverty, disease, terrorism, conflict, gender discrimination and climate change are exacting a heavy toll. Millions of people continue to suffer deplorable exploitation through bonded labour, human trafficking, sexual slavery or unsafe conditions in factories, fields and mines. The global economy remains an uneven playing field.
Contrary to popular opinion, the UN and its multiple agencies have had success on many fronts but there have been failures as well. The UN Sustainable Development Goals have inspired the most successful anti-poverty campaign ever. The many United Nations treaties on inequality, human rights, torture and racism have protected people, while several other agreements have safeguarded the environment. UN peacekeepers including those from Sri Lanka have ensured peace in some hostile areas of the world and its mediators have settled many disputes among nations.
The world is changing, and with it the demands on the United Nations. The UN provides a unique platform for international action. It offers unparalleled legitimacy for global engagement, owing to its universal membership. Yet, much needs to be done by the UN and its Member States. Today, the biggest threat facing the UN is that many countries are moving away from multilateralism. They not only seek to resolve their problems on their own, but also stop helping other nations via aid and other mechanisms. Several countries have pulled out of leading UN agencies. Many countries are choosing isolationism instead of international cooperation. This runs counter to the world order envisaged by the founding fathers of the UN.
There are several major issues facing the world today that can only be resolved through international cooperation. Terrorism and Climate Change are among those. Terrorism is raging around the world and even countries that were relatively safe from terrorism had experienced it recently. The rapid spread of terror groups such as ISIS is alarming. Whole countries have been destabilized with the rise of terrorism. There are around 50 conflicts around the world which show no sign of ending. It is a challenge that the world has to fight together.
Despite the many obvious signs of Climate Change, several countries have denied its effects and even pulled out of the landmark Paris Accord. This could be a disaster for the Planet Earth. All efforts must be made to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Accord despite the setbacks.
There are many other global issues that need our attention, including poverty, disease, population growth, and lack of access to education. These are challenges that the UN must tackle head-on. But doubts have been expressed whether the UN is strong enough and willing to do so. There is a notion that the UN system is dominated by a few powerful countries and the UN indeed has to do a lot of work to shed this image. There is also a notion that the UN needs to talk less and do more.
There have been many calls for strengthening and reforming the UN so that it becomes a more balanced, more effective organisation for international cooperation. There should be a constant emphasis on transparency, accountability, integrity, efficiency and flexibility. Since all countries contribute funds to the UN, the efficient use of these funds must be encouraged. For example, Sweden and Denmark have both decided to withhold funding for the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), after reports about its director Erik Solheims extensive and expensive travel. It was revealed that he has reportedly been spending nearly 80 percent of his time out of the UNEPs headquarters in Nairobi, opting to travel extensively at a cost of around US$ 500,000 during his first 22 months in the job. His massive air travel has raised questions about the carbon emissions generated. Such glaring anomalies should be corrected.
The UN is all about global cooperation. It should provide an equal voice, an equal platform to all 193 Member States irrespective of their status. The UN should be an instrument for positive change across the world. It does a remarkable amount of work in all areas of the world but it needs more monetary and other resources to fulfill its wide ranging mandate. In doing so, it has the potential to ensure world peace and a bright future for all.

Crops worth Rs.165 bn wasted annually: Minister
The transportation of fruits and vegetables had been an issue for farmers, with crops worth Rs.165 billion were wasted annually due to it, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a gathering at a meeting held in Agunakolapelessa on the Api Wawalai, Api Kanne project.

Vap and KatinaThai Experience
Dhamma Dialogue at the  Gosinga Sala Gardens
Vap full moon rose calmly bathing and illuminating the whole Gosinga Sala Gardens with its brilliant sylvan glow as the sun departed on this exceptional evening. The enviroment was laid up for the leisure of arhants. The orchard was comforting to the mind. Among the other illustrious arhants who were residing there were Elder Moggallana, Elder Revatha, and Elder Anuruddha. They all were moving in to the park where Arhant Sariputta and Arhant Kassapa was engaged in a Dhamma dialogue. Observing this splendid group of arahants was Rev Ananda who was interested in linking with them.
Sariyuth Thera addressed them,
Dear colleagues, I am sincerely grateful for your attendance tonight, while Sala florets in full blossom is blending in stirring air that disperse in all directions. As the charming fragrance reach your senses, may I ask from each one of you in your analysis, as to what type of a Bikkhu will contribute extra beauty and dcor to the grandeur of this elegant garden or add to this beautiful plot Venerable Ananda, you may respond now, you are the close confidante of the Buddha. One by one they affirmed their views on the kind of Bikkhu who could make the orchard more striking while Elder Sariputta unwearyingly listened. At the conclusion of the round, Elder Maha Moggallana bowed to Arhant Sariputta and spoke to him, dear Sariputta, this serene night is lovely to watch; all have responded, now we would be happy to ask your views too.
O friends, suppose a bikkhu is able to live his day have the benefit of the bliss of whatever achievement that is his preference for that time of the day, and with his mind completely well under his control, I believe it is this type of Bikkhu who can add further beauty and dcor to the splendor of this elegant garden
Importance of Vap Full moon
After offering Katina Cheewara, the Kings in ancient Ceylon, participated in Vap magul ceremony to promote agriculture. King Parakramabahu had offered over eighty Katinas before participating in plough and sow ritual which commenced concurrently. The Buddha visited Tavatimsa celestial plane on a Vap Full Moon Poya Day. He preached Abidhamma to the Devas, which included the Matru Deva or his Mother Deity, Queen Mahamaya and as per the chronicle, she had attained Sotapanna status along with another 80 million Devas who attained various stages of Sainthood. Vap Poya is of great significance for yet another reason, as Buddhist history reveals an important landmark; it was on this day that on termination of his retreat Buddha move down to the city gate of Sankassapura. The Maitriya Bodhisatva, a future Buddha became a devotee of the Buddha with a large following of entourage of over 500 on Vap poya.
The arrival of Sangamitta Theri at the initiation of King Devanam Piyatissa was on Vap Poya day, which paved the way for Sanghamitta Theri to set up the Bhikkhuni order in Sri Lanka.
Why Waste resources in thename of Katina
Vap full moon Poya is significant to Sri Lankan Buddhists due to some special events taking place on this day. It symbolizes the end of Vas season, or the rainy periods retreat for monks. It is also useful that we reflect upon recently added wasteful extravaganza to Katina pageants making it an extremely costly event. As venerable Maduluwave Sobitha thero once stated, some temples spend a few millions in organizing a grand perahera wasting lot of funds that can be used to build a small house for a deserving dayake.
The chief priests and Dayakesabhavas should give serious thought to the late theros golden advice. Are those elephants, hired dancers, fireball acrobats and professional whip-crackers are really necessary It is high time the organisers rethink on the inevitability of using them. Cannot the temple authorities go back to past performance and conduct it in a simple manner As per writers nostalgic memory, in good old days there were flag and flower bearing devotees who walked in a single file headed by the Katina cheevara carrying chief dayaka and a few drummers, that made an ideal procession. Why hire Pachyderms at Rs100,000/- each
An Experience with Thai Katina
During an official visit to Bangkok some 15 years ago, the writer had the privilege of visiting a Thai Temple some 100 km south-East of capital Bangkok on a Vap full moon day. Taking time off the busy schedule and leaving the city hotel around 5.00 am we took the highway route to reach the place in less than an hour.
I was curious to learn the similarities and differences in the practice of Theravada Buddhism in that country by directly observing the Thai Buddhist ritualistic conduct of Katina Pooja. I reached remote Ashokarama, which I selected browsing through the internet. Thai conventional performance carried out at this sub-urban temple reminded me of my home-town temples. The general set up and layout was very much similar to ours.
In all Buddhist countries where Theravada sect prevailed Katina Pooja is a well-established custom. The Katina Cheewaraya, as per observance is a thick robe stitched in a 24-hour day and night operation. Any bikkhu who had completed a rainy seasonal Vas is eligible to accept a Katina Cheewaraya. All other materials offered at a Katina puja ritual are considered as similarly valuable contributions. Unlike in the Bangkok citys centerpiece attractions known as golden temples, which even charge visitors an entrance fee, the rest of the temples in the outskirts of city were quite similar to Sri Lankan set up in both the practice of traditional rituals and also in the Lay-priest relations.
The Thai Buddhists like us believed that Katina  Cheevara Pooja, as the most noble and meritorious ritual or sacred wholesome act that one can perform in life; they too think, it is just one among Ata Kusal, the Great Eight Merits, as per the deliverance by the Chief Priest in his sermon.
Very few spoke English there. The Buddhist accounted for 93 percent of countys population. I was fortunate, that a young Samanera could converse in English reasonably well who roughly translated parts of the sermon for me. The gender ratio among the devotees really shocked me: unlike back home an equal number of male devotees were seen participating along with their female counterparts; it was a significant difference compared to our very high Upasika involvement. Thai Theravada scholars Ajahn Sujato and Dr. Mettanando Bhikkhu believe the so-called Garudhammas, the eight rules that constraint Buddhist nuns [Bikkhunis] was an introduction by male chauvinists long after the Buddha. They both agree in their writings that it was the work of prejudiced and anti-women participants at the Councils held after the Buddha. They vehemently reject the rule as more Jainist than Buddhist which says, a bikkhuni, irrespective of her seniority, must bow down to every novice male monk.
What is meant by term Katina
The third book of the Vinaya Pitaka,Mahavagga Pali says, Katina originated with the thirty forest-dwelling Pindapatika bikkhus, who were on their way to Sravasti to visit the Lord Buddha during the rainy season. The extreme weather forced them to break journey for two days and resume the journey in spite of the rain. They reached Jetawana in Sravasti, wearing rag-robes and exhausted their robes soaked with mud.
On hearing about the monks tiring journey the Blessed One realized the agony of monks travelling in the rainy season and decided to relax some of the rules for Bhikkhus, but ensured that they are relevant strictly during the rainy season.
The term Katina is interpreted differently by two schools of thought, both of Theravada origin. Our scholars consider katina means hard as Diamond, whereas the Thais construe the word as originating from Katrina, meaning weaving cloth. However, our scholars believe that the term implies stability, firmness, or durability.
According to the Vinaya commentary the ceremony and the robes was called katina because of the merit attained from gift of robes was as hard as diamond. All Theravadines accept as true, that the Katina Pooja and the related performances are the most commendable over all other ritualistic operations.

Enter rain retreat
The rain retreat, having commenced in Esala, comes to an end in Vap. It is time for Buddhists to celebrate with much grandeur  spiritual grandeur. In Pali Katina means unbreakable.
Modern days do not have a proper rain calendar. But we are always fond of following the traditions, hence the rainy retreat, no matter whether rains come or not.
The Buddha, along with his disciples, initiated the rain retreat  vassana. Monks, especially higher ordained, are expected to follow the discipline code in a strict sense. How this ritual came to be is interesting.
When the Buddhas monk disciples used to walk even in the rainy seasons, it was a good point for the non-Buddhist sects to attack the Buddha. That the Gautamas followers kill thousands of living beings in the rainy season.
When monks stayed indoors and meditated, people mistook it. They thought monks suffer a lot, and reported this to King Bimbisara. The good-hearted king invited the Buddha and his followers to his city of Rajagaha.
It was the custom of the Buddhist monks to roam for their alms. This was so even during the rainy periods. This had been, as usual, criticised by the non-Buddhist sectors especially Jains. Their complaints were that the Buddhist monks walk on the lawns and crops. Jains believe destroying plants too is a sinful act. They also opined that during the rainy season, many insect-like creatures come to the ground, and monks roaming affects their life. Any being, including even birds, will remain indoors during this season, while the Buddhist monks still roam here and there giving a cold shoulder to natural norms.
The Buddha listened to this, surprised them by ruling that the monks should stay indoors in the rainy season and named it rain retreat. It means vas in Pali, because viseema is dwelling in English. The retreat lasts for three months.
The vas actually starts in Esala, which is called pera vas, and what happens in Nikini is called pasu vas. This paved the way to a strong bond between the monks and laypeople, as they get to meet oftener.
This period is considered utmost sacred. Many meritorious activities such as discussion and meditation are carried out. Whenever a layperson builds a new house, h/she invites the Buddhist monks to spend a while during this season.
Offering a katina robe or being engaged in a katina activity is considered a great merit, which will yield results in this existence itself. It is considered as one of the eight great meritorious activities.

The Buddha taught us to give up all forms  of evil and cultivate virtue
Following the  right path
Fight greed, fight aversion, fight delusion... these are the enemy. In the practice of Buddhism, the path of the Buddha, we fight with Dhamma, using patient endurance. We fight by resisting our countless moods.
Dhamma and the world are inter-related. Where there is Dhamma there is the world, where there is the world there is Dhamma. Where there are defilements there are those who conquer defilements, who do battle with them. This is called fighting inwardly. To fight outwardly people take hold of bombs and guns to throw and to shoot; they conquer and are conquered. Conquering others is the way of the world. In the practice of Dhamma we don't have to fight others, but instead conquer our own minds, patiently enduring and resisting all our moods.
When it comes to Dhamma practice we don't harbor resentment and enmity amongst ourselves, but instead let go of all forms of ill-will in our own actions and thoughts, freeing ourselves from jealousy, aversion and resentment. Hatred can only be overcome by not harboring resentment and bearing grudges.
Hurtful actions and reprisals are different but closely related. Actions once done are finished with, there's no need to answer with revenge and hostility. This is called "action" (kamma). "Reprisal" (vera) means to continue that action further with thoughts of "you did it to me so I'm going to get you back." There's no end to this. It brings about the continual seeking of revenge, and so hatred is never abandoned. As long as we behave like this the chain remains unbroken, there's no end to it. No matter where we go, the feuding continues.
The Supreme Teacher [1] taught the world, he had compassion for all worldly beings. But the world nevertheless goes on like this. The wise should look into this and select those things which are of true value. The Buddha had trained in the various arts of warfare as a prince, but he saw that they weren't really useful, they are limited to the world with its fighting and aggression. Therefore, in training ourselves as those who have left the world, we must learn to give up all forms of evil, giving up all those things which are the cause for enmity. We conquer ourselves, we don't try to conquer others. We fight, but we fight only the defilements; if there is greed, we fight that; if there is aversion, we fight that; if there is delusion, we strive to give it up.
This is called "Dhamma fighting." This warfare of the heart is really difficult, in fact it's the most difficult thing of all. We become monks in order to contemplate this, to learn the art of fighting greed, aversion and delusion. This is our prime responsibility.
This is the inner battle, fighting with defilements. But there are very few people who fight like this. Most people fight with other things, they rarely fight defilements. They rarely even see them.
The Buddha taught us to give up all forms of evil and cultivate virtue. This is the right path. Teaching in this way is like the Buddha picking us up and placing us at the beginning of the path. Having reached the path, whether we walk along it or not is up to us. The Buddha's job is finished right there. He shows the way, that which is right and that which is not right. This much is enough, the rest is up to us. Now, having reached the path we still don't know anything, we still haven't seen anything, so we must learn. To learn we must be prepared to endure some hardship, just like students in the world. It's difficult enough to obtain the knowledge and learning necessary for them to pursue their careers. They have to endure. When they think wrongly or feel averse or lazy they must force themselves before they can graduate and get a job. The practice for a monk is similar. If we determine to practice and contemplate, then we will surely see the way.
Ditthimana is a harmful thing. Ditthi means "view" or "opinion." All forms of view are called ditthi: seeing good as evil, seeing evil as good... any way whatsoever that we see things. This is not the problem. The problem lies with the clinging to those views, called mana; holding on to those views as if they were the truth. This leads us to spin around from birth to death, never reaching completion, just because of that clinging. So the Buddha urged us to let go of views.
If many people live together, as we do here, they can still practice comfortably if their views are in harmony. But even two or three monks would have difficulty if their views were not good or harmonious. When we humble ourselves and let go of our views, even if there are many of us, we come together at the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. [2]
It's not true to say that there will be disharmony just because there are many of us. Just look at a millipede. A millipede has many legs, doesn't it Just looking at it you'd think it would have difficulty walking, but actually it doesn't. It has its own order and rhythm. In our practice it's the same. If we practice as the Noble Sangha of the Buddha practiced, then it's easy. That is, supatipanno  those who practice well; ujupatipanno  those who practice straightly; anapatipanno  those who practice to transcend suffering, and samicipatipanno  those who practice properly.
These four qualities, established within us, will make us true members of Sangha. Even if we number in the hundreds or thousands, no matter how many we are, we all travel the same path. We come from different backgrounds, but we are the same. Even though our views may differ, if we practice correctly there will be no friction. Just like all the rivers and streams which flow to the sea... once they enter the sea they all have the same taste and color. It's the same with people. When they enter the stream of Dhamma, it's the one Dhamma. Even though they come from different places, they harmonize, they merge.
But the thinking which causes all the disputes and conflict is ditthi-mana. Therefore the Buddha taught us to let go of views. Don't allow mana to cling to those views beyond their relevance.
The Buddha taught the value of constant sati, [3] recollection. Whether we are standing, walking, sitting or reclining, wherever we are, we should have this power of recollection. When we have sati we see ourselves, we see our own minds. We see the "body within the body," "the mind within the mind." If we don't have sati we don't know anything, we aren't aware of what is happening.
So sati is very important. With constant sati we will listen to the Dhamma of the Buddha at all times. This is because "eye seeing forms" is Dhamma; "ear hearing sounds" is Dhamma; "nose smelling odors" is Dhamma; "tongue tasting flavors" is Dhamma; "body feeling sensations" is Dhamma; when impressions arise in the mind, that is Dhamma also. Therefore one who has constant sati always hears the Buddha's teaching. The Dhamma is always there. Why Because of sati, because we are aware.
Sati is recollection, sampajaa is self-awareness. This awareness is the actual Buddho,the Buddha. When there is sati-sampajaa, understanding will follow. We know what is going on. When the eye sees forms: is this proper or improper When the ear hears sound: is this the appropriate or inappropriate Is it harmful Is it wrong, is it right And so on like this with everything. If we understand we hear the Dhamma all the time.
So let us all understand that right now we are learning in the midst of Dhamma. Whether we go forward or step back, we meet the Dhamma  it's all Dhamma if we have sati. Even seeing the animals running around in the forest we can reflect, seeing that all animals are the same as us. They run away from suffering and chase after happiness, just as people do. Whatever they don't like they avoid; they are afraid of dying, just like people. If we reflect on this, we see that all beings in the world, people as well, are the same in their various instincts. Thinking like this is called "bhavana," [4] seeing according to the truth, that all beings are companions in birth, old age, sickness and death. Animals are the same as human beings and human beings are the same as animals. If we really see things the way they are our mind will give up attachment to them.
Therefore it is said we must have sati. If we have sati we will see the state of our own mind. Whatever we are thinking or feeling we must know it. This knowing is called Buddho, the Buddha, the one who knows... who knows thoroughly, who knows clearly and completely. When the mind knows completely we find the right practice.
So the straight way to practice is to have mindfulness, sati. If you are without sati for five minutes you are crazy for five minutes, heedless for five minutes. whenever you are lacking in sati you are crazy. Sati is essential. To have sati is to know yourself, to know the condition of your mind and your life. This is to have understanding and discernment, to listen to the Dhamma at all times. After leaving the teacher's discourse, you still hear the Dhamma, because the Dhamma is everywhere.
So therefore, all of you, be sure to practice every day. Whether lazy or diligent, practice just the same. Practice of the Dhamma is not done by following your moods. If you practice following your moods then it's not Dhamma. Don't discriminate between day and night, whether the mind is peaceful or not... just practice.
It's like a child who is learning to write. At first he doesn't write nicely  big, long loops and squiggles  he writes like a child. After a while the writing improves through practice. Practicing the Dhamma is like this. At first you are awkward... sometimes calm, sometimes not, you don't really know what's what. Some people get discouraged. Don't slacken off! You must persevere with the practice. Live with effort, just like the schoolboy: as he gets older he writes better and better. From writing badly he grows to write beautifully, all because of the practice from childhood.
Our practice is like this. Try to have recollection at all times: standing, walking, sitting or reclining. When we perform our various duties smoothly and well, we feel peace of mind. When there is peace of mind in our work it's easy to have peaceful meditation, they go hand in hand. So make an effort. You should all make an effort to follow the practice. This is training.

Fonseka against paying compensation to former LTTE cadres
I am not in favour of the proposal to pay compensation to former LTTE cadres, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
Fonseka observed that the LTTE cadres were involved in a separatist movement which was a serious violation of the Constitution.
Minister Fonseka was speaking at a press briefing at the UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha, yesterday.
The LTTE was an organisation that took up arms against the government of Sri Lanka. It is not legal to pay compensation for such people who have violated the Constitution and are involved in anti-government acts. If there are persons, citizens, who have not been identified as culprits before the law and have been wronged, we can accommodate them, Minister Fonseka said.
I cannot give you an example as to what type of a person that would be. Now, if a wildlife officer dies in an elephant attack, his family shall be compensated. It is the same case when it comes to a policeman who has died in action. However, I am not in agreement with paying compensation to those who were involved in anti-government acts, Minister Fonseka pointed out.
Meanwhile, when asked about the claims of a caretaker government, Minister Fonseka said that the UNP does not need a caretaker government.
These are the agendas of the same people who brought in a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister. If they are going to set up a caretaker government, they will only have the Joint Opposition to rely on. All other political parties were and are against a Rajapaksa rule. I am sure they will not support a caretaker government, he pointed out.
Asked about a decision to increase the pension of former Parliamentarians, Minister Fonseka observed that if such an increase is granted, it should be applicable for all the government pensioners, not just the MPs.
Asked about the recent elephant deaths caused due to train-elephant collisions, Minister Fonseka observed that the Wildlife Department is working closely with the Railway Department to find solutions to the matter. Asked about the delay in brining persons who are alleged to have pmisuded public funds, Minister Fonseka said that there seems to be certain instances where strong political influencing stopped justice being done to some of those persons.

CID informs Court:
FORMER TID DIG NALAKAS VOICE CUTS MATCHED
Criminal Investigations Department officials yesterday informed Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne that the voice recordings of telephone conversations between former Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) DIG Nalaka Silva and Anti Corruption Movement Operations Director Namal Kumara matched.
The CID informed the Fort Magistrate based on the Government Analysts report that 123 out of 124 voice samples of both Nalaka Silva and Namal Kumara matched.
Investigators cited that some data of Namal Kumaras mobile phone has been deleted and they cannot be retrieved as the department does not have the necessary technology .
They said that Namal Kumaras mobile phone would be sent to Hong Kong to retrieve the deleted data.
The investigators also disclosed that Namal Kumara had served at the Sri Lanka Air Force and later joined the Sri Lanka Army without being discharged from the Air Force.
The CID told court that Namal Kumara had later served at the Avante Garde Security Service too and an investigation is being carried out into Namal Kumara.
The investigators also disclosed that DIG Nalaka Silva had created a fake Facebook account under the name of Rasika Sanjeeweani using his official computer through a Woman Police Constable attached to the Terrorist Investigation Division.
Investigators sought a court order to refer the computer in question to the Governmet Analyst for thorough investigation.
The Fort Magistrate after taking the CIDs request into consideration ordered the Government Analysts report over Nalaka Silvas computer.
Attorney at Law Ajith Pathirana appearing on behalf of DIG Nalaka Silva said that his client had rendered tremendous service over eradicating terrorism in the country and some parts of voice recordings given by Namal Kumara had been deleted.
Attorney at Law Maithree Gunaratne who appeared on behalf of complainant said that the CID is going to make the complainant as accused.

Further remanded for allegedly soliciting bribe
National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) Chairman M. K. Muthuvinayagam and Kadiresu Sivanesan, who were arrested for allegedly soliciting a bribe from a businessman, were yesterday further remanded by the Colombo Additional Magistrate.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage made this order since Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake was absent yesterday.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the NLDB Chairman had allegedly demanded Rs.1.2 million from a businessman to expedite the lease of a restaurant at the Malsiripura NLDB Farm. However, it was later negotiated for Rs.600,000.
The Chairman had done this deal through another person known as Kadiresu Sivanesan.
Sivanesan was sent to collect the alleged bribe from the businessman and based on a complaint made by the said businessman, the Bribery Commission officers had observed the whole incident. Sivanesan, having obtained the cash had called the NLDB Chairman to confirm that he had received the money. The case will be taken up on November 1.

Gun licences for farmers to protect fields
In order to uplift the living standards of the rural people in the Kegalle district, urgent solutions should be found to problems relating to agriculture which is their main livelihood. The main agricultural problem they face is crop damage caused by monkeys, torque monkeys and other animals, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Dr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing a meeting of the Kegalle District Development Committee held at the Kegalla kachcheri, on October 22.
We have discussed this problem and arrived at the most plausible solution. In future, we would issue gun licences to farmers to protect their daily grub. Doing so would be a great act of merit, he said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said this problem needed a technical solution.
There is no purpose in giving firearms to individuals in the village. But when we give a shot gun to a farmer, we are doing it to help him safeguard his livelihood, he said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said as peoples representatives, it was their duty is to look into peoples problems. The main problem of farmers in the district was crop damage caused by animals. It was the small-scale farmers who are hit hard by this problem. There were instances where even monkeys consumed their bowl of rice on the hearth by invading their kitchens.

Commission probing SriLankan Airlines:
I was unable to take any decisions regarding airline - Former Civil Aviation Minister
Former Civil Aviation Minister Priyankara Jayaratne yesterday said that he was unable to take any decisions and did not even know any information pertaining to activities of SriLankan Airlines.
He said as a result he could not answer any of the questions raised by the Opposition MPs in Parliament regarding SriLankan Airlines.
Jayaratne added that he was so helpless and remained silent when Opposition MPs raised questions with regard to the airline and its activities.
Jayaratne made the above observations while giving evidence before the Presidential Commission to inquire into Allegations of large scale fraud and malpractices at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka.
He further said that though he had informed the Board of Directors to take necessary decisions, they had failed to do so.
Responding to the questions made by Additional Solicitor General PC Neil Unamboowe,the former Minister alleged that former SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe and the Board of Directors were ignoring the subject Minister and as making decisions on the direction of then Finance Minister and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Jayaratne noted that he informed the former Presidents Senior Additional Secretary Gamini Senerath about the situation that prevailed at the airline,but yet no measures were taken.
It is at the Commission that I saw some of the important documents pertaining to the transactions made by the airline. I was not aware of the transactions that were made eventhough I was the subject Minister, Jayaratne said.
He said that as the subject Minister he submitted a Cabinet Paper on May 27,2011 requesting Rs.520 Million for SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka on the instructions of the Ministry Secretary for a five year development plan.
In 2012, the Cabinet approved the proposal, but, the money was never passed. Former Chairman Wickremasinghe never discussed any matters related to the airlines with me, he said. Jayaratne pointed out that then Chief Executive Officer of the airline Kapila Chandrasena was present at some the progressive review meetings.
I do not know if SriLankan Airlines received Rs. 14.2 billion from Bonds or not. I was not made aware about it by any official. I did not even inquire on the matter as the Board of Directors functioned ignoring the line ministry directives, he emphasised.
He said he was rendered helpless when he was questioned by the Opposition MPs in Parliament on this matter.
A four member committee chaired by the Ministry Secretary was appointed to look into SriLankan Airlines but this Committee did not proceed, he said
The former Minister said that the former Chairman was a planter and brother-in-law of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He added that a Cabinet Paper was submitted on March 22, 2012 to obtain US$ 121 million from the Mashreq Bank and the Bank of Ceylon was a guarantee.
I was not aware of many things happening at SriLankan Airlines but placed my signature for the recommendations made by the Ministry Secretary, he said. He added that Ranjith Silva and Dr.Ravindra Ruberu were serving as Ministry Secretaries and he had trust in them.
The Bank of Ceylon had issued two bonds for the airline without inquiring from me. But, I was not aware of more information of these bonds, he said.
Jayaratne added that the airlined was struck in a major financial crisis. The crisis is so severe that the airline could not implement a business plan, he added. He said that he submitted Cabinet Papers only,but insisted that he did not submit any Cabinet Papers with regard to the purchasing of airbuses or the leasing of airbuses.

Importance of ensuring equal justice stressed
The Convener of the Movement for a Just Society Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to ensure good governance in the country by fulfilling the pledges given to the public when they came in to power.
In 2015, people of this country proved that none of the two main political parties who ruled the country is suitable to rule this country anymore. Therefore, both parties had to form a Unity Government. But it is questionable whether these two parties united to work for the betterment of the public or to for the benefit of their fellow politicians, Prof. Wijesuriya said.
He further stressed the importance of ensuring equal justice for all and urged the relevant authorities not to consider narrow personal objectives when appointing persons to the high ranking judicial professions.
The people of this country are still expecting justice for the large scale crimes and corruption committed, he said.
Executive Committee Member of the Movement for a Just Society Saman Rathnapriya said the President and the Prime Minister should take all the important decisions of this Unity Government without just demonstrating that they work together.
People gave a mandate to form a Unity Government.
If any party wants to quit the Unity Government they have to wait until the term of Government expires, he added.
Commenting on the Cabinet Paper submitted by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe seeking approval for calling for international tenders to supply the necessary cranes to the East Terminal, Rathnapriya said that this is a good decision taken by the Minister to develop the Eastern Terminal.
The Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port will not be privatised and 80 million US dollars will be allocated to install the necessary equipment including cranes.

Indian S.C. eases firecracker ban
INDIA: India's Supreme Courtt on Tuesday eased a ban on fireworks for a major Hindu festival despite air pollution in New Delhi and other cities again reaching danger levels.
The Supreme Court, which last year banned firecrackers for the Diwali festival, rejected a new call for a ban in the capital amidst growing concern over pollution.
Firecrackers set off for the Hindu festival of lights add to the toxic mix created by farmers burning crop stubble, diesel engines, coal-fired power plants and industrial emissions.
The World Health Organisation in May listed 14 Indian cities, including Delhi, in the world's top 15 with the dirtiest air.
Ahead of Diwali on November 7, the Supreme Court ordered that only reduced smoke fireworks -- so-called 'green firecrackers' -- could be sold and that this must be through licensed traders. No fireworks can be sold online, it said.
The court has also set a two hour window from 8:00pm to 10:00pm for the lighting of crackers on Diwali.
It needs to be enforced strictly, Gopal Sankarnarayan, a lawyer for the petitioners told NDTV television.
Last year, the Supreme Court suspended the licences of all firecracker sellers in Delhi for one month because of the pollution crisis which leaves the Indian capital's 20 million residents gasping for clean air during the winter months.
However, many ignored the ban and purchased crackers illegally or brought out old stocks.
Every winter, air pollution in Delhi soars as cooler air traps harmful particles from the various emissions.
Smog has climbed in recent weeks as temperatures have fallen and smoke from burning wheat fields in neighbouring states has reached the capital, mingling with urban pollutants.

Injured Wawrinka withdraws from Basel
Basel, Monday: A back injury suffered during a Sunday practice session with compatriot Roger Federer forced Stan Wawrinka to pull out of the Swiss Indoors tournament on Monday, while Marin Cilic eased into the second round in Basel.
"I turned my back, and retiring was the only decision I could make," said the three-time Grand Slam champion, adding that he will end his season early and not play at the Paris Masters next week.
The withdrawal of Wawrinka, ranked 68th in the world as he continues to fight to fully recover more than a year after two knee surgeries, comes after Federer made an injury confession of his own.
Federer revealed in the run-up to the start at the St Jakobshalle that he had been suffering since the summer with a hand injury, which the 20-time Grand Slam winner insisted was fine now.
Federer, the holder, is seeking a ninth title at the event where he got his start in the sport as a teenage ballboy.
He begins on Tuesday night against Serb Filip Krajinovic. Wawrinka has been playing in fits and starts this season, losing in the Shanghai first round this month after reaching the semi-finals in September in St Petersburg.
Wawrinka, twice a semi-finalist in Basel, was to have faced Adrian Mannarino in the first round on Wednesday. Later on Monday, 2016 winner Cilic saw off rising Canadian star Denis Shapovalov in straight sets to reach the second round.
Australian Open runner-up Cilic is one of two former champions in the draw alongside Federer, and he brushed aside teenager Shapovalov 6-4, 6-2.
The world number six will next face Romania's Marius Copil, who defeated American Ryan Harrison 6-2, 7-6 (10/8).
Finnish-born home player Henri Laaksonen won his first match in Basel after five previous first-round losses, beating Roland Garros semi-finalist and sixth seed Marco Cecchinato 6-4, 6-2.

## Title: Its wonderful to realise the truth of insecurity

## Section: Features

Its wonderful to realise the truth of insecurity
The impermanence, the first thing one can really watch, is the uncertainty of everything. Because one of the meanings of nicca, the opposite to anicca, is something which is certain, which is regular, something you can rely upon. So the opposite means that things which are there will suddenly disappear, unreliable, irregular. And its interesting contemplating that word, anicca - unreliable, because how often do we seek for something to rely upon in this world. Some little place of security, something we think is always going to be there for us to come home to, either physically or mentally. Some sort of refuge, inside the mind or inside the world, a place of safety or a thing of security. What anicca is doing is saying that all of that is insecure, is insubstantial, is irregular, and you cannot rely upon it.
The tendency of the human being is may be to admit that a lot of the world is unreliable but to seek some sort of secure place, or secure person or secure mind state, which you think is secure and is always going to be there. Thats why some people look for partners in the world, someone you can rely upon, someone whos always going to be there for you, a soul-mate. But all soul-mates eventually disappear, they go, they too are unreliable, as you find out when you marry one!
But not only that, but people also rely on places and things, the little hide-aways, the nice little houses, the little nests. And even those are unreliable. Eventually they will disappear as well. But we also have the little nests inside of our minds, some little place that we rely upon. But even that, anicca, when it gets in there, reveals that even that is insecure. Thats why anicca, when you see it clearly, is quite frightening. It brings up the feeling of complete insecurity.
Theres no place where you can stand. No place where you can sit down. Everything is always changing. And because of the fear which arises when one starts to look at anicca, it means that unless youve got the powerful mind-states of jhanas or post-jhanas, youll never be able to pass through that fear and see through to reality. Therell always be some part of existence youll think is secure, reliable, permanent. And thats why we arent enlightened.
Sometimes we think its not very nice to realise insecurity, but its wonderful to realise the truth of insecurity for two reasons. One, because when you know you havent got a home (in all senses of that word), then you can be like a bird, you can fly everywhere. Every place is a tree where you can rest for a while. Youll never think that you own that particular tree, that thats mine and the other birds should keep out. You can share. Two, it also means that when you realise that all these things are completely changing, then when they do change, when they do disappear, when things alter, youre never surprised. You realise that this is actually the truth of things, that their insecurity is actually a freedom. Security is like being in prison, being bonded to something. So after a while, one gets quite a sense of release with insecurity, a sense of being able to fly and being able to go where one wishes rather than being bound down.
Insubstantiality of everything
And so this is what happens when we look at anicca, it gives us a sense that all this is coming and going, that theres nothing which is stable, no place that we can rest on. But in particular, the anicca which is going to discover the third aspect of the three characteristics of existence, anatta, that is the anicca which is very difficult to apply. Thats anicca which applies to the one who sees anicca. Sometimes to see the one whos seeing is just so difficult - its like trying to catch an eel, its so slithery and slippery. As soon as you catch it its slipped away again. Or its like a dog trying to catch its tail. The self trying to see the self. And this is why seeing anicca in the doer and the seer is just so hard to do. This is, again, one of the reasons why we cant do this because we dont want to do it, we dont like to do it, wed rather not see the insubstantiality of everything. Its just too frightening, its just too challenging, its just cutting too deep. So the only way that can actually happen is if after a good meditation, which is just so peaceful, and were so happy and joyful, that that happiness and joy overcomes any fear and we can go so deep into insight.
In the same way, and youve heard me tell you this before, the only way you can be open to hearing things you dont want to hear, to criticism for example, is when youre in a good mood.
If youre in a really good mood and youre really high, then I can tell you anything which is wrong with you, even personal things, and you dont mind. Thats why I tell people who are in relationships with husbands and wives, if theres something very difficult you have to tell your partner, some criticism which you think they might not really take very well, then take them out to dinner, dress up really nicely, take them out to a really nice dinner, give them the very best food, what they really like, and then, when theyre on the last course, when theyre really nice and happy, all soft and smiley, you can tell them anything and theyll accept it. You can give all sorts of criticism, which is personal or otherwise, and because theyre happy and relaxed, they can listen, they dont feel challenged. But if you tell them when theyve just come home from work after a hard day, then thats it, Im calling the lawyers, this is divorce! This is what happens because when youre feeling happy and when youre feeling relaxed, youre more open to seeing or hearing what you dont want to hear or see.
In the same way, when youve had a good meditation, everythings nice and peaceful, youve got so much happiness, then youre much more open to seeing those insights which you would normally never allow yourself to contemplate. Theres no-one here. Life is suffering. Everything is impermanent. Those are challenging. Take the suffering of life. This goes completely against the grain. Life is beautiful. Life is a bowl of cherries. Life is out there for you to enjoy. Go out and experience. If you cant actually go there, then get a video on it.
Theres so many ways to enjoy yourself in this world - theyve even got virtual reality now. Soon, youll be able to get virtual jhanas! Just put on this little mask, push a button, and all these beautiful nimittas will come up and lead you into virtual jhanas! So you dont have to sit on the floor and waste all these nine or ten days, just do it in half an hour at a virtual reality store. Im sure that someone will try that one of these days. But thats not the way it works. Wed like to have it the easy way, but sometimes it takes a lot of giving up and letting go. But actually to see suffering is to see something that, by its very nature, we dont want to see.
I was talking about perceptions the other day, actually right throughout the retreat. There was a very fascinating experiment done, I think it was at Harvard, to examine the way the mind perceives things, where they flashed images up on the screen. They got a few volunteer students to sit and see what was going on, with a notepad by their side. First of all they flashed these images up so fast that there wasnt really time to understand them - they were just a flash on the screen. And they asked these students to write down what they perceived. And all they could see was, like, a flash of light - thats all. Then they increased the exposure on the screen, from one-hundredth of a second to, say, two-hundredths of a second. They still only saw a flash. And they kept on increasing the time of exposure on the screen incrementally until there was a flash there and they could catch something, they could perceive something, then they could write down what it was. And they kept on increasing it until they could see it more clearly and write down what it was. Some very interesting things happened when they kept on increasing the exposure more and more and more. At a very early exposure length, when they thought they understood what was there, they continued writing the same thing, kept on seeing it in exactly the same way. One example was when the actual photograph was a bicycle on the stairs going up to one of the lecture halls. One of the students perceived it as a ship. Its quite easy to do this because it was only shown very quickly, and perception just grasps something and they said it was a ship.
Old perceptions
The interesting thing was that as the exposure time was increased, incrementally, he still said it was a ship. And at times, when every person who was exposed at that particular length would say its a bicycle on the stairs, they would still see it as a ship. The old perceptions had imprinted themselves on the mind they actually saw that image according to their old views. And it took them a really long exposure on the screen to change their old ideas and say its not really a ship, its a bicycle on the steps going to a lecture hall.
What was interesting there was how, through the perceptions that we have, we form these really strong views, which make us see the whole world to conform to those views, even though theyre completely wrong. Thats why its so difficult to catch the illusions of self, the illusions of suffering, the illusions of anicca. We need to have that strong exposure, not just for a second but for long periods of time, to see that weve been seeing it in the wrong way. Its not a ship after all, its just a bicycle on the steps. Its not a self after all, its just a process. Life is not such a bowl of cherries, life is a bowl of rotten eggs!
And the other interesting thing about this experiment, is that they found that images which were repulsive, which were abhorrent, took people much longer exposures to see them as they really are. One of the images they showed on the screen was of two copulating dogs. And that took the longest of all the images for them to figure out what it really was. The reason was because they didnt want to see that - that was repulsive. If it had been an image of, like, a beautiful model, they would have seen that in a few seconds. But they didnt want to see it and therefore they didnt want to see it. And that was really fascinating because that was reinforcing what the Buddhas been saying for, like, twenty five centuries. That with the hindrances operating, we only see what we want to see. We dont see whats real. And sometimes the exposure need to be so long and right in front of our face before we truly admit whats going on in the world.
But with suffering, this is the problem - we dont want to see suffering, therefore we dont see it. We live in a fantasy world, that life is happy, that you get married and youre happy ever after. You get the perfect relationship. I remember one lady kept on telling me, no matter what I said to her about Buddhism, she said I know hes out there somewhere - the perfect man for me. Its just that I have not met him yet. I dont know where he is, but I know hes out there somewhere. And she was in her late forties and she still said stupid things! People live in fantasy land most of the time - not real at all. Or the people that think that if you get the right medicines then you never need to die, and that aging is something that is healable, curable, something which is not necessary. All these ideas, the fantasies which people have, are just not being real.
So when we start looking at the truth of dukkha, we have to be very courageous to see that. Not just courageous, but we have to be very sneaky as well. And again, this is why we do something like the jhana meditations, because we feel so happy, so peaceful (like the husband or wife whos been taken out by their partner to a beautiful dinner), and the feelings so rested, so at peace, that were actually open to seeing or hearing what we dont want to hear, what we didnt want to see. Thats how you sneak up on dukkha, and you can finally accept it. Theres one particular area of dukkha which we dont want to see - at least we think that were happy. Thats why when you go home from this retreat, doesnt matter how much suffering you have on a retreat, when you go home again you say it was really worthwhile, it was really good. Because youd look like such a fool if you said it was really terrible, full of suffering, that you spent all this money on this. Even on retreats where you have to go through a lot of physical pain, you get conned into saying that it was a lot of pain but that you discovered something wonderful. If you didnt say that youd be really embarrassed that youd been wasting this time.
Its the same as when you go on holiday. Everyone who goes on holiday, when they come back afterwards and their friends ask how was it, they say they had a wonderful time. Even though youre lying through your teeth. Even though you had a terrible time. Because it makes you sound so foolish if you say you had a terrible time going through customs, the hotel was rotten, it rained all the time, that you had arguments with the person you went with youd feel such a fool! And also its just not done, its not our custom. Everyone knows that when you come back from a holiday you say you had a really wonderful time. Everyone knows that you write a postcard to your friends saying having a wonderful time, wish you were here. No-one says having a rotten time, wish I was back home! So sometimes just be careful of the ways that we lie.
Telling jokes
We dont face reality because of our social conditioning. Its the same as if you go to a funeral. Ive been giving funeral services for a long time. Even for me, it took many years to get up the courage to tell a joke at a funeral service. You know that I like telling jokes. Because its not done to tell jokes at funeral services. You can do it at some other time, any other time, but the one time youre not meant to tell a joke is when theres a stiff in the coffin! Its being disrespectful, isnt it But actually when I did get the courage to do it, all the people said Thank you so much. It made us feel good and the person who died was always telling jokes and they would have really appreciated that one. Im sure I could hear the coffin rattling as they were laughing!
But we have these taboos which are incredibly difficult to break. One of those taboos is facing up to that life is suffering. Thats a taboo that people dont want to recognise. And thats why you have to creep up on it and find that all this world is all suffering. You know the taboo of looking at a sunset or beautiful flower and, its really challenging to say that all flowers, even the most beautiful flower, is suffering. People think youre just crazy or youre weird, or youve been a monk too long, and you should come back into the real world! Its a taboo - flowers are beautiful, everyone knows that. The sunset is so wonderful, the mountains, the forests
To challenge that is very difficult to do. So this is where you do need to have that ability to go against preconceived notions which go so deep inside of you, you wouldnt believe just how deeply they are embedded in you. And the most deeply embedded notion is not the idea that life is happiness, but that you are. Thats the deepest notion which is the hardest one to eradicate, the anatta, that I am. And that view is just so tricky, so slippery, its just like trying to shoot a bird a million miles away through the eye with an arrow. Its just so tricky to see this self, this me. And this is why the Buddha gave, not just the jhanas to give the mind power, and to be able to see what it doesnt want to see, but he also gave the four satipatthanas, as a way of not wasting time, to be able to focus on the four areas where the illusion of self really hangs out. Because theres many places where you might try to look for the illusion of self, but the four main areas are the rupa, your body, vedana, the feelings, citta, the mind which knows, and the mental objects, dhamma, especially the doer, will. Those are the four areas. And so, having heard a teaching like the satipatthana, having practiced the Eightfold Path, when the mind is in jhanas and it comes out afterwards see if you can remember to employ the satipatthana, especially for one purpose and one purpose only: not to see anicca, but to see anatta, not-self. That is the deepest, most fundamental block which is stopping you from being enlightened, which stops you being free.
One of the ways which I practice myself, and teach other people to practice, is to ask yourself a question. Not is there a self, thats just too philosophical. But to ask yourself: -What do I take to be myself Who do I think I am Who do I perceive I am What is this me I assume to exist When you ask that question, whatever comes up as an answer, challenge it. Am I this body I look in the mirror each morning and smile there I am again. Is that me, this body Sometimes were very sophisticated intellectually and we think of course Im not my body. On the thought level we might say that, but when we get sick or were dying we realise that thats just superficial wisdom. It hasnt gone deep enough. We are still attached to our body. We still think its ours.
The Buddha gave a test to see if you really are attached to these things, whether you think theyre mine. This is a story of when he was walking with some monks in the Jeta Grove and he pointed out some twigs and leaves on the ground and he said Monks, what would happen, how would you feel if some people came along and collected all these twigs and leaves and put them into a big heap, and then set fire to them all And then once the fire had died down, they took all the ashes and threw them to the four winds until they were completely dispersed. What would your reaction be if they did that And the monks said Nothing, because these things arent ours, they dont belong to us. Theyre just sticks and leaves, thats all. Very good, said the Buddha, Now monks, what would happen if the lay people took all of you and put you in a heap and set you on fire, until youre just ashes, and then threw those ashes to the four winds, would you be upset Would you be really worried And according to the texts, I dont know if they really meant this but they certainly knew the right answer, the monks replied No, no, we wouldnt be at all worried! And the Buddha asked Why is that monks And they said Because this body isnt ours, its nothing to do with us, its not me or mine.

Heavy rain forces another D/L result :
Lankan batting fires on all cylinders to deliver long overdue win
Sri Lankas wobbly batting line up finally got everything right to run up their highest ever ODI total at the R Premadasa Stadium  366 for 6 wickets and beat England by a thumping margin of 219 runs on the D/L rain rule after heavy rains washed out play in the fifth and final match with England poorly placed at 132 for 9 wickets in 26.1 overs.
The par score at 26.1 overs was 351 and England were miles behind that. Their margin of defeat by 219 runs is their heaviest ever in one-day cricket.
England who had taken a 3-0 lead however won the five-match series 3-1 with one match ending in a no-result.
England rested their captain Eoin Morgan, all-rounder Chris Woakes and fast bowler Olly Stone for this match to give the other players who havent had a game the opportunity. But that moved subsequently backfired as Sri Lanka choose this game to turn it around after being at the receiving end for almost the entire series.
Niroshan Dickwella and Sadeera Samarawickrama starred in Sri Lankas highest ODI partnership for any wicket for the calendar year when they put on 137 for the first wicket off 115 balls to provide the perfect launching pad for their teams total after they won the toss and choose to bat first on a belter of a pitch supported by a fast outfield.
Dickwella looked well on course to become the first Lankan batsman to score a century in ODIs for the calendar year when he was dismissed for 95 top edging an easy catch to Joe Root at backward point off Moeen Ali.
Dickwella was well in control of his innings and looked destined to reach a big score before his sad departure after facing 97 balls and hitting 12 fours.
With Samarawickrama who scored an aggressive 54 off 48 balls (8 fours) Dickwella who won the Man of the Match award got his team to a flying start with the pair impressing in running quickly between the wickets and latching onto the loose balls to hit boundaries.
Following the dismissals of the two openers, skipper Dinesh Chandimal who has now been slotted into the no. 3 position and Kusal Mendis produced another century stand that carried Sri Lanka towards their imposing total.
Mendis cast aside his recent disappointments of being dismissed for scores of 0, 0, 0 and 5 to play a breathtaking knock of 56 off 33 balls that comprised a four and six sixes - two of them hit off consecutive balls from Tom Curran to reach his fifty. With Chandimal, Mendis raised 102 off 76 balls for the third wicket. Chandimal continued to hold up one end and went onto score a nicely paced out innings of 80 off 73 balls (6 fours, 2 sixes).
The two big hitters Dasun Shanaka and Thisara Perera didnt stay long enough to affect any major damage but Dhananjaya de Silva and Akila Dananjaya gave the innings a late impetus with a productive 38 runs partnership for the seventh wicket. De Silva rounded off the Lankan innings in style with a six over long-on off the last ball of the innings off Tom Curran who although taking two wickets proved to be the most expensive of the seven bowlers used conceding 71 runs off eight overs. The England fielding put under pressure for the second consecutive match proved ragged as they spilt three catches. Chandimal had two lives at 6 (Tom Curran) and at 8 (Mark Wood) and Akila Dananjaya at 17 (Moeen Ali). In comparison Sri Lanka gave a spectacular display of catching on the field especially the catches held by Kusal Mendis at slip diving to his left to send back Alex Hales, the one by Samarawickrama at point diving forward to dismiss Joe Root and Chandimal at extra cover to dismiss Moeen Ali.
England probably had their worst starts for a long time losing three wickets within the first two overs with the score stagnant on four as Kasun Rajitha and Dushmantha Chameera bowling fast and straight had them in all sorts of trouble. The innings was given a brief respite by Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali who figured in a fifth wicket stand of 79 off 66 balls, but once Akila Dananjaya had Ali held brilliantly by Chandimal for 37 the rest of the innings folded up tamely.
Stokes dismissal for 67 scored off 60 balls (12 fours) with the score at 122 ended whatever hopes England had trying to make a match of it as Dananjaya tore into their batting inflicting serious damage to the middle and lower order batting to finish with figures of 4 for 19.
Only a half full stadium witnessed Sri Lankas turnaround of fortunes, but the win could certainly see a packed house for the one-off T20I at the same venue on Saturday.

The last of  the truly greats
The announcement by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) that Rangana Herath will be retiring from Test cricket at the end of the first cricket Test between Sri Lanka and England at the Galle International Stadium next month brings to an end an era when the country produced international cricketers of such quality that they gave even the best cricketing nations a run for their money.
Herath belongs to an era when Sri Lankas cricket was beginning to bloom as a Test nation after they had won the Cricket World Cup for the only time in their history in 1996. The legendary left-arm spinner made his bow in Test cricket in 1999 against the Australian side led by Steve Waugh playing in the second Test of the historic Galle Stadium. He made an immediate impact capturing the wickets of Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne and Damien Fleming for 97 runs reeling off 34.3 overs and providing an ideal foil to Muthiah Muralitharan who captured 5 for 71 off 38 overs. The Test ended in a draw with rain playing a major role.
But with part time spinners like Sanath Jayasuriya (left-arm), and Aravinda de Silva (off-spin) around Sri Lanka did not require a second spinner in their Test side to support Muralitharan and Herath found himself on the sidelines playing the odd Test whenever he was called upon to do so. This went on for the best part of a decade and it is to Heraths credit that he did not get frustration get the better of him but continued to persist with his career by plying his trade in the domestic sphere.
The big break for him came in July 2009 when he was hastily summoned from England where he was playing for Moddershall CC in the Staffordshire League to replace Muralitharan who was injured and was not available for the first Test against Pakistan at Galle. Herath landed in Galle less than 24 hours before the Test match and spun Sri Lanka to an incredible win taking four wickets for 15 runs in 11.3 overs as Pakistans batting crumbled in dramatic fashion in the second innings from 71-2 to 117 all out chasing a target of 168. Herath was undoubtedly named the Man of the Match and it was no surprise that it was his first such award of his international career. He was to add ten more similar awards to his distinguished career in the next two decades where he went from strength to strength to establish himself as one of the modern day greats and take over the mantle as Sri Lankas match-winning bowler after Muralitharan.
Heraths second match award came two years later at Kingsmead, Durban where he once again spun his country to a historic maiden Test triumph on South African soil with nine wickets in the match.
England should remember how Herath wreaked havoc with their batting at Galle the last time they toured Sri Lanka for a Test series in 2012. Herath took six wickets in each innings for a match bag of 12 to subject England to a 75-run defeat. Amongst Heraths victims were skipper Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Matt Prior, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Samith Patel.
The England side of Joe Root is well prepared and is a better all-round side than they were six years ago. They may have plans of their own to combat the wily left-arm spin of Herath, but as all opposing batsmen have found out for themselves it is not an easy task against a past master who knows his trade like the back of his hand.
No doubt Herath will also be inspired by the fact that the Galle Test will not only be his swansong but he is also one wicket shy of reaching a century of Test wickets at this traditional venue  an achievement only performed by the great Muralitharan who also bid farewell to Test cricket at Galle eight years ago.
Although not a big turner of the ball like his predecessor Herath has his own strengths as a left-arm spinner relying on accuracy, the subtlety to vary his pace and flight, his ability to bowl long spells and a mystery ball thrown in for good measure  one that is quicker and darts back into the right-hander.
So no doubt with such an armoury at his disposal he retires as the greatest left-arm spinner the game has come to know having taken over the mantle in October last year by becoming the first bowler of his kind to cross the 400-wicket mark in Test cricket. Whatever laurels that come his way Herath, who has been a faithful servant of Sri Lanka cricket deserves every bit of it.
Thank you Rangana for the memories.

Cabinet Ministers alleged connections to RAW:
Minister Fonseka dismisses allegation
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said that he did not believe that any Cabinet Minister had connections with Indias Research and Wing (RAW) Agency.
Speaking at a press brief held at the UNP Headquarters yesterday, Minister Fonseka pointed out that, while it would be wrong to divulge the specifics of a Cabinet meeting to media, it is equally wrong to label a Cabinet Minister for having connections with a foreign intelligence agency.
Fonseka made these observations in relation to the concerns raised about an information leakage regarding a recent Cabinet meeting.
This argument came up when this journalist concerned mentioned that she spoke with four ministers in reference to a recent Cabinet meeting. If by any chance all these ministers are connected to the RAW agency, it also implies that this journalist too has a connection with the RAW.
But for me, this whole story is unaaceptable, Minister Fonseka said. You all must know, that the RAW agency is a very advanced, professional and dedicated establishment, even superior to our intelligence units. Recently, Wimal Weerawansa was claiming that an Indian, who is suspected to be a RAW member, was trying to meet him at his house. RAW does not employee unprofessional people as such. Minister Fonseka pointed out.
We are still unclear of the journalists claim as well. Lets say some ministers did speak with this journalist, but that does not mean we can stamp them for having connection with the RAW.
If they leaked information about a Cabinet meeting, it is definitely wrong. But, just because one spoke to the media, nobody can label them as having connections with the RAW, Minister Fonseka further added.
When asked about Minister Mahinda Amaraweeras recent claim that the Cabinet Ministers who leaked information about the Cabinet meeting also have had connections to the RAW, Minister Fonseka said that all arguments brought out by politicians have not always been correct or true.
I am sure my good friend Minister Amaraweera brought this argument depending on what the journalist said about speaking to four ministers. I am sure you know that all arguments that politicians bring forth are not essentially correct or particularly true, Minister Fonseka said.

Rupee depreciation:
No cause for alarm: Minister
Depreciation of the rupee has caused an unnecessary fear among the public. It is not a big problem to the Treasury because it acquires an income almost double the debt payments it incurs from import taxes. The problem is due to the price escalation of goods imported by the people, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing the gathering at the Sahasak Thuru one million tree planting projects at the Ratnapura district programme, recently.
Minister Ranawaka said the countrys current account balance stood at US $ 2 billion when expenditure on imports is deducted from foreign exchange earning.
We spent US $ 1,800 million on import of milk, sugar, apples, grapes and other products, some of which could be grown or produced locally. Apart from this, we spent US $ 500 million on drug imports and nearly US $ 1,000 million on vehicle imports. When you consider the people going abroad, Sri Lankan currency worth nearly US $ 1,600 million is spent abroad. We earn an income of US $ 4,000 million from the tourism industry and as such we could easily overcome this crisis, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said the President launched a programme themed Api Wawamu Rata Nagamu in the past.
If we produced our own goods which could be produced locally, all that money draining out of the country could be saved. We could transform losses into gains and strengthen our economy. This could not be done by installing former rogues back in power. This was a thing which should be built up through a new journey with new hopes and aspirations, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said projects launched by his ministry were always projects beneficial to the country. It did not launch loss-making project such as SriLankan, Mihin Lanka, Hambantota International Conference Hall, day-night markets and Mattala airport.
The government after assuming power had fulfilled most of the pledges concerning the establishment of democracy. It changed the authoritarian, Executive Presidential system. Independent commissions had been established and strengthened, he said.
Although owners of certain media institutions misused media freedom to engage in a wicked media operation, the government did not try to torch media institutions or intimidate journalists.
The Right to Information Act had enabled anyone to question the action of all state institutions and even the President and the Prime Minister, he added.
The government had also fulfilled most of its pledges in the economic front too. Public service salaries were increased by Rs. 10,000. The members of the police and security forces would increase two-fold by 2020. There had been a corresponding increase in pension payments. The government had not resorted to abductions either, he said.

Palaly Airport to accommodate Indian traffic
The government is planning to open the Palaly Airport to accommodate Indian traffic said Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, he said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is very keen to develop the tourism sector and by making Palaly an international airport, it could attract high number Indian tourists.
This proposal was discussed at the last Cabinet meeting, the Minister disclosed.
The Minister said the Palaly Airport which operated as a military airport for a long time had been opened up for civilian transport.
The domestic airport, when developed would drastically increase the number of tourists visiting Jaffna as they would be able to fly to Palaly from the Bandaranaike International Airport.
Minister Amaratunga addressing the World Tourism Day official celebration at the Jaffna University earlier said that the government is strongly considering the possibility of resuming the ferry service between Rameshwaram and Thalaimannar.

Paving the way for posterity
In April 1986, Most Venerable Seiyu Kiriyama Thera came to Sri Lanka. The Founder of the Agon Shu Sector was in Sri Lanka at the invitation of the then President J R Jayewardene. To establish communication between the Sri Lankan President and the Most Venerable Thera, the Japanese Embassy relied on Somasiri Addara Pathirana. The brief stay of seven days with Addara Pathirana impressed the Japanese Thera. His punctuality was a notable feature.
Thus established connection lasted through the years until Addara Pathirana initiated the Sri Lanka Agon Shu Friendship Foundation.
Because of my relationship with the Thera, I made several trips to Japan. He made a proposal for me to initiate a business. I was born to a poor family and came a long way thanks to a scholarship. So I know how it is like to be poor. I suggested to the Thera to initiate a scholarship.
Addara Pathirana who is now the Director General of Sri Lanka Agon Shu Friendship Foundation recalls.
When the Agonshu Foundation was established in 1993, a promise was involved. The funds channelled should be properly put into use. The funds shall be given only if responsibility takes place.
Then Venerable Thera suggested that I should be paid a monthly allowance as I am engaged in this. I said no need. I will strike a balance between my work and this. Then this workload grew up. But I did not accept a salary. Then he appointed me as a consultant of him with a salary. Then I had to go to Japan to attend certain events. But I worked from here. I thought the Thera must have thought it is not nice to get work done free from me. Then he appointed me as the consultant for South Asia. I visit Japan seven eight times a year. But I wont get anything for the Foundation. I do it as a volunteer, Pathirana notes.
In January 1994, Agonshu awarded the first scholarship to 50 children. The scholarship holders were chosen through the grama sevaka. It took sometime for the Foundation to realise the procedure followed is not proper. A certain methodology must be applied. The Foundation set a criterion. The children with financial difficulties who failed the Scholarship Examination would be chosen.
By 2017, the Foundation has offered 14385 scholarships. In 2018, the scholarship count will be 107. The scholarships will be offered up to A-Ls.
We give all the facilities to schoolchildren. Everything a schoolchild requires. It includes a bag, three packs of uniforms, books, stationery, shoes and socks. Everything required at the beginning of the year. The parents do not have to spend a cent for the education. They always say the books are more than enough. They pass it on to the siblings.
Most Venerable Kiriyama Thera maintained that no child should be deprived because of poverty. That was the stepping stone of the foundation. If someone asks for rice, offer them the path to earn a rice packet.
In August, we take measurement. Then the clothes are sewn before handed over with the books. Once chosen for the university, the students would not need us as they have Mahapola. We offer books only to the Medical college recipients as it is an expensive venture, Addara Pathirana concluded.

PCs ineffective, says Wasantha Senanayake
There is an urgent need to revisit the system of devolution and the current systems of provincial councils have proven to be ineffective, State Foreign Affairs Minister Wasantha Senanayake said at a media briefing recently.
We need to bring government closer to the people so that they can contribute to decision-making about their own problems and needs. We need a meaningful system of devolution, for better administrative functioning and for protection of the cultural and religious identity of minority communities as in the panchayat system in India, he said.
Elaborating on the present provincial councils, he said they were white elephants and it was clear from the fact that five no longer function and the term of the sixth ending today, there is no urgency to replace them.
This shows apathy towards them and also that the country can get on well without them, the State Minister said. He suggests that that the current method of election to a provincial council is through districts, but representatives of districts are swallowed up by the larger body, which means small districts have little power.
They function in a context in which the administrative unit for most activities is the district, not the province. There is little effective communication between the different authorities, political and administrative.
He added that reverting to district councils would get rid of the need for provincial headquarters. Unlike in the 1981 district development councils, there would be no outside authority, no government-appointed district minister, and no governor who sits on top of provincial councils.
State Minister Senanayake said under this system, the cost of elections and the money spent on elections will be stopped. Members of the district council would be chosen by the elected members of local authorities. The current situation of these bodies working in isolation and in ignorance of each other would be avoided, with the district and divisional secretaries providing the administrative backbone for services and programmes.
The proposals suggested by Minister Senanayke are currently before the Select Committee in Parliament.

Grama Shakthi:
Poverty alleviation in a new light
Poverty alleviation has occupied a prime slot in the universal agenda over the decades for the mere fact that it is a phenomenon that inhibits the progression of nations across the globe. Hence, emphasising the gravity of the issue, countries have arrived at a consensus to combat poverty by prioritizing No Poverty as the first sustainable development goal (SDG) of the United Nations development agenda.
As a demographically and geographically small nation, Sri Lanka continues to feel the tremors of the poverty earthquake, though the effects could be lesser in extent compared to other countries in Asia and other regions.
In post-independent Sri Lanka, many governments that came into power launched many robust socioeconomic programmes to overcome poverty over the past 60 years. As a result, the poverty index which was 26.1 percent at national level in 1990/91 dropped to 6.7 percent in 2011/12. It is on an overall downward trend of 74 percent though there were subtle variations in the poverty index at 1.9 percent in urban areas and 4.5 percent in rural areas and 8.8 percent in estate areas. Poverty has donned varied forms at divisional, district and provincial level, making it a more complex, yet an urgent issue to be addressed.
Grama Shakthis objectives
President Maithripala Sirisenas ambitious campaign to eradicate all forms of poverty by 2030 came to the fore against this backdrop under the banner Grama Shakthi - Peoples Movement on October 20, 2017. It is a fact that there were positive as well as negative aspects of many post-war poverty alleviation programmes that came into effect. The ultimate aim of Grama Shakthi is to alleviate poverty in the next 12 years (20182030) by reviewing and improving only the positive profile of these programmes and infusing strength to implement rural development plans with proper understanding of market opportunities, with the contribution of women and youth.
Four policies have been identified for the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement. They are identifying the nature of poverty by targetting families and areas, deriving public sector contribution for poverty alleviation, garnering support of the private sector for the cause, and mobilising the support of people and organisations to combat the reasons causing poverty.
Based on the above policies, the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement propagates certain golden rules that the community should follow to maximise the benefits. Breaching of any of these golden rules can inhibit the progress of the villages. These rule highlight the need to contribute to peoples development, uphold self-confidence and practice self-help, emphasise significance of being accountable for own actions, acknowledge that good governance is key to success, believe in gradual progression, the worth of cost effectiveness, the importance of transparency in transactions, uphold the principles of equity and inclusion, highlight the value of swift action and ensure quality and relying on others when required.
It is proposed to launch this village-based peoples movement covering all 14,022 Grama Niladari Divisions at Divisional Secretariat level. A peoples company (Grama Shakthi Unit) is formed with a Board of Directors representing 80 percent of families in selected 700 Grama Niladari Divisions that rose from 10 percent to 45 percent in the poverty index in 2017. Every villager can become a member and under this programme, a fund will be raised by the government to provide Rs. 8,000 per individual, an amount determined based on the size of the membership of each unit. Solutions will be provided through the Grama Shakthi Unit for identified poverty-related reasons within the village.
The President intends to adopt the self-sufficiency approach to meet the countrys food requirement and encourage frugality through this endeavour. The current food import cost is Rs. 400 billion per year. The project would aim at cutting down this cost by producing food within the country. Ensuring food prosperity in the country, saving foreign exchange, reducing the cost of living of the people, and upgrading living status, and strengthening the economy of the poor and the export economy are the expected outcomes of this food production drive.
Many programmes have been launched to uplift small and medium enterprise development by the government in line with the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement. According to the Central Bank Annual Report 2017, a new loan scheme Swashakthi  Towards One Million Jobs launched on February 8, 2017, by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), extending the period of operations of National Agribusiness Development Programme (NADeP) up to December 31, 2017, increasing the loan size from Rs. 150,000 to Rs. 1 million and extending the loan repayment period from 36 months to 48 months of Thurunu Diriya loan scheme has been proposed.
Launching of the Athwela loan scheme by the CBSL to offer credit facilities on concessionary terms and conditions to resume economic activities affected by disasters in August last year was another milestone under this project. This initiative can be viewed as a progressive step to empower the rural masses who are constantly intimidated by individuals and private financial institutions when obtaining loan facilities. These small and medium enterprise development programmes directly contribute towards rural development and aligns with the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movements mandate which is to alleviate rural poverty in gradual progression. Youth will be equipped with the latest information technology knowledge with the help of a leading private telecommunication service provider.
The agriculture sector
The agriculture sector is also at the receiving end of this movement. Considering the close association existing between poverty alleviation and agricultural development as poverty pervades mostly rural communities whose main source of income is agriculture, the initiative has a major thrust on agriculture development. The government has launched programmes to redesign policies, grant tax concessions on machinery and fertiliser, rehabilitate tanks, provide new technology and modernise agricultural research and provide training to encourage increased youth participation in agriculture.
The President has advised cultivation of paddy even in the off-seasons in protective houses using new technology, facilitating farmers with high prices and introducing various crops suitable for different climatic zones. Under the Grama Shakthi programme, cultivation of paddy in 800,000ha in the Maha season in 2017/2018 and cultivation of 500,000ha in the Yala season was planned. Under the programme Atukotu Purawamu, measures have been taken to cultivate 130,000ha of fallow paddy fields out of which 108,000 ha will be reserved for paddy farming and the remaining land is allocated for short-term cultivation with concessions being granted by the Agrarian Development Department.
Agriculture is not confined to rice and does not exist in isolation. According to Dr. Arumugam Kandiah, Independent Consultant to the World Bank, UNDP and Global Environment Facility (GEF) and former Senior Lecturer in Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya, rural development and agricultural development go hand in hand. Though paddy is a vital crop in terms of food security, it is not regarded as a cash crop. Therefore, the time has come to move beyond rice and take up cash crops such as fruits and vegetables which generate a higher income that in turn would raise the income of poor farming households.
Cash crops
Currently, maize is a good cash crop but is merely used as an animal feed. But, there is an excess of 200,000mt of maize per year. Hence, the government has taken steps to woo small and medium scale entrepreneurs towards taking up maize cultivation. Though soy bean is an ingredient used for animal feed in Sri Lanka, production amount per year is 10,000mt. It is only five percent of the local need. The rest is imported.
To limit importation, the government has decided to offer a handsome price and relax tax policies. Most of the green chilli requirement is imported today as the monthly consumption is 5,000mt, while the annual local production remains as low as 10,000mt. The imported green chilli is of inferior quality and far from being fit for human consumption. Hence, the government under Grama Shakthi has drawn up plans to cultivate green chilli in protected houses using sophisticated water supply methods and encourage youth to take up chilli cultivation. Even the private sector has come forward to facilitate onion farmers with proper storage facilities.
A ray of hope is clearly visible as the private banks, local and foreign market, local investors and business sector are ready to join hands with the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement. Foreign direct investment is directed to village-level agricultural products such as green gram, cowpea, black gram, groundnut, sesame and millet under the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement. A group of Swedish and Indian investors has expressed willingness to provide assistance in establishing and promoting a manioc flour plant targetting the Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Moneragala districts and it is expected to cultivate manioc in 6,000 hectares.
Fruit and coconut cultivation
Though fruit production in the country is at a satisfactory level, fruit importation has raised serious concerns. It has revealed that most of the fruits imported at exorbitant prices fall well below the standards and often are not fit for human consumption. In this context, since local production of banana, papaya and pineapple is at a commendable level, off-season fruit production has prospects to become a profitable venture. Therefore, the Agriculture Ministry and Primary Industries Ministry have extended special assistance to boost fruit cultivation in rural areas.
Similarly, another controversial sector that has emerged in recent times is the coconut industry. People are strangled by high market price of coconut, a problem that has arisen partly due to dwindling coconut cultivating lands. As a solution, the Plantation Industries Ministry and the Coconut Development Board have taken steps to expand coconut cultivation, moving beyond the conventional Coconut Triangle to the dry zone. Further, the government has decided to facilitate coconut farmers registered at Agrarian Development Centres by providing concessions.
Aquaculture and fisheries
Even the water-related industries are in-focus in this development drive. The government pays constant attention to the aquaculture and fisheries industry by providing affordable financial facilities for purchase fishing gear, introducing new technologies, implementing policies for the development of infrastructure in the relevant field, breeding five million freshwater shrimp and fish breeds under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department, establishing aquaculture units in selected areas and setting up fish markets.
Dairy production is another major sector that the government is investing in to augment export earnings and increase potential for more employment opportunities. A programme is being implemented to provide a litre of milk daily for every house in the island by encouraging young entrepreneurs to have a farm with a production of 100 litres per day. Using uncultivated lands for animal feed production and developing organic fertiliser as a secondary production are also priorities.
In addition to the above facilitations, the government provided various incentives in the National Budget 2018 to promote the BlueGreen economy programme. The budget incentives further proposed tax concessions for implementing greenhouse technology that enables advanced technology in agriculture practices, de-silting small and medium tanks in a systematic manner for rainwater harvesting, new weather-based insurance cover for farmers, and a cost-sharing scheme for the fisheries sector.
Plans are also afoot to improve research and development in the plantation industry while providing a boost to export crops such as cinnamon and pepper by increasing production and promoting value addition.
Despite all those efforts to rejuvenate the rural masses by increasing their income level, the positive outcomes of the project are yet to be reviewed. Sri Lanka has witnessed the rise and fall of numerous state-driven poverty alleviation initiatives in the past that were of little avail in overcoming even basic livelihood problems of the rural community. There were many reasons for the failure of earlier poverty alleviation programmes. As opposed to the popular belief that the public sector is the sole authority responsible for eradicating poverty, the time is ripe to change that laidback stance and take agency to achieve individual and national development. For that, all stakeholders including the civil community and the private sector need to engage in this task. Most poverty alleviation initiatives were hindered by lack of political patronage, misallocation of resources, misappropriation of funds, lack of land and capital, poor communication between government officers and the community, and improper training given to officers.
These evils are always the pitfalls of any development drive that need to be tamed before they strike.
In the wake of new challenges in this era, poverty remains an unresolved issue despite many efforts being directed to eradicate it. Many scholars express the hope that Grama Shakthi would be a success like other global development initiatives such as the celebrated Comilla Programme of Rural Development and Youth Self-Employment Programme, both in Bangladesh.
In a similar vein, since it adopts a holistic approach in combatting poverty, Grama Shakthi appears to have muscle to become a promising intervention to end poverty in future Sri Lanka provided that previous mistakes are duly addressed and ruled out.

Commission probing SriLankan Airlines:
Rs.500 mn spent from EPF to purchase SriLankan Airlines shares - Witness
It was disclosed at the Presidential Commission investigating into alleged frauds at SriLankan Airlines that Rs.500 million has been spent from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) to purchase SriLankan Airlines shares belonging to Emirates company on the instructions of a Bank of Ceylon official.
Finance and Media Ministry Secretary Dr. Samantha Samaratunga giving evidence before the Commission yesterday upheld that the EPF funds have been utilised for the purchase of SriLankan shares even after the Cabinet decided that the Bank of Ceylon and Sri Lanka Insurance should purchase the SriLankan shares belonging to the Emirates.
The Commission told Samaratunga to report as to how members of the EPF were benefitted by this investment.
Samaratunga added that P.A.Lionel, an Assistant General Manager of the Bank of Ceylon had issued a directive to an EPF Superintendent of the Central Bank on July 10, 2010 to purchase SriLankan shares using EPF funds.
Dr.Samaratunga added that the Investment Committee of the Central Bank had decided to purchase these shares using EPF funds without carrying out a proper study.
He said that no feasibility study or proper accessment has been done in this regard. However, the Investment Committee has decided to release the funds for this purpose and one of the Committee members had signed the relevant document.
He added that the EPF funds do not belong to the government but to the employees in the public and private sector.
A special procedure has to be followed when these funds are utilised for investments, he said.

RUPEE WILL BOUNCE BACK - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera who was optimistic that the rupee would bounce back yesterday said the rupee depreciation was not the catastrophe it was made out to be.
He assured that the rupee which is following the current volatilities of the international market, would stabilize once the markets settle.
The repayment of the loans the Rajapaksas left behind however is a bigger issue than the depreciation. The economy could collapse if we do not repay the loans this year and the next. So our efforts are concentrated on this, the Minister said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry, Minister Samaraweera said that he had written to the Head of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on Monetary Affairs and Development (G24) yesterday, proposing that all countries facing a similar issue with their currencies meet at a summit to discuss the future course of action.
We want to form a coalition of the willing. This is something that is not going to go away in a month or two. Volatility in the international scene will be around for awhile, and we have to look at ways to face them, the Minister said.
International events such as the trade war between China and the US in addition to sanctions on Iran have exacerbated the issues, he observed, We have no control of these issues.
The rupee yesterday depreciated to Rs 174.12 against the US dollar but the Finance Minister pointed out that during the previous regime, the rupee depreciated 14 percent during an even shorter time period. The government at the time had unsuccessfully pumped in USD 4.1 billion to stabilize it, Given the need to protect our foreign reserves, I am not prepared to spend our reserves unnecessarily, said Minister Samaraweera.
The Government has also imposed import restrictions on non-essential items to curb imports, the Finance Minister stressed, adding that these measures were temporary, We are not going back to an era of import controls. They will not be there longer than necessary. I would also like to add that the liberalisation programme of the government would go ahead, the Minister said.
We have done the best we can do at the moment, he added.

Vap Full  Moon Day
Sacred Vinaya Pitaka in Mahavagga Pali
Reveals the observing of Vas in times early
Believed to be the highest act leading to liberation
With the dawn of Katina and its culmination
Every Buddhist monk blessed with higher ordination
Are entitled to observe Vas for their emancipation
During 3 months commencing from Esala month
They engage in this religious fiesta with utmost faith
At the end monks receive Katina Cheevara from the laity
Who wishes this to be in their life a reality
Out of Atamaha Kusal this is in deed
Said to be the highest merit bestowing deed
While at the same time this is said to suppress
The ill effects of bad kamma of those in distress
This is the most noble wholesome act of Katina robe
Creating a religious awakening in the entire globe
Bringing about a total disciplined way of life
Compelling them to utilise the day sans strife
Bhikkus are also blessed with higher levels of Dhamma
Through strict meditation and study sublime Dhamma
They in turn showed the laity with Dhamma
As the gift of Dhamma excels all other gifts of Sam Buddha Samma
The busy vassana brings devotees all together
With great enthusiasm they never fail to gather
They provide the Sangha with the four essentials
In gratitude for their service in Dhamma and its rituals
VapPoya is of great significance for yet another reason
As the day that Buddha in Thavathimsa heaven
Preached Abidhamma to his mother MathreeDivya Raja
On his way to spend seventh vassana with a special puja
The other sacred event is regarding BosatMaitree
Where history reveals that he started his religious spree
With a retinue of 500 on this Vap full moon day
For the most glorious historical event, paving the way
Then TheriniSanghamitta arrived in Dhammadweepa
Turning a new chapter in the history of Buddha Sasana
It was on Vappoya day, King sent envoys to Pataliputta
Under the leadership of Minister MahaAritta
Lanka was blessed with two most sacred things in Buddhist culture
Which led to a complete transformation in historic future
One was that Therini inaugurated Bhikkuni order
The other, she brought the most sacred Sri Mahabodi along with her
This stunningly serene Bodhi with charm and grandeur
Is a landmark visited by millions every year
