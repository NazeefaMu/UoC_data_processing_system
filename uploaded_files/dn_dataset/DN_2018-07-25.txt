One thing you should always do to rice before cooking it
Rice is a key ingredient in most of our diets. Its cheap, its not too unhealthy and it has a long old shelf life so you can always have an emergency pack in the cupboard. But despite most of cooking it pretty regularly, many will admit to still managing to get it wrong far more often than we should.
A top chef has revealed a secret trick which could put the days of burnt saucepans and mushy meals behind us. Australias Monty Koludrovic shared his expertise on 9Honeys podcast What the F is For Dinner.
He says the key to the perfect flurry rice is washing the grains before you cook them. But were afraid a quick old rinse wont do, and if you want to do it properly youll need to wash it about 30 times. Yep, 30 times!
Monty says, When you wash it well its just amazing They say to wash it 30 times. If you picture the starch being microscopic grains of stickiness... as they absorb water, they dont have the ability to stand up to pressure so their structure is pasty. Whereas the starch in the rice helps it stand up and be fluffy. Now all we need to do is work out how to get the portions right...

Prime Group crowned As Best Developer of Sri Lanka
The Prime Group is been awarded the title of Best Developer of the year 2018 at the PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards (Sri Lanka) 2018.
The PropertyGuru Asia Property Awardsis the biggest and most respected real estate awards programme in Asia and was held for the first time in Sri Lanka this year at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo.
Having secured the Best Developer title for 2018, the Prime Group will also represent Sri Lanka in November this year in Thailand for the Asia Property Awards.
The award is a true testament to the Groups unmatched status as a property developer in Sri Lanka. The awarding body undertakes a stringent selection process where each potential winner is evaluated based on a range of criteria that includes reputation, image and CSR activities, quality of projects (value for money), track record, sales success, innovation in construction, marketing and functionality, major accolades and achievements of the past, brand, peer recognition, certifications, growth and efficiency.
Over the last five years the Prime Group has initiated a number of revolutionary projects within the industry and has undertaken a total of 43 projects ranging from mid-sized housing developments, gated communities to luxury high-end condominium and residential developments.
So far we have completed and delivered 19 projects, with another 11 awaiting completion over the next six months, said Chairman, Brahmanage Premalal, speaking on the meteoric rise of the Group.
The Group was also awarded the title of Great place to Work for the fourth consecutive year among 25 best organizations to work for in Sri Lanka, by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The award is a direct reflection of employee satisfaction within the Group. The Prime Group enjoys exceptionally low employee turnover and zealously invests in the happiness of their employees through a host of internal programs that includes career and skills development, personal growth programs as well as programs designed to uplift individual employees.
As the market leader in real estate and land development, the Prime Group places much importance on the impact they create on their clientele, but more importantly on the perceptions they build in the minds of their employees. We have always been an organization that has endeavoured to create a work environment which allows our people to work together seamlessly while performing to the best of their abilities, towards the success of the organization, says a representative of the company.
As the only property developer to have secured this, much sought-after title, the organization does not hesitate to credit their multiple recognitions - as a great place to work and the best developer of 2018 to their most valued employees; as the Group thrives on the belief that great people create great places of work.

SAITM students parents to complain against unqualified students
State Medical Students Parents Union will make a complaint to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in connection with all state officials who are responsible for recruiting 54 unqualified students to SAITM, media spokesman of the union, Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said that it is not good governance to file a case against state medical students and their supporters who fought to protect free education while allowing state officials who recruited unqualified students to SAITM to go free.
The polices brutal attack launched on state medical students who protested against SAITM is unacceptable as is their warm welcome of SAITM students who went to meet politicians and officials.
The police ill treated qualified students while offering a warm welcome to unqualified students.
The unions national organiser Ashoka Ranwala said that the union has unofficial information about the educational qualifications and other details of SAITM students. The University Grants Commission does not give details of SAITM students because they have to hide those details in order to protect the identities of unqualified students. But legal action will be taken against all state officials who failed to provide information requested by the union.
The Unions Secretary Prem Kulathilaka said that the government cannot repair the air conditioning of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital cardiology theatre but pays Rs.300 million monthly to the SAITM hospital.
Medical Faculty Students Action Committee Convener Didula Amarasinghe said that the KDU Act needs to be re-amended to absorb SAITM students who had passed three or less subjects in the GCE Advanced Level examination in two or three sittings. According to the law of Sri Lanka, only the students who pass all three subjects in one sitting are eligible to enter the university.

As a child, nothing could ever beat a colouring session with your favourite pencils right Well one crazy new form of nail art has got us taking a trip down memory lane...
The experimental beauty Instagram account Nail Sunny has really outdone themselves with this new colouring pencil nail art.
Yes you read that correctly... you can now get a manicure which looks weirdly like your old trusty colouring tools.
Complete with actual coloured lead, this can only mean one thing: its time to rummage around for those old colouring books.
While were still hoping the Russian nail pro uploads a tutorial video, we can only imagine the intricacies of this design.
Were talking epic nail extensions, serious glue skills, and somehow sticking actual lead into the works.
With their perfectly painted and weirdly realistic look, the pencil nails even have the appearance of ridges to mimic wooden design. No wonder the account has over 1.7 million followers.
Although we cant help but admire the incredible design, we can only imagine just how impractical this manicure would be for everyday life... cup of tea accidentally dipped in lead, anyone

Sri Lanka, China, India jointly invest  US$ 700 mn to develop Lankan ports
Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), China and India are jointly investing over US$ 700 million to develop three key ports in Sri Lanka in the next three years.
Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe said that China would invest between US$ 400 to 600 million to commence the third phase of the Hambantota Development project. The project will commence at the end of the year and would be completed in three years.
Speaking at the first SLPA, JCT, SAGT and CICT jointly organized Port of Colombo Awards Night in Colombo on Monday he said besides, the Indian government has pledged US$ 40 million to upgrade the Kankesanthurai Port. This development project is now in the process and would be completed early next year. He said that the Treasury has received the total lease payment of US$ 974 million for Hambantota port project from the Chinese counterparts and China has already invested US$ 146 million for the development work in the Hambantota Port. The Minister said that a lot of planning and talking had been going on to develop the East Container Terminal (ECT) and finally the SLPA has decided to invest US$ 100 million to construct it. The SLPA has a record Rs. 13.3 billion profit last year and we will invest this money for the development of ECT as delaying this project would cost more money to SLPA. We will also redevelop the West Container Terminal in Colombo and a feasibility study will begin soon.
According to internationally recognized global ranking indices, the Port of Colombo is positioned as the worlds 23rd best container port and the 13th best connectivity port in the world at present and we want to further improve on this.
He also said that after taking over the Shipping Ministry there is harmony in the Port of Colombo and there is no industrial action (strikes) as he constantly has a dialogue with the trade unions. We will also add more infrastructure facilities to the Colombo Port to offer better facilities to cruise liners and work with the travel sector to promote Sri Lankas cruise liner business.
Plans are also underway to convert Galle Harbour as a tourism port and EOI for this would be called soon. The Minister also disclosed that they are waiting for the master plan of the Trincomalee development plan to commence work on the Trincomalee harbour where the SLPA owns over 500 hectares of land which is to be given for development as a PPP project.
The Minister said that they are also working with the Asian Development Bank to formulate a long term maritime master plan for Sri Lanka and this would be presented to Cabinet this year.

The fourth forum of this series is titled Grips Theatre. This documentary film and the discussion will take place on July 31. The Curator will be M Safeer.
In 1966 the Children's Theater in the Reichskabarett in Berlin was built. The Reich Cabinet was at that time a well-known and successful left-wing cabaret group.
The co-founder and one of the authors of the Reich Cabaret Group were Volker Ludwig. In the summer of 1966, they began performing on the weekends theatre for children. Gradually, more children's pieces were developed, and more and more performances for children took place.
The idea was not just to bring fairy tales to the stage, which was the standard theatre for children at that time.
On the contrary, imaginative pieces written especially for children should be performed, which have a direct relation to the respective current world of children in the stage happenings.

Three Sri Lankans sentenced to 8 months jail for forged Malaysian visas
SINGAPORE - Three Sri Lankan men were convicted and sentenced last Friday (July 20) to eight months jail for possessing forged Malaysian visas in their passports, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in a statement on Monday.
They were arrested by ICA officers on June 27 after anomalies were detected in their visas during checks at Woodlands Checkpoint.
Nalliah Selvamany Rohan, 26, Kanthanadan Jasitharan, 23, and Roopan Diasrepinsan, 20, were looking for employment outside of Sri Lanka.
The first two approached a Sri Lankan agent, Rajanikanth, to make arrangements for a trip to Malaysia for 305,000 Sri Lankan rupees (S$2,600) each. The third approached another agent to make the same trip for 500,000 Sri Lankan rupees.
Rohan and Jasitharan arrived in Singapore on June 18, and the forged Malaysian visas were attached to their passports. Roopan arrived on June 26 and did the same.
On June 27, Rajanikanth arranged for a Malaysian taxi to take the three men to Malaysia at about 8pm. ICA officers nabbed the trio at about 9.20pm.
Rajanikanth had left Singapore before investigations started, and the Malaysian taxi driver was found to be uninvolved in the scam.
Under the Passports Act Section 47(6), a person convicted of knowingly possessing false foreign travel documents may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.

Wonder Woman has a home in Bethel
Moulton Pete Marston grew up with Wonder Woman. A super heroine created by his father in the early 1940s, she first appeared in a comic book when Marston was entering his teens. She made such an impression on him that he began collecting Wonder Woman items. Hes been collecting ever since.
Fourteen years ago, when he was 70, he decided to gather all that he had accumulated and house his collection, a gift to his three children, in his Bethel home.
Marston has what he calls his museum, a wonderland of Wonder Woman memorabilia, in a special, secure area there. Comic books, however, are in a bank vault.
With many of the items purchased online, and gifts from fans around the world, the collection ranges from toys to shirts and hats, to household items. There are games, maps, sunglasses and just about everything else that falls into the you-name-it, hes-got-it category.
Of course, theres a full-size mannequin of Wonder Woman and her mother, Hippolyta, too. And theres a section devoted to actress Lynda Carter, who played Wonder Woman on television. She is, to several generations of people in the U.S. and abroad, Wonder Woman come to life.
Carter visited Marston not long ago. She had a ball, he said. I hear from her frequently. Shes a terrific lady. Shes a beautiful 62-year-old who looks like a 40-something. Shes a marvelous girl.
Where, Marston was asked, did Wonder Woman, a 6-foot, dark-haired, beautiful Amazon princess, originate and what is the allure she has for so many people
His father, William Moulton Marston, - a lawyer, writer, psychologist and inventor - was asked to create a hero when he worked as an educational consultant for DC Comics on the eve of World War II, he said. However, Marstons mother, Elizabeth - a psychologist and lawyer - objected to yet another comic book hero. She wanted a female heroine.
Marstons father, with his wifes input, came up with the idea of Wonder Woman. Cartoonist Harry G. Peter was given the task of drawing her.
Wonder Woman represented a new type of woman, a woman who controls her force with love, said Marston.
She made the world aware of how much women were capable of. ... She was also a transition from the housewifery of the time to the possibilities of accomplishment in the outside world.
Once Wonder Woman entered the world, Marstons father used her to teach Marston and his three siblings lessons in behavior. He did that during what was dubbed The Sunday Club in their Rye, N.Y., home.
He directed our thinking with stories about what she did and why, Marston said. While she was a powerful lady, she didnt hurt people. We learned that you can convince people about what youre thinking, but you dont have to be a bully to do it.
Were the Marston kids interested in those life lessons taught using Wonder Woman
Yes, said Marston.
My sister was especially interested because Wonder Woman was a female action figure whose tools included her ethical and moral standards, physical strength, Lasso of Truth, invisible airplane and bulletproof bracelets.
We were also shown the original art and saw what was happening every step of the way, recalled Marston, owner of Marston Real Estate. I was fascinated by it. She was a unique figure that took off.
Over seven decades after she made her debut, Wonder Woman is still an iconic figure in the world.
She is highly recognized, said Marston, especially in South America and the Orient. Shes like a female Superman and girls still want to be recognized as strong. Theyre her biggest fans.
Marstons daughter, Christine Holland, who oversees, collates and catalogs the collection as well as a Wonder Woman website, had a slightly different take on Wonder Womans continued popularity.
Shes an inspiration to the world, Holland said. Shes taken on a life of her own ... Shes become a totally real person because shes impacted real people. She has evolved from a comic book heroine to a real person.

Aqua culture battle to uplift fisheries sector
The aqua culture battle was launched by the Fisheries Ministry with the government's Gam Peraliya and Grama Shakthi livelihood development programmes to promote a rural economic revolution through the fishing industry, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economy State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
Under this programme, inland fisheries are being promoted to launch fishery-based industries to earn foreign exchange through value addition. The State Minister was addressing the gathering at Diyawara Aruna attitudinal development programme at the Pelawatte Aqua Culture Development Authority auditorium in Battaramulla, organised by the Jathika Dheewara Maha Sammelanaya on July 23.
He said this was aimed at transforming fishermen into entrepreneurs. Under the programme, new technology would be introduced to the fishing industry to enable local fishermen to compete with their counterparts abroad.
State Minister Wedaarachchi said since Minister Vijith Vijayamuni de Zoysa had now given him a free hand to implement his plans for the development of fisheries, he was able to initiate many new programmes to improve the livelihoods of local fishermen.
Steps would be taken to further develop the inland fishing industry by setting up tank based fishermen's unions. He had also directed the Aqua Culture Development Authority to formulate a five-year programme to develop the inland fishing industry.
Already, 12 new varieties of fish had been introduced. Prawn and crab culture development programmes are promoted with a pilot project in the Hambantota district. Under this programme, the crab production industry was launched on 42 acres in Rekawa. It is also hoped to increase this industry to another 200 areas.

DOCTORS NOT QUALIFIED TO SPEAK ON FTAs, GMOA BATTING FOR RAJAPAKSA
The GMOAs resistance to the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement is no different to its previous canard that RAW spies would come to Sri Lanka with the 1990 Suwaseriya ambulance service, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said.
The Deputy Minister addressing a press conference at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday said the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has no subject knowledge to speak on the FTA with Singapore.
He accused the GMOA of undertaking a contract of pro-Mahinda Rajapaksa group towards toppling the Government by deliberately spreading falsehood and involving in a fear mongering campaign.
The GMOA announced an island wide strike on August 3 in protest of the FTA with Singapore.
The doctors did not strike when substandard drugs were imported to the country or when the hospitals lacked essential facilities such as beds. They did not strike when the Senaka Bibile Drug Policy was delayed for decades, but they strike over the FTA with Singapore which is completely irrelevant to them, he said. Mannapperuma stressed that the doctors should not interfere into the decisions that should be taken by the economic specialists. What they are speaking is outside their orbit.The MBBS degree does not confer knowledge that economic experts have, he added.
The Deputy Minister called on the GMOA to concentrate on the issues related to their profession without undertaking political contracts to appease former President Rajapaksa.
The GMOA previously objected to the 1990 Suwaseriya ambulance service and led a misinformation campaign against it.
Today Suwaseriya service is highly admired by all the people. It is highly problematic as to why the so called educated individuals lead misinformation campaigns in this manner. It is not that they dont know the truth. They do it knowingly to fulfill the political aspirations of another group. Not all the doctors approve the GMOA stance. It is a mafia, he said.
Mannapperuma said the Governments aim with the FTA is to bring in more foreign exchange into the country, adding that duties have been waived for 80 percent of the goods coming from Singapore as per the FTA. The FTA with Singapore will mark a turning point in the countrys economy. We have the space to amend the agreement in another years time and rectify any identified shortcomings, he noted.
The Deputy Minister, commenting on the sluggish pace of legal action against the perpetrators of corruption, said only five persons have been convicted for the offense of corruption for the last 25 years in Sri Lanka.
Our law is lenient as such. We need to make our law strong that not only the little fish but also the big fish can be nabbed effectively, he commented.

Lankans illegally staying in Israel get grace period to return home
Sri Lanka has provided its citizens who are working in Israel illegally, a grace period untill September to return to the country, while legal action would be take against those who do not return during that period, Manusha Nanayakkara, Deputy Minister of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment said.
Nanayakkara made this statement while addressing family members of Sri Lanka who are working in Israel illegally, yesterday. We have a lot of opportunities to work in Israeli farms, but now we dont get that opportunity. This is because around 150 out of 500, have not returned. We have spoken to the Israeli Government and they have agreed to take back people who have returned after the expiry of their work visa, he said.
The Deputy Minister said that some Sri Lankans, who were living in Israel illegally, had lodged bogus human rights complaints with the Israeli authorities.
They said that they have been assaulted in Sri Lanka and that they were unable to return to the country because they fear for their lives. They are trying to allege that there is no human security in Sri Lanka, which is tarnishing our image internationally. This is what happened to us during the war where a lot of people who never had any threats lied to get asylum in Western countries. Iam sure they benefited personally, but millions of people living here suffer due to the consequences of such allegations,  he said.Nanayakkara also urged the family members of Sri Lankans who are working in Israel illegally, to bring their loved ones back. He warned that they had taken steps to issue warrants on those who have violated Immigration laws.

Akila warns of conspiracy to cripple school education system
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday warned of a conspiracy by certain trade unions which are trying to cripple the school education system by making unfair demands.
Minister Kariyawasam while requesting the trade unions in the education sector not to use school children as a cats paw to achieve their narrow political objectives, stressed that an investigation would be initiated against those who are attempting to cripple the school education sector.
The Minister was speaking at a press conference at the Ministry premises yesterday. He condemned the Trade Unions attempt to go for a strike on July 26, obstructing the school examinations.
Kariyawasam added that the Ministry has received a number of complaints against educational authorities who have intimidated principals,teachers and students with the backing of certain trade unions.
The Minister added that the trade unions in the education sector have degenerated to such levels that they have resorted to threaten the teachers and principals who are prepared to report for duty on July 26 .
The Ministry is making arrangements to provide delayed promotions, increments to officials in the education sector who were penalised due to political and other reasons during the previous regime, Minister Kariyawasam added.
He added that this process is implemented in a transparent manner and no such officers have been granted posts.
Only those who were proved to have been political victimised during the last regime have been granted grade promotions and the relevant salary increments.
The Education Minister added that trade unions can go before courts, if Ministry has granted grades or promotions to unqualified officials.

BSL hosts learning event  for Plantations Sector
Biodiversity Sri Lankas (BSL) Plantations Standing Committee, held a leaning event held recently, at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, on Biochar - A Sustainable Option for Soil Remediation and Pollutant Removal.
The event was organized by BSL in partnership with Dilmah Conservation and attracted participants from the Plantations Sector, of which 50% was fromBSL member companies.
The enthusiastic participation of two banks was also positively noted. The event included a technical presentation on Biochar as a sustainable alternative to the traditional chemical applications used for purposes of soil fertility improvement in plantations, as well as two case study presentations on lessons learnt from the practical application of Biochar on plantations. The presentations were followed by lively discussions on challenges and how to address them.
Dr. Keerthi Mohotti Deputy Director Research at the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, presented findings of extended research studies carried out on the effectiveness of Biochar.
The benefits of Biochar application include the improvement of water and nutrient retention in soil, increase of the soil carbon pool,capture and storage of carbon and improvement of soil microbial activity. He also drew comparisons on the changes that occur in the chemical properties of soil with the application of Biochar made out of Gliricidia sp., Coconut Shells and Paddy Husk.
He favoured the idea of locally producing Biochar as opposed to importing it from abroad for a higher cost, noting that the raw material required for the manufacture of Biochar was readily available for utilization in Sri Lanka. Further, he highlighted the need for establishing standards for locally produced Biochar as perthe International Biochar Initiatives Standardized Product Definition and Product Testing Guidelines for Biochar that is Used in Soil (IBI Biochar Standards).
Dr. J. Krishnaratna Founding Director of the Biochar Initiative Company (Pvt.) Ltd. - who carries a wealth of experience on the subject, enlightened the audience with his eye-opening field results, as he made the final public presentation of his career at this event.
His findings ensured that there is an average increase in crop production by more than 14% in tea estates at different elevations, with the application of Biochar. Further, he elaborated that tea bushes under Biochar treatment continue to absorb and retain water, producing more tea leaves without water stress in dry periods. He requested Sri Lankan Plantation Companies to collaborate to form a common platform to facilitate the collective application of Biochar in a commercial scale. He reiterated that this collective approach will negate the concerns regarding high cost.
Janaka Gunawardhana Manager Corporate Solutions of Kahawatte Plantations (KWPL), presented field level results obtained by the company post application of Biochar.

Burning birds among starving brutes
Sanjeewa Pushpakumara has directed several short films and two feature films. Flying fish (Igilena Maluwo) and Burning Birds (Davena Vihagun) show his talent in feature film-making, and his films have brought him many acclaims at international film festivals.
Davena Vihagun is simple. Its cinematography has no difficult techniques and the story is told in a linear flow. Like a folk story, it starts from the very beginning and flows towards the end without intermediating flashbacks and other difficult-to-understand cinematic strategies.
The story begins against the background of Sri Lankas most terrorized JVP riot era and its immediate aftermath. Kusum (Anoma Jinadari), a mother of eight children, lives in a remote area of Sri Lanka with her husband - a fish seller (Sanjeewa Dissanayake). Their poor family was shattered when the husband was taken into custody and brutally killed, in suspicion that he was an ex-JVP member, by a few members of the security forces who came in a white van.
Abattoir Vs brothel
Isolated along with eight children, many of them are girls, Kusum, braces the burden of looking after her children and mother-in-law (Leonie Kotalawala). Not finding suitable employment, she worked at a quarry and then at an abattoir before joining a brothel. She was exploited, humiliated, raped and jailed as the story flows to its end. Finally, not finding any solace in society, she killed the principal who helped army personnel kill her husband by bowing his (principals) head towards the fish seller thus marking her husband as a JVPer. Thereafter, she set fire to her house and merged with its flames as the film concludes with an iambic cord.
Burning Birds terrorizes us with brutalities of the JVP riot era and of its aftermath. The film tells us societal inhumanity and commercializing of womanhood. Set on a barren land in a shanty shelter, the film rarely pushes our attention towards other aspects which are essential to flow the films realism uninterrupted. As shadows reflected by the kerosene lamp draw lethargic images on walls, the film ties us to the lives of the occupants of the house. Only after stepping out to the road, we get a chance to have a retrospection of what we have viewed that far in the theatre.
First of all, the film lacks the credibility - the credibility of most of its characters and scenes. When the film begins, Kusum has eight children of varied ages. The eldest, Vasana (Samanalee Fonseka), is around 17 years of age. If Kusuma had married at age 20, she would have been at least at around age 40 when she delivered all these children and mothered each at least two years. She has done the toughest jobs that a woman rarely does. Can a woman maintain a body desirable for the trade after the immeasurable chores she had gone through before her final job - prostitution
Linear flow
The slaughterhouse owner, (Mahendra Perera), gang-raped Kusum after abducting her assisted by his henchmen. The owner is portrayed as a kind man, but all of a sudden, he turned to a brute and committed a heinous crime. Only by absorbing to the linear flow of the story, you will be able to believe such a character shifting. The similar episodes are many in the film. The elder daughter, Vasanas arrival in the city and finding a job at a garment factory, which her mother was unable to do and her being in the village all alone with seven kids where her mother is a victim also question the credibility of its characters.
Moreover, the shelter of the family lies at an extremely lonely place. Except for some Palmyra trees, the house views only a few greeneries. Kusum lives along with her eight children, mother in law, and Sumana (Chandani Seneviratne) at this house. We are hardly shown any neighbours. This also gives doubt in mind of the audience of the credibility of the film and of many of its scenes.
The principal who betrayed Kusumas husband is another enigma. Why did he do that Has he had any grudge against the fish seller How could Kusuma, all of a sudden, entered principals house and hacked him to death All these pose us questions and we have to shun them and view the film in silence.
The music of the film (R. Abaji & Philip David Sheppard) is praiseworthy. It elaborates the theme of the story and rouses our imagination. Silence plays the major part of the music but it has been used expertly to highlight main episodes of the film effectively. The isolated house and its lonely occupants help the director sharpen his theme and focus on it very well.
Brave attempt
Anoma Jinadari, Samanalee Fonseka, Mahendra Perera, Pubudu Chathuranga (brothel owner), and Shyam Fernando (paramilitary leader) do justice to their roles. The cinematography is laudable. The film is a join production (Neon Production (France) and Sapushpa Expressions (Sri Lanka), and they must be praised for their brave attempt.
The film has represented Sri Lanka for many international film festivals. It won the Best Film Award at the 15th International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights in Geneva and clinched the Youth July Award at the 15th International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights in Geneva. Anoma Jinadari emerged as the Best Actress at the 3rd Asian World Film Festival in Los Angeles for her character of the film and the film was nominated for the best film award at many more international film festivals.
Sanjeewa Pushpakumara has grasped filmmaking at many acclaimed international universities. His attempts so far brought in many credits to Sri Lanka. Burning Birds provides ample evidence for his creativity and honesty towards his themes. Film lovers can expect a range of good films from him in the future.
More we need people talented like him.

Chronicle of a chariot
It is interesting to note that ancient Sri Lanka is deeply linked with Hinduism. It is called by numerous names connected to Hindu religious faith. Sivaboomi, Iswaraboomi and Kuberaboomi are some of the ancient names connected to the ancient Sri Lankan land. Sri Lankas capital Colombo is a metropolitan city. Colombo is blessed with an important seaport. The Colombo seaport occupies a crucial place in the world. This seaport attracted numerous alien citizens to Sri Lanka.
This seaport served as one of the seaports of Sri Lanka for the Tamil population to migrate from South India to this country. The Nattukottai Chettiar community also migrated to Sri Lanka through the seaport. They introduced the Adi Vel festival to the capital Colombo.
Kataragama festival
This is one of the foremost Hindu festivals, widely celebrated in Colombo. It is known as Adi Vel Vazha (Villa) in Tamil and it is called Vel festival in English. It has a long history dating back to 1874. It is interesting to note that the famed Kataragama festival falls in the Tamil month of Adi (July). For the Kataragama festival in Sri Lanka pilgrims from all over the country flock to the holy shrine at Kataragama which is located in the down south of Sri Lanka.
Earlier due to the lack of transport facilities devotees used to reach the temple on foot (Paatha Yathra). The pilgrims from Northern Province, Eastern Province and from different other parts of the country started their Paatha Yathra to Kataragama nearly two months or two and a half months before the commencement of the festival.
From Colombo area, Nattukottai Chettiar community, Vellalar community and other communities together used to go to Kataragama festival. Lord Murugan is often known as Kathirvelauthan or Kathiresan. The Buddhists call Lord Murugan by the Kataragama Deviyo. Kataragama festival symbolizes Lord Murugans triumph over evil and his marriage with the Goddess Valli (Vedda /Vedduva kings daughter).
Devotees from different walks and faiths of Sri Lanka flock to Kataragama to pay their deep devotion to Lord Murugan. EspeciallyHindus and Buddhists pay their obeisance to the presiding deity of the Lord Kataragama. For the Kataragama festival, the people go to the Kataragama temple on Paatha Yathra, from all over the country. In 1874unfortunately a cholera epidemic broke out in the country. Due to it, the Government prohibited the pilgrims to take part in the Kataragama festival. They were prevented from proceeding along Galle Road near the location of the present three temples ofBambalapitiya. Due to this, the pilgrims kept their Kaavadis at the Maddams (present temples of Bambalapitiya) and stayed at the Maddams with broken hearts and frustration. It is stated that Lord Murugan appeared in a dream and conveyed to the devotees, that in future, during the Kataragama festival period the same festival could be conducted in Colombo for their convenience. They were requested not to worry about the unavoidable circumstances. Eventually, two Kathiresan temples and the Samman gods Sri Manika Vinayagar temple were built at Bambalapitiya. Later these two Kathiresan temples were called by the name Upaya Kataragama temples. At the time the administration of all the six temples involved in the Colombo Vel festival was vested in the hands of the Chettiar community. The devotees with the cooperation of the Chettiar community arranged the Vel festival in Colombo. Hence the Vel festival takes place in Colombo concurrently during the period of Kataragama annual festival time. In simple words, Vel means spear. Lord Murugan holds the Vel (Spear) in his right hand. Today the name of the festival is known as Vel festival. In some of the Murugan temples in the world at the Sanctum, instead of the idol of Lord Murugan, the Vel is installed for worship.
Popular term
The annual chariot festival (car festival) of two Old Kathiresan temples of Colombo or the chariot festival of two New Kathiresan temples of Colombo, or the chariot festival of Samman gods Sri Kathirvelautha Swamy temple of Colombo held in collaboration with Sammangodu Sri Manika Vinayagar temple of Colombo is widely known by its popular term Vel festival. The Kataragama festival starts during the Tamil month of Adi (July). The Kataragama festival lasts for 14 days. The Vel festival of Colombo lasts for three to four days. In the Vel chariot procession the idols of Lord Murugan, along with his two consorts Goddess Devayani Amman and Goddess Valli Amman are taken out. On the full moon day of the Tamil month, Adi the Kataragama water cutting ceremony takes place.
In the Colombo Vel festival, the idols of Murugan and his two consorts (Devies) are taken out in the procession. The exact year of the origin of Vel festival is not known. Originally the first Vel festival started at the Old Kathiresan temple Chettiar Street (Sea Street). The New and Old Kathiresan temples were built in different years and administered by two different administrative committees. Yet both of them were managed in a coordinating manner with regard to the Vel chariot festival. Both these temples have two different Vel chariots.
Different temples
In the Vel festival, three different categories of Vel chariots are involved. These three Vel chariots are connected with six different temples in Colombo. The Kaavadi Chariot originates from Sammangodu Sri Kathirvelautha Swamy temple, First Cross Street (Pettah), Colombo.11, and reaches the Sammangodu Sri Manika Vinayagar temple, Galle Road, Bambalapitiya, Colombo-4. The Golden Vel Chariot originates from Old Kathiresan temple, Chettiar Street, (Sea Street), Colombo-11 and reaches the Old Kathiresan temple, Galle Road, Bambalapitiya, Colombo-4. The Silver Vel Chariot originates from New Kathiresan temple Chettiar Street, (Sea Street) Colombo 11 and reaches the New Kathiresan temple Galle Road, Bambalapitiya, Colombo 4. The two Vel chariots (Golden and Silver) are taken out in procession in alternate years.
That means if the Golden Vel chariot is taken out in one year in the following year the Silver Vel chariot would be taken out. Besides these two chariots, another Kaavadi chariot festival also takes place annually from the Sammangodu Sri Kathirvelautha temple, First Cross Street, Pettah to Sammangodu Sri Manika Vinayagar temple, Galle Road Bambalapitiya on the day before the Golden or Silver Vel chariot procession.
Three days
The wooden Kaavadi chariot is driven by a tractor. For a number of years, the travel route of the chariot remains the same. The deities spend three full days at Sammangodu Sri Manika Vinayagar temple, Galle Road, Bambalapitiya.
During the procession of the Vel chariot devotees, residents, businesspeople of commercial establishments stand on both sides of the road and make their Offerings. People keep the Mandapapadi and Purnakumpam and welcome the chariot.
On both sides of the road, the people wait for the chariot for long hours and pay their obeisance to Vel chariots. Vel chariots are always decorated with yellow bulbs, fresh flower garlands, Palm leaf Thoranam decoration and Banana trees with the ripe yellow banana bunch.

The bud wilted and dead, drooping down
What a farce! The entire country was waiting anxiously to hear the debate in parliament on the New York Times exposure of gratifications accepted by parliamentarians in the previous regime of Rajapaksa and the main person was none other than the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is said to have received millions of dollars from the Chinese contractors for his election campaign.
He, being the key person who is accused, should have faced the accusations and exonerated himself. Instead, he conveniently left for Singapore on the same day of the debate on some pretext. Isnt it a cowardly act, least to say The very action in purposely evading this debate shows a lack of leadership. Does not this also show there is some truth in what was stated in the New York Times
It is also strange the founder Chairman of Pohottuwa, Prof. G L Peiris not coming into the fray, to defend Mahinda Rajapaksa and other members of his party.
What did the eagerly awaiting voters see in parliament instead Rowdyism which forced the Speaker to suspend sittings. The other worst pathetic picture was there was no quorum and the bell had to be rung. These are our representatives whom we voters sent to parliament for a Yahapalanaya.
There is, to save face, a news item to say JO is planning to take legal action against
New York Times, which will never take place and remain only as a news item in the papers.
Come next elections and the same faces will be nominated and we voters were the left helpless. Dogs bark and the caravan moves. So be it.

Councillor opposes hydro electricity project
Extensive damage could be caused to the environment if the proposed 16 small-scale hydro electricity schemes based on small water bodies in the Dehiowita Pradeshiya Sabha area are given the go ahead, said JVP member Kosala Nuwan Jayaweera.
As such, the Dehiowita Pradeshiya Sabha should object to this proposal, he said.
JVP member Jayaweera was addressing the monthly meeting of the Dehiowita Pradeshiya Sabha, recently.
He said 16 varieties of fish and some frogs endemic to the area too would become extinct if these mini hydro electricity schemes were set up in the area.
Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Dumindu Shyaminda said the council had not received any notification about setting up such mini hydro electricity schemes in the area. Even if the council was notified about such a proposal, it would be compelled to oppose it.

Death penalty, a deadly blow
If there is one thing drug cartels fear the most, it would probably be legalisation or dwindling of meagre supplies. Surprisingly enough, law enforcement authorities told the Daily News that during the last seven days, supplies of narcotics have run short, prices have shot up, supply chains were breaking up, and anything which remained was deftly diluted.
Widespread detections have got suppliers running for cover, says SSP T.C.A Dhanapala, Director of the Police Narcotics Bureau. This has created a scarcity of narcotics in the market. A gram of heroin which could be bought for Rs. 12,000 now costs Rs. 14 000 or more. We have every reason to believe that supply chains are turning up loose ends and whatever is left in the market is diluted.
SSP Dhanapala says that confiscation of sizeable amounts of the drug is a deadly blow to both cartels and addicts. When there isnt enough of heroin in its pure form, it has to be adulterated to cater to demand, he said. Weve found that in some instances purity levels dropped to nearly 40 percent.
SSP Dhanapala, with other law enforcement officials, says there is a plausible explanation. Between June 26 and July 2 this year, through the setting up of a new range comprising the Special Task Force, Police Narcotics Bureau, Presidential Task Force on Drugs and the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB), police executed a massive drug detection campaign across the country.
Within these seven days, 5,010 detections were carried out islandwide and 4,940 arrests were made. The seizures of the drugs included 909 grams of heroin, 1.668 kg of cocaine and 4.44 kg of cannabis.
Interestingly enough last week, President Maithripala Sirisena, in his coup de main,called for the execution of prisoners engaged in drug trafficking from prison. During an event in Polonnaruwa on Saturday, July 14, he stoically defended the order, deafening cries of opposition. His call for the death penalty goes back to 2015 when he stated twice in public his willingness to enforce it if Parliament agreed.
In light of ample global empirical evidence which suggests that the death penalty does not serve as a deterrent, Sri Lanka makes an interesting case. SSP Dhanapala saysthat Presidents proclamation has had a surprising effect. Drug dealers and prisoners alike have began panicking. Under the veil of bravery, most drug lords loath death, he said. If enacted, this piece of law may have far-reaching effects on the local drug trade, than any weve seen so far.
Commandant of the STF and Senior DIG M.R. Latiff says that organised crime such as drug trafficking is a changing and flexible phenomenon. He says that traditional structures headed by kingpins who control niche crimes are being replaced by loose, flexible networks which shift operations and modify business based on opportunities, profit and demand.
They are structured like businesses, freely exercising violence and bribery to maintain operations and ward off competition, he said. He refers to the logic of drug violence: when there are fortunes to be made from a commodity which is only available through criminal enterprise, people would resort to any measure to seek fortunes. This includes retribution such as murder, and killings between underworld gangs, as witnessed here during recent months.
The most effective deterrent to crime is the certainty of detection, which has increased significantly over these months and particularly, in the last few weeks, he says. Consumption has not necessarily increased, because the quantity of drugs seized compared to last year remains small.
Narcotic detections by Sri Lanka Police this year compared to 2015 show a slump in quantity of cannabis, while the quantity of heroin increased in 2017. Massive hauls of cocaine were found in 2016, but marginal in the years before and after.
Senior DIG Latiff faults the current prisons system, adding that regardless of arrests, prisons are an incubator for increased drug usage and trade. Operational deficiencies include lack of space or segregation, while administratively, drug addicts need to be rehabilitated than dumped with other drug traders, which is counter-productive.
Prisons Commissioner H.M.T Upuldeniya who also heads administrative, intelligence and security, concedes that the prisons need restructuring and that sweeping reforms are in the works. We are in discussions with the judiciary on segregating those convicted of drug-related offences from other prisoners, and hope to make sweeping changes soon, he said, adding that the issue has become complex because of overcrowding in prisons. Welikada Prison can accommodate only 1,200, but has over 3,600.
He said that out of the total number of prisoners, nearly 63 percent are convicted for drug-related offences. Drug addicts in a society are scattered, but once inside prisons, its a meeting place where the drug trade flourishes. He told the Daily News, that the Presidents order for the death penalty has created a sense of fear even for those behind bars. When a directive of that nature is issued, it is these prisoners who would be affected first. The order has created a sense of fear.
Despite the ripple effect, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC ) says that the Presidential order may comprise the work that Sri Lanka has done to curb drug trafficking.
Alan Cole, who heads the Global Maritime Crime Programme at the UNODC office in Colombo, praised Sri Lankas efforts to curb international drug trafficking, but noted it was a pity a country as compassionate and sophisticated as Sri Lanka is contemplating going down the path of enforcing the death penalty when it could be doing more on demand reduction, effective law enforcement and education."
We have been encouraged by the work that the Prime Ministers office has done. They have been cooperating with us. Problems like this are not easy to fix. But the PMs office has had the right approach which is increased international cooperation and strengthened law enforcement, he said. However, the UNODC is fundamentally opposed to the death penalty - it is wrong in principal and unlikely to work in practice. Sri Lanka is very much leading the debate on tackling drug trafficking, but that role will be compromised if the country goes down the path of reintroducing the death penalty.
Meanwhile, Institute of Policy Studies research economist Sunimalee Madurawala argues that fighting illicit drug trafficking is a challenge for Sri Lanka because it lacks the resources, both financial and human. More needs to be done in terms of capacity building and training officers. Domestically, the government needs to allocate more funds for the rehabilitation of drug users and reintegration programmes for victims of drugs.
According to the NDDCB, around 20 percent of illicit drug users in Sri Lanka are between the age of 19 and 25, and 38 percent are between the age of 26 and 35.
Sri Lanka is not a producer or manufacturer of illicit drugs, with the exception of cannabis. It is, however, an important hub for international drug trafficking, including opium and heroin. This is mainly a result of the countrys strategic location, especially on important maritime and aviation shipping routes, for drugs originating mainly in India and Pakistan.
Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake believes that recent detections of gold and drugs such as heroin by Customs at the Bandaranaike International Airport are intricately linked. It can be said that drug consumption locally has increased, which is why there are far more detections of individuals bringing in undeclared gold and jewellery into the country.
He added that currency circulation in Sri Lanka has dropped inferring that individuals now bring in greater amounts of gold so that it can be bartered in exchange for expensive drugs such as heroin.

## Title: DEMOCRACY AND CONSCIENCE OF PEOPLE AND LEADERS

DEMOCRACY AND CONSCIENCE OF PEOPLE AND LEADERS
It is Sri Lankas experience, that all the Presidents, and many authorities responsible for judicial decisions, administration and financial transactions of public and private institutions have in many instances acted arbitrarily, according to their erroneous, flawed desires and corrupt whims and fancies. The people demanding the abolition of the presidency  the highest state authority  is a consequence of Sri Lankas degeneration to an abjectly rotten political, socio-economic culture and of serious exercises of irresponsibility. It is a sign of their alienation from the people. Sri Lanka needs saving from such a calamitous situation.
In the final analysis, the problem of creating space for a stable democracy does not depend only on a form of government, a presidential or parliamentary or a particular economic system. It depends on those vested with responsibility critically evaluating social reality and understanding and acting creatively with a good conscience. Confronted with a huge debt and critical financial situation the government should be frugal in expenditure and not engage in self-serving. It should stop importing duty-free vehicles for MPs, withhold increasing their salaries and bring about a new dynamic social reality according to a progressive agenda that is people oriented and open to their support.
All citizens are vested with responsibility, proportionately. Those who have been endowed with more need to contribute more by bearing greater responsibility to sensitize everyone. To lead all to discern the truth of the unhealthy social reality, help decide prudently, act in a disciplined manner according to conscience are acts of lively understanding and intelligence. Leaders need to assist and urge people to recover their conscience. No one could choose to do what is right and proper without a prudent conscience.
Good conscience
Consciences get formed from ones young days at home and school. Under the guidance of parents and teachers the young mature in their discerning and good consciences bud forth. Formation is a development in which the interior, the most precious within of a human being progresses towards a self-creation and an ongoing maturation and integrity and a wholesomeness of growth enabling him to deliberate, reason, understand, judge, decide and act freely, justly, fairly and independently of the vacillating opinion of others. Yet, as attractive contrary desires interpose, acting according to the dictates of a good conscience is indeed challenging. Those with a formed character are consistently successful. Formation of character is the function of parents and teachers. An education system that is indifferent to character formation is next to useless.
If the limp in the limb is not set right when a child is young, it will persist even in maturity. So, when for any reason the formation of a sensitive conscience of the young has been defective, whatever they became  clergymen, teachers, nurses, policemen, ministers, Supreme Court judges, heads of state they carry with them the predominant orientation of their badly formed consciences and make decisions with them. Just as the limping man knows his walk is crooked, the man acting with a disoriented conscience also knows he is crooked. Those with power without a good conscience are like a brigade of activated mindless robots handling complex lethal weapons. Public men with deformed consciences are worse than plagues.
So, when the one responsible politically or otherwise,
* only engages in the interplay of political forces, disregards the rule of law and along with it human rights, justice and fairness and exercises or succumbs to raw political power and gets away with it,
* denies the human rights of a vast number of people belonging to a racial or religious minority,
* denies the language rights and educational rights of a vast number of people belonging to an ethnic minority,
* deprives the children of the underprivileged people the opportunity to learn English while his children and those of his close supporters are assured of every opportunity,
* dispossesses people of their lands and houses for public works and leaves them in the lurch,
* supports the expropriation without compensation of the properties of individuals and groups
* enviously and vindictively supports the expropriation of the denominational schools to bring the Catholic Church to its knees as one of that leaders Cabinet ministers sneeringly put it, not knowing perhaps that at worship the Catholic Church is more on its knees than any other community,
* becomes spiteful of the Judiciary and grants to a condemned criminal amnesty and honours to reward him,
* receives gifts of vast sums of money given by foreign government and social organisations to help the distressed and banks the money in his private account earning interest too,
* abuses state resources - movable and immovable properties and financial resources without any check, and is not held to account for the dishonest expenditure,
* hires fleets of buses from the government transport board for election purposes and fails to settle the bill,
* openly engages in nepotism and promotes his own kith and kin and friends ensconcing them in high positions despite their lacking decent qualifications,
* supports those engaged in drug trafficking and protects wrongdoers from arrest, disregarding the law and deadening the agencies of the law,
* does not treat all citizens as equal but favours a particular group and unjustly discriminates against others,
* disdains the law and obstructs its application to favour political loyalists,
* pressurizes all his political partisans to abandon their own conscience and vote to prolong his rule
* involves the country in huge debts and lets his supportive friends, kith and kin to make huge gains corruptly at the cost of the country,
* mortgages the countrys future beyond his lifetime and leaves its onus to future generations,
* condones ministers who use their positions to distribute houses and vehicles at government expense to relatives and political supporters,
* makes solemn promises witnessed by multitudes and reneges on them, and creates tension between racial and religious groups as a vote catching devise,
* remains blind to matters such as these and displays a foolish self-righteous stubbornness,
It cannot be said that such national leaders and those responsible have acted with a good conscience. They have acted with evil and dishonest intent. They are aware of it. Belatedly a few have admitted to have made mistakes  mistakes that have cost the country dearly. Others are far too arrogant to admit. The root cause of all the intractable problems of our country in the public and private sector is the far from desirable upright condition of the consciences of our people and of those vested with authority who act arbitrarily and in corrupt ways. Political leaders pass all manner of unjust and unfair laws to suit their narrow and selfish purposes. Unjust laws are no laws at all, said St. Augustine of Hippo, over sixteen centuries ago!
Constitutions and law updating are important; but they achieve precious little without persons of reliable conscience. Though the link between democracy and conscience may seem tenuous, conscience is the guarantor of democracy. We cannot be a civilized people if we are without a decent conscience. It is all the more reason to plan and systematically put into effect a way to form and strengthen consciences. This is possible. If there is a will there is a way. If such a plan is duly carried out, satanic forces roaming this land will be thrust down to the hell fire where they belong.
National leaders
There are many citizens, learned, experts in their own fields who are honest and clear headed and know what reforms Sri Lanka needs. They know what and how things should be done. As they are not in power to do so, they should get mobilized and even persuade those in power to a moral conversion and sincerely cooperate to remake Sri Lanka. Though for selfish reasons they may hesitate, the overwhelming decency of conscientious people will induce them to mend their ways or step aside.
The new team of national leaders especially should be a clear headed sharers of a common vision who could lead the people as a shepherd leads his whole flock to more verdant pastures. Jewish people called their kings and rulers shepherds. The Leader sets the tune for all vested with responsibility. It is high time we had a national leader with a good conscience who is sustained by supporters of rectitude and acts fearlessly, courageously and impartially and could speak frankly and forthrightly to the whole Nation and lead her honourably with a sense of justice and fairness and respect for all the citizens, upholding the best traditions of democracy. Such a leader will not only be a bulwark of truth and justice and a boon to all the people of the country, he will also be a beacon of light and one to be emulated by the young, the blessings and traditions of conscientious leadership should be passed from generation to generation for many years to come. An undesirable rotten tradition has lasted a few decades, a purified tradition could replace it with the support of the people.

Dimuth climbs, Rabada knocked off perch
Dimuth Karunaratne continued his climb up the batting rankings chart to reach No. 7 after a Player-of-the-Series performance for Sri Lanka.
In the low-scoring series against South Africa, which finished 2-0 in favour of the hosts, opener Karunaratne was the biggest batting highlight.
He scored 158*, 60, 53 and 85 to total 356 runs in the two Tests, taking him up three places to a career-high 754 points in the MRF Tyres ICC Test Player Rankings for batsmen update on Tuesday, 24 July.
With Dinesh Chandimal, their regular captain who missed the series owing to suspension, at No.8, Sri Lanka now have two batsmen in the top 10.
Angelo Mathews is also up four places to No.24 among batsmen, thanks to his fighting 71 in the second Test.
Other gainers in the Sri Lankan camp were Danushka Gunathilaka, up 36 spots to No. 73, and Akila Dananjaya, the off-spinner, whose seven wickets vaulted him up 16 places to No.39 among bowlers and up 25 to No.46 among all-rounders.
Kagiso Rabada lost the No.1 position on the bowling table to Englands James Anderson. Dale Steyn, who had made the top spot his for years, is still waiting for the one wicket that will make him South Africas leading wicket-taker, and slipped by four to No.24.

DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr suspended from the Commons
DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr has been officially suspended from the Commons for a record 30 days for serious misconduct - and voters could now boot him out of office.
MPs formally backed the extraordinary penalty today after a damning report on two luxury trips the MP made with his family to Sri Lanka - paid for by the countrys government.
A damning watchdog report last week found Mr Paisley failed to register the trips, both in 2013, within 28 days and later engaged in paid advocacy in a 2014 letter to the Prime Minister.
We have concluded that Mr Paisleys actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute, the Commons Standards Committee declared.
We conclude that Mr Paisley has committed serious misconduct.
The suspension of 30 sitting days is the longest since records began in 1949.
It will begin on September 4 which means it is set to last until mid-November - depriving Theresa May of a crucial Leave vote on her final Brexit deal.
The suspension will also trigger a process that could see the MP booted out of office.
Under a law passed in 2015, any MP suspended for more than 10 sitting days automatically triggers a recall petition that their constituents can sign.
If at least 10% of local voters sign the petition within six weeks, Mr Paisley will be booted out of office and a by-election will be held in his North Antrim seat.
The probe into Mr Paisley, the son of the late firebrand unionist of the same name, was triggered by an investigation in the Daily Telegraph last year.
Paisley recommended himself to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, which itself triggered the ruling by the Standards Committee.
The report found Mr Paisley visited Sri Lanka twice with his family, in March to April 2013 and in July 2013.
But he failed to register the visits within 28 days. Then, on 19 March 2014, the MP wrote to then-Prime Minister David Cameron with other MPs expressing alarm at a proposed UN resolution on Sri Lanka.
The UN resolution had proposed an international investigation into alleged human rights violations in the country.
But,Paisleys letter opposed the resolution noting with alarm the decision by HM Government to internationalise the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
In this letter Mr Paisley did not declare the financial benefits he and his family had received from the Sri Lankan government, todays report said. Paisley argued he had felt a declaration was not necessary because sufficient time had elapsed since the visits and because the Prime Minister was aware of his interest in Sri Lanka.
Paisley apologised immediately for his failure to register the hospitality, but there were also aggravating factors, MPs said.
The report declared: Mr Paisleys failure to register the hospitality he received from the Sri Lankan government is made more serious by the scale of that hospitality. While he has disputed the Daily Telegraphs claim that the value was 100,000, by his own calculation it amounted to over 50,000 - and may have been significantly more than that.
This massively exceeded the threshold for registration, which at that time was 660.
The report said Mr Paisley later promptly registered a third visit to Sri Lanka - showing he was well aware of the need to do so.
The penalty over undeclared visits to Sri Lanka is the longest since records began in 1949 - and will trigger a process for voters to boot him out of office- Mirror.co.uk

The essence of all religions
The book titled Ways to the Center and subtitled as An Introduction to World Religions (1981, 1984, Wordsworth Publishing, California) reached me as a rare treasure from a car boot sale in London as far back as mid-eighties. For those who are in need of essential knowledge on the main religions of the world, the work is authored by two scholars: Denise Lardner Carmody and John Tully Carmody.
The work contains ten main chapters, helping the reader to grasp the background of the religion, the social impact, the various challenges faced by those who accepted the religion and the vision and the mission of the same that enabled it to be accepted via documents as well as the oral transmission over the years. Followed by the preface, the authors present some salient factors pertaining to the need for the study of world religions. The most significant factor is the necessity that created the religious belief.

The earliest humans had to perceive the impact of the nature as a supportive mode as well as a divine element that makes him live with an awakened beneficial living condition. In the direction, the surmised belief in divinity or God had come to stay. Followed by various ways of seeing the divinity, arrived the need to know more about the studying of religion where the authors indicate the key events in the subject area of religious studies book in the East and in the West.
The scholarly methods of studying are indicated. Firstly there are the psychological perspectives indicative of research of the type of French (1856  1939). Secondly comes the sociological research leading to the study on the part of Max Weber (1864  1920) and Emile Durkheim (1858  1917). Thirdly more scientific studies that lay emphasis on some of the aspects of religious studies enter in the form of scientific studies that lay emphasis on physics, chemistry and medicine. This leads to the fourth area of study known as phenomenological perspectives. All these background material lead into the opening chapter on the ancient religious mind and the changing aspects of the same over the years.
The authors attempt to rediscover the nature of the pre-historic religious, mainly based on folklore, anthropology and history in various parts of the world. In this direction, the authors have indicated 25 key events globally from the formation of the earth 4.6 billion years ago.
The areas such as the rise of life, the growth of the advanced Hominoid, the use of stone tools, use of five, the rise of homo sapiens, and the use of the ritual, the growth of the hunting culture, migration, colonization, agriculture, breeding animals. Thinking patterns, irrigation, writing and literacy are traced with adequate examples. This leads to the phenomenon of the religions of non-literate people at the gradual changing process.
Myths and rituals
Twenty-five key dates relating to the religions of non-literate people are indicated. They include initially Homo Sapiens. Then come the homo sapiens of Australia, onto Polynesia and New Zealand. The authors introduce the types of myths and rituals linked to these key dates. Chapters three and four centres on the origins of Hinduism and Buddhism respectively. These chapters explore the aspects of the cultures in post-Vedic India, Vedic India, the period of native challenge, the period of reform and foreign challenge and a summary of what Hinduism means. Coming on to the chapter on Buddhism, the contents include the background history of the Buddha, Dhamma the aspects of early Buddhism, the aspects of Tantrism and Mahayanism, the challenges faced by the Buddha and the spread of Buddhism to other countries etc.
The story of the Buddha at the outset is narrated like a story stating that he would be Buddha, named as Siddhartha was born and grew up in a time of rapid change, when people were in turmoil over religion and open to new teachings. Furthermore, the legend has it that his father Suddhodana was a king, who received a revelation that his child would be a world ruler if the child stayed at home.
According to other legends as the researcher-writer notes, but if the child leaves home, he would be a spiritual saviour. The renunciation on the part of Prince Siddhartha amidst all the pleasures bestowed on him is emphasized as the great renunciation the search for the ultimate spiritual goal. As stated, Prince Siddhartha, now known as Gothama meditated on age, disease and death and decided to cast away his round of pleasures and solve the riddle of lifes meaning by becoming a wandering ascetic. The words used by the writers go as follows:
Renouncing his wife, child, father and all the luxuries, he set off to answer his souls yearning.
Buddhist discourse
Chapter Five is an attempt to trace the areas in Chinese religion, such as Confucianism, neo-Confucianism, Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, and the allied religious areas. Then comes the chapter on Japanese religions. The contents include the formative stages of the rooting down of Buddhism into various sects such as Kamakura Buddhism, Zen Buddhism and the advent of new visions of Buddhist doctrine.
The reader comes to know that two of the great pioneers who launched Zen vision in Japan was Eisai (1141  1215) and Dogen (1200  1253). Eisai had studied Zen Buddhism in China and then established himself in Kamakura, the new centre of Japanese political power. His teaching won special favour among the warlords who were coming to dominate Japan. From there onwards, the Zen vision got close bonds with them.
Zen became popular due to the central theme of the twist of the vision that linked the narrative that evokes a psychological impact on either the listener or the reader. It is the great visionary Bodhi Dharma who is held responsible for the origins of the Zen Vision. The vision helped the masses to think of how the mind works and the need for the mastery of the same in situations.
The next episode is the presentation of facts and figures pertaining to religions of ancient near eastern civilizations. This includes areas such as religions and practices in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Iran and Greece. Followed by the merged Judaism. It is recorded that Judaism is the oldest of the three major prophetic religions. The founding and development of Christianity and Islam could not have occurred without the pre-existence of Judaism. It is also stated that Zoroastrianism can claim some prophetic equality with Judaism, but its prophecies never became dominant in near eastern and western beliefs.

First of many firsts
Showbiz may be good business but being there is no easy job for it is most unpredictable. Trends keep changing and something that clicked today will find no favour with the audience tomorrow. From a producer-driven industry to a star-dominated one, Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Deputy Chairman Ranjit Page has seen the evolution of Sri Lankan cinema from close quarters.
The man who has been in touch with the industry for many years via Ceylon Theaters spoke to the Daily News about the close association of the company with Sri Lankan cinema.
Sri Lanka embodies a rich history. The entertainment sector can be instrumental in bringing our culture and values to the fore. The industry is the hub of new technologies. It is also a sector in which youth can shine as new filmmakers. We built new cinemas, digitalize the screens, and create an environ suitable for a family outing as a means of uplifting the local film industry, he explained adding that joining hands with ANCL to rejuvenate the Sarasaviya Film Awards this year is another step towards boosting the local film industry. This is the first time that two reputed organizations have gotten together to host a film festival of this nature. The Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards 2018 will be held on August 3 at the BMICH.
Known as one of the oldest film production companies in Sri Lanka, Ceylon Theaters was taken over by Albert A. Page with the aim of enriching the industry and helping to entertain masses. Armed with the belief that good entertainment will unite people to bridge the gap between diverse cultures and regions, the company became the first to mark several milestones in Sri Lankan cinema history. They incorporated Ceylon Studios in 1956 thereby stopping remittances to India for film production. They also established the first cinema in the country  Empire Theatre, which was built on the site that the Regal Colombo stands today. April 7, 1947, the company released its first national film Asokamala. They followed this up with many noteworthy productions like Nidhanaya, Ada Rae, Kusumalatha and Akkara Paha. Later the company diversified its portfolio and acquired Millers Ltd. and Cargills (Ceylon) Ltd in 1981.
Adding another feather on their cap the company created the countrys first Cineplex at Majestic City. They also boast of the largest number of film screens in Sri Lanka: 15 screens in Colombo, Jaffna, Kandy, Negombo, Gampaha and Nuwara Eliya, with plans for 21 new screens across eight locations.
We wanted to create a good environment to lure youth to film theatres to watch films. We digitalized the cinema in Nuwara Eliya which had been shut down for a couple of years. Likewise, we are on the lookout for new venues in which we can put more than one cinema screen. We believe that presenting the latest technology in a novel manner will woo the youth and bring them over to the industry. Both the public and private sectors need to do their bit to achieve this target, Page opined.
With over 27 years of experience in the management sector Page has been instrumental in introducing the supermarketing concept to Sri Lanka.
During my stint, I saw the suffering of the rural farmers. We gave them a chance to sell their goods on our shelves. We also changed the structure of the supermarket, he noted adding that the audience has changed over the decades and that there is a need to cater to their demands.
We need to change according to time. We cannot play the same tune which we did in the past and expect to draw masses. We should learn from the past and make the transition. Other countries have built malls which houses a few cinema screens. We are looking at taking this concept out of Colombo, he explained.
Stressing on the importance of making way for new young filmmakers for the industry to move forward Page says that the country needs entrepreneurs and business leaders who can revolutionize the industry.
Then they would realize that the country gave them this opportunity and they need to give something back to their motherland. We still make movies to please ourselves rather than aim at making productions with the goal of bringing youth into film halls. Think about your customers tastes too rather than your own, he pointed out.
Though there are still a few veterans in Hollywood and Bollywood many new faces too have joined the scene each year. He says that this change of mindset needs to be brought to the Sri Lankan cinema sector too. Cultural change too can be brought via cinema.
We have changed the face of agriculture and dairy. We have also changed the concept of entrepreneurship to a certain extent. Now it is time for cinema to make that transition. We need to do this using the latest technology. We also need to hand over the industry to the future generation, he said.
People see the world through entertainment. They will be able to witness things which are in the international sphere as well as those in the home front. It is a powerful medium which can drive home a message and can reach thousands of people easily, he said adding that a policy needs to be created for the betterment of the future rather than viewing it in the past angle. He says that an equal playing field in investment is needed for an industry to thrive. Productions, imports and screen developments need to be encouraged. The answer to films queuing up for release is to increase the number of screens.
You do not need acres to build a film hall today. You do not need to have 600 seats in a theatre. The youth are looking for something to inspire them. We need to provide them with that inspiration and create a good cinema culture for them to take this industry forward, he concluded with a smile.

Fitch maintains RWN on  BBB-(lka) rating of HDFC Bank
Fitch Ratings has maintained Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lankas (HDFC Bank) National Long-Term Rating of BBB-(lka) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).
The agency has also maintained the RWN on the BBB-(lka) rating of HDFC Banks senior secured and senior unsecured debentures.
The RWN, first placed in August 2017, has been maintained pending a capital infusion from the Sri Lankan state (B+/Stable) to help HDFC Bank meet the Rs 5 billion minimum regulatory capital requirement. We expect the state, the banks major shareholder, to extend its support but the timing of the capital infusion depends on regulatory clearance. The minimum capital requirement has been in force since 2016. Fitch downgraded HDFC Bank on January 29, 2018 after the state failed to provide the capital to the bank in a timely manner. HDFC Banks rating reflects Fitchs expectation that the bank will receive extraordinary support from the sovereign, if required. Our assessment captures the states 51% effective holding, which includes the National Housing Development Authoritys direct ownership of 49%; the banks quasi-policy role in supporting housing-development initiatives; as well as HDFC Banks low systemic importance. The banks weak standalone profile is characterized by its above-industry exposure to low- and middle-income customers, mainly through housing loans, who tend to be more susceptible to economic cycles. The share of housing loans has declined over the years but it has remained high, at 82% at end-March 2018. The bank continued to have a high reported non-performing loan (NPL) ratio, which stood at 19.7% at end-March 2018.
This was mainly due to defaults from housing finance backed by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which contributed slightly more than half of the banks total housing NPLs at end-March 2018. Nevertheless, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka annually reimburses HDFC Bank for EPF-backed loans in arrears for more than three months.
The banks NPL ratio remained high even without the EPF-backed housing loans at 8.9% at end-March 2018 (9.0% at end-2017), which reflects the concentration of its credit risk in the low- and middle-income housing-finance market.

Five thousand Udagammana villages by Jan 2020
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa pledged to begin the construction of 5,000 Udagammana villages by January 2020.
He was speaking at the vesting of two Udagammana villages - Thuruudugama and Muwasirigama - in Ampara to the public.
Under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, the yahapalana government has launched an accelerated housing development programme, said the minister.
Minister Premadsasa said that the construction of 906 Udagammana villages has already begun, covering all 25 districts from Dondra to Point Pedro.
We are planning to establish 2,500 Udagammana villages by December 31 next year. To meet that target, we have to establish 1,594 more Udagammana villages. But we have only 533 days. So we have to start the construction of three villages per day, he said. According to statistics, around 102,550 families out of a total of 209,796 families in the Ampara district have housing issues.
The reason for such a large amount of housing issues after the regime of a government which boasted that there was a massive development drive is surprising, the minister said.
Construction of 39 Udagammana villages in the Ampara district has already begun. But we cannot be satisfied with that number and we are hoping to establish 150 more Udagammana villages in Ampara, Minister Premadasa said.

Fixed goal
Straight and narrow is the path for him. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of De Mazenod College Kandana, Shalin Perera who feels that sacrifice is one of the greatest actions one can ever perform. Your heart needs to be in the right place.
In life, so many people will apply pressure on you to live your life the way they want you to live your life. You need to be resolute and follow your goals. Dont let anyone rush you. If you want to take your time, take your time. Believe in yourself most of all. Trust your instincts. You cant go wrong then.
As we live in a somewhat troubled world I feel the youth must be brave and should have foresight. I feel that they must also need to be creative. In this competitive society, people rush after money and power. The youth must not be afraid to be different in society. I wish to tell the youth that you dont need to jump on the bandwagon all the time, just because someone tells you to. You dont have to follow the path everyone else takes. You dont need to follow the norm. Do what your heart tells you to do, not what others want you to do, said Perera.
Identified success
You need to find out what you are good at. If you are good at what you do, then you are going to do well in life.
These days a lot of young people want to be doctors and engineers because people tell them to follow those careers. Those are the fields that society deems as prestigious and much sought after. Fields that are identified with success. But we know that there are some young people who can take photographs well, and who can write creatively. So then, is it not better for them to be a photographer or an author or storyteller So then they should identify their talents and strengths and move in that direction. They will make them much happier. That is my idea of a role model, said Perera.
When we face difficulties we must formulate a plan. Now that is easier said than done. Formulating a strategy is not easy. You need to work on that aspect of your personality and mind. It is not a case of Hey Presto I have a solution! When formulating a plan it would be good to have some input from others. Of course but on one hand there are those who have brilliant acumen. Working on how to devise plans would be a useful ability.
We need to understand what the difficulty is because we cannot solve a problem without proper understanding. We must also get the opinions of others. Elders have experience and experience is vital. Difficulties can occur at any time. We must face them with a plan. Also having a backup plan is useful  Plan B. This will help us face our problems which will ensure a positive result, stated Perera.
Horrific pain
Pereras pointed out that an exemplary leader in history is Jesus Christ. Anyone who has watched the Passion of Christ would have seen the horrific pain and suffering that Jesus had to endure at the hands of the hardened Roman Soldiers. In that way, his sacrifice was one of a kind. Jesus also walked with sinners. All kinds of sinners and treated them equally. He forgave them all.
I am a Catholic and there is only one leader in history I admire, and he is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ sacrificed his life to save the world and people. In history, there are great kings and leaders, but none of them has really laid down their lives the way Jesus did. Though we cant come close to him, we can learn many qualities from Jesus. He is the best example of a good leader, explained Perera.
Perera feels that his defining attributes as a leader are the fact that he follows the straight and the narrow path.
I am a Head Prefect and the reason for my success is that I take the advice of my elders and even those under me. And I am also genuine and upright in what I do. As I said before, I try to fully understand the situation when facing an issue and I face it with integrity. I would also like to acknowledge my Grade Nine teacher Shantha Bandara. She was the person who encouraged me to follow the prefect-ship. She advised me to take up the challenge saying that she would stand by me, and that was my turning point, pointed out Perera.
Responsibilities and priorities
Perera also pointed out that his school is his second mother. Perera feels that as a student we need to identify our responsibilities our priorities. School life is not merely taking orders and performing them, studying the subjects and learning the textbooks.
School teaches you how to behave in society and identifying what is good and discarding what is bad and learning what humanity is. For the full duration of my school life, I have been a good student, a good basketball player since Grade 4, and I am a good Kandyan dancer. I have become a good leader and Prefect, and all this because of my dedication to my duties. Also as the Head Prefect, I try to maintain the discipline in the school and stay true to my college, added Perera.
Perera believes that doing Kandyan dance has taught him discipline. Traditional dance is something special in Sri Lanka. They have a great place in the Pereharas. Also, you learn flexibility.
When we look at the world we can see that people are so selfish. They only think of their advancement. They do not spare a thought for others. They are not interested in helping others. Again sacrifice is the key issue here. Even the tiniest sacrifice can make a big difference in someones life. I like seeing people helping others and being a good example for children. This should be our quality. Also, we see another problem in society which is negligence. You cannot neglect your duties towards other people. We need a world of helpful people. A person should be an example of compassion as well. So trying to make people open their eyes and trying to get them to be more understanding of others is something I would like to do, explained Perera.
Goal accomplished
Perera has set his sights on becoming a leader in the Air Force and reach the highest position in the Air Force and pointed out that everyone is backing him to accomplish this goal including his parents and teachers.
I am willing to make the necessary sacrifices and ready to do my best. Even though this is my ambition I have other ambitions as well which includes being a national basketball player. I would love to serve my country in any way that I can, even as a player. I would even like to be a really good Kandyan dancer, said Perera.
Learning in the Math stream, Perera presented a riddle showing his interest in math 
Lets say that you are trapped in a room with no windows. Think if you are trapped in that room! And even if you are in a room with windows, imagine the windows are closed. Also, the water is gushing into the room. How do you escape without drowning The answer is simple  You dont think about the subject at all! You dont think about it at all! That is the solution!
The message that he wants to give to young pupils in life is not to be afraid to try new things! Take on responsibilities and make something of our lives.
Always do what is honourable because the eyes of everyone are on you. What you do will come under endless scrutiny because you are a leader. People may stand in your way but you need to overcome these hindrances in a decent way. Always think twice. Because people will try and talk behind your back but that is because you are in front. You have to be a shining example a younger one can look up to. Dont run after worldly things and understand and follow the truth, explained Perera.
Perera also commented that when facing pressure you need to assess your strengths and weaknesses and the best thing is to stay with your religion.
Prayer is very helpful. Always do things that make your mind free. It is different from man to man. People are different and their minds are different. Lastly, I wish to say again that sometimes people tend to think that money and power are everything. But in my experience, we cant change people the way we want to, but we can guide them in our own way. Truth and Justice are more important than power and money. Even politicians need to address the real problems in a country, which they dont seem to be doing. We need righteous leaders in the future.
Lastly, I wish to thank Principal, Rev. Bro. Janaka Fonseka, Deputy Principal Rev. Bro. Pubudu Rajapaksa, Master In charge of Prefects Royden Fernando and Mistress in charge of prefects Nirmala Nishanthi.

Government push for electric three-wheelers
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma jointly launched Sri Lankas first electric three wheelers yesterday in an effort to bring down transportation costs and to encourage transition to environmentally friendly transportation alternatives.
Speaking at the launch of the Electric Tuk Tuk at the Waters Edge Hotel on Monday, Finance Minister Samaraweera said with more than one million three-wheeler drivers in Sri Lanka, the three-wheeler industry is indeed a major sector of the country. The Sri Lankan tuk has in fact become something of an icon as it is used in myriad aspects. It is an affordable means of transport for small business, providing last mile connectivity for SMEs and entrepreneurs. Three wheelers are a means of affordable private transportation as well, and are increasingly popular in the tourism industry. The government has recognised the importance of this sector to the economy and intends to further empower those involved in the industry. In the 2018 budget, Finance Minister Samaraweera proposed to introduce the tourist friendly tuk-tuk concept in collaboration with the hospitality industry.
This programme provides for existing three-wheeler drivers to register with the SLTDA so that a three-wheeler would not only be a mode of transportation, but the driver to serve as a local tourist-guide as well.
This policy was initiated to create a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved and improve the quality of services provided in the tourism industry.
This program is now being implemented successfully with 589 drivers joining the training programmes already.
Electric three wheeler
The introduction of electric three-wheelers to this industry is another important new policy. Minister Samaraweera said, there are several reasons for the shift from the fossil fuel tuk to the electric version, and environmental concerns are chief amongst them.
As part of the Paris agreement, Sri Lanka has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the transport sector by 2020.
Among the host of recommendations, one way to achieve this reduction is to convert the existing vehicles to zero-emission vehicles, which would cause minimum levels of pollution and carbon footprint.
The number of three-wheelers in Sri Lanka has increased eight-fold since the year 2,000. The fuel consumption per person has increased from 90 litres to 150 litres during the same time. In 2017, Sri Lanka spent nearly USD 3.5 billion to import fossil fuels for the generation of electricity and transportation.
This is equivalent to around 4% of GDP.
Therefore, Sri Lanka needs a longer term sustainable solution to mitigate the negative environmental consequences that arise as well as a solution to minimise the forex outflows from the country.

Govt to write-off loans given to women in drought-affected districts
This scheme of relief initially will be limited to women who have obtained micro finance loans for non-consumption purposes in the drought-affected districts. The 12 districts that were affected by the recent drought are Trincomalee, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa where cultivations were affected consecutively for five seasons.
Accordingly, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that women who obtained such loan amounting to Rs 100,000.00 and below can apply for complete write off of the interest and the capital payment.
The General Treasury will reimburse the loss incurred by the micro finance companies for having written off the capital component.
The government has allocated Rs.500 million for this year to initiate the reimbursement programme. The micro finance companies will have to absorb the interest component of the loan written off.
The persons who are benefitted by this debt relief programme will be included on a priority basis to provide new loan facilities from interest subsidy loan scheme launched under the Enterprise Sri 201807-24 Lanka programme with a maximum of two year grace period. Further, they will also be given priority under Governments subsidised programmes and other rural livelihood schemes implemented through co-operative societies as envisaged in the Budget -2018 proposal.
Micro finance institutions are currently providing micro loans without collateral through a door-to-door strategy of high interest rate loans amounting to 40 percent to 220 percent per annum for women seeking economic activities and income generation sources. When multiple loans are obtained under micro finance scheme, people have to pay much higher interest than the initial loan amount due to higher interest premium. Therefore, the government has taken the timely action to protect the rural women from falling in to a debt trap by imposing an interest rate cap of 30 percent on future loans.

Grace period for Lankan illegal immigrants in Israel
Sri Lanka has given its citizens working illegally in Israel a grace period till September to return to the country and legal action will be taken against those who do not return during that period, , Deputy Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said.
The deputy minister was speaking to family members of Sri Lankans working illegally in Israel yesterday. We got a lot of opportunities for Sri Lankans to work in Israeli firms, but now we dont get that opportunity. This is because around 150 out of 500 have not returned. We have spoken to the Israeli government and they have agreed to take back people who returned after the expiry of their work visa, he said.
The deputy minister said that some Sri Lankans who were living in Israel illegally had lodged false human rights complaints with the Israeli authorities.
They said that they been assaulted in Sri Lanka and that they cant return to the country because they fear for their lives. They are alleging that there is no human security in Sri Lanka and this is tarnishing our image internationally. This is what happened to us during the war. A lot of people who never had any threats lied to get asylum in Western countries. Im sure they benefitted personally, but millions of people living here suffer because of the consequences of such allegations, he said. He urged the family members of Sri Lankans who are working in Israel illegally to bring their loved ones back.
He warned that they had taken steps to issue warrants to those who have violated immigration laws.

Greek forest fires kill over 60
GREECE: Huge forest fires raging across Greece have killed over 60 people and injured more than 100, forcing authorities to seek international assistance.
A state of emergency was declared in parts of Athens as coast guard boats headed out in an attempt to rescue dozens of people trapped on beaches by fire.
A Red Cross official revealed that 26 bodies were found in the yard of a villa in the seaside village of Mati on Tuesday morning.
The death toll previously stood at 24 before the grim discovery.
People have been told to leave their homes across the region as authorities desperately try to bring the situation under control.
Of at least 104 people injured by the blazes, 69 needed hospital treatment and 11 were in a serious condition, officials said.
Fire Service spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri said Greece had called on the European Union for assistance with aerial and ground support in helping battle the flames.
We are doing everything humanly possible to tray and tackle these fires, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said in Bosnia as he cut short a visit there and returned to Athens.
What concerns us is that there are fires occurring simultaneously.
The first major fire broke out in a pine forest near the seaside settlement of Kineta 30 miles west of Athens between the capital and Corinth.
At least 220 firefighters were on the scene while five water-dropping planes and seven helicopters helped to fight the blaze from the air.
Local authorities said childrens summer camps and a seaside resort for military officers were evacuated, while dozens of homes and cars were reportedly destroyed.
The coast guard was sending five vessels to rescue people trapped on nearby beaches by the flames. - AFP

Health Minister orders probe into incidents at state hospitals
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has informed Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe to conduct separate investigations into the incidents which took place at Galaha Rural Hospital and Thammennawa Rural Hospital, which were reported in the media, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to media reports, a woman had gone to Galaha Rural Hospital recently to obtain treatment for her four-year-old child. They had reportedly been sent away after a doctor allegedly scolded them and an attendant allegedly assaulted them.
The media had also reported that three accident victims of one family had not been accepted by the Thammennawa Rural Hospital because no doctor was available to treat them. They had been sent to the Mihintale Hospital, but the child and father had died before admission. The mother is now receiving medical treatment at the Anuradhapura General Hospital.

A historic milestone
It was a dream come true, not only for President Maithripala Sirisena who waged a lone battle during the previous regime to get the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga project off the ground but also for 21 million Sri Lankans who waited for more than a decade to see it become a reality. Speaking during the ceremony held to mark the release of water to the Kalu Ganga reservoir in Laggala, President Sirisena described it as the happiest day in his life and predicted it will spur a massive development drive to rejuvenate the countrys agricultural hinterland. This is indeed a watershed moment in the countrys annals. It was also fitting that the new reservoir was named after legendary engineer Dr. A.N.S. Kulasinghe.
As the President said, the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga reservoir development scheme, the biggest in the Mahaweli system, is a permanent solution to wipe away the tears of the Rajarata people who were affected by an acute scarcity of water for decades as there was no proper irrigation system. Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga will not be an isolated project as it will be followed by several other irrigation and hydropower projects such as giant canal systems, Upper Elahera Ela and a few others. Combined, the two new reservoirs are many times bigger than the Parakrama Samudraya, itself one of the biggest reservoirs (tanks) in the country.
The Moragahakanda project completed at a cost of US$ 1,150 million will end the water scarcity in several districts including Matale, Polonnaruwa, Vavuniya and Anuradhapura. It will provide irrigation facilities to 81,422 hectares in the Dry Zone. The 102 Km Rajarata channel system will connect to the Mahakanadarawa Tank via Huruluwewa. The construction of the 96 km long Wayamba Channel system will commence in February. Both channel systems will supply water to 1,500 small tanks in the Dry Zone. Upon completion of the two channel systems around 94,000 hectares of paddy land can be cultivated throughout the year. Apart from providing water for agriculture purposes, the project will provide drinking water to millions in the dry zone who are severely affected by health issues such as kidney disease. The project will also add 25 Megawatts to the national grid through the power house attached to the main dam of Moragahakanda.
It is important to recall that this project almost did not get off the drawing board, if not for the valiant efforts of President Sirisena during his tenure as the Mahaweli Minister. He recalled that even though he commenced the project on January 25, 2007 as the then Mahaweli Development Minister, the former President did not give any support or assistance to carry out the project. As a result, the project stagnated for five long years. Water could have been released for irrigation six years ago if the project went ahead as planned. This is yet another instance of how development  and the people  can suffer as a result of petty political revenge. At least now, a mechanism should be evolved to ensure that no individual or Government can unnecessarily hold up essential development projects that benefit the public regardless of the political issues involved. National policies must be formulated to continue development projects irrespective of political developments.
Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganaga will join the rest of the Mahaweli system to revitalize the countrys agricultural fortunes. Lest we forget, Sri Lanka is primarily an agricultural nation with a proud irrigation-based civilization. In fact, some of the reservoirs (tanks) built by ancient kings still work perfectly, leaving modern engineers astonished at the level of precision and engineering. The Mahaweli project is the very embodiment of this proud heritage. It was originally planned as a 30-year venture, but the Government of President J.R. Jayewardene accelerated it, given the multitude of benefits to the countrys rice-growing hinterland. There were three objectives of the project  irrigation, drinking water supply and power generation. Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga have several more benefits  pleasure boating/tourism and inland fisheries are among them. We should also pause for a moment to express our gratitude to the hundreds of families who willingly scarified their ancestral homelands and houses for the project. On its part, the Government has built an entire new township replete with all facilities for these families.
With Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga in full flow, the months long droughts will no longer pose a huge problem to the farmers in the North Central Province and elsewhere from now on as water will be available year round. This will benefit not only paddy farmers but also cultivators of other crops. It is also vital to manage the paddy cultivation and storage prudently, to prevent an unnecessarily excessive harvest at least until we identify viable export markets for our rice varieties. In fact, Post Harvest Losses (PHL) is a big factor in local agriculture which adversely affects the farmers. A mechanism must be introduced to reduce or eliminate PHL in local agriculture possibly with foreign expertise. We should also take a critical look at water management in agriculture as water is a very precious resource. The waters of Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga must be used prudently with the future generations in mind.

Hitler in Sri Lanka!
The life of nations merely repeats, on a large scale, the lives of their component cells. - Marcel Proust
Usually the subject matter of a sermon, particularly if delivered at a domestic setting, is unlikely to catch the interest of the larger public. These are practices of the faith, private functions for the householder, his family and invitees. It is the custom, particularly among the well to do Buddhists, to mark a personal milestone, like a birthday, with an alms giving for the clergy followed by a sermon. After the departure of the monks the gathering will be served a meal. There are professional organisers for such events, relieving the organisational burdens from the householder, provided he can afford the exercise.
This household was somewhat unusual in the sense that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa the householder, brother of the former President, although avowedly no politician and purportedly with no political organisation behind him, is widely considered a potential Presidential candidate, to some even a certain winner at the next elections. In an age when the bloodline is irrelevant for high office, when we all claim to be enlightened republicans, an appreciation of the South Asian political mind is essential to understand this strange political phenomenon. In this part of the world, political vision and ability runs in the family; all for one, one for all!
To hold sway, this South Asian inclination towards family based politics, feeds on other social and psychological ingredients. Large numbers who can be described without offence from the public stage as Dugi Duppath (poor and helpless), habitual seeking of patronage and the waiting for handouts mentality are essential for the so called prominent families to predominate.
When the vote was first introduced in early 20 Century, the populace, unsure and uncomfortable in their new role, looked at powerful personalities in the area for guidance and leadership, inevitably turning electorates into family bequests.This family hegemony found legitimacy from many sources, including the top of the political leadership in the form of the Senanayakes and the Bandaranaikes who needed no encouragement to endorse family as a desirable political method.
Family hegemony
Even at the other end of the political spectrum, those professing Marxism here; the anti-thesis of the feudal mind, denouncing the rotten system from every platform have also proved their good family values. Philip Gunawardena is said to be the father of Marxism in this country and founder of the political party the MEP. His son Dinesh, now leads the party, perhaps there is a grandson waiting in the wings to lead the rump MEP.
To his credit, bloodline is not the only thing Gotabhaya Rajapaksa can claim. He was one of the few who thought that the LTTE should be and could be defeated and with the whole hearted blessings of his President brother Mahinda, became the administrative lynchpin of the campaign against the terrorist group. The effort bore fruit. For sure, the psychology of family hegemony was the decisive factor in his effectiveness; no other individual would have had the license and the indulgence of the powers that be to that extent. For the family mindset, that filial connection is open sesame, invalidating or diminishing all else.
None before, empowered the family as grossly as Mahinda Rajapaksa. During his tenure as President, brothers, sons, cousins and in-laws all became part of the Sri Lankan Power structure. Sirima Bandarnaike who is said to have nourished a family tree during her tenure as Prime Minister (1970-77), comes a close second, but in that era there were far less financial goings on while an active opposition and a more independent bureaucracy acted as a restrain on excesses. Most of the Sirima Bandarnaike appointees were independently endowed, and perhaps did not view public office as the main chance, in the manner the desperate relatives of today view such appointments.
Gotabhayas career as a high public officer, if it could be described as such, didnt end with the war. There were more dazzling rewards awaiting him, mainly in the important area of urban development. Funding was available from the World Bank and he got down to work with an independence and power rarely seen in this country. Some of the things accomplished were much needed and even laudable. To give him his dues, in a few years Gotabhaya was able to transform the city of Colombo from a dirty, polluted metropolis to a much cleaner and livable place. A serious attempt was made to discipline and regulate urban living, a drastic attitudinal change being a crying need for Sri Lanka.
Applauding Gotabhaya does not mean to forfeit our critical faculties, especially in respect of the circumstances and the process of his public life. Projects/enterprises of a public nature are carried out in a larger context of competing social priorities, return on investment and accountability. Should a plush airport be built in your own District based on fanciful speculation or should that money be channeled into technical training for the younger generation Do public works contracts go on fair tender or channeled to henchmen and relatives, establishing a sickening cronyism
If the overall perception of the Sri Lankan State structure is that of one rife with corruption, nepotism and cronyism, however laudable individual actions within the structure maybe, they remain part of a rotten system. To gain perspective, Kaddafis Tripoli and Saddam Husseins Baghdad were impressive, well maintained ornaments of those regimes. These Capital cities were also managed by a relative or a henchman of the respective ruler with unusual empowerment, and with access to more than adequate funding. However, the grandiosity of these cities didnt make either Libya or Iraq good countries, or even fast developing economies.
President Mahinda entrusted brother Gotabhaya with other projects too, one being the struggling Apollo (Lanka) Hospital. Here is a task calling for other skills, effective application of modern medical methods, while keeping the organisation in the black, with gain for the stakeholders. As he was wont to, it is said that Gotabhaya brought in army officers to the front office. Apparently they were polite and as efficient as their training made them. But was the experiment a success as the core functions of a private hospital go Are there no limits to family skills
Presently, among the fastest growing economies in the world are exotic places like Djibouti, Cote d lvoire and Ghana. For several years after the ouster of the primitive Taliban, Afghanistan recorded a double digit growth rate. Not that these countries had Gotabhaya or PB Jayasundera clones as top bureaucrats. It is only natural that a post-war country or countries with a very low economic base can record high growth rates. Unfortunately, our country even in the immediate post war years, although recorded a higher growth rate than during the war years, was unable to reach a double-digit or even a more impressive growth rate than a relatively modest 7-8%. It is apparent that the faults besetting us are much deeper than thought of in our common philosophy.
For most of our history, India was the only world we knew. Not that our kings made regular visits across the Palk Straights ;what they came to believe of India came mouth to mouth, several times hearsay, vague magical stories about the massive land across the waters. In nearly everything, spiritual as well as corporeal, India was our reference point.
The wisest sages, righteous rulers, richest merchants and the prettiest damsels came from India.
The world has shrunk incredibly since. We have awareness of many more lands and cultures now. Our legislators pore over laws of other countries, as varied as the UK, South Africa, New Zealand and Hong Kong, referring regularly to unfamiliar ideas; the Latimer principles, Erskine May, conflict of interests, parliamentary decorum. Our doctors do their training indifferent countries, adopting the latest methods of practice as well as approach. In common conversation there are easy references to Lee Kuan Yew, Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Joseph Goebbels and even Hitler; distant and incredibly far flung from the references of the days of the kings.
One of the worst villains of human history
That reference to Adolf Hitler by a Buddhist priest at the Gotabhaya residence was made in this context; a statement only accountable to a palpably weak grasp of that particular history.
The German race is no laughing matter, they are among the best performers in almost every sphere of human endeavour; philosophy, technology, literature, music, sports. For many of our so called elite, a state of the art German car is confirmation that he has arrived.
Even under Hitler, that darkest period of their history, the Germans fought the combined forces of Russia, America, United Kingdom, and France among many others, to a near stand-still. For his aggression against neighbouring nations and the ruthless persecution of Jews and other races, Hitler is considered one of the worst villains of human history. But despite all the dictatorial powers he then commanded, there is no record of Hitler promoting his relatives to high State office.
In that priestly urging to Gotabhaya, things are made almost painfully simple- be a hard ruler and the country will zoom forward like a rocket. Put in another way, if only there was a tough leader, we would surely be the miracle of Asia! A hardworking capable race awaits in a richly endowed land for that one leader, denied to them thus far!
The yahapalanaya exercise has proved in the most disappointing way, the limitations of the human material we have; only distinguished by their big talk and small deeds. When the nation looked to a promised land, they find themselves in a morass of deceits and swindles, a government preoccupied with retaining power, busying themselves in petty deeds to enrich themselves and their families.
Will Gotabhaya be the long awaited deliverer Is his life so gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world -this was a man Or will the nation remain true to its recurring theme of mediocrity, proving that people are differently wired, endowed in their own way And upon facing the reality of inevitable failure, will he unleash his ire on the opposition and the media, accusing them of undermining the regime Hitler thought that his failure was brought about by fiendish Jewish plots. Sri Lanka is too small a pie for the Jews to conspire against. But it has never been too difficult for our leaders to find a scapegoat.

An ideal manual for electronic broadcasters
From the humble beginnings as an Operational Assistant (spinning discs and assisting in the production of programmes) in the studios of Radio Ceylon, V N MathiAlagan gained practical and theoretical aspects of electronic broadcasting, step by step, and rose to the highest position as Deputy Director General of Broadcasting. He is a humble and pleasant man with dedication to his chosen field with immense talents and shone over the airways as the first Tamil newsreader over the first TV station in Lanka the ITN, and later the Rupavahini and proving himself as an efficient administrator in radio broadcasting too.
At the beginning of the present century, he emigrated to Canada and presently work for the TVI Channel (Tamil Vision Inc.) as a Senior Broadcaster.
He was in Lanka last week to launch his worthwhile book of 150 pages titled V N. MathiAlagan- Sollum Seithigal (meaning the NEWS (he) SAYS)
The book is priced at Rs 1000 and printed by Kaanthalaham in Chennai.
SriLankan Radio (then called Radio Ceylon and later SLBC) was and is very popular broadcasting medium in South Asia for its friendliness shown by broadcasters in different tongues-English, Tamil, Sinhala, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada.
But now, sad to say, with the number of private radio TV stations coming up, the focus is on cheap entertainment and catering mostly to the not so culturally inclined younger people. The electronic media is flooded with broadcasters descending to lower standards, thereby insulting the majority of listeners and viewers who expect information and cultivated cultural items. The audience expects that the broadcasters should play a role model to the listening and viewing public. The accepted standards of using the medium of language deteriorated, and young people not properly understanding the nature of radio/tv broadcasting enter the field using clichs and inappropriate ad-libbing, lowered the standards of speech over these channels.
But not all broadcasters are to be blamed for the misuse of broadcasting etiquette.
It is at this point, that this book in Tamil serves the good purpose of educating the etiquette in broadcasting, particularly in radio/tv journalism and the quintessence of good broadcasting.
The author acknowledges the pioneer TV personalities, the late Thevis Guruge, and Sharmini Boyle by using their colour photographs in the back of the front cover and dedicates the book to his wife, who is the woman behind his success. There are 15 chapters plus comments by others in the form of introductions and forewords and wishes.
In his well-written pieces in clear language, he primarily stresses on the language of the spoken word and news presentation. Simple language is rightly recommended by him. He also mentions the collective responsibility of gathering news and rendering them. He also writes about the current methods of News communication in the electronic media. He cautions of how correct pronunciation matters, behind the news, perfect translation into native languages, newsroom studios among other things
Let me list some of the points which may be useful to all broadcasters and newscasters.
Credibility, accuracy, clarity, translating ability, maintaining a balance in presentation, nonpartisan attitude, immediacy, voice -production, avoidance of overcrowding of words and complex sentences, and the like.
He also gives valuable advice and suggestions and hints particularly to those print and electronic journalists using the Tamil language, who are willing to learn.
There is yet another chapter on the importance of correct pronunciation of Tamil and other languages words.
The need for updating and following up of news by journalists, understanding the scenes behind the news, correct translations from one language to the other and many more information clearly explained by the veteran V N MathiAlagan.
It is a superb guide to all journalists who could read Tamil.
In the inside pages, one finds several memorable photographs in which the author has figured prominently. Undoubtedly V N Mathia lagan is a proud product of our country, even though he is a Canadian citizen now.
As a previous regular broadcaster in English and Tamil, I wish to congratulate the author for producing a valuable book.

National Single Window initiative
Implementation plan to Government by end July
The implementation plan of the National Single Window (NSW) blueprint initiative will be presented to the Government by the end of July, 2018, said World Bank, Consultant Dinesha Samaranayake.
Samaranayake disclosed this speaking at the Third Public Private Consultation on Sri Lanka National Single Window, organized by the International Trade Centre (ITC), in collaboration with Sri Lankas National Trade Facilitation Committee, in Colombo yesterday.
In addition to the implementation plan, change management, communications and capacity building plan of the NSW blueprint project will be delivered by the end of this month.
Discussing operational models and current progress of the NSW blueprint project in Sri Lanka, Samaranayake added that the project is being developed under eight task clusters which include governance and operational models, legal and regulatory, service level agreements, revenue model and fee structure, technical and functional architecture, business process re-engineering change management and communications, risk management strategy and implementation and capacity building.
The objective of the NSW is to set up a facility which allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge information and documents with a single entry point to fulfill all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements.
Also, the implementation of the NSW will assist traders to enhance accountability and transparency, while it will also reduce time and costs currently spent in preparing and submitting information and documents to multiple border regulatory agencies. Noting that the NSW initiative requires a lot of consultation, collaboration with different stakeholders, she said that implementation is much more complex process than compiling the blueprint.
There have been a lot of discussions and consultations that have been done for the blueprint process, which took about seven months from November last year.
World Bank expects that once the blueprint is completed, there would be a program setup for acquisition and procurement, which then goes to implementation and operational phase of the NSW.
She also revealed that the World Bank has been requested to support the acquisition phase by the Government, and currently the bank is exploring the possibility of financing this possibly through a project that looks at overall trade and logistics environment.
She also mentioned that world bank has already shared Governance and operational model of NSW blueprint in March, this year while data harmonization,risk management and revenue and fee models of this initiative has also been shared in June, 2018 with relevant authorities.
Speaking at the event, Seetha Senaratne, Additional Secretary of Ministry of Industry and Commerce said, The implementation of the NSW is also an obligation of the country under the WTO trade facilitation agreement which Sri Lanka has already ratified.
The government is also thinking of cross-border facilitation as a national priority.
We expect that the NSW will reduce the time and cost currently spent by traders in preparing and submitting information and documentations to multiple border agencies.
Identifying the crucial role played by the SMEs in Sri Lankan economy, Senaratne said the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has developed an action plan for SME development and NSW also strongly underlines the importance of bringing benefits to the businesses especially SMEs by facilitating trade and reducing the cost of trading cross borders while allowing SMEs to make most of the potential opportunities especially under the EU generalized scheme of preferences.

Indian visually handicapped team clinches T20 series
The Indian visually handicapped team romped home to victory by 10 wickets in the last game to win the five-match T20 series 4-1 against their Sri Lankan counterparts at the BRC grounds Havelock Park yesterday.
The Sri Lankans taking first lease of the wicket made a modest 189 runs helped by two fine knocks by Chandana Deshapriya 80 and Ajith Silva 64. In reply the Indian openers Ajay Kumar Reddy and Sunil Ramesh paid scant respect to the Lankan bowlers and knocked the required runs easily.
Sunil Ramesh scored 107 and skipper Ajay Kumar was unbeaten on 66. Indian skipper Ajay Kumar was named Man of the Match and Sunil Ramesh received the Man of the Series award. The awards were presented by Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
I was told that Sri Lanka had beaten India in the ODI series. Its a huge achievement as far as the Sri Lankan team is concerned and I like to congratulate the winners, said Ranatunga. I hope these bilateral series will help both teams to improve and go from strength to strength.
The unbeaten Indian team was unbeaten for a record six consecutive years and their winning ODI streak was ended by Sri Lanka when they won the first part of the bilateral series recording a memorable 2-1 win over the world.

A key witness in the controversial RADA case yesterday told the Colombo High Court that they were asked to move out of the Mavil Aru area by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa since they were negotiating with Emil Kanthan, the LTTEer.
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said he and a group including Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera, Akmeemana Dayaratne Thera who reached the Mavil Aru area to open the Mavil Aru anicut sluice gate from the clutches of LTTE were told to move out of the area by the then President and Defence Secretary.
Warnasinghe, the first witness in the case revealed these facts when the case filed against former MP Tiran Alles and three others in connection with a Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006 was taken up for trial yesterday.
At that time, JHU leader Champika Ranawaka had been summoned to Temple Trees by former President Rajapaksa.Ranawaka was asked to call back the group led by Rathana Thera to Colombo from Mavil Aru area, Warnasinghe said. He told Court that Minister Champika Ranawaka had been informed by former President that they were negotiating the Mavil Aru issue with a LTTE leader called Emil Kanthan.
We were ordered to leave the Mavil Aru area by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.We were summoned to the Kallaru army camp and asked to leave the area, Warnasinghe told court. Warnasinghe said Rs.200 million had been given to the LTTE through Emil Kanthan on the pretext of constructing houses in the Northern and Eastern provinces. It is a grave crime. Public Funds had been given to terrorists who subsequently utilised them to attack us. Cabinet approval has not been obtained for this so called housing project. Tiran Alles functioned as the head of this RADA organization, the witness further added.
The witness said he made a complaint with Police Headquarters representing the Anti-Corruption Front in this regard.
Witness Nishantha Warnasinghe was testifying before Colombo High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi and evidence was led by Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris. The first witness will be cross-examined on August 2. The Attorney General had filed indictments against four accused-former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with controversial RADA fraud. The High Court had allowed the Attorney General to proceed controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, the second accused in the case.
The Attorney General had listed several witnesses including former Tresury Secretary P.B. Jayasundara, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe and several others as witnesses in the case. Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris with State Counsel Udara Karunatilleke appeared for the Attorney General.

## Title: K-WAVE HITS SRI LANKA
## Supertitle:

K-WAVE HITS SRI LANKA
Colombo is 5,841 kilometres from Seoul, the dazzling, high-tech capital of Korea, where K-Pop started, but you wouldnt have known it at Sri Lankas K-Pop World Festival. The two cities seemed inextricably close as Sri Lankans and Koreans alike crowded into the auditorium of Bishops College for a celebration of the high-energy genre that brought Korean culture to the global mainstream.
Performances choreographed to power anthems from girl group BLACKPINK prompted deafening screams from the crowd and tenderly sung Korean ballads brought smiles to the faces of diplomats and businessmen. It was one of over 80 K-Pop festivals to be held around the world, leading up to the main event in Seoul in August, where 20 of the winners from their own countries will compete for the world title.
An energetic display of Sri Lankan-South Korean relations, the Korean Embassys festival was a far cry from the dry politics that normally characterize international affairs. The hosts spoke in a mix of Korean and Sinhala and swapped the traditional clothing of each others country. The Sri Lankan host wore a hanbok and the Korean host dawned a sari for the festivities. Competitors sported hallyu inspired attire and the audience sang along excitedly to K-Pop songs they evidently knew by heart.
Minji Kim, Director of Culture for the Korean Embassy, said she believes Korea and Sri Lanka have a lot in common, citing a deep appreciation for traditional culture in particular. But even with this explanation, when Kim moved to Sri Lanka a year ago, she hadnt anticipated the K-Wave to have hit an island so far from her homeland.
I was really surprised because there are many Sri Lankans who love K-pop and can sing K-pop better than Koreans, she said after the event.
But when Kim looked a little closer, she started to understand how the phenomenon had spread. She says most Sri Lankans find out about K-Pop on the internet, by searching on Youtube, visiting Facebook pages, or finding Instagram profiles to learn more about Korean stars.
When we do our Facebook page, we can feel that there are many Sri Lankans who want to enjoy the Korean culture, Korean songs and Korean foods, she noted.
WHAT MAKES A WINNING K-POP PERFORMANCE
When asked what the judges were scoring for at the festival, Kim explained passion is essential to Korean culture. When you see and hear the K-pop singers sing and dancing, you can feel the passion. Passion is always in our Koreans, she said. A through-line of Korean culture, passion unites modern K-pop with the K-dramas and folk dances of centuries past.
World-famous boy group, BTS echoes her sentiment, lyrics to their song, Rap Monster, translate to, Are you a boy Girl I dont carepassion is the key, a hot heart is your ID.
And passion was certainly a hallmark of the Sri Lankans performing at the festival.
Moon Nicky, a 23-year-old Sri Lankan who participated in the K-Pop World Festival described her love of K-pop as an addiction.
I was more into hip-hop dancing before I got to know about K-Pop. After I was addicted to K-Pop, I followed their dancing style,  she added, its very cool and unique.
Moon Nicky discovered K-Pop when she was searching Google for cool hairstyles. She remembers seeing a photo of Kim Jaejoong, a member of the Korean pop band, TVXQ. One click led to another, and soon she found herself deep down the rabbit-hole of Korean culture on the web.
It is no coincidence that Moon Nicky stumbled upon K-Pop on a quest for trendy hairstyles. Visual aesthetics, expressed through carefully curated costumes and theatrical performances, are as essential to K-Pop as the music itself. The best K-pop performers are the Renaissance Men of modern culture: excelling at dancing and singing, while also maintaining a visually captivating aesthetic style. Many are even enrolled in acting classes as children, years before their debut.
At the K-Pop World festival, Sri Lankans sported K-wave inspired clothing. The winning group, Meraki, wore whats sometimes called bubblegum gothic style-- striped knee socks with bright pink and black skirts. Other groups leaned more towards the grungy side of K-pop-- baggy pants, ripped clothing, and combat boots were essentials. Some female performers went as far as to cut their hair into the iconic Korean short-hair and bangs style.
Nicky Moons team, called Rising Stars, modelled their costumes after edgy girl group SONAMOO, specifically the music video for Deja Vu, where the group wears cargo pants and dances through the halls of a dark warehouse.
Moon said her favourite thing about K-Pop is watching music videos, which often have hidden meanings. Sometimes watching a K-Pop music video is like a solving a puzzle, she said.
One need look no further than BTSs 2016 hit, Blood, Sweat & Tears, which was screened at the festival, to understand what she means. The video follows the boy group through an art museum-- one performer stands before Michelangelos Pieta and another stare into sprawling Renaissance canvases. Its cryptic, eery, and nearly academic in its use of symbolism.
THE K-WAVE LIVES ONLINE
Despite the references to the past, this genre is quintessentially modern, particularly its dissemination. When asked how they discovered K-Pop, fan after fan gave the same answer: the internet.
K-pop cannot be envisioned without the internet, said John Lie, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley and author of K-Pop: Popular Music, Cultural Amnesia, and Economic Innovation in South Korea, its export strategy relies on social media and the internet, especially YouTube.
According to Lie, K-Pop entrepreneurs were trailblazers in the internet era.
Rather than using radio stations or concert tours, it was the first pop-music genre to use the internet almost exclusively to promote it. In turn, K-Pop entrepreneurs have sought to generate fan enthusiasm etc. by relying on Internet-based fan groups/communities, he said.
Induni, a 23-year-old psychology student from just outside of Colombo, runs one of those internet-based fan groups, a blog called KPop in SL. She discovered K-Pop before it was cool when it was such a nice interest that all of the fans knew each other.
It was totally alien to Sri Lanka, she said, so K-pop fans were kind of brave to stand out of the crowd.
Back in 2008, nearly ten years before the Korean boy group BTS would top international charts, Induni was poking around the internet, watching K-dramas when the addictive music genre caught her attention. She soon found herself in a K-Pop click hole, discovering more music and meeting people to share it with.
When I got into K-pop I felt like a loner because no one was sharing the same taste in music. Then I came across few people through international sites, and I spoke with them, she said.
Swept up in the thought-provoking lyrics, the lively music, and the flourishing international community, Induni soon realized she couldnt balance school with her new hobby. She actually had to deactivate her Facebook in the interest of her schoolwork.
Unfortunately, I found myself spending so much time on K-Pop without doing my studies, she said.
Indunis story is not so uncommon, especially now that K-pop has reached the mainstream. An interest in K-pop can become all-consuming.
It can build your social life, inform your studies, and fill your free time. Induni remembers learning the Korean language and trying out Korean cooking when she first discovered K-Pop.
It doesnt help that internet offers an endless stream of information to satisfy your every curiosity. Youtube interviews, Instagram posts, and endless feed of #kpop Tweets, make the K-pop stars feel close, even on an island where none of them has ever performed.
Our goal is to have a K-Pop concert or fan signing here, said Gayathri, a 23-year-old from Kegalle, who is known to K-Pop fans as Lejong. She runs the Facebook page, K-Pop Fans in SL, as well as K-Pop chat groups on Whatsapp and Korean messaging platform, Kekeo.
Originally, Lejong said, it was hard to find other fans, but after she started the Facebook group, she was able to find K-Pop fans in every part of Sri Lanka. We wanted to prove that there are enough fans here [for a concert], she said of her motivation to start the group.
With the arrival of the Korean Embassys K-Pop World Festival in 2015, Sri Lankas K-Pop fans have certainly been making progress. Over 1,400 people have signed the petition on change.org entitled, Bring Kpop Idols to Sri Lanka. Thats nearly twice the number of Korean people in all of Sri Lanka, which was a mere 748 in 2013.
AN UNEXPECTED COMMUNITY
But even without K-Pop stars making an appearance in Sri Lanka, the fan-base remains strong as ever and has connected people of Korean and Sri Lankan descent all over the island. What started, for many, as an online escapade through videos and blog posts from Korea, has become a robust, real-world community in Sri Lanka.
Most of the K-Pop fans Ive ever met, Ive met them through social media. Then after some time, we even organised K-Pop fan gatherings and other events to get to know each other, said Induni.
Nicky Moon also made many of her closest friends through K-Pop. She met many on Google plus and connected with them later in person.
But these friendships are different from friends youd make through say, art or yoga classes. K-Pop becomes an integral part of many fans identities.
When Lejong introduced herself, I first thought she was from Korea but learned her nickname comes from a combination of her favourite K-Pop stars names, Shinee Jonghyun and Vixx Leo.
Most fans have nicknames from their favourite idol name, the native Sri Lankan explained, adding that Lejong is the name K-Pop fans know her as.
Similarly, Moon Nicky took her name from K-Pop artist, Moon Jongup. Induni said Koreans call her Min Ju, the K-Pop community knows her as Peaches Kim, but feel free to use any [name] as needed, she reassured me.
With the ability to customize names on Facebook and Twitter, K-Pop fans identities are solidified digitally. In the online world of K-Pop, these self-chosen names can easily take precedence over given names.
K-POPS FUTURE IN SRI LANKA
Anthems like DUDUDUU and As if Its Your Last echoed through Colombo 7 on the evening of the K-Pop World Festival, and the only thing louder than the powerful bass drops were the earth-shattering screams of the audience.
For now, while K-Pop fans make real-world friendships, it looks like K-Pops biggest stars will remain on the internet, only showing their faces through the pixels of computer screens. But that could change.
When asked if K-pop stars will come to Sri Lanka in the future, Director of Culture, Minji Kim looked around the crowded auditorium after the show and said, I think they have to.

Kotelawalas and Katuwawale
Presenting the Kotelawala lineage and history which dates back to 14th Centurys Dambadeniya era of King Parakramabahu-IV, supported with a family-tree and Genealogy chart was Malanie Kotalawala, a much loved former teacher and a grandniece of the late Ellen Kotalawala, nee Artigalle, who vehemently refuted the young John and Ellen couples covert story that we explicitly attributed to village Grapevine.
The amazing conversation writer is about to relate took place both from the human voice in which the story was told and its relationship to the events in the series as well as from the point of view of history, was so extraordinary. The search of origins and family history serves several purposes; the aspiration to carve out a position for the family in the historical portrait, a sense of duty to conserve the past for future generations, and a wisdom of self-assurance in precise storytelling.
While Ellen was the eldest daughter of Geromis Artygalle, the proprietary planter and Plumbago tycoon; John was the Police officer son of Don Aaron Kotalawale and Carolina Artygalle.
When the writer sought an appointment to collect valuable first hand information based on more reliable family grapevine, in response to her displeasures intimated to our Editor over the findings in our article dated 11th instant, the courteous lady even offered to accompany the writer to their ancestral village of Kotalawalas in Undugoda, Bandaragama where the name originated circa 17th Century. It was her great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Doloswala Wickremasinghe, Mukaveti of Sabaragamuwa [as per chart]. who detected parts of an ancient golden pinnacle (kotha) from a dagoba (chaitya) buried under the earth while digging in the premises for some purpose. Kotha-leva-wala (hole where the pinnacle was laid) became Kotalawala; hence the adoption of family name.
John Snr's wife, Ellen Artygalle, a gracious lady
The sumptuous breakfast, the host had laid with traditional dishes at her Katuwawala home reminds one of her uncle Lionels [Sir John] famous Kandawala egg-hopper breakfast meetings; it was a pleasant surprise that perfectly matched the vegetarians appetite.
She expressed her annoyance at the saga appeared in our article as implicating an insinuation of encouragement by the young lady on her fianc John Kotalawala [Snr] to sneak into Artygalle Walawwas sleeping spaces at odd hours as stated therein. Allen aachchi was a highly respected elder among family circles and a virtuous lady who faced many challenges with courage and determination after the untimely demise of her husband though she converted to Christianity, she continued to help building Temples in Kolomunne with lavish donationscontinued Ms Kotalawale demonstrating her natural pleasant disposition.
She believed it was likely to harm the ladys reputation: isnt it unethical to make such uncomplimentary remark on a lady who is no more and unable to defend herself, the well-mannered lady expressed her emotions in the company of two other members of the Kotalawala kinfolk who graced the occasion on her invitation.
She also provided some insights on the adoption of name Kotalawala by her ancestors, an interesting saga which counters the popular version as we highlighted in Contemporary Politics, as quoted by quite a few writers in the past.
She believes both statements as sentimental figments of imagination of the old village folk that the writer approached few years ago while collecting data for resolving uncertainty in another project.
A black and white Pittu (portions of kurakkan and rice flour arranged alternatively in a creative pattern) with a variety of dishes, some first-time rare sweet meats and coffee enjoyed by the writer and his wife at her residence accorded a fitting tribute to the guests that coincided with their 45th wedding anniversary.
The land close to RMV complex covering a few acres was part of their family property situated on either side of the recently widened Horana-Colombo road. A member of the family living on the opposite side described the sprawling surroundings of the Ancient Colombo-Ratnapura Road which was used by Muhandiram D C Kotalawala who moved to Uva in early 19th Century for setting up a fleet of double bullock carts to transport produce from Badullas rural areas to Colombo port through the jungle maze and personally managed the network which was trailed by robbers and bandits. The vast lands in Katuwawala owned by Kotalawalas was used as Gava galas (resting place for bulls and carters where the changeover of animals took place), and also for growing grass for the bulls.
I was so keen to get Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne, my cousin, whose mother is a Kotalawale and in whose possession are those valuable documents, and is quite thorough with family ancestry, to join us tooeven last evening I spoke to him; unfortunately, on prior arrangement he had left for Kandy, she lamented. Built up around a core family group of Kotalaa-tigalle were a multitude of inter-marriages, the first being father of John [Snr], Aaron marrying Carolina Artygalle, and the next perhaps our protagonist followed by another sixteen inter-marriages! Indeed a unique phenomenon recorded in the family chronicles.
Unlike Montagues and the Capulets of Verona, the Kotalawales and Artygalles of Madapatha were not feuding families. In her affair, Juliet displays greater maturity, mainly in instances of excitement. She makes the transition from a guiltless youngster to responsible adult; Shakespeare created a strong-willed spirited Julietin her relationship with Romeo, Juliet is loving, witty, loyal, and strong. It was on the above context that we likened the young Ellen to a Juliet, and not backed by any contemptuous motives. Writer sincerely and profusely thanks the lady and two of her relatives.

Murder and sensation 112 years ago
Death of Dixon Artygalle and birth of Uncle-Nephew Politics: Scandalous murder; and the sesational trial 112 years ago is the true story of emergence of Senanayakes, Kotalawalas and Jayewardenes in Sri Lankan Politics, the source that financed their activities, and also the concealed hostility, enmity and rivalry for pre-eminence among the three families that formed the upper crust of the United National Party hierarchy for many decades that commenced during the time of this saga and reached its peak in 1952, enduring up to the end of last century.
After the not so harmonious wedding ceremony of the eldest daughter, the Artygalles concern for the future of the other two girls became greater than before, prompting them to find two educated grooms from affluent families-a few years after Mudaliar passed away leaving two unmarried girls and the only son, for widow Mrs Peternella Artigalle, nee Abeykoon to accept proposals brought in by the marriage brokers for her two younger daughters.
Second in the family Leena married Col. T.G. Jayewardene, an engineer who had four lawyer siblings; including Supreme court Judge E.W (JR Jayewardenes father); the third sister Ellen to Barrister F R Senanayake, MMC, Diplomat and older brother of D S Senanayake. Kumari Jayawardena-[Nobodies to Somebodies]
Each of the second and third daughters, Leena and Ellen received 2,861 and 3,027 acres respectively of cultivated land, out of tea, rubber and coconut estates, plus a share of graphite mines, and Rs 200,000 in cash, [more than a century ago] as dowry[Ref.Nobodies to Somebodies: Kumari Jayawardena-2007- pp 288] much more than the eldest girl Alice who married Kotalawala; an inequitable and unpardonable discrimination that brew hatred and jealousy in the mind of John. The youngest in the family Francis Dixon was yet a minor attending school at Wesley College Pettah, who won the accolades of its Head-master P C Dias.

Lanka worlds first in breastfeeding: UNICEF
Sri Lanka is the first in the world in breastfeeding according to indicators. The population statistics re-confirmed this status, UNICEF Health and Nutrition Officer Dr. Dhammika Rowel said.
She was addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday. She said breastfed infants develop confidence and their IQ level increases to over 10 points. A childs brain grows during the first three years in his or her life and breast milk helps them to become confident, energetic and healthy adults.
Breastfeeding working mothers should be given daycare facilities by state and private institutions, she added.
Health Promotion Bureau Director Dr. Paba Palihawadana said breast milk increases immunity of infants while protecting the mother from breast and ovarian cancers. Breast milk reduces the risk of developing Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) when infants become adults. All infants should be breastfed during the first six months without any other liquid or food. Dr. Palihawadana said breast milk is the best food that can be given to an infant during traveling, when facing a natural disaster and when the mother or child falls sick.
Consultant Gynecologist Dr. U.D.P. Rathnasiri said breastfeeding reduces the risk of developing Postpartum Depression (PPD) in mothers. If mothers do not breastfeed, it can lead to various complications when the milk is collected in the breasts. Breastfeeding can also cut down the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in mothers.

Molinari rises to sixth in world rankings, Tiger returns to top 50
Paris, Monday: Newly-crowned British Open champion Francesco Molinari climbed to a career-high world ranking of sixth on Monday, as 14-time major winner Tiger Woods edged back into the top 50.
Molinari became the first Italian in history to win one of golf's four majors on Sunday with a flawless final-round 69 at Carnoustie, and has jumped nine places in the rankings and now tops the European Ryder Cup points list.
The 35-year-old started 2018 outside the top 20, but his strong recent form had already produced wins in the European PGA Championship and the Quicken Loans National.
Woods, who has struggled with back injuries, was outside the world's top 1,000 before his latest comeback late last year, but leapt 21 spots to 50th courtesy of finishing tied for sixth behind the Molinari.
The American star needed to break the top 50 in order to qualify for the last-ever WGC Bridgestone Invitational event to be held at Firestone in Ohio next month -- a tournament he has won eight times.
The 42-year-old just about managed that thanks to late dropped shots from Jordan Spieth in Scotland, bumping him up from a tie for seventh which would have seen him miss out.
But that will only be a small consolation for Woods after leading 10 holes into his final round before slipping away to fail in his bid to claim a first major title for over 10 years.
Dustin Johnson remains at the top of the rankings, although Englishman Justin Rose is the new world number two after finishing in a four-way tie for second at the Open to leapfrog Justin Thomas.
World top 20
1. Dustin Johnson (USA) 9.45 average pts, 2. Justin Rose (ENG) 8.87 (+1), 3. Justin Thomas (USA) 8.31 (-1), 4. Brooks Koepka (USA) 7.83, 5. Jon Rahm (ESP) 7.37, 6.

More electric fences to battle jumbo invasion
Around 800 km of electric fences in addition to the present 500 km will be erected soon in the Anuradhapura District since wild elephants had destroyed nearly 150 villages close to jungle belt in the Nochchiyagama, Thalawa, Thirappane, Kahatagasdigiliya, Horowpothana, Padaviya, Palugaswewa, Palagala and Mahawilachchiya Divisional secretariat divisions.
The President has instructed the Wildlife Conservation Minister to erect additional fences of about 2,500 km very soon giving priority to remote areas more vulnerable to the wild elephants invasion.
Sources said the ministry has allocated about Rs. 6000 m for the project. More funds will be granted by the Treasury and Rs 600,000 will cost to construct one km of an electric fence.
The Civil Security Department will released 1,800 of its employees to work at the Wildlife Conservation Department and another 1,500 will be released to maintain and repair the electrified fences. Weta Samithi, (Fences Societies) will be set up to assist them in this regard.
Wildlife Conservation Minister Sarath Fonseka said he would take step to resolve the conflict very soon. He said the shortage of crackers would be resolved and more staff will be given to the Department.
Modern equipment including advanced weapons, and adequate transport facilities would be provided and public participation in the campaign would be encouraged, the Minister said.

Mathews returns to lead after injury
No place in ODI squad for suspended Chandimal, Gunathilaka
Two of Sri Lankas suspended cricketers Dinesh Chandimal and Danushka Gunathilaka were left out from the 15-man squad picked to play South Africa in a five-match one-day international series starting at Dambulla on Sunday.
At the same time injury prone Angelo Mathews returns to lead Sri Lanka after missing out on both ODIs and T20Is less than two weeks after being reinstated as his countrys limited overs captain in January this year.
Gunathilaka, a left-handed opener was suspended on Sunday by Sri Lanka Cricket on a charge of misconduct where he had broken curfew rules and had a male friend in his team hotel room during the second Test against South Africa at the SSC.
SLC has suspended him from all international cricket pending an inquiry.
Gunathilakas suspension is a blow to Sri Lanka as he was the side's second highest-scoring batsman with 161 runs in the 2-0 Test series whitewash of South Africa. In the second Test played at his home ground SSC, Gunathilaka made twin fifties and shared in opening stands of 116 and 91 with Dimuth Karunaratne who has been named as a standby.
Chandimal, who led Sri Lanka in Mathews absence is currently serving a four-match ODI ban for conduct contrary to the spirit of the game for refusing to take his team onto the field during the first session of play in the second Test against West Indies at St Lucias last month..
Also missing from the line up since the last ODI series in Bangladesh in January are fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera and all-rounder Asela Gunaratne, who had picked up injuries during the ODI series in Bangladesh, fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep, rookie paceman Shehan Madushanka, and leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga.
Included in their places are medium-pacer Kasun Rajitha who made his Test debut in the West Indies last month and could be a front-runner to make his ODI debut, uncapped left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya, and all-rounders Shehan Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanaka. Shehan Jayasuriya is expected to take Gunathilakas place in the line-up.
Sri Lanka have not won a bilateral ODI series since 2016 when they beat Ireland 2-0 (away) and West Indies 3-0 in 2015 (home) which speaks a lot for their current ODI ranking at eighth. South Africa won the last ODI series played in Sri Lanka in 2014 by 2-1.

SL-SA TEST series reviewSteve Smiths Aussies suffered same fate as no. 1 side
Now No. 2 ranked Proteas falls to spin
Like Steve Smiths Australians two years ago, the South African team led by Faf du Plessis arrived in Sri Lanka as the no. 2 ranked Test team in the world with high hopes of keeping intact their new found away record. But to their dismay after the two Tests which they lost rather comprehensively by margins of 278 runs and 199 runs well inside four days they found that they were not the competitive side they thought they were, especially on dry spinning tracks of the subcontinent.
A 2-0 series whitewash is too much to stomach for no. 2 ranked South African team skipper Faf du Plessis.  AFP
The South African batsmen brought up largely on pitches that had pace were exposed to the hilt against high class spin on pitches they hardly encounter at home. Their techniques to play against spin was brought into question in the series and left them with enough to think about and work on before they tour India next year.
Smiths team ranked no. 1 suffered the same fate as the South Africans, being whitewashed 3-0 in the Tests with their batsmen unable to come to terms with turning pitches and the discipline with which the Lankan spinners, headed by spin master Rangana Herath posed.
South Africa came to Sri Lanka with high hopes that their fast bowling unit comprising Rabada, Steyn, Philander and Ngidi would be able to run through the Lankan batting even on dry tracks using reverse swing as their main weapon. But to their disappointment they were unable to do that and the Lankan batters were able to counter them quite successfully. Most disappointed would have been Dale Steyn who managed only two wickets that left him still one short of becoming South Africas leading wicket-taker in Tests. The absence of reverse swing had a big effect on his bowling as it was the one that contributed largely to his last visit to Sri Lanka in 2014 when he captured 13 wickets (avg 17.46) in two Tests and played a decisive role in his countrys 1-0 series win.
DIMUTH CORNERSTONE
Opener Dimuth Karunaratne was the cornerstone of the Lankan batting. He alone stood head and shoulders above everyone else getting past fifty in each of his four innings in the series to total a handsome 356 runs and average over a hundred.
With Karunaratne solid at one end Sri Lanka were able to build on partnerships which the South Africans failed to do with their batting. Having missed the series in the Caribbean due to a fractured finger and using the Sri Lanka A tour to Bangladesh to play himself into form, Karunaratne was at the peak of his form when the South African series started and he immediately made an impact in the first Test at Galle with a monumental knock of 158 not out that simply knocked the fight out of the Proteas. He maintained that form throughout the series by adding three consecutive fifties to that score to deservedly win the Man of the Series award.
The South Africans could not find a single batsman good enough to combat the Lankan spin threat and hold up one end like Karunaratne and they collapsed to paltry totals of 126, 73 and 124. Where they would have erred was in trying to stick to their three-man pace attack even in unhelpful pitches instead of balancing the side with two spinners. At Galle they played two spinners plus three fast bowlers and weakened their batting and at the SSC they decided to go with only one spinner and strengthened the batting. That they clearly lacked another spinner at the SSC was proved by left-armer Keshav Maharaj who single-handedly ran through the Lankan batting taking nine wickets in the first innings and a match bag of 12.
Theunis de Bruyn did not disappoint his selection and showed the rest of his teammates what they have been missing by taking on the Lankan spinners to score his maiden Test hundred and with Temba Bavuma who scored a half century put on the only century partnership for South Africa in the series for the sixth wicket. Thanks to their liaison South Africa were able to come up with a decent total  290 in comparison to their previous three efforts. Although it was a vain attempt, their batting would have given them confidence for the upcoming five-match ODI series that starts at Dambulla on Sunday.
WORST TEAM AGAINST SPIN
Many teams have toured Sri Lanka including South Africa in the past but although they lost series they have never displayed such poor quality batting against spin than Du Plessis side. The techniques they adopted to tackle spin was blatantly exposed and made the Lankan spinners look as if they were unplayable on any surface.
Sri Lanka no doubt possess a spin combination as good as any in the world with Herath being the kingpin of the attack supported by the off breaks of Dilruwan Perera, the mystery spin of Akila Dananjaya who bowls four varieties and the left-arm chinaman deliveries of Lakshan Sandakan. This quartet wrought havoc with the Proteas batting accounting for 37 of the 40 wickets to fall in the series.
It was a series where spin dominated over pace and Suranga Lakmal the stand-in captain bowled just 6.3 overs in the entire series. He was the only paceman picked for the two Tests and he hardly handled the new ball because throughout the series Sri Lanka opened the bowling with their spinners.
The stranglehold the Lankan spinners had on the South African batsmen didnt as much test their batting for apart from Karunaratnes contribution there was hardly anything substantial from the rest. Danushka Gunathilaka, Karunaratnes opening partner made twin fifties on his home ground at SSC and Angelo Mathews and Dhananjaya de Silva made a half century apiece. Apart from them Kusal Mendis, Roshen Silva and Niroshan Dickwella hardly made an impact with the bat.
The fact remains that Sri Lanka without the services of their captain Dinesh Chandimal and coach Chandika Hathurusingha have won their last three Test matches  one against West Indies and two against South Africa. Sri Lankas series win over second ranked South Africa has brought them level on ratings with England on 97 although they remain in sixth position. England are Sri Lankas next opponents in November and the three-Test series will be eagerly awaited.
The tour in fact brought into question the rationality of visiting sides playing warm-up matches ahead of a Test series and whether it serves any purpose at all. As Dean Elgar the South African opener pointed out the pitch they got for their two-day game was a flat surface and the ball hardly spun compared to the ones they got for the Test series. It was vice-versa when Sri Lanka toured South Africa in 2016/17 where they were provided with slow turners for the practice match in comparison to the fast bouncy tracks they encountered in the Test series.
