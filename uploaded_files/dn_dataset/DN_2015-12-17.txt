Afghan opium cultivation drops for first time in six years
AFGHANISTAN: Afghanistan saw a drop in opium cultivation this year for the first time since 2009, a United Nations report said, citing dry weather conditions as a key reason for the decline.
Despite a decade of costly US and international counter-narcotics programmes, poppy farming has boomed in southern and western regions, which include the most volatile parts of the country where the Taliban insurgency is strongest.
The total area under cultivation was 183,000 hectares (452,203 acres) in 2015, a 19 percent decrease from last year, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
The southern province of Helmand, however, retained its title as leader in growth of opium, which is used to produce highly addictive heroin.
The agency's head in Afghanistan Andrey Avetisyan told AFP that the Taliban hotbed could alone meet the entire global demand in poppies.
The lack (of) sufficient water for irrigation... affected the decision of some farmers not to cultivate poppy, said the report, which was released last week. It also cited a substantial increase in eradication as a factor, though experts warned that did not play a dominant role.
The short answer (to the decrease) is crop failure and certainly not the counter-narcotics efforts, said William Byrd, an economist with the United States Institute of Peace think tank.
Lower levels of cultivation meant there was a 48 percent decrease in total opium production this year.
Avetisyan said the figures should be handled carefully due to the UNODC's refinement of its methodology since last year.
We now compare two sources of information on the ground and from space with satellites and we analyse it, he said, asserting that accuracy levels had improved.
Poppy farmers in Afghanistan, the world's leading producer of opium, are often taxed by the Taliban, who use the cash to help fund their insurgency against government and NATO forces.
International donors have splurged billions of dollars on counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan over the past decade.

Budget amendments to have Rs. 7 billion impact on govt. revenue
The amendments proposed to the Budget 2016 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will result in a Rs 7 billion impact on the government revenue, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament.
The minister said he would brief the House as to how this income would be recovered when the Budget debate concludes on December 19. The minister was responding to a supplementary question by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena.
The minister noted the allocations for development purposes or relief measures would not be curtailed to facilitate additional allocations required for the proposed amendments.
"The Budget is not something engraved on stone. The Prime Minister was was flexible enough to incorporate the proposals of various segments in society. Various proposals are put forward at the Committee Stage of the Budget and we need to consider them. Even if you make constructive proposals that benefit the country which are not extreme, we are ready to accommodate them as well" he replied.
The minister said the Prime Minister had made four proposals, while President Maithripala Sirisena made a proposal with regard to excise tax.
"The President's proposal actually increases the revenue by Rs 250 million. If the GMOA insists on the car permit, we will have to provide for it from the allocation made to the Health Ministry," he said.
MP Gunawardena asked the minister to submit a report to Parliament clarifying how the Government is going to revise the budgetary allocations to accommodate the amendments proposed by the Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, the Finance Minister replying to another supplementary question by MP Gunawardena stated the Government is not directed by the IMF policy, but, it follows what it thinks is best for the people and the country.
"At the same time, we must be sensitive to external threats like ISIS too. I am confident that dollars will flow in to the country after the Budget," he said.
"There is no issue with the balance of payment. The issue is with the trade deficit. To control it, we need to take effective steps to reduce imports and increase exports," he added.

Climate pact like 'Health Insurance Policy for planet' - Ban
UN: Terming the Paris climate change deal as "a health insurance policy for the planet", United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that it is for the first time that every nation in the world has pledged to curb emissions to address climate change.
"The countries of the world have made a historic choice," Ban told reporters yesterday on his return from the COP21 conference in Paris, as he called on governments to put their pledges into action.
"The Paris Agreement is a victory for people, for the common good, and for multilateralism. It is a health insurance policy for the planet," Mr Ban said.
Describing the climate agreement as the most significant action in years to uphold the UN Charter mandate to "save succeeding generations", Ban said nations have unanimously decided to work as one to rise to the defining challenge of current times.
"For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and act internationally and domestically to address climate change," he said.
The 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Saturday adopted the Paris Agreement after two weeks of intensive negotiations at the summit.
The accord covers all crucial areas identified as essential for a landmark conclusion: mitigation - reducing emissions fast enough to achieve the temperature goal; a transparency system and global stock-take - accounting for climate action; adaptation and support - including finance, for nations to build clean, resilient futures.
Ban said that it embodies a successful new approach to global cooperation on climate change, with countries acknowledging that their national interest is best served by acting for the common good by transforming the global economy to low-emission, climate-resilient growth.
"It marks a decisive turning point in the global quest for a safer, more sustainable and prosperous future," he stressed. "It will save lives, improve human well-being and promote more peaceful, stable societies."
He highlighted the agreement as one of his top priorities since the day he became UN Secretary-General.
"For nine years, I have spoken repeatedly with nearly every world leader about how the growing human imprint on the planet threatens our lives, our economies, our security and our survival.
I have mobilised business and engaged civil society. I have never lost faith that the international community could rise to the climate challenge. "Now I count on Governments, and all sectors of society, to turn these commitments into urgent, decisive action," he added. - PTI

Disgruntled Siberian city wants Barsik the cat as mayor
RUSSIA: Fed up with corruption and nepotism among local officials, residents of a far-flung Siberian city are yearning for a more feline kind of political representation.
Barsik the cat has been propelled to stardom after finishing far ahead of his human rivals for the post of mayor of Barnaul in an unofficial poll run by a popular regional social media page.
Political apathy and resentment over corruption scandals at city hall helped the 18-month-old Scottish Fold claw nearly 91 percent of more than 5,400 votes cast by Tuesday.
The poll, launched earlier this month by the Altai Online page on Russian social network Vk, has become the talk of the town in the city of 700,000 people located some 3,600 kilometres (2,250 miles) east of Moscow.
"People don't know who to trust anymore," local pensioner Yevgeny Kuznetsov told AFP, explaining Barsik's popularity. "They have come to the conclusion that they can't trust the authorities."
Barnaul, a city close to the picturesque Altai mountains, has been rocked by a series of high-profile corruption cases.
A commission made up of the city council and regional governor Alexander Karlin will convene next week to appoint a new city administrator after the incumbent, Igor Savintsev, quit in August following abuse of power allegations.
Savintsev, who ran the city from 2010 until his resignation, is accused of selling off municipally-owned land to organisations affiliated with family members, costing the city more than 11 million rubles ($157,000, 144,000 euros).
His son Maxim is meanwhile awaiting trial on fraud and embezzlement charges after having fled to Thailand, according to local media reports.
"Residents doubt their competence and professionalism. And they have a right to do so," said one of the poll's administrators, who goes by the pseudonym "Altai Farmer" as he fears his surveys could have repercussions on his offline life. - AFP

Doping charges against Kusal Janith doubtful - Sports Minister
Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara said in Parliament yesterday, that there was doubt as to whether the doping charges against Sri Lankan cricketer Kusal Janith were a part of a conspiracy to oust him ahead of the 20/20 Cricket Tournament to be held in India next year. The minister was responding to a question for oral answer raised by UNP MP Lucky Jayawardana, said the Sports Ministry is standing with him on this issue.
We will be intervening on his behalf by providing legal support and as well as other facilities. After being charged with the use of steroid, arrangements have been made to test the second sample of his blood. President Maithripala Sirisena had also instructed that necessary steps be taken on behalf of Kusal Janith.
There is nothing we could do with Kusal Janith if proven guilty, but we are working on the assumption that he is innocent.
The minister however said that stern action would be taken against players if they were found guilty of using steroids.
National Freedom Front maintained by Housing Ministry - Nalin Bandara

He also challenged NFF MP Wimal Weerawansa to speak for at least five minutes about what he had done to the housing sector.
During his period what he only did was building houses for his relatives, maintaining his party the NFF and robbing ministry funds, the MP said.
Some NFF MPs were able to be elected to Parliament only due the SLFP. The NFF could not survive without the support of the SLFP.
Ratnapura district lacks drinking water - Labour Minister
Labour and Trade Unions Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne told Parliament yesterday, that people in the Ratnapura districts had to face various hardships due to lack of drinking water.

As a solution to the Ratnapura drinking water issue, a water supply project was initiated during the previous regime. The first phase of that project had already been completed, he said.
He urged the government to provide funds for the second phase of the project.
He also emphasized the necessity of enhancing infrastructure facilities of urban areas in line with the population growth of the areas. Currently 30 percent of the countrys population lived in urban areas and it would increase up to 50 percent by 2030.

Naveen, Anura Kumara wants Ravi Algama Committee report tabled
Plantation Industries Minister and former Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, urged current Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera to table the Ravi Algama Committee report.
They made this request when Minister Jayasekera requested for two weeks time to respond to a question by JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti pasted on the order paper for oral answers. MP Handunnetti in his question had asked the minister to table the Committee report headed by Ravi Algama to investigate acts of fraud and corruption that had occurred in Sri Lanka Cricket under the previous regime.
MP Anura Dissanayake noted that the question should not be postponed as it is relevant to the Sri Lanka Cricket election to be held shortly.
The former minister appointed a committee and its report is now submitted. As public representatives, we have a right to know what happened during the past years, he said.
Minister Navin Dissanayake speaking at this point, stood by the argument of MP Anura Dissanayake, adding that he firmly believed the report should be available to the public domain.
Responding to these queries, Minister Jayasekera stated that he needed time to study the report, noting that it was not proper to reveal its content to the public or media without confirming the charges made in it.
There are policy decisions that the ministry should adhere to as of the recommendations by the report. If you permit me time till December 19, I would make a ministerial statement and table the report thereafter. Even though various allegations have been directed against individuals labelling them as thieves over the past few days, while the charges were not properly proved. As a responsible minister, I am unable to do so.
I will hold proper investigations and if the charges are proved beyond doubt, I will take action against them. I do not want to cover up anybody, nor wish to protect thieves. Over the past years, a large number of incidents of corruption have taken place at the Sri Lanka Cricket. I cannot reveal them without properly looking into them, Minister Jayasekera replied.
Minister Samarasinghe wants Parliament Select Committee sittings open to media

A committee headed by former Supreme Court Judge Gamini Dissanayake, had been appointed to look into the case of the misplacement of the elephant registry and illegal elephant owners, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera said in Parliament yesterday.
The minister was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana.
He said any individual could forward information about persons who possess elephants without a valid licence to the committee.
The minister noted that the committee would commence its operations next week. Several individuals have been taken into custody for keeping elephants without licenses and the ministry would take action to arrest many more persons in the future. There were rumours that the elephant registry had last been seen at Temple Trees during the times of the previous govenrment.
Laws would be implemented against people who keep elephants illegally, irrespective of their positions. Laws would also be implemented against members of the clergy too, he commented.
Monthly excise revenue increased
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told Parliament yesterday, that the monthly excise revenue had increased to Rs.11,800 million compared to just Rs.2,000 million income for November 2014 alone, due to the stringent measures taken under the present government against alcohol abuse.
The minister responding to a question for oral answer raised by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma, said there was a move to open more liquor stores in the guise of Super Markets.
However, if existing liquor licenses are transferred to Super Markets, a levy of Rs.15 million should be playable to the excise Department.
Only 353 licenses have been issued for the import of ethanol this year and out of which, just 20 licenses are for the production of alcohol beverages. All the other permits are for the manufacture of Ayurvedic drugs.
Pure drinking water for 89 percent by 2016 - Minister Hakeem

He was joining the committee stage debate of the Budget 2016, under financial heads of City Planning and Water Supply Ministry.
A high level of pollution had contaminated river estuaries and water resources. This has become a major problem in providing pure drinking water to the people of the country. Water resources were also contaminated with solid and urban waste added to the rivers and the environment, while the use of pesticides, weedicides and chemical fertilizer polluted the water resources. Therefore, we need high technology to purify the water.
New Cabinet Paper to acquire plantation areas under local bodies
Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram said in Parliament yesterday, that a new Cabinet Paper would be submitted to take plantation areas under respective local government bodies.

The minister said this in response to an oral question raised by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardene. This decision was taken after discussions between the President and the Prime Minister, while the relevant Cabinet Paper in this regard would be submitted next week. We hope the living standards of the estate workers and infrastructure facilities in plantation areas would be improved with this endeavor.

Commenting on the controversial incident at the recently held 2015 Mr Sri Lanka contest organized by the Sri Lanka Bodybuilding Federation, a life ban awaits any player who refuses to face a doping test, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Parliament yesterday.
When the Director of the Sri Lanka Anti-Doping Agency Dr. Seevali Jayawickreme went to conduct tests in the afternoon, several players had not allowed him to perform the tests.

After the tournament ended and at the awards ceremony, the first runner-up had gone away with the trophy and gifts meant for the winner.
He said so in response to a supplementary question raised by Kandy district UNP MP Lucky Jayawardena.

NHDA funds drained out for entertainment - Bimal
The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) had spent Rs 11 million as entertainment expenses during a period of 11 months in 2014, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said in Parliament yesterday. He was participating at the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2016 when the House took up expenditure heads of the Housing and Construction Ministry.

He asked for a probe into these expenditures and steps be taken against the officials responsible for approving them.
He further stated these expenditures also include Rs 1.6 million spent on a said Workshop for 450 journalists at the Golden Rose Recreation Hotel at the beginning of the year, but according to the hotel management, 450 invitees had not taken part in it, adding that the money taken for this event had been misused.
Moreover the NHDA had spent Rs. 475, 500 for food during a ceremony held on December 5, 2014, to grant permanent appointment letters. This ceremony was organized when the election was at hand. The Elections Commission should inquire in to the matter and punish the violators of election laws. The NHDA had also spent for a musical show at Gunasinhapura and this was also aimed at the election.
These may not be staggering amounts compared to the billions misused under the previous regime, but I revealed them because those who misappropriated the peoples money now act as patriots, he said. The MP also stated the party men of former Minister Weerawansa, were paid millions of rupees as salaries by the State Engineering Corporation without working at any of its sites.

Burning questions for the masses of fans that make local rugby a colourful local popularity contender.

The 2015/16 season needs Army, Navy and Air Force to be teams that have the ability to push all sides to the wire - they must add a dimension of surprise, to a league that needs magic, needs fliers, needs spectacular tries and massive impact tackles to pepper the fans imagination and win new young hearts to the union code, especially given the absolutely massive Rugby World Cup in sunny England. How impressive the quality of rugby warrior, on and off the field, how amazing the millions who watched and what a brilliant future for the game.
The domestic season cert has a lot to offer families, school leavers and fans, the local players given opportunity to skill shine and dazzle, new stars, new names, fabulous indeed.
Week 5 - Kandy superior, classy, experienced - the team to beat. Travel to the capitol to meet CR. Expect a bruising 80 mins and plenty of defence from the Longdon Place Red shirts. In form three quarters for Kandy will dictate the pace and magic,
This Dec Sat: Army v Havies will be closer but the park warriors will control the game with a game plan to contain the fitter Army who unfortunately lack experience.
Navy v Police is bound to be a real battle both teams equally capable of grabbing the bonus points at full time. Team leadership might be the difference to get over the line.
18th Dec: CR v Kandy, @ Longdon Place 4pm ko. 18th Dec: CH v Airforce @ venue to be announced .4pm ko . 20th Dec Army v Havelocks @ Army grounds 4pm ko. 20th Dec: Navy v Police @ Welisara 4pm ko.

MR was engaged in political deals - Dilan
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was engaged in political deals.
Perera said so responding to a journalist, who raised a question regarding the allegation of Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa that the government is engaged in political deals.
He said that 'deals' are not new in the country's political arena.
He noted that Namal's father - former President Rajapaksa was also engaged in a deal aiming to come to power in 2005. As a result of that deal people of the North and East refrained from voting and therefore, he (Rajapaksa) could become the President. If there was no such deal Prabhakaran would have been alive today.
He revealed that Namal Rajapaksa was also engaged in a political deal very recently to bring back Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
"It was Namal who talked with Minister Samaraweera aiming to coax him to crossover to the SLFP," Perera said.

New discoveries redefine Angkor Wat's history
AUSTRALIA: Archaeological studies conducted at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia have found that the largest religious monument in the world was far larger than expected and more complex than previously thought.
The University of Sydney's professor Roland Fletcher and Damian Evans lead the Greater Angkor Project in Cambodia, a major international research collaboration which is using airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) technology, ground-penetrating radar and targeted excavation to map the great pre-industrial temple, according to a University of Sydney statement.
"This structure, which has dimensions of more than 1500m-600m, is the most striking discovery associated with Angkor Wat to date. Its function remains unknown and, as yet, it has no known equivalent in the Angkorian world," said Professor Fletcher, from the university's department of archaeology.
The team also discovered Angkor Wat includes an entire ensemble of buried 'towers' built and demolished during the construction and initial use of the main temple, remains of what is thought might be a shrine used during the construction period. The areas surrounding Angkor Wat have long been assumed to be sacred precincts or 'temple-cities'. However, the research has revealed evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, including a grid of roads, ponds and mounds, possibly used by people servicing the temple.
"This challenges our traditional understanding of the social hierarchy of the Angkor Wat community and shows that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been exclusively the preserve of the wealthy or the priestly elite," said Fletcher. The team has also discovered that Angkor Wat was fortified with wooden structures sometime late in its history. Fletcher said the results revealed how Angkor Wat may have made its last attempt at defence. - AFP

SLFP guided only by party Central Committee - Dilan
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera stressed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is taken forward based only on the decisions taken at the SLFP Central Committee and not guided by personal views of anyone.
Even though there are alternative views in the SLFP the party is driven based on the decisions taken at the Central Committee unlike during the regimes of former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
He was addressing the SLFP weekly press briefing at the SLFPheadquarters yesterday.
Speaking on the Budget 2016 the Minister said that Budget 2016 was subjected to several key amendments during the Committee Stage. The budget is debated at the Committee Stage aiming to make the necessary amendments even though that opportunity was not utilized thus far, until this year. Accordingly several proposals of the budget have been re-considered including the proposals relating to vehicle permits, vehicle emission testing tax and many more.
"For the first time in the political history of the country Budget 2016 was amended at the Committee Stage. Therefore, the budget will be passed in Parliament with a clear majority at the Third Reading on the 19 th ", he said.
Speaking on the forthcoming local government election, Minister Perera said the SLFP will contest the next local government election under the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA)banner as a broad alliance comprised of all parties of the UPFA. But the SLFP will never go with extremist parties. President Maithripala Sirisena will lead the UPFA election campaign. He added that the people of the country expect several changes in certain sectors. Among these expectations are the abolishment of the Executive Presidency and implementing the new electoral system. Besides, national policies should be introduced for key sectors such as education, heath,agriculture etc.

US, Russia agree to push ahead with Syria talks
RUSSIA : The United States and Russia agreed to plough on with efforts to halt Syria's brutal civil war, with a fresh round of international crisis talks set for this week in New York.
After a three-hour meeting in Moscow between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US Secretary of State John Kerry, the two sides appeared to be a step closer to each other's positions on Syria, though differences remained on the fate of President Bashar al-Assad.
In a stark reminder of the urgency of the quest -- and even as the US envoy and the Kremlin leader were meeting Tuesday -- a monitoring group said suspected Russian air strikes killed 34 Syrian civilians.
"We support the idea of convening in New York another meeting of the International Syria Support Group at the ministerial level this Friday, December 18," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said after the talks, which also touched on counterterrorism and Ukraine.
He and Kerry said the New York negotiations would lead to a UN Security Council resolution to underpin the process aimed at brokering a ceasefire and political talks between Assad's regime and Syria's armed opposition.
"We discussed today in great detail the need to accelerate the effort," Washington's top diplomat said.
"You can't defeat Daesh without also de-escalating the fight in Syria," he said, using another name to refer to the jihadist Islamic State group.
In Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby predicted "the same level of activity and energy" at the New York talks as in two previous rounds among the 17 nations involved in Vienna.
Kerry and Lavrov admitted differences remained between Washington and Moscow on Assad's fate but stressed they would not let those ruin the political talks.
"What we have said is that we don't believe that Assad himself has the ability to lead the future Syria," Kerry said.
"But we focused today not on our differences about what can and can't be done immediately about Assad, we focused on the political process whereby Syrians will be making decisions about the future of Syria."
He also said he had conveyed to Putin Washington's concern "that some of Russia's strikes have hit the moderate opposition" in Syria, and not just IS fighters.
"And I'm pleased to say he took that under advisement," Kerry said.
Washington is relying on the Kremlin to drag its ally Assad to the table for talks with his rebel opponents.
But looming large over the effort is the threat posed by the Islamic State group to spread the carnage beyond Syria's borders.
More than 250,000 people have died since Syria's conflict erupted in March 2011, and millions more have fled their homes.
Kerry hopes that if the regime and the rebels can agree a truce, then they, Russia and a US-led coalition of Western and Arab allies can focus their fire on the jihadists.
Lavrov said the two countries agreed to intensify "our efforts in counterterrorism."
"ISIL, Jabhat Al-Nusra and other terrorist groups are common threats to every one of us and today we reiterated our determination to uproot this evil," he said, referring to the IS group and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front.
