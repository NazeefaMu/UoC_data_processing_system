China to boost cultural ties with Sri Lanka
China attaches great importance to Sri Lanka's economic and social development needs, Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang said.
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the China-Sri Lanka study center, the ambassador said as Sri Lanka's traditional friend, China looked to further strengthen its cooperation with the Sri Lankan Bhuddist community as both nations shared Bhuddism as its majority.
"Over 70 percent of the population of Sri Lankans believe in Buddhism, which plays an important role in the social life of this island nation. China always attaches importance to the Sri Lanka Buddhist community in terms of cooperation and communication," the Chinese ambassador said.
"Under the Chinese embassy's help, more than 100 Chinese Buddhists visited Sri Lanka, while more than 150 Sri Lankan monks visited China for exchange programs. In the future, China will encourage more exchange visits between the two countries and will further promote exchanges and cooperation between China and the Sri Lankan Buddhist culture," he added.
During the first half of 2015, China has provided over 1,100 training and scholarship opportunities to Sri Lankans and the country now looks to further increase these numbers.
Based on the significant progress made by the two countries in areas such as political, economic and cultural and civil exchanges in the recent years, the China-Sri Lanka Cooperation study center is also one of the results of cooperation between the two countries, Yi said.
Venerable Sri Lankan Bhuddist monks who participated in the event noted that Sri Lanka and China shared a strong bond and China had provided support and assistance to Sri Lanka for the post war economic development.
The monks further said Bhuddist exchanges between the two countries had increased and they hoped in the future China would take action to strengthen the Chinese language skills of the Sri Lankan Bhuddist monks. (Xinhua)

HR Investigations under a domestic mechanism
The outcome at the UNHRC in September would have been different if the government did not change at the January 8th Presidential Election, Minister of Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunathileke said in Parliament.
The Minister said this when the report of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Sri Lankas was taken up for debate for a second day.The Minister reiterated that all investigations pertaining to the proposals cited in the report of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner will be held under a domestic inquiry.It was former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who took the human rights issue to Geneva and brought the problem to the Human Rights Council by entering into an agreement with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon in 2009 after the end of the war. Fresh commitmentswere undertaken but the Minister further pointed out that the previous regime remained insincere to the task, leading the international community to lose confidence and patience leading to divided the international community.

If there was no change on 8 January followed by good governance, political reforms and reconciliation measures enabling the international community to have a positive outlook, Sri Lanka would have been marginalised internationally by now, he added.
He said it can be observed at this debate in Parliament, that some politicians with narrow agendas and seeking cheap publicity are trying to mislead the people by incorrectly interpreting the Geneva report and flagging off unnecessary concerns.

The Minister while stating the government can obtain the advice of the international community also emphasised establishing a mechanism to investigate into the allegations of human rights violations and the proposed mechanism would be within the provisions of the Constitution. (Govt. Info)

Rameswaram fishermen go on indefinite strike
Fishermen of Rameswaram went on an indefinite strike from Friday, demanding the release of 87 fishermen held captive by Sri Lanka. Many fishermen from various parts of the state have been languishing in the prisons in Sri Lankan. Fishermen in the Rameswaram have decided to refrain from fishing, said district secretary of Tamil Nadu Mechanised Boats Fishermen's Association during a meeting of fishermen's associations held in Rameswaram on Friday. "We came to know that the fishermen are facing many hardships. We want the 87 fishermen and their 39 boats to be released immediately," he said.
He said fishermen should be compensated for the boats that drowned in Sri Lankan waters because they were not retrieved on time and brought back to India. They urged the government to protect their livelihood and rights to fish. Many members of the fishing community have migrated to other jobs due to lack of security for their livelihood, they said.
Fishermen have planned for a fast on Saturday in Thangachimadam to stress their demands. Nearly 25,000 fishermen and their families will be affected due to the strike, they said. Similar strikes were conducted four times in the last three months, excluding the period of fishing ban. (TNN)
