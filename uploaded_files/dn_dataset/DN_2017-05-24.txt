Then the President will say the country will be able to move forward with new vigour and hand over all state hospitals to the Media Minister, he added.
A male nurse cannot tell a professor to go home. The GMOA will meet ILO and complain to the International Judiciary if required. The GMOA hopes the Government will stop repressing trade unions before that. Cabinet Ministers sends letters without dates. That is the quality of their standard, he said.
The GMOA challenged the civil organisations and their leaders to gather at least 1,000 people and show their support. These so called civil organisations and NGOs depend on dollars and implement agendas of foreign countries. They cannot decide which direction Sri Lanka should go. They never talk about abolishing the pension. The relevant authorities should investigate how and who funds them, said Dr. de Zoysa.

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was absent today for the court hearing on the allegation on offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court amounting to Contempt of Court on January 25, last year.

However, Counsel Anusha Perusinghe appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera informing the Court that her client was not present since he is ill.
She undertook to produce the accused along with a medical certificate on the next hearing which was fixed for May 31.
This case is to be taken up for argument before a two-judge-bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena on the next hearing date.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it was vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
At a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

"A total of 16 members from nine families attended the camp. They are interested in returning to their hometowns in Sri Lanka. Most of them who came today are natives of Jaffna and Vavuniya," Indian Regional Special Deputy Collector S. Natarasan told TOI.
The officials verified the documents to authenticate their Sri Lankan origin and their passports. UNHCR would even help them apply for passports in the Sri Lankan embassy in Chennai if they had not obtained the same.
UNHCR would also take care of the travel expenses to Sri Lanka and provide financial assistance for their survival until they are accustomed to the situation to earn on their own.
"We will provide financial assistance to maintain their daily needs for at least three months in Sri Lanka," said Natarasan.
More refugee families attended the second day's camp yesterday.
As far as Trichy district is concerned, the refugees have been residing in the two camps in Kottapattu and Vazhavandhankottai. At present, 1,389 refugees including 701 males and 688 females are residing in Kottapattu, while the other camp has 1,420 refugees including 725 males and 695 females.

Sir Roger Moore, James Bond actor, dies aged 89

Actor Sir Roger Moore, best known for playing James Bond, has died aged 89, his family has announced.
He played the famous spy in seven Bond films including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill.
Sir Roger's family confirmed the news on Twitter, saying he had died after "a short but brave battle with cancer".
The statement, from his children, read: "Thank you Pops for being you, and being so very special to so many people."
"With the heaviest of hearts, we must share the awful news that our father, Sir Roger Moore, passed away today. We are all devastated," they said in a Twitter post.
The actor took the character of James Bond in a more humorous direction than his predecessor Sean Connery.
Sir Roger's Bond was calm and suave - a smooth operator who could seemingly get himself out of a tricky situation with ease.
The veteran star, who died in Switzerland, will have a private funeral in Monaco in accordance with his wishes, his children said.
"The love with which he was surrounded in his final days was so great it cannot be quantified in words alone," read the statement from Deborah, Geoffrey and Christian.
"Our thoughts must now turn to supporting Kristina [Tholstrup, his wife] at this difficult time."
The statement added: "We know our own love and admiration will be magnified many times over, across the world, by people who knew him for his films, his television shows and his passionate work for UNICEF which he considered to be his greatest achievement.
Along with his famous Bond role, Moore was also known for TV series The Persuaders and The Saint.
Sir Roger was also well known for his humanitarian work - he was introduced to Unicef by the late Audrey Hepburn and was appointed as a goodwill ambassador in 1991.
Russell Crowe led the tributes to the actor on Twitter, writing simply: "Roger Moore, loved him."
Michael Caine said: "I am truly sad and think I will be in tears if I talk about him.
"Roger was the perfect gentlemen, adored by all his friends."
Michael Ball said: "My dearest uncle Roger has passed on. What a sad, sad day this is.
"Loved the bones of him. Generous, funny, beautiful and kind."
Mia Farrow wrote: "Few are as kind & giving as was Roger Moore. Loving thoughts with his family & friends," while Boy George added: "RIP Sir Roger Moore. He was the king of cool."
Duran Duran, who sang the Bond theme song for A View To A Kill, simply tweeted: RIP Roger.
In a statement, fellow Unicef ambassador and actor Ewan McGregor said: "Thank you, Roger, for having championed so tirelessly the rights of all children for the last 26 years.
"You've shown that we all have the power to make a change to the lives of the most vulnerable children."
Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent, recalled how he and Sir Roger had become good friends in recent years.
"He even watched me ski past his chalet in Crans-Montana [Switzerland] while sipping a drink on his balcony," he said.
"He had a wonderful sense of humour and I will miss his jokes by email. We had lunch together only a few months ago and even after all these years he seemed surprised that his career had been as successful as it evidently was. We will miss him."

Trump meets Pope Francis before meeting Italian leaders

US President Donald Trump is meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican - the latest during the third leg of his overseas trip.
Trump and the pontiff have already clashed at a distance on issues including migration and climate change.
Trump will also meet Italy's president and prime minister, before flying to Brussels for a Nato summit.
He earlier vowed to help Israelis and Palestiniansachieve peace, as he ended the Middle East leg of his tour.
The US leader began his foreign trip with a two-day stop in Saudi Arabia over the weekend,urging Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation.
Trump arrived at the Vatican just before 06:30 GMT for his meeting with Pope Francis. Afterwards, he will hold talks with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.
It is hard to think of two more contrasting characters than Pope Francis and President Trump.
On one hand, the Jesuit who has made his mission the championing of the poor and dispossessed; on the other the property developer who has championed getting rich, and surrounded himself with billionaires in his cabinet.
And though this will be their first meeting they've already sparred. During the election the Pope on a visit to the Mexico-US border said that people who only think of building walls instead of bridges were not Christian.
Donald Trump described those comments as disgraceful, and accused the pontiff of being a pawn of the Mexican government.
But on Wednesday both men will be seeking to find common ground.
After his visit to Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's holiest sites, and to Israel, this is the final leg of the tour of the world's three great religions.
President Trump's commitment to fighting extremism and intolerance will win approval from the Pope, as will his determination to bring peace to the Middle East.
And the president thinks there's another reason why they will get on. Back in 2013 he tweeted: "The new Pope is a humble man, very much like me."
This is Trump's first visit to Europe since he took office in January.
Security has been stepped up across Rome, with the areas around the Vatican City, the Italian presidential palace and the American ambassador's residence, where Trump is staying, temporarily closed to traffic.
Despite the heavy police presence, about 100 anti-Trump protesters held a rally in one of Rome's squares on Tuesday evening.
Later on Wednesday, Trump will fly to Brussels, where significant protests are expected.
For the EU and for Nato, this visit is about damage limitation with the fervent hope of establishing some kind of transatlantic chemistry, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says.
She adds that the tone in Brussels has gone from off-the-record sneering when the erratic and unpredictable Mr Trump first won the November elections, to outright concern now that the implications of his presidency have begun to sink in.
Trump will end his tour on the Italian island of Sicily at the G7 summit on Friday.
'Rare opportunity'
On Tuesday, he said he would "do everything" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.
At talks in Bethlehem with Mahmoud Abbas, he spoke of being gratified that the Palestinian leader had committed to taking necessary steps to "fight terrorism".
Israel and the Palestinians have not held peace talks for three years and Trump acknowledged it would be "one of the toughest deals of all" to broker.
In both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, Palestinians have held protests against the trip and in support of a hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Trump earlier said he had come to "reaffirm the unbreakable bond" between the US and Israel and that there was a "rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace" to the region.
He added that the president of the Palestinian Authority had assured him he was "ready to work towards that goal in good faith", and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised the same during their talks in Israel.

Use water sparingly, Apura GA urges public
The Anuradhapura Government Agent had urged the public to use drinking water only for drinking and cooking purposes in view of the prevailing drought.
Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that the water levels of the Nuwara Wewa, Tissa Wewa and Thuruwila tank which supply drinking water to around 300,000 people have been decreasing drastically.
He pointed out that around 40,000 cubic metres of water are filtered and distributed to the public per day from the tank trio. He appealed to the people to start using the abandoned deep wells and existing tube wells for routine domestic washing purposes including watering the gardens etc.
Wanninayaka said around Rs. one million is spent daily for water purification by the Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB).
The Government Agent and the WSDB have requested the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to issue a few water turns from Mahaweli to Tissa Wewa, Nuwara Wewa and Thuruwila tank in view of the national Poson religious celebrations which would attract around one million devotees to Anuradhapura.
