No sinking  feelings
No part of your body sits still during this intense sport. Athletes are submerged in deep water where they can only swim above the surface. You tread water with your legs, contort your body with your core, and you reach, catch, and throw with your arms. So think of it as a combination between soccer and basketball, but in a pool! Combining the teamwork and stratergy found in games like rugby and hockey players ranging from all shapes and sizes engage in a non-stop workout which pushes their athletic boundaries. The object of the game is to outscore your opponent but it encompasses a great social side, both in and out of water, as well.
Welcome to the world of water polo! Vigorous, entertaining, and fun, water polo has become a sport which is becoming popular among many Sri Lankan school goers and youth today. His ability to think quickly on his feet and find the best scenario helped Michael Shannon Ebenezer to excel in the game. The youth who is also the Head Prefect of S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia, passed a milestone in his life recently when he celebrated the rare feat of having won Triple Coloursmen for swimming, water polo and football at the Colours Assembly held recently. He was awarded the Thomian Blue  the highest award for sports given by the school. He was also named the Sportsman of the year 2018.
I started swimming from grade one. Since I did exceptionally well in swimming I took to water polo from grade eight onwards. Water polo is enjoyable but also very difficult to master as anyone cannot go through the whole process. I love the aggression and intensity of the sport. If you want to challage yourself physically, then this is the sport for you. That is what drew me and kept me captivated to the game, said Michael who is the Vice Captain of S. Thomas Colleges water polo team. He is also the captain of the schools swimming team.

He had been trained under Zafar Zainudeen and Dhanushka Seram. The first national event he had taken part in was the under 15 for public schools. He had been part of the team in seven Royal Thomian Waterpolo Encounters and had won four out of them. The first international tournament he took part in was the SAAC Aquatics Games in Colombo in 2016 when he was in the under 21 group category. They competed against three international teams at the event and managed to clinch the silver medal.
Michael had represented S. Thomas Colleges water polo team in many tournaments from the year 2012. He was part of the college team which toured Thailand and Malaysia in 2015 and 2016. He was a member of the OTSC A Team, which obtained the runner-up position in the National Water polo championship in 2014. He was part of the team which won the international water polo mens tournaments in Malaysia and Thailand 2015  2018. The team was selected by the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union, the National Governing Body for the aquatic sports in the country.
There are 13 players in a water polo team but seven players play during a session. A game goes on for about 45 to 50 minutes with breaks in between. Michael mostly plays the left bar as he is good at taking shot at the goal. He had scored six goals in the last Royal-Thomian water polo tournament and four goals in the Nationals.
You have to be a good swimmer to become a water polo champ. Possessing the strength, both physically as well as mentally, to carry on with the game is also a must. Your leg work needs to be strong. The game demands endurance too, especially to make it through the last few minutes, Michael spelled out what it takes to become a winner in water polo.
He says that best advice he had gotten about the game was to keep things simple and play to the basics. Ashane Francis who captained the Thomian water polo team in 2016 had given him that tip which he follows even today.
He admires former American Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps because of his determination to succeed and Irish boxing champ Conor McGregor because he had said that before he goes for a game, he plays the game in his head and wins it.
Receiving the Thomian Blue
Taking part in the Inter House Athletics Meet
Singing in the Thomian choir
That is my cue too before a game. Before I take part in a game, I too visualize the game in my mind and step out into the pool as a winner, he quipped adding that this makes it easy for him to achieve his goal.
Michael had represented his school at the All Island Swimming Meets and has won many medals from 2008.
Another noteworthy achievement on his list is that he was also the Head Prefect of Lower School and Head Prefect of Middle School. He is a gifted football player and had excelled in athletics too. He had been the treasurer and secretary of the Student Christian Movement. He is the schools present choir leader.
Queried on what his greatest achievement is and Michael says that he is humbled and honored to be appointed as the head prefect of S. Thomas College.
It is a God given opportunity for me to influence and inspire others. I have always respected the values and disciple of our college and being the Head Prefect gives me the opportunity to see that discipline and good character is moulded into our youngsters. I would like to influence and impact the community in a positive manner, in the future as well, he expressed.
Michels father, John Ebenezer, is into music while his mother, Nilanthini Ebenezer, works part time at the church. His brother, Shevaan, is also schooling at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia.
He wishes to enter the architecture or piloting field in the future.
The world has become more competitive today. You need 100 percent effort and sacrifice to excel in a game now. Jesus has been my strength so I think youngsters should engage in their passions not only for their own gain but also as a means of glorifying God, Michael said adding that he wishes to thank his Warden Rev. Marc Billimoria for his guidance and support and all the teachers from his childhood who have inspired him throughout the years.

Ogilvy Media, [emailprotected] win Bronze at  Campaign Agency of the Year Awards
Ogilvy Media, premier media agency, and [emailprotected], a leading digital agency in Sri Lanka,were awarded the Rest of South Asia Media Agency of the Year  Bronze and the Rest of South Asia Digital Agency of the Year  Bronze at the recently concluded South Asia leg of the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards 2018 in Mumbai, India.
The award entrants are judged on the overall performance of the agency business, the objectives set out at the beginning of the year, the strategies adopted to accomplish these objectives and most importantly the results achieved at the end of the relevant 12 month period.
Key criteria considered include business growth, innovations and new initiatives, client and talent retention, as well as recognition received and industry initiatives introduced.
The Ogilvy Media entry highlighted how the agency embraced change to adapt and succeed in one of its most challenging years yet. In addition to adverse macro and micro economic factors,higher media inflation, rapid changes in the media landscape, and client demand for higher effectiveness at a lower cost saw most agencies responding with a price war with an increased media commoditization. However, Ogilvy Medias approach revolved around six key strategy pillars which prioritised on preventing any possible decline in business while upholding its uniqueness in planning excellence and service quality.
Through this, the agency was able to achieve outstanding results in client retention, business acquisition, staff development and retention, and innovation  as well as becoming the most awarded agency at the Effie Awards Sri Lanka 2017.
The [emailprotected] entry focused on the agencys two-fold approach to address the exponential evolution of digital platforms, as well as to developing talent.One of the key strategies saw the forming of strategic partnerships with digital platforms such as Facebook and Eskimi and regulatory agencies such as ICTA, providing [emailprotected] with a two-steps-ahead advantage.
With the advent of new media, the current environment is both stimulating and challenging. In this context, the key to being a sustainable and growing business is adaptability and innovation. These were central in our approach not only to our business, but in our service offering to clients as well as managing our people. I am extremely proud of the effort by the team at Ogilvy Media this past year, and honoured to be recognised by this regional accolade, said Lalith Sumanasiri, Managing Director of Ogilvy Media and [emailprotected].
The digital landscape in Sri Lanka is an exciting one, but its growth needs to be understood and anticipated in order to remain successful. I truly appreciate all the work put in by the team at [emailprotected] last year, and dedicate this award to their untiring efforts, said Amitha Amarasinghe, Chief Operating Officer, [emailprotected].

Plea to  conserve  Adams  Peak
Although the Adams Peak is the third highest mountain in the central mountain range, when we consider its economic, social, environmental and cultural impact on Sri Lanka, we can consider indubitable, it is the most important mountain in our country. It is a famous religious place among the general public, because of the keen interest in worshiping the holy foot print, and thousands of people belonging to various religions visit this place. Therefore, it gives an invincible contribution to the religious co-existence. However, this interest among visitors leads to serious garbage issue which adversely affects the natural beauty of Adams Peak. If this issue continues, destruction of Adams Peak is in near future.
Adams Peak is one of the Sri Lankan identities. It makes a great contribution in developing the countrys economic, social and cultural dynamics.
Mahaweli Kalani 
Walawe Kalu yana ganga
Samanala kanda mudune 
sita penanenga
Bawum thenithala 
hel atharin ringa
Mewa galai mini 
keta diyayata hanga
The above-mentioned poem which has been very familiar since our childhood, gives us a sense of hydrological importance of Adams Peak. Think a little further; what are the consequences that will arise if we lose those catchment areas How will it impact on our agro economy, generating hydro power and all the other industries which are based their daily tasks with water Furthermore, we can expect a social, cultural and aesthetic development properly when we have advancement in our economy only. As an artist, thats the main reason I joined here. Sri Pada or Adams peak has its own conjunctive art and culture. If the Adams Peak begins to destruct; all the other factors evade along with it. The Adams Peak is also known as one of the largest and least disturbed remaining areas of the submontane and montane rain forests of Sri Lanka, which are a global conservation priority on many accounts. That is the reason which United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization has recognized three mountains in the central mountain range including Adams Peak as a world heritage. That forest includes flora and fauna from which are unique. Therefore, protecting this heritage is a responsibility of our nation said the musician, composer Edward Jayakodi.
While being on the pilgrimage, our fraternal communities dispose their garbage on this religious place viciously. As an artist who represents the younger generation, I have the urge to shoulder this national responsibility. Youngsters are capable of handling challenges, and my intention is to get together with the young generation to protect Adams Peak. Therefore, joining with the great musician Edward Jayakodi, created a song Asiri Surakimu Samanala, musician Sanka Dineth said. We invite you all to join individually or as volunteer groups with our social media network and our web site www.savesripada.lk to pledge to save Adams Peak. You can also join our campaigns which will be held on December 29, January 12 and 20 with the co-ordination of state organizations, Sanka Dineth added.
Link Natural Products Corporate Social Responsibility Manager Priyantha Kolonnage says the company has taken the leadership in this endeavor for several years.
We have been providing Link Samahan and S P balm for those who are on pilgrimage to Adams Peak over six years. However, this time we have decided to go beyond our normal CSR and have decided to initiate garbage collection and to create awareness to avoid garbage dumping in the religious land. By using waste materials, they can create new products and at the same time we can minimize the environmental pollution. We encourage volunteers to join us, Kolonnage added.

Poll option gaining currency
There are calls from the SLFP/UPFA pohottuwa membership and also other groups affiliated to the Government that President Maithripala Sirisena should go for a referendum on the question of holding a General Election, should the Supreme Court holds the dissolution of Parliament invalid. The most vocal on this score has been Convenor of Federation of National Organizations Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera who in a media briefing contended that referring the matter to the people was wiser than making a judge decide. Reports also indicated that the UPFA membership at a meeting with the President had urged him to declare a referendum on holding a General Election if the Court ruling goes against the dissolution of Parliament.
A daily newspaper in its main story also reported that discussions were underway between several political parties on the possibility of providing the required two thirds majority in Parliament to hold a General Election should the dissolution be declared invalid by the Supreme Court. The report also stated that the President and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had been holding formal and informal meetings to seek a way to end the present crisis.
It is not clear if the UNP was involved in these discussions with the President. However most feel that the most appropriate course to follow under the present circumstances is to opt for a General Election. This is because the stalemate is bound to continue even in the event of the court ruling permitting the present Parliament to continue. In such an event the crisis could only prolong leading to not just an anarchic state but the complete breakdown of the political system which could also pose a threat to democracy itself.
True, a referendum is a costly exercise and if a General Election were to follow it will be a severe drain on the countrys scarce finances. A General Election is also bound to exacerbate the already extreme political heat between the contending factions leading to unprecedented violence. In addition, should a GE throw up a hung Parliament there will be more problems. Also, there is bound to be a time gap before a referendum is held- if that is what it will come down to- should the court ruling, which will out anytime soon, goes against the dissolution. How things will pan out, given the pending Supreme Court ruling on the Writ matter challenging the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and the Cabinet, is anybodys guess.
Then there will also be another interval before a General Election will be held if a yes vote is cast at the referendum. In the meantime, the country will be without a budget for the ensuing year though the Government could go for a Vote on Account in the event an election is declared.
It appears that we are, in any event, heading for a General Election, whatever may be the Supreme Court verdict. It is not that General Elections had not taken place in this country mid way through an administration. The last occasion we had a premature General Election was in 2001 when CBK terminated her own Government following a rash of crossovers to the UNP. This time too the President would be terminating his own Government i.e if it is contended that the Government he appointed on October 26 is a legal one. The UNP and its supporters contend otherwise, while the SLFP/UPFA pohottuwa combine still say that their Government is intact and that what the Court of Appeal ruling did was only to restrain the functioning of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
In the meantime, the UNP is to move a Confidence Motion on leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and through this means intends to force the hand of the President to restore the status quo prior to October 26. The President for his part is firm that he wont have Ranil as Prime Minister but would not object to an alternative should the UNP manages to show a majority in Parliament. This amidst the stubborn insistence of the Greens that it will be RW and no one else.
Assuming that the Court rules the dissolution invalid and the President yet decides not to go for a referendum leaving the prevailing status quo drag on where would this take the country
Yesterday we advocated in these spaces on the prudence of some neutral party acting as interlocutor to bring about a settlement to the crisis. We proposed the intervention of religious leaders of all faiths with the hope that the warring parties would be amenable to the sober advice emanating from such exalted quarters. We also called for the toning down of the violent political rhetoric that is now on display on both sides.
Hopefully, saner counsel prevails and the country pulled out from the precipice it is waiting to plunge into due to the uncompromising attitudes by the political leaders. We reiterate that both President Sirisena and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe spare a thought for the country and decide to end the impasse. After all pride should be sacrificed on all fronts when it comes to rescuing the country from peril.

The President made this request during a meeting with members of the plantation trade unions to discuss the ongoing strike action and finding a viable solution to the estate workers wage issue.
The President had told trade union members that he believed workers should be given a reasonable salary and in the same manner steps should be taken to preserve and further develop the tea industry as well, the Presidents media unit said.
The President has decided to hold a meeting with the Estate Employers Union on December 19, to discuss the issue related to the increase of the daily wage of estate workers.

President postpones Singapore FTA discussion dates, amendments
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, directed the Government to postpone the dates of the discussions leading to the implementation and the amendments to the Singapore - Sri Lanka FTA, MP Bandula Gunawardena told the Daily News yesterday.
This is a sequel to the Report on the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement being handed over to President Sirisena on Tuesday by a team of Economists and experts of technocrats who were appointed to a Presidential Commission headed by former Colombo University Vice Chancellor and Economics Chair Prof. W.D.Lakshman.
The President was also requested by the Government Parliament Group to give them more time to study the report, its recommendations and amendments.
There have been a large number of drawbacks and impediments along with some legal flaws and President Sirisena has asked for a postponement in the dates for the discussions as well.
The conditions of the Agreement are such that the amendments have to be made within a year of the signing of the Free Trade Agreement and that was why there was a request for the extension of time, these sources said.

Protecting your line, unbeaten teams and solid basics so far...
The 2018 seasons break looms large, with the 4 top contenders neatly drifting comfortably from the rest ...
Sri Lankas elite but defined club structure, need to reinforce the premier leagues reputation for fair play...justice and technology. The countries rugby faithful depend entirely on this surviving system to guarantee results every weekend.
The frequency of fair play and justice mentioned by the faithful , scrutinised and criticized by the public are handled entirely by the guardians who are the technical committees that marshal the game The IRB rule book stands alone as a definitive guide to the games progress ...the laws are fixed right across the board.
Interpretation by the referees and technical officials form the fine line between fair play and natural justice.
Sri Lanka to all intents and purposes are one of the few rugby unions in the world , and that somehow gives more publicity to the referee in charge as much as the players and team ...is this a reflection therefore of the players , the game and The dictates of the rulebook .
Referees control the game and the players provide 80 mins of intense skill and passion delivered under pressure to raucous support by the diehard fans .
With the availability of t.v. replay on big screens should be a standardised reality of every ground .the intensity in the middle is relentless and unforgiving with little or no room for error or mistakes naturally the ideal and reality carefully separate in the middle for the duration of the two teams confronting each other.
Our world entirely evolved around these facilities and technical conditions followed consistently all the way through.
Interpretation by the referee, the coach and ultimately the players are the qualities that govern a decent match delivery in the middle .
Players skill levels, instinct And competence on show for the hundred or so minutes that constitute game time.
Our resident experts and social media pundits wholl be licking there lips in anticipation of sharing there well read knowledge on team quality , player form and general skill level ....is much looked forward to
These experts not only drive the game in social media circles but are also part of rugbys wider circle at various levels.
Assuredly 95% of our experts on Facebook etc are probably played less but talk more of the game in tense appeal.
As the Dialog league hots up only Kandy and Havelocks are unbeaten so far. Defending champions Kandy, the Lions have struck form right from the start of round one, sustaining their team performance and its remarkable consistency. Coach Wijesinghe and captain Richy having the luxury of a real balanced squad and plenty of depth to cheer loudly from the cauldron in Nittawella. Kandys die hard and fanatical support contribute hugely to the teams performances at home.
There is however a variable when they play away from home which might will affect there unbeaten status this season. Playing CR at Longdon Place, Navy at Welisara camp, CH at Racecourse and Havelocks at the park under lights ....will test them on their away game mentality to the hilt.
I still believe from the comfy Heights of my deck chair , that Kandy will be under pressure , when they play these 4 teams at sea level oxygen in round 2.
Kandy carry Ratwatte, Nigel, Danushka Ranjan, Wiliweera, former captain Roshan Weeraratne and his brother Gayan hose vast experience adds plenty to their running backs in their boiler house Heshan Kalhara, hit man Sohiru Anthony, all purpose number 8 form a formidable power house for the champions.
Their schoolboy recruits blending in well with no dip in performance stats.
Heart warming to see young Dangae, Jamaldeen and the consistent form of fullback Thilina ...these factors combined quite neatly...make Kandy the team to beat yet again. For Havelocks and coach Martis Lakala and his staff...the challenge to meet Kandy head on looms large.
Kandy and Havelocks have the best chance at the league title on current form. The reliable Riza Mubarak has been in fine kicking form from the start of the season.
Havelocks will need plenty of guts, courage, skill and fire power up front to combat Kandy for the league title...the big if remains to be seen when both teams meet in Colombo and Kandy ....
For Navy and CH variable mountains to scale before they confront the champions in round 2 ..both coaches Ronny and Jayathilake questions about the quality of their players remain unanswered and can only be resolved in the middle
CH despite big names ....the ability to finish strong has been their excess baggage without allowance. Which needs them to rethink their strategy thinking under pressure and how to protect their lead in the last quarter of the game ..very little doubt that skipper, Yoshita number 10 fly half Sam Maduwantha, Naveen Heenakan, Hirantha Perera the Lee brothers, Nishon and Herath...are solid backs. But with no good ball or lacking confidence to finish has cost them dearly in the last quarter of the game hope fully skipper will inspire prop Henry and the likes of Sathiya Ranatunga, with the superbly balanced Muthu to sort things out in the loose.
Fundamental that ruck and maul ball is secured mud field for CH to strike home the big Ws.
At CR and FC captain Kavindu, Parindu Ratwatte, Dickson and Rahul de Silva give CR plenty to look forward to ..
The season so far with the exception of Army beating CH and Police upsetting Havelocks ...everything else had gone according to form ...
Pure magic this season lies ahead and will be centred around unbeaten Havelocks and Kandy specifically pursued with the sole intention of out playing them will be CR, Navy and CH. Everything boils down to performance, work rate, stats, winning their own ball and consistent defence in the middle most importantly its the injuries to key player factor that will dictate and decide the results of these much anticipated traditional grudge battles.
The fans are back, the game is thriving and the big office of rugby needs to innovate change and investment into the games elite stakeholders...that will secure the balance for the future of this great code.
The game needs believers, heart and vision.
Bula bula Sri Lankas future.
Cheers

Wickremesinghe commended the Speaker for his contribution to protect Parliamentary democracy. Accepting that there may have been certain shortcomings in his government, Wickremesinghe said,
There are shortcomings in everything. Our progress could be seen a slow march forward. But, it was steady. We moved forward while settling the debts. Our work was affected by the floods and drought. We had to face many natural disasters and the affected people had to be provided with relief while we had to continue the development drive. We continued to allocate funds on welfare measures such as education, free healthcare and housing, he added.
Parliamentary session was adjourned untill 1 pm on December 18.
Darkest hour in our democratic history - Sajith
Moving the Vote of Confidence in Parliament yesterday, Deputy UNP Leader Sajith Premadasa appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena to reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, as he commands a majority in Parliament.
Your Excellency the President, please stop wasting time. The time is right to change your decision and put things in order by reappointing Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister as he commands the majority in Parliament. Look no further, wait no more, please reappoint him, MP Premadasa said.
He said this is the darkest hour in our democratic history, adding that the Constitution has been violated a few times since October 26 brining the entire country to a grinding halt.
The issue started with the unconstitutional removal of the Prime Minister and appointing a new Prime Minister and the Cabinet that does not command at least 80 seats in Parliament. Not only that the Parliament was also dissolved and also different attractions were offered to win the hearts of the lawmakers and to switch sides. We had to take democratic moves to bring in No-Confidence Motions, motions to cut funds to office of the Prime Minister and the Ministers, he noted.
Having wilfully violated the rule of law and Constitution, they have betrayed the voters, Premadasa said,adding that even kindergarten children knew the UNF had the majority.
People were shocked to see the chilli powder attack and the slapping tof Police officers inside the Chamber of Parliament. They claim to protect and behave according to Buddhist teachings. But have violated the basic teachings of The Buddha by behaving in such a bad manner,the Deputy UNP Leader said.
He said now that they had shown over a 2/3 majority in Parliament, better safeguard what is left of their self-respect. They should accept the fact that they dont have a majority and allow us to take over the government. They are unable to chose good from bad lacking good political backgrounds, Premadasa said.
He warned that in the absence of a legal government, the country is at a crisis where development has stopped, donations held up, foreign assistance cancelled, businesses stuck along with the state sector employees now clue less of the next move.
The hospitals have run short of medicines along with many other projects that served the masses of Sri Lanka. Even the issue of school uniforms to children have come to a standstill, he said, adding that now its the opportune moment to reappoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister and prevent the country from plunging into further chaos.

Ranil created present conflict - JVP leader
The present political conflict was triggered by the Wickremesinghe led government that shifted away from the people without addressing their common aspirations, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. He also said that the way Ranil Wickremesinghe acted in the post of Prime Minister contributed much for this alienation.
While claiming JVPs fullest support to defeat the present political coup, Dissanayake observed that whoever takes over the position of the Prime Minister is not relevant to them. The Prime Minister post will be held by a person from either of the main camps. Whoever that person would be, we are sure that person cannot do much for the betterment of this country. That person will not be able to come up with a plan to initiate a good political culture or a good economic policy for this country. We do not have faith in any person from either of these camps. When it comes to Ranil Wickremesinghe, we hold the same position that we held in last April when a No Confidence Motion was brought against him, Dissanayake said.
When a new government was formed in 2015, there was a specialty in it. The power was not centered upon one particular party. Several fractions held the power. But unfortunately, one fraction, a group of persons and a single authority started to claim power. A governing party is responsible for doing the right thing. They are also responsible to make sure not to do the wrong thing as well. Wickremesinghe is responsible for doing such things that a government is not supposed to be doing, Dissanayake also said.
Dissanayake made these observations as a motion expressing confidence in Ranil Wickremesinghe was moved in Parliament yesterday. Dissanayake said the motion expressing confidence in Wickremesinghe is totally irrelevant to the JVP. Friendliness or hostility shown to us by some parties in this given situation does not matter to us in anyway. he added.
Further speaking Dissanayake said, We hold President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa responsible for this whole drama of a coup. But who created this situation Let me assure that we are in no way justifying this political coup. It is wrong and we are against it and we will do everything in our power to defeat it. That does not mean we are ready to help Ranil Wickremesinghe to reclaim his position. For the last three years, Yahapalana government failed to win the trust of the general public. Wickremesinghe is responsible for that scenario.

Shave  no  more!




There is so much pressure on women to maintain smooth and hairless skin. Hair removal may be a basic step of most womens beauty routines but a good wax - whether you do it yourself or trust a pro - requires proper prep and aftercare. Apart from the pain that inevitably comes when your hair is being pulled out from the root, waxing offers many amazing benefits. It is definitely worth it to put up with a little rain if you want to see the rainbow and the pot of gold at the end: silky smooth skin with finer regrowth.
Waxing defined
Waxing is hair removal from the root. Waxing is one of the most effective ways of removing excess or unwanted hair from the body. It involves depilation, which is the removal of the entire hair shaft from below the skins surface. It is among the most effective methods of temporary hair removal. There are many types of waxing techniques out there, with warm waxing being the most popular one.



Hair-free span
New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different human hair growth cycle.
Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, pubic hair (called bikini waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen, knuckles, and feet. There are many types of waxing methods which are suitable for removing unwanted hair in these specific locations.
The difference between Hard Wax and Strip Wax
Hard wax is meant for those very sensitive areas such as Brazilians, manzilians, underarms, face and neck. Although, if you do have a preference for strip wax on your Brazilians our Lycon Azulene strip wax is thick and soft in consistency and it doesnt stick to the skin like most strip waxes making it less painful and more comfortable. An hour after getting waxed with this strip wax you wont have that after Brazilian wax feeling because it doesnt have that skin pull.
Strip wax is recommended for large areas of the body such as legs, arms, chest and back. The wax we use is loaded with essential oils and has shrink wrapping capabilities grabbing hair as short as 2mm. This leaves you silky smooth without stubble from broken hairs. Getting a smoother wax without this shrink wrapping technology is near impossible.
Preparing your skin for a waxing treatment
Gently exfoliate your skin a day or two before waxing, but skip harsh scrubs the day of your waxing appointment.
Exfoliation helps wax grab hair and not skin, but it can also leave skin more sensitive to pain. So lighter is better. A rough washcloth is perfect for gentle exfoliation.

Compiled by Ruwini Jayawardana 
Benefits of waxing 

Smooth and even skin: One of the best benefits of waxing is that your skin will feel smooth and even. When waxing, you not only remove unwanted hair - you also wax away any dry and dead skin cells in the process!
No cuts or bruises: With waxing, you arent at risk to any cuts or nicks that can leave you with scars. This is good news, especially for those who have skin that is susceptible to discoloration due to even the slightest cut.
Stubble free skin: Waxing removes unwanted hair completely, from its roots. Shaving, on the other hand, often results in stubbles, leaving your skin feeling rough and abrasive.


Irritation and allergies-free: There are minimal chemicals involved in the waxing process, so waxing rarely causes any skin irritation or allergy.
Slow hair re-growth: After waxing, the regrowth of your hair is very slow, often taking four to six weeks. Many say that they have found their hair to be finer, after the regrowth.
Different forms of waxing 

Heated soft wax
This type of wax is mostly found in a port and is often softened by a microwave or a warmer.
It is one of the best techniques because the heat makes it easy to spread and also softens the hair and skin thereby lessening waxing pain.
Cold soft wax
Cold soft wax is taken directly from the port and applied on the skin. Even though it is convenient, it is firmer, meaning that you can have a hard time trying to get an even layer. Many people also find cold soft wax more painful than when heated. A downside to this technique is that it can leave hair behind if it is not applied properly.
Pre made strips
In this case, the pre-made strips already have the wax attached.
This type of waxing is not only easy to use, but it also leaves no chance of putting too much of the product. Depending on the amount of hair you are removing, you may use waxing strips more than once on a single area. However, it is always advisable to pre-heat the strips before using by rubbing them between your palms as this enables them to stick well on the hair.
The strip is simply placed on the skin and moved in the direction of the hair. Some of our favourite products are our waxing strips and waxing rolls, made from high-quality, all-natural cotton.
Hard waxing for hair removal
Also known as stripless waxing, this is another popular waxing method for hair removal. This is because it does not require a strip to remove hair. It is often warmed slightly, but can be used at room temperature or cold. Hard wax for hair removal is applied thicker than soft but in the direction of hair growth and works great for areas with thick hair growth. Hard wax is also useful for smaller, more sensitive areas.

SL introduces simulator training for would-be drivers
Soon driving licence applicants would have to undergo training on a simulator before taking the permanent driving licence test, National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said yesterday.
Underlining the fact that a large number of accidents are a result of unskilled drivers getting behind the wheel, Dr. Kodagoda said that therefore the use of technology such as simulators which give the real-time feel of driving is important for effective training before issuing licences to applicants.
He was speaking after inaugurating the Electronic Technical Training Centre for drivers at the Council premises. The Centre has been equipped with three simulators costing Rs.15 million donated by N.T.K Co. Ltd of Japan.
Speaking of the urgency to ensure road safety in the country, he said a person dies in a road accident every three hours and around 15 to 20 persons are injured in Sri Lanka every day. Deaths totalled 2,481 in 2,590 reported road traffic accidents during the period from January to October this year.
Every day, around 500 schoolchildren die in road accidents worldwide. Two-thirds of road accidents have been caused by motorcycles in the last few years, he said.
However, there was a reduction in the number of road accidents caused by motorcycles last year due to increased fines and other stern action taken by Traffic Police as well as the awareness programmes conducted countrywide by the Council.
Nevertheless, passenger-related fatalities showed a considerable increase last year, Dr. Kodagoda said.
Dr. Kodagoda said the WHO also estimates that road traffic fatalities will be the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. In fact, its such a big problem that the UN feels it needs an entire decade to fix it, he said.
In 2011, the UN launched a Decade of Action that aims to stabilise and then reduce global road traffic fatalities by 50 percent by 2030.
If things go as planned, we can also ask the driving schools to install the same system for vehicle learners as simulators, he said.

Prime Minister Theresa May has won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party by 200 to 117.After securing 63% of the total vote, she is now immune from a leadership challenge for a year.Speaking in Downing Street, she vowed to deliver the Brexit "people voted for" but said she had listened to the concerns of MPs who voted against her.Her supporters urged the party to move on but critics said losing the support of a third of MPs was "devastating".The prime minister won the confidence vote with a majority of 83, with 63% of Conservative MPs backing her and 37% voting against her.The secret ballot was triggered by 48 of her MPs angry at her Brexit policy, which they say betrays the 2016 referendum result.The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the level of opposition was "not at all comfortable" for the prime minister and a "real blow" to her authority.Speaking shortly after the result was announced, Mrs May said she would be fighting for changes to her Brexit deal at an EU summit on Thursday."I am pleased to have received the backing of my colleagues in tonight's ballot," she said."Whilst I am grateful for that support, a significant number of colleagues did cast a vote against me and I have listened to what they said."She spoke of a "renewed mission - delivering the Brexit people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that really works for everyone". - BBC News

TNA presses conditions on UNP to extend support
United National Front (UNF) MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led United National Party had discussed with R.Sampanthan and several other Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs about how they could go about serving Tamil people in the North.
Senaratne said this on being asked about Mondays reports that said that the TNA members,leader Sampanthan, M. Sumanthiran, Selvam Adakkelanaden and D. Sidharthan had put forward several conditions upon UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees to extend the TNAs support to the UNP.
TNA sources said the meetings they held with UNP higher-ups were successful than with any other political parties.
On being asked whether they discussed context of a new Constitution, freeing of political prisoners, release of lands currently under Sri Lanka Army to their original owners, full implementation of the 13 th Amendment, and merging of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, Senaratna said, they talked about these problems with the TNA.
We did not talk about anything eccentric. What had been discussed with the TNA, had also been discussed with President Maithripala Sirisena in no simple terms, said Senaratne.
Asked if the UNP agreed with the conditions laid out by the Tamil National Alliace, Senaratne charged that our newspaper was trying to create a bleak picture about a UNP-TNA aggregation that would divide the country.
On being pointed out that we are only interested in knowing whether the UNP has struck an agreement with TNA on the basis of some conditions laid out by the latter, Senaratne said,You may write what you want. Anyway this is going to be for a few days.
United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Gamini Lokuge said they have no reservations that UNP leader Wickremesinghe would sign anything to stay in power, irrespective of any concern to policy, national security or integrity of the country.
Asked if he meant that they do not have the support of TNA, Lokuge said, For TNA to support us we should agree with the condition put by them. 
We have clearly stated that we are against any federal or constitutional move that would put the country at the risk of being divided. Our stance is clear as regards the removal of military in the North and we will not merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces, he explained.
UNP MP Eran Wickramaratne said about this that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinge made his stance clear about it the preceding day in Parliament when he said that the solution to the national question is in an undivided unitary Sri Lanka.
A Federal solution is totally out. The TNA is also for it. They have stayed away from it and encouraging a different settlement to their problems, explained Wickramaratne.
UPFA MP S.B. Dissanayake said , All these words come from a party whose leader had actually tried to write off a portion of a three- fourths of the country to LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.
The countrymen know so well what Ranil did in 2001, he said.
As regards the TNAs condition for the full implementation of 13 th Amendment, this was exactly what the UNP was trying to do all these years.
I have reasons to think that Ranil has already signed an agreement with the TNA to give away the provisions for Police Powers and Land Powers to the North. This is no big deal for him, if he sees an opportunity to stay in power, he added.
Commenting on the prevailing conflicting situation in the country and on what Dharmallingam Siddarthan had stated, veteran archeologist Ven. Ellawala Medhananda Thera said: Which-ever political party that supports or collaborates with proposals detrimental to the well-being of the country, put forward by another political party merely to get their backing and vote for their survival, such a political party is a party that betrays the country.
While commending the Tamil community at large willing to live in harmony with other communities, Ven. Medhananda Thera pointed out that those Tamils living the Northern part of the country, said they love to preserve what is old and sacred and they have no grudge against the Sinhalese. There is a very close and cordial relationship between the Sinhala and Tamil people.It is the Sinhala and Tamil power hungry politicians who are trying to create a division between the two communities for their political survival. I have said this to the face of R. Sambandan in Parliament, while I served as a MP,, the Thera added.
Small political parties extend their support to major political parties to form a Government on conditions that are beneficial to them. The main political parties should understand this. The small parties are waiting to get the maximum benefits by bargaining for various things. They extend their support to which ever party that is ready to give in to their demands, the Thera said.
Which-ever major political party that supports or collaborates with proposals detrimental to the well-being of the country, put forward by another political party merely to get their backing and vote for their survival,this si something that cannot be tolerated as it a betrayal of the country and people, Ven. Medhananda Thera added.
Meanwhile, Parliamentarian Keheliya Rambukwella said If the Supreme Court announces its decision on the Fundamental Rights petitions filed challenging the dissolution of Parliament today or tomorrow, it will help find a speedy solution to the current political impasse, .
This situation has arisen due to postponing of the hearing of the petition on the the appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa until January 2019, he added.
Rambukwella said the Courts have taken time to resolve the political issue and in this backdrop, if a decision by the SC too gets delayed and if Mahinda Rajapaksa does not resign from the post of Prime Minister, it will be difficult to solve the issue.
He said the decision by the Court of Appeal to postpone the hearing may indicate that although some think the current political crisis is very serious, the Appeal Court may not be of the same mindset.
Speaking on the current political scenario, CAFFE Director Keerthi Tennakoon was of the view that steps need to be taken to resolve the issue without further delay.If not, it would have a major impact on the countrys economy. It would be disastrous if one allows the present crisis to prolong, as it could adversely affect the economy.
According to Tennakoon, there are three ways to resolve the present political crisis:Firstly,to get the verdict from the Supreme Court in quick time; secondly, to create the necessary atmosphere to appoint a new Prime Minister and thirdly, to take prudent measures to resolve the crisis and stabililise the political and economic situation by forming an All Party Government.
He also said that an Interim Order of the Supreme Court does not prevent the appointment of a suitable person as Prime Minister together with a Cabinet. It has only temporally stopped Mahinda Rajapaksa and 49 other Members from functioning in their posts.

Towards social and moral enhancement
Ever spiraling crime rate in the country and our drastically eroding image in foreign climes compels me to give vent to my opinion with the sole purpose of contributing even in a humble manner to find a long term solution to this perennial problem which has spread into our blood stream of social life.
The other day, I had to hide my face in utter despair when two foreigners were talking about our countrys status quo with regard to body politics, constitutional crisis and judiciary at Queensland railway station in Australia where at present I am on a one year visa. I came here with the purpose of making a deep study into the history of aborigines as an armchair study and to help my daughter in babysitting.
The supreme bliss of grand parenting has now badly spoilt due to various sentiments that have crept into my fragile mind among them the sorry state of affairs at home. I have always advised them to return to motherland as soon as finishing their studies and other undertakings. How can I answer their numerous questions now with a firm heart when the country is on the doldrums and sitting on a volcano An old sage in India once said in Sanskrit, mother and the native land are more excellent than swarga.
Learning process
My concern here is to trace the true cause of the prevalent situation from a psycho-sociological point of view. In education, the teachers look at the child who comes to his feet as an innocent bundle of inherent potentials. He or she is duty bound to facilitate his learning process in such a way that the child would become a useful citizen for the country. How many of them have or would meet that set goal in education at the end of their learning process. Who is responsible for this crucial situation The king once told Socrates to make his subjects controllable and in reply he asked the king to give all the children below five to honour the request. The king told him in angry words that he himself could control the toddlers without his help. During the good old days, a kings request was tantamount to a royal command. The cardinal truth behind that is when a child reaches five his personality is moulded.
The above word would suffice for me to proceed along my train of thought towards finding a workable solution for this problem. Newspapers are laden with the latest news of broad day light killings without an iota of kindness to civil life. Bank robberies, drug trafficking, divorce, debauchery, bribery and corruption, santhosams for sweeping rackets and other nefarious activities under the carpet, diabolical offences committed by members of the clergy, to cap them all disgusting behaviour of some parents, teachers, and also of the officers of the arm of law seem to destroy the whole country and the nation. There is no way to come out of this treacherous bog of cultural decadence. In this backdrop law has become a lucrative profession.
In educational methodology and psychology person is divided into three categories namely cognitive domain, affective domain and psychomotor domain. The proportional development of these domains is basically the bounden duty of the teacher. For that they are given a profound knowledge at different colleges of education and teacher training and universities at government expense. The ongoing situation compels me to allege them as a party responsible for this chaotic situation.
The cognitive domain is the brain in plain language. The cognitive skills of the growing child have to be catered with surgical accuracy. The development of the brain is of paramount importance. Cognizance of the child could decide many an aspect of the overall development. The brain is sub divided into several faculties such as memory, thinking, creativity, decision making, attitude formation and mental balance.
The primary purpose of education according to Pearson is the development of thinking, creativity and attitudes. In other words, a balanced development of a child basically depends on the cognitive aspect according to educational psychologists such as Jean Piaget, Roosevelt, Pavlov. Pearson and other prominent educationists have devised time tested methods to develop these faculties of the children through hard labour and longtime experiments. Modern teachers should essentially become facilitators to meet this growing need of the young generation. Abraham Lincolns letter to his sons teacher could be a constant guide for teachers.
Social outcasts and undesirable elements
Affective domain is the heart. Kindness, compassion, gratitude, feelings, and other much needed aspects of the population are catered to in the systematic development of this domain. Through different activities and projects, the aforementioned aspects could be projected into the heart of the child in his formative years. When there is a vacuum in the heart devoid of these qualities, the child at later stages behaves deadly against his own fellow men. Under the influence of liquor and drugs his behaviour could be more aggressive and dangerous. Eventually they become social outcasts and undesirable elements posing a formidable threat to the society.
The recent unforgivable scenes in the parliament at our expense and stabbing cases of the students vividly drive home the idea that most of the people in the contemporary society have big holes in their hearts, hole in heart I mean here a vacuum in heart and it has to be filled at the latest or else the whole society would be enveloped in a hellish situation.
Psychomotor domain is limbs. The development of the psychomotor aspect is of great significance for the physical development of the child. The old adage says that it is the healthy body that decides a healthy mind to a great extent. Nutritious food, stress free life, physical exercises, climatic conditions and hereditary factors decide ones development of the psychomotor aspect of personality development.
Then only one can lead a god life. Ironically, the recent spate of unruly acts of children, adults and responsible citizens of the country display a lack of expected level of psychomotor development. The activities of the limbs should be essentially controlled by the brain and heart. The nation needs this monitoring for the wider interest of the fellow beings.
In my opinion, the leaders of the country together with the teachers and the clergy could devise a pragmatic approach to arrest the deteriorating social well-being of the nation before it would totally cripple in near future. Making prisons and enacting laws would not prove fruitful. In our forward march towards a global village it could be a great contribution.

UNF struggle to establish good governance - Rajitha
The United National Front (UNF) will initiate a crucial struggle to establish democracy and good governance in the country by December 17, said Parliamentarian Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
We will bring the people on to the streets demanding the authorities concerned to establish democracy and good governance by adhering to the decisions of the Legislature where the people will surround government offices too, he said. Speaking at a press conference at Temple Trees yesterday, Dr.Senaratne said that the Police should discharge their duties in accordance with the law of the country and they cannot indulge in illegal activities to pacify politicians with vested interests.
We have established an Independent Police Commission and Police officers cannot act according to the whims and fancies of politicians, he said
He asked the Police as to what action is going to be taken against Civil Society activist Saman Ratnapriya, citing that his recent remarks fanned the flames of hatred among the people.

UNP urges the President to hold a Presidential election
President Maithripala Sirisena can get a clear picture about peoples consent by holding a Presidential Election instead of wasting Rs 4.5 billion in vain for holding a referendum, United National Party Parliamentarian Ajith P. Perera said.
Perera was addressing media today at Temple Trees.
He added it can be presumed that the President is going to hold a referendum with a view to receive peoples opinion on the dissolution of the Parliament. But holding a referendum is considered as an utterly wasting millions of public funds and time since the President can have an idea about public consent by holding a Presidential Election. According to him a sum of Rs 4,500 million is needed for holding a referendum and a presidential election can also be held with that amount of money.
Then UNP urges the President to hold a Presidential election if he wants to seek the public opinion instead of holding a referendum with using Rs. 4,500 million in vain Perera said.
Speaking on the vote on confidence, which passed in the parliament to prove UNP leader Ranil Wickremasinghe commends the confidence of Parliament to function as Prime Minister, he said it is not abnormal that the Tamil National Alliance has been supporting the UNP and the former government where necessary. The TNA, which has now come democratic stream is labelled as terrorist organisation or as separatists by certain SLFP and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna members, he said.
Parliamentarian Kawinda Jayawardana said that countrys economy has severely affected by this present political crisis. Accordingly, tourist arrival has come down by half. An amount of around Rs. 32 billion of foreign investments has been taken away by now, he said. 
He requested people, who love to strengthen the democracy and against the violation of constitution to rally round with the UNP lead continuous protect campaign scheduled to be launch from next 17th.

## Title: What is next for middle-income Asia and Sri Lanka
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

What is next for middle-income Asia and Sri Lanka
Decades of sustained economic growth have left the Asia-Pacific with few lower-income countries. Absolute poverty levels are and will continue to keep falling. This is cause for celebration. But it also requires a new partnership between countries and development institutions to tackle the challenges that arise as Asia becomes an upper middle-income continent. The narrative in Sri Lanka should shift from a costly domestic political crisis to a national debate on development priorities.
Asias achievement
The scale of change in Asia is immense. In 1990, more than 80 percent of the worlds population living below the extreme poverty line (estimated at US$ 1.90 per day, measured at purchasing power parity) were either in East Asia and the Pacific, or South Asia. Today, that number is far smaller and getting smaller still. By 2030, just 0.1 percent of the population of East Asia is expected to live below the extreme poverty line. In South Asia, the figure will be only 2 percent.
Put another way, half of the worlds population in 2025 will likely live in Asian middle-income countries. Today, almost all of the regions nations already enjoy middle-income status. And more are moving beyond a US$ 4,000 per capita income, signifying a shift from lower middle-income to upper middle-income status. By 2025, only Afghanistan and Nepal are expected to remain officially poor.
This progress is positive. Millions have been lifted out of extreme poverty over the past decade alone, with just as many now benefitting from improved education and health. But it also requires a rethink of the policy obstacles that Asian countries must now overcome, and the way in which they interact with bilateral and multilateral development institutions.
Middle-income challenge
Middle-income status does not mean development gets suddenly easier. While Asias growth still outpaces global growth, it has slowed since the global financial crisis. This has led some to argue that Asia is facing a middle-income trap, where growth slows after reaching middle-income levels and the transition to high-income levels seems a distant prospect. Malaysia and Indonesia are often mentioned as examples.
Equally worrying is that several middle-income Asian economies suffer from persistent pockets of poverty, while their people remain vulnerable to sudden changes in income. Some countries continue to confront fragile situations associated with long-term and often sub-national conflict. Afghanistan has seen three decades of armed conflict between the government and the Taliban, while Myanmar is engulfed in a crisis involving the Rohingya people.1
Ageing populations are another challenge, particularly China, South Korea and East Asia.2 This will translate into rising dependency ratios, increasing elderly care costs and probably higher taxation.
Moving nations out of extreme poverty also tells us little about the extent to which their people are vulnerable to falling backwards. This vulnerable group of people  those who hover precariously above the poverty line but do not advance quickly towards middle-class status  is expanding in Asia. In countries from India to Indonesia to the Philippines and Bangladesh, this category now covers hundreds of millions of citizens.
Although growth has lifted millions above the breadline, the quality of that growth has not always been pro-poor. Recent decades of growth have often exacerbated income inequality levels across Asia. Gini coefficients (a common measure of income equality) have declined in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea.3
Tackling these challenges requires different policies by governments in Asia, both to continue to push growth but also to make it more equitable. Improving innovation, tertiary and vocational education, digital infrastructure, financial access for small businesses, elderly care and pensions systems and institutions can help put Asia on the path to developed, high-income status.
These policies should be tailored to individual national circumstances along with gradual opening up. The days of transplanting a one-size fits all development model  be it a Washington neo-liberal consensus or a Beijing consensus of an eclectic approach to free markets and a big role for state enterprise  are over.
Questions for Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka aspires to become an upper-middle income economy. In 2019, however, the country faces the prospect of tepid growth of four percent or thereabouts with rising inequality. Additionally, a debt to GDP ratio well in excess of 70 percent and downgrading of debt rating implies limited head room for raising public expenditure. This depressing domestic economic scenario could be complicated by unpredictable weather affecting agriculture, and political instability. Multiple global risks are also looming on the countrys horizon including escalating trade tensions between the US and China, capital outflows from emerging markets, and geopolitical tensions.
Once the political dust settles, a national debate is needed to move on from the political crisis to a policy agenda for the next couple of years. Seven important questions come to mind:
1. How does political uncertainty affect private investment and growth
2. Do high debt service payments mean fiscal austerity
3. How can lagging productivity be improved
4. How might the digital economy take root
5. Is rising inequality temporary or permanent
6. How can the cost of living be reduced and development be spread outside Colombo
7. What economic reforms are necessary
Successful countries from Korea to Singapore have spent time finding answers to these issues and forging a national policy consensus for their economic development. Sri Lanka could productively follow suit.
New policies and donor role
Asias new middle-income era also poses questions for development institutions.4 Improved income status means Asias development finance landscape is quickly changing. As countries become wealthier, the sources of finance and financial instruments available to them will change, as will the volumes of aid they receive, and the conditions attached to it. Borrowing from international capital markets will become crucial, with rating agencies influencing the terms on which they can do so.
Middle-income status is often considered a signal for a successful development trajectory  hence the rationale for development institutions to play a progressively smaller role. But development institutions should not move from an aid relationship with Asia to simply no relationship at all.
Instead, they need to create a new and different kind of relationship, based at first on a mixture of aid and trade, and eventually trade and private investment alone  in the process finding new ways to help transform Asian nations whose development journeys are only at most mid-way complete.

Shanghai, Wednesday: World badminton champion Kento Momota made a lightning start at the BWF World Tour Finals in China on Wednesday, rampaging past Indias overwhelmed Sameer Verma in just 36 minutes.
The Japanese star is looking to put the seal on a breakthrough year in which he has risen to number one in the rankings and become world champion for the first time.
It is all a far cry from 2016, when Momota was expelled from Japans team for the Rio Olympics and banned for more than a year for visiting an illegal casino.
The 24-year-old had too much quality and power for Verma -- ranked 14th in the world -- thrashing him 21-18, 21-6 to confirm his status as the man to beat in Guangzhou.
Also untroubled in her opener was the womens number one, Tai Tzu-ying from Tawian, who defeated Zhang Beiwen of the United States 21-15, 21-17 in 30 minutes. AFP

Cause of death yet to be determined
The cause of death of an elephant found dead recently in a bed of water hyacinth in the Janaranjana wewa in Suriyapura, has not yet been confirmed, Wildlife Conservation Department officials said.
Officials said since the carcass of the elephant had not been removed from the tank, a postmortem was yet to be held. They said they were unable to drag the carcass ashore as the water level in the tank had risen.
Officials added that it had finally been decided by a group of Wildlife officers led by Veterinary Surgeon Sameera Kalinga Arachchi, to remove the carcass using a backhoe and commence the investigation.
Wildlife officers said that they observed a wound on the face of the animal.
They also said that a few farmers in the locality had seen the elephant lingering in the area.
It had trouble walking as well, they added.

Awaiting a crucial decision
Sri Lankas constitutional crisis is now into its eighth week and continues to dominate headlines and retain public interest because, at the time of writing, the nation is awaiting the crucial determination from the Supreme Court as to whether the dissolution of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena was constitutional or not.
Submissions to the Supreme Court by the petitioners representing the United National Party (UNP) led United National Front (UNF), the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the intervenient petitioners representing President Sirisena as well as the interests of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) continued until the end of last week.
While the Supreme Court had initially indicated December 7 as the end date for its Interim Order restraining the dissolution of Parliament, it later conveyed that this order will be in force until the court delivers its verdict.
If the battleground has shifted from the corridors of power in Parliament to the halls of Hulftsdorp, there was no scarcity of legal issues being forwarded for determination by the courts of law last week by interested parties on behalf of both the government and the opposition.
Monday saw two fundamental rights petitions being filed in the Supreme Court and another petition being filed in the Court of Appeal. The first of these was a fundamental rights petition filed by Dambara Amila Thera against the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe from the premiership and the appointment of a new Prime Minister and a Cabinet. The petition was taken up by a three-member bench including Buwaneka Aluwihare, Sisira De Abrew and Murdu Fernando and fixed for further hearing on January 7.
Also on Monday, a fundamental rights petition was filed against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya accusing him of Contempt of Court by convening Parliament and passing various motions including a motion of no confidence, after the Supreme Court stayed the gazette dissolving Parliament.
Independence of the court
The petitioner, Attorney Aruna Laksiri Unawatuna, argues that by convening Parliament when the Supreme Court has stayed the gazette dissolving Parliament and passing various motions including a no-Confidence motion the Speaker has not only violated the constitution but also has attempted to influence the independence of the court in a negative manner.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes turn. Sharmila Gonawela, a member of the Colombo Municipal Council representing the SLPP filed a petition in the Court of Appeal seeking a Quo Warranto order to prevent Wickremesinghe from continuing as a parliamentarian.
In her petition, Gonawela said Wickremesinghe was disqualified from being a Member of Parliament as his appointment is illegal as a company he was a shareholder of, Lake House Printers and Publishers, was doing business with state organisations and institutions. She has alleged that this is in violation of Article 91(1)(e) of the Constitution and also cites a previous case, Dilan Perera vs. Rajitha Senaratne.
Also on Tuesday, after media had reported that the President would seek to expedite the hearing of the fundamental rights application against the dissolution of Parliament, Attorney Aruna Laksiri filed a motion in the Supreme Court against these purported moves.
Through his motion the petitioner says that the Presidents reported request to Chief Justice Nalin Perera through the Attorney General to expedite the verdict on the petitions filed against the dissolution of parliament was publicised in the media and argues that such a request would lead to an impediment in examining the case in a proper manner.
The current impasse is however not totally because of the legal issues involved. There has been dialogue between President Sirisena and the UNF but there is a deadlock because of the Presidents decision not to nominate Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and the UNFs insistence that their nominee is none other than Wickremesinghe.
The President held a discussion with the UNF last week to explore means of resolving the current crisis, where Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Cabinet have been restrained from functioning. At this discussion, the stumbling block was the issue of Wickremesinghes re-nomination as Prime Minister.
The President maintains it is his prerogative to nominate his Premier as the Constitution states that the person nominated should, in the opinion of the President be appointed to that post. However, the UNF maintains that such a person should also command the confidence of Parliament and that in this instance, only Wickremesinghe is able to do so, albeit with the support of the TNA. The JVP has categorically stated that they would not endorse Wickremesinghe in Parliament for the Premiership.
President Sirisena was to reiterate his stance when he addressed a special session of the SLFP. In his speech which received wide publicity, he declared that he would not reappoint Wickremesinghe even if all 225 members of Parliament endorsed him.
Differences of opinion
Many saw this statement as an indication of how deep the differences of opinion are between the President and his former Prime Minister. That is ironical because Wickremesinghe was instrumental in convincing the UNP to accede to a common candidate at the 2015 presidential election and also in campaigning to win UNP votes for who was then the SLFPs longest serving General Secretary.
However, President Sirisena has countered accusations that he was being ungrateful stating that he allowed Wickremesinghe to govern and take decisions very much on his own, out of a sense of gratitude. However, he can no longer do so because it is detrimental to the country, the President argues.
The President has also dismissed speculation in some circles that he could opt for a snap presidential election. If there is a snap presidential election, only I have to declare it. I have no intention of doing so. I am not ready to comply with the political agendas of others, the President told a newspaper. When asked whether he would contest for a second term at the presidential election scheduled for later next year, he said it was too early to decide on it.
Others have suggested that, should the Supreme Court hold that the dissolution of Parliament was inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, the President should explore the possibility of holding a referendum on the issue. However, the propriety of holding a referendum to circumvent a court decision as well as the enormous costs involved are significant deterrents to this option.
Clearly, all options are on the table. President Sirisena has categorically stated that he would abide by the Supreme Court decision on the dissolution of Parliament, whatever it may be. That will be a landmark verdict that will be watched keenly locally and internationally. It will also determine the direction which this political tussle will take in the months to come.

Baseball coaching camp, a big success
The Womens Baseball Federation of Japan conducted five-day Baseball Coaching Camp in Sri Lanka in cooperation with the Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Amateur Baseball /Softball Federation.
The five members came to Sri Lanka under the program called Sport for Tomorrow, sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan to bring the joy of sports directly to ten million people in over one hundred countries by the time the Olympic torch reaches Tokyo in 2020 and to spread the value of sport for the future generation.
The Womens Baseball Federation of Japan had two main objectives of visiting Sri Lanka, namely, 1) to spread the joy and excitement of baseball to those women and girls who are not familiar with baseball and 2) to share the skills and techniques to those already active female players to improve their performance.
The first objective has been achieved through 3-day camps with the participation of more than 100 beginners in Kandy on December 6 and 7 as well as nearly 50 beginners, including students from Kelaniya University, Sri Jayawardenapura University, Sirimavo high school and Magedera high school, in Diyagama (Japan-Sri Lanka Friendship Ground) on December 10.
As for the second objective, they conducted a baseball coaching camp for female players of Sri Lanka Army and Navy from December 7 to 9 at Japan-Sri Lanka Friendship Ground.
Milka Priyadarshani, captain of Army team said this is the first time to be trained by Japanese coaches in my 4-year career. So I deeply appreciate this valuable opportunity. S.W.S.M Wickramarathna, captain of Navy team said I have learnt a lot through this coaching camp. They are very kind and friendly, we enjoyed a lot. Simply it was very fun!
At the farewell ceremony held in Ambassadors residence on December 10, Akira Sugiyama, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, expressed his appreciation for the Sri Lankan players enthusiastic participation and was impressed by their passion for baseball, and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to all those who made this camp possible, especially the Sri Lanka Amateur Baseball / Softball Association headed by Fazil Hussain.

Jurassic Park A cinematic spectacle
My favourite film, book, soundtrack and videogame all have one thing in common: Jurassic Park. My love for the film, and the extent to which it has influenced me, cannot be expressed by mere words. Whether in music, my interest in palaeontology or even in writing, Jurassic Park has been influential.
Spielbergs film is superbly crafted, with some of the most awe-inspiring and terrifying sequences in cinematic history. However, there is one moment that truly defines this movie, and the magic it possesses. The Welcome to Jurassic Park sequence is not only my favourite moment of cinema, but also one of the most impactful and revolutionary scenes of all time.
This scene perfectly captures the wonder of seeing a dinosaur for the very first time. Three essential factors contribute towards this, and the first of these is the dinosaur itself. In this case, the dinosaur is an eighty foot, fifty ton Brachiosaurus. With its imperial, giraffe like profile and elegant stance, the simple sight of it striding to feed from the treetops is mesmerising. Its ethereal call and the way the ground quakes with its every step truly capture its magnificence. The groundbreaking special effects, perhaps the most influential aspect of the film, brought this docile herbivore to life in the best possible way.
Its one thing to reconstruct a dinosaur. Its another to pretend to see one. Acting is another essential factor that immerses the audience in a film, and the cast of Jurassic Park did not fail in their performances. The characters of Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are portrayed brilliantly by Sam Neill and Laura Dern, reflecting the reactions of any palaeontologist or dinosaur enthusiast. Even the sarcastic mathematician, Ian Malcolm, portrayed by Jeff Goldblum, cannot help but grin in joy at the sight. The reactions of the characters were the mirror images of the audiences reactions. These reactions were significant for two reasons. The more obvious reason is the wonder of the special effects themselves. Such quality visuals were as new to the audience as the resurrected dinosaurs were to the characters. Secondly, and more importantly, the depiction of dinosaurs in the film was unlike anything ever seen in cinema. For generations, dinosaurs were presented as ugly, dim and unrealistically vicious monsters. Jurassic Park would forever change that perception, and audiences were able to see dinosaurs for what they were: elegant, active and reasonably intelligent creatures.
The final, essential factor is perhaps the one that binds all the aforementioned qualities together, and one that is unfortunately overlooked in modern times: the music. While John Williams may indeed be a god in composing; his soundtracks for Star Wars, Superman, Harry Potter and many others being regarded in legendary status, his soundtrack for Jurassic Park was indescribably extraordinary. Never since Star Wars had Williamss themes been so powerful and absolutely perfect in representing various concepts. For the Welcome to Jurassic Park sequence Williams used the films main theme to represent the majesty and splendour of the dinosaurs. Beginning as a grand, stately melody, the theme grows in strength and grandeur, parallel to the characters increasing amazement. This theme is the final part of this near perfect sequence. As the park is presented to us, the theme reaches a spectacular crescendo unparalleled in film history, and as it finally fades away, signalling the end of the sequence, we can be left with no doubt that we are in for the cinematic experience of a lifetime.
Welcome to Jurassic Park is more than just a scene. It is a sequence showcasing every element required to make a standout scene, and revolutionised, not just filmmaking, but how we see these leviathans of the past. The whole world was able to watch, spellbound, as dinosaurs walked the earth for the first time in sixty-five million years. For many, this scene defines a moment of their childhood and, twenty-five years later, stands the test of time, as a moment of movie magic. This scene has influenced me more than anything, and continues to do so. The fact that I cant help but grin every time I watch it is definitive proof that this moment must surely be cinema at its most spectacular.

Cinnamon Sweeps National Tourism Awards 2018
Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts swept away six awards at the Sri Lanka Tourism Awards 2018 held recently where they were recognized for the unique initiatives that contributed to the hospitality industry.
Cinnamon was the only brand to win more than two awards in all categories which were intensely fought by all leading leisure brands in the country.

The brand Cinnamon aims to set new standards to hospitality in the country in order to create a unique proposition for Sri Lanka as an island that offers myriad activities for the international visitor.
The Cinnamon Magazine, a bi-monthly lifestyle magazine, received the award for the Best Print Media Presentation on travel and tourism.

People should elect prudent MPs
People should elect MPs who are acting with or showing care and thought for the future. MPs have to be prudent enough to handle fiscal and monetary matters of the country.
Currently, the country is facing a non virtuous cycle of debt and is a very fragile situation which can even lead to a debt crisis, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy has said. He was speaking at the Presidential Commission related to SriLankan Airlines.
We must take this advice seriously and take suitable corrective action.
We thank Dr. Coomaraswamy for giving this advice.
Fiscal means relating to government revenue. Fiscal policy is how the government uses taxing and spending to expand the economic growth.
Monetary means relating to money, specially the total amount of money in a country. Monetary policy is the process by which the monetary authority of a country, controls either the cost of very short term borrowings or the monetary base, often targeting an inflation or interest rate to ensure stability and general trust in the country.
When we appoint Members of Parliament, they should have a knowledge of these important principles.
Let us think about this when cast our votes at the next election.
We thank again Dr. Coomaraswamy for his excellent advice to citizens of this country. It is our duty to take this advice seriously and elect prudent MPs.

Dialog, Ideamart Partner with Earth Networks
Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider, and Ideamart, announced the launch of an aggregate weather solution, Weather Guru, in partnership with Earth Networks, the largest global hyperlocal weather network providing weather intelligence data to organisations and governments worldwide.
Understanding the importance of highly accurate weather forecasts and predictions to facilitate safe and productive operations of the aviation, shipping, government, military, agriculture, fisheries and tourism industries among others, WeatherGuru aims to provide fully automated, industrialised weather sensors capable of capturing parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, precipitation, UV index and more, including Sri Lankas first lightning sensor via weather stations and weather kits deployed island wide.
Additionally, using Dialogs advanced Internet of Things (IoT) platform, both developers and enterprise users will now be able to access real-time weather data, weather forecasts and alerts via APIs in order to create their own, personalised weather-related solutions.
Users may also utilise the web-based dashboard to visualise real-time and historical weather data, along with regional and location based weather forecasts and alerts.
Moreover, the capacity to combine weather forecasts and alerts with different telco and IoT services has been made possible with weather widgets on I Say You Do, Dialogs platform that assists users with automating tasks and activities to create personalised and convenient solutions.
Speaking on the launch, Anthony Rodrigo, Group Chief Innovation Officer and Chief Architect, Dialog Axiata PLC, said, The agriculture industry requires specific weather variables and derivatives given that Sri Lankas monsoon season spans over six months. WeatherGurus forecasting capability will enhance the offerings provided through the Dialog GoviMithuru service by providing farmers with actionable weather advisory services tailored for the crops they grow.
Dialog WeatherGuru, along with the Wi-Fi based and USB powered weather kits will convert weather stations which previously required the manual recording, plotting and analyzing of data by weather professionals, a time and resource consuming process, into automated stations resulting in the collection of more accurate data at a much faster pace. Real-time weather data collected from multiple smart weather stations will be sent to a single weather platform where forecasting tools combine sensor data with thermal maps and radar and satellite information, to generate more accurate weather forecasts. Further, this information can be produced daily, hourly or as 10-day forecasts, inclusive of weather and lightning alerts.

The estimated average congestion cost in Colombo Metropolitan area per day has increased approximately to Rs one billion, said Dr. Don Jayaweera, Transport Economist, Financial Analyst, Project Management Associate International (Pvt.) Ltd. Dr. Jayaweera also emphasized the effect on the traffic, highlighting the fact that the operated vehicle kilometers has increased, but not the passenger kilometersduring the recent past.
He was speaking at the 16th John Diandas Memorial Lecture, organized by The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) at the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka recently.
He outlined the reforms attempts in the bus sector, unresolved supply side issues considered for bus sector reforms and key features of the SAHASARA bus passenger reforms project followed by the evaluation of some of the transport development projects and proposals. The detailed statistics in the presentation showed background information which consist of the economic data, basic market demand on car ownership and fuel consumption of transport sector.
Then he deliberated on bus sector reform strategy for 2018 under conceptual outline of SAHASARA which is identified as a cost-free solution for the national transport problem.
The basis for SAHASARA is that the total daily income of a bus operator should not depend on the number of passengers who board that particular bus. Rather, it should be determined by the total take of all buses plying a route on a given day which should then be fairly distributed among all operators based on the total number of turns each bus plied its route.
The audience raised many questions on the details of the SAHASARA project and made a number of constructive suggestions for consideration in the implementation. Some of the industry leaders such as Prof. Amal Kumarage, FCILT and Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan, FCILT actively participated the session. CILT is a leading global professional body associated with the logistics and transport industry.

Floriculture products muster  over US$ 16 mn in 2017
Sri Lanka has earned around US$ 16 million in 2017 by exporting floriculture products. Of that 39% of products are exported as live plants while 60 percent of them were exported as cut foliage.
And also, the world demand for ornamental plant production in 2017 is nearly US$ 19 billion which is Sri Lankan share is only 0.17 percent.
Floriculture industry is considered a high income generating agribusiness and it can potentially be harnessed as a means of socioeconomic development in Sri Lanka. Also, this sector can be identified as one of the opportunities to get womens contribution to the national economy. It will enable the empowerment of womens workforce while improving the standard of living. To cater the export market, ornamental plants should be made in uniform quality in large quantities. Prior to the export, the plant quarantine certificate should be obtained according to the importing country regulations. Since current production is not sufficient, the EDB has identified that new investments need to be promoted with the technological knowhow.
These views were expressed at a full day workshop on production of ornamental plants, held at the EDB auditorium held on December 4, 2018.
The workshop was organized by Lanka Export Development Board in collaboration with National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS), Department of National Botanic Gardens (DNBG) and Sri Lanka floriculture industry experts.
The objective of this workshop is to encourage new investments in ornamental plant production for export market whilst improving the product quality. The workshop was organized for Floriculture Exporters/ Potential Exporters and Suppliers.
With the development of higher living standards of the world, people have started to buy more ornamental plants for personal use as well as for gifts. Also companies, at events, weddings and recreation purposes people have shown the use of more flowers and plants for indoor decorations. In Europe and USA there is a trend in bringing nature back in the daily life, by using natural ornamental plants. Therefore, there is a demand for best quality ornamental plants in the global market.

Freedom of expression, a key right - Civil Society organizations
Civil Society organizations which supported President Maithripala Sirisena as the then Common Candidate in 2015, yesterday urged that he should not disrupt the citizens freedom of expression.
Speaking in support of their fellow member, Trade Union Leader Saman Ratnapriya, who made a controversial statement on the fate of autocratic rulers recently, they said freedom of expression is the right of the people and they were fighting for that even before President Sirisena became the Common Candidate at the Presidential Election in 2015.
A few organizations, including the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya supporting President Sirisena, had lodged a complaint with the Police against this statement.
National Movement for a Just Society Convener Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya explained that the statement made by Ratnapriya was just an example and therefore, the President has no moral right to undermine the people who are expressing their ideas.
But, he could response to them if he was not agreeable with those ideas, Wijesurya said.
All these incidents are the consequences of the October 26 coup. As citizens, we have a right to speak against it under the democratic framework, he added.
Purawesi Balaya Organization Co-Convener Gamini Viyangoda pointed out that the freedom of expression is a key right recognized by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Sri Lanka has also agreed.
The statement of Ratnapriya was just political criticism. He has the right for that, Viyangoda added.
Some racist organizations have made this complaint with the police on the sanction of the President. However, it is totally a suppression of the freedom of expression, Viyangoda said.
Co-Convener of the Purawesi Balaya Organization K.W. Janaranjana also addressed the media.

He was making reference to the decision of the TNA to support UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament and the much claimed agreement between the UNP and the TNA.The TNA which acted as the political arm of the LTTE then, is now out to realise their aspirations, that they could not achieve with guns. It was Champika who called the TNA as Tigers and said he wished to see that party banned.
That very party now supports the UNP and I wish to know where Champika Ranawaka stands now and the people are watching, Gammanpila told the media.
Gammanpila went onto say that the Confidence Motion passed in Parliament has no bearing, even if has the support of the 225 Members and not 117.There is no vacancy for him to be Prime Minister for so far Mahinda Rajapaksa has not vacated the seat and there is no Court decision to remove him from the seat either. what the UNP should have done was bring a No Confidence Motion in through the proper channel and create a vacancy in the post.

The month of December belongs to Sara Ali Khan. At long last, after a stretch of three years and some more, the daughter of Saif Ali Khan and his former wife Amrita Singh, is being launched with two high-profile films: Abhishek Kapoors Kedarnath and Rohit Shettys Simmba.
In fact, 2018 may well be remarkable for introducing two Bollywood family talents: Sara and Janhvi Kapoor, daughter of the late Sridevi and Boney Kapoor. The latter made her debut with the well-liked Dhadak, opposite Ishaan Khatter, which was produced by Karan Johar. Both in terms of personality and attitude, the debutantes seem to have what it takes to become quintessential Bollywood heroines.
Indeed, from the moment Sara was in her teenage years, she had been noticed by filmmakers who wished to cast her in their films as soon as she was ready to take the plunge into show business.
As for the incessantly watchful Bollywood grapevine, so far they have linked her with Anil Kapoors son Harshvardhan and one Veer Pahariya, who comes from a political family. However, right now it is being said that she is unattached, and is focusing on her career.

GMOA calls for SLSFTA report to be made public
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) on Tuesday demanded the release of the expert committee report on the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) into the public domain.
The Committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to study the agreement handed over its report to the President on Monday.
The Association also insisted that charges should be framed against those who were involved in drafting this agreement which is detrimental to the country.
The GMOA added that former Minister Malik Samarawickrama took efforts to stifle stiff opposition to the agreement to achieve his personal agenda.
According to GMOAs Dr Prasad Colombage, those who betrayed the country by drafting this agreement should be brought to light and legal action should be instituted against them without delay.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, he said the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement would have been implemented if the GMOA had not intervened to make the authorities aware of its consequences to the country
He added that the GMOA had insisted that this agreement is detrimental to the country long before it was signed. Only then did political parties raise their eyebrows over the agreement.
Dr Colombage said that his Association had to resort to trade union action demanding that the government suspend this agreement. Our organisation foresaw that the service sector in the country would head towards collapse if this agreement came into force.
He said that the GMOA studied the agreement and then the government agreed that there were many clauses under which an environment had been created for foreigners to exploit national assets for a song.
He said that his Association joined the professional fraternity in the country to raise its voice against this agreement. The GMOA had a series of discussions with the President over this agreement and the President gave an assurance that an expert committee would be appointed to study and report on the agreement, he said.
The GMOA saved the country by convincing the authorities of the adverse impacts of the agreement. The GMOA had laid the foundation for this national endeavour, he said.
He said that his organisation pointed out the pitfalls of striking bilateral trade deals without having a proper national trade policy. The previous government allowed waste to be dumped in Sri Lanka. Even an ordinary citizen would not agree to these types of clauses, if he loved his motherland, he said.

Hunt for Strasbourg Christmas market gunman
FRANCE: Hundreds of Security Forces personnel were Wednesday deployed in the hunt for a lone gunman who killed at least three people and wounded a dozen others at the famed Christmas market in Strasbourg, with the French government raising the security alert level and reinforcing border controls.
Some 350 people, including police, troops and helicopters were on the heels of the attacker who had sowed terror in the city, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said.
The killer opened fire at around 8 pm on one of the citys busiest streets, sending crowds of evening shoppers fleeing for safety.
Castaner said the gunman had killed three people and wounded 12.
Soldiers patrolling the area as part of regular anti-terror operations exchanged fire with the suspect and wounded him, but could not stop him escaping, police sources said. A soldier was slightly injured by a ricohet from a shot by the gunman.
Castaner also said France had raised its security alert level to emergency attack with the implementation of reinforced border controls and tightened controls on all Christmas markets in France to avoid the risk of a copycat attack.
The gunman has been identified and was on a watchlist of suspected extremists, a statement from local security services said.
Frances security forces, already on high alert after a series of terror attacks since 2015, are particularly stretched at the moment due to anti-government protests that have swept the country.
I heard shooting and then there was pandemonium, one witness, who gave his name as Fatih, told AFP. People were running everywhere. He said he had seen three people injured on the ground only a few metres (feet) from the giant Christmas tree in the centre of the city.
Shortly after the shooting, lines of police vehicles and ambulances streamed into the market area, under festive lights declaring the city the capital of Christmas. We heard several shots, three perhaps, and we saw people running, one witness told AFP, asking not to be named.
One of them fell down, I dont know whether it was because she was tripped up or if she was hit, the witness said.
President Emmanuel Macron expressed on Twitter the solidarity of the whole nation after holding a crisis meeting with cabinet officials in Paris.
President Emmanuel Macron arrived for a crisis meeting with cabinet officials in Paris shortly after midnight, while Interior Minister Christophe Castaner was dispatched to Strasbourg.
Two separate security sources told AFP on condition of anonymity that the shooter was believed to be a 29-year-old from the city, whose name was given as Cherif, and who was set to be arrested on Tuesday morning.
He was being investigated over an attempted murder, one of the sources said.
Several areas neighbouring the Christmas market were sealed off on Tuesday night and residents were being told to stay indoors.
Many people took refuge in local restaurants and bars which pulled down their shutters.
We let everyone inside, down into the wine cellar. Theyre locked in there, local restaurant owner Mouad, 33, told AFP.
A police source, again speaking on condition of anonymity, said that security forces had opened fire in an area of the city where the suspect was thought to be hiding.
The source did not give the address and it was unclear if the shooter had been located.
Specialised anti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident in Strasbourg, which lies on the border of Germany.
Several residents of the city have been detained in recent years for trying to reach jihadist groups in Syria, or arrested upon their return.
Shocked and saddened by the terrible attack in Strasbourg. My thoughts are with all of those affected and with the French people, British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote on Twitter.
The Strasbourg-based European Parliament was also on lockdown, with MEPs, staff and journalists unable to leave the building.
In a parliament bar usually reserved for MEPs, EU commissioners, powerful legislators and staffers huddled in small groups waiting for developments. - AFP

Hutch to invest US$ 200 mn  for local expansion
Hutch Telecommunications Lanka (Pvt) will invest US$200 million within the next five years for their local expansion.
CEO, Hutch, Thirukumar Nadarasa said that CK Hutchison and Etisalat Group completed the combination of their operations in Sri Lanka and it would take effect in five months. Upon completion of the sale, CK Hutchison Holdings Limited will have a majority and controlling stake of 85% whilst Etisalat Group will have 15% ownership of Hutch Lanka.
Mobile merges are very common in the world and we have done this in Australia, Scotland, Spain and Austria.
In Sri Lanka there are 5 mobile players and top two operators have a 70% market share. Hence small players like us need to merge to reinvest and offer better advantages to customers and have a better reach. For this we need a larger population than 20 million living in Sri Lanka. To overcome this we decided to merge and become a stronger player.
He also disclosed that the government was very keen that during the merger there would not be any workers cuts or golden hand shakes and this was respected. We currently have 350 staff and would incorporate 500 from Etisalat.
He said that the current subscribers of both networks could continue with their packages while both the 072 and 078 numbers too would not charge. In five months time Hutch will also be going for a new branding, keeping the brand name Hutch. Three years ago discussions were on with Mobitel to merge but this deal did not metalize due to various reasons. Both Etisalat formally Celltel and Hutch formally call Link were the first two mobile players in Sri Lanka. Etisalat has indicated that they want to keep their presence in Sri Lanka and this is why a 15% stake remains with them. They will also have one member in the Board.
He said that the telecommunication industry is one of most successful sector in Sri Lanka and this was mainly due to government flexible regulations over the past 20 years. Asked if they have plans to merge with Airtel he answered in the negative. He said that with new internet options the IDD market has taken a huge beating. With operations in over 50 countries and over 290,000 employees worldwide, CK Hutchison has six core businesses, ports and related services, retail, infrastructure, energy, finance &investment and telecommunication.
With the merger services will also be combined to provide customers a much larger 2G/3G/4G network and better overall value. Hutch has recently launched 4G services in the Western Province and a nationwide roll-out has also begun. Etisalat subscribers would be able to access the Hutch 4G services once the two networks are fully amalgamated.

ICC boss confident of corruption-free WC
New Delhi, Wednesday: The head of crickets world body said Wednesday he is confident of a corruption-free 2019 World Cup as the sport works overtime to disrupt criminals who attempt to fix matches.
David Richardson, chief executive of the International Cricket Council, also called on national governments to do more to tackle match fixing, which has affected lucrative Twenty20 leagues as well as international matches.
The ICC anti-corruption unit is trying to be much more proactive in first of all disrupting these criminals who are travelling the world trying to corrupt the game, said Richardson.
Working hand in hand with the law enforcement agencies will help us do that. So (we are) very confident that we will keep the World Cup corruption free, Richardson told reporters at a promotional event in New Delhi.
He added: We are persuading governments to introduce legislation that can make attempts to fix cricket matches a criminal offence and put these people behind bars.
Richardson said there are currently investigations ongoing into corruption and match fixing.
Sri Lanka bowling coach Nuwan Zoysa was the latest to face suspension in October over accusations of match fixing.
Former Sri Lankan opener and ex-selector Sanath Jayasuriya was also charged for failing to cooperate with a match-fixing probe and concealing information in October. The 2019 World Cup is due to take place in England and Wales from May to July.
The 59-year-old Richardson, who is a former South Africa wicketkeeper, also reiterated ICCs interest in taking cricket to the Olympics.
The vast majority of ICC members are keen to have the sport at the quadrennial event, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has its reservations.
We have got an ambition to have cricket in the Olympics in 2028. Thats easier said than done. We need to convince the International Olympic Committee to have cricket, said Richardson.
103 out of 104 members are strongly behind that decision to get cricket in the Olympics. There are some issues that BCCI has with the Indian Olympic Association but I am very confident that those issues can be resolved.
The only time cricket has ever featured at the Olympics was in 1900, with just two mens teams competing. Great Britain won gold with hosts France taking silver. AFP

India is the destination for those who want to soak in the rich diverse culture of this land. India is one of the most alluring destinations in Asia. The Daily News recently attended a familiarization tour of India sponsored by the Indian Government in what proved to be an exciting and unforgettable experience.
Truth be told it was destiny that the tour to India took place close to the Hindu Festival Diwali. The Elephanta Caves on Elephanta Island were our first exposure to mythology in India. The cave temples on the island are dedicated to the Hindu God Shiva.According to historical sources, the Trimurti is the triple deity of supreme divinity in Hinduism where the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities, typically Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer. Diwali is the day the god Krishna overcame and destroyed the evil demon king Narakasura. Krishna is worshipped as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu.
Elephanta Caves
Visiting the Elephanta Caves is a fascinating experience. To reach the caves you need to travel by boat to Elephanta Island and this experience is particularly meaningful and special to those who love history and culture and who delight in spirituality. According to Hinduism, Shiva is the Supreme Deity seen as both creator and destroyer of the Universe. His incarnation as the destroyer is seen in his appearances in incredible forms. At Elephanta Caves all three aspects of Shiva  Creation, Preservation and Destruction are combined.
When walking through the Elephanta Caves, one marvels at the life size statues which show the prodigious skill and ability of the architect. So excellent that the Elephanta Caves were included in the World Heritage list in the year 1987 by UNESCO, because such beauty belongs to all of mankind. It is an example of how a person can be inspired to create works of stupendous beauty.
If you take the Island, different dynasties controlled Elephanta Island throughout the centuries the Mauryas of Konkan, the Trikutakas of Badami, Silaharas, Rashtrakutas, Kalyani Chalukyas, Yadavas of Devagiri and later by the Muslim rulers of Ahmedabad, the Maratha. In 1534 A.D. the island passed into the possession of the Portuguese who named the location as Elephanta Caves. This was because there was a huge colossal stone structure of an elephant.
Ancient wonder
However accessing this ancient wonder is not easy. After arriving on the Island you need to climb 120 steps to reach the cave temples. However the climb is worth it! The stone sculptures of the deities are so amazing that you can easily forget the passing of time in these caves, a creation of an unknown genius and one that has survived the passing of time and will continue to do so far into the future.
Looking at the stone columns what comes to mind is J.R.R. Tolkiens Middle Earth, specifically the Mines of Moria/ Khazad-dum, the home of the Dwarves!! It is so well planned and conceived, that it really is overwhelming walking into these caves. When one looks at these astonishing stone statues, one believes in the potential locked inside us all. The statues bring out the pride and greatness of the pantheon of Hindu Gods.
Their imperiousness evident on the expressions on their faces. In that respect it has a certain similarity to the Olympian Gods of Greek Mythology. As you walk through the corridors you feel a sense of awe as history looks down on you. Who was this mysterious creator as intriguing as his creations Will we ever know What effort must have gone into this remarkable creation - hewn from stone!
However our tour was not only about the past! The Mumbai Airport is one of the most beautiful airports in the world and is worth mentioning. And it was our first introduction to India. And what an introduction it was!
The unique architecture of Terminal 2 celebrates both the rich heritage of design and craft of India and Indias emerging stature as a global leader. Terminal T2, which is a colossal 4.7 million square feet (5 times BIA terminal) is built on 4 levels vertical terminal handling both International and domestic passengers under one roof. Mumbai Airport handles more than 50 million passengers per annum and Terminal 2 is designed to handle 45 million passengers. The mega international terminal 2 is ultra- modern yet it is also unmistakably Indian.
T2 design is inspired from peacock, the national bird of India, and can been seen in every element of the terminal in a beautiful contemporary way, be it the interior of the huge roof or the magnificent 30 mega columns that hold the mega roof.
Small disks of colorful glass recessed within the canopys coffers speckling the hall below with light along with the reflective water pools around columns. The constellation of colors also makes reference to the peacock.
There are about one thousand custom made chandeliers exclusively crafted for the terminal inspired by Indias national flower  the lotus. Diya Curtain (a curtain of lighting lamps)is a symbolic Indian Gesture with 10,000 lamps at the Immigration Hall.
The terminal is also the home to GVK Jaya He New Museum, an amazing collection of art and craft and some 7000 artifacts from all corners of India.
Where art is usually an afterthought or a decoration in many civic buildings around the globe, GVKs Mumbai International Airport must be applauded for incorporating the art and craft as an integral part of the design from the very beginning, creating a one of a kind airport where passengers cant complain even if they miss their flight.
GVK Botanical Gardens - The Mumbai airport is also a place for biophilic designed spaces with large vertical gardens, water features, koi fish ponds spread inside and around the airport. The kitchen waste of the airport is decomposed and used as fertilizer to maintain these gardens. The botanical garden team continues to engage passengers and stakeholders to promote the green initiatives and spread awareness through events and workshops round the year. Every plant and tree is natural and alive and there is nothing artificial at Mumbai Airport.

Memorable stay
GVK is an Indian conglomerate spanning diverse sectors including energy, resources, airports, transportation, hospitality and life sciences.
Our stay in Mumbai and New Delhi was one of luxury and comfort. We received accommodation at seven star hotels  The Taj Palace New Delhi and the Taj Mahal Tower Mumbai. Here, the service was of a very high standard which was super luxurious. The attention paid to the smallest detail made it very memorable.
Last but not least, one is compelled to comment on the hospitality and warmth of the Indian people. Right throughout the trip we, the journalists were treated like VIPs. Everywhere we went we experienced the vibrant culture of India. The Indian Bazaars that we visited in order to purchase mementos were so vibrant and colorful, it was really amazing. The sellers, busy as bees, were truly aggressive negotiators! It was so quaint and beautiful that it was part of the unforgettable memories of India that are forever etched in our minds. These Indian Bazaars are huge, bustling and noisy and one is tempted to buy those little trinkets and goods of greater value. As mentioned above our visit to India was close to the time of the Hindu Festival of Diwali and there was no shortage of items at these Bazaars that had relevance to the festival.

Indian teen takes all ten wickets in an innings
An 18-year-old from Manipur, a state in Indias north-east, became the latest to accomplish the rare feat of taking 10 wickets in an innings.
Rex Rajkumar Singh, a left-arm medium pacer, took a remarkable 10/11 in Indias four-day tournament for under-19 players, the Cooch Behar Trophy. Six of his 9.5 overs were maidens.
He bowled five batsmen, two of his wickets were lbw, two caught behind and one caught by another player. He found himself on a hat-trick thrice.
His efforts helped Manipur bowl Arunachal Pradesh out for a paltry 36 in their second innings at the Rural Development Trust Stadium in Anantapur on Tuesday, 12 December.
Manipur, who had posted 122 in their first innings in response to the oppositions 138, got the 55 runs they needed in 7.5 overs to complete an easy 10-wicket win.
Singh, who had made his first-class debut in the Ranji Trophy this season, finished with 15 wickets in the match, having taken 5/33 the first time.

MRs appeal challenging CA:
Interim Order fixed for Friday
The Special Leave to Appeal application filed by Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa challenging the Court of Appeal Interim Order that restrained him from functioning as the Prime Minister was yesterday fixed for support on Friday (14) by the Supreme Court.
When this application came up before Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Justice L.T.B.Dehideniya, the court was informed through Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran that the petitioners were yet to receive notices. He sought another date to support the application.
However, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for several respondent-petitioners informed court that they are ready to support the application since its national importance and urgency. There is no Cabinet in the country now. The country is running without a government. An Interim Order has been issued preventing the operation of the Cabinet of Ministers. This matter has to be taken up for support as much as possible, Silva added.
Justice Dehideniya explained his difficulty to sit on the Bench continuously since he is expecting to obtain leave on Thursday (13)to attend a funeral in Kandy. Justice Dehideniya said the Bench would not be properly constituted for the following date (13) if the matter was taken up for support on Wednesday (12).
Taking facts into consideration, the Supreme Court fixed the Special Leave to Appeal application for support on Friday (14). Through this appeal petition, MP Mahinda Rajapaksa sought an order to set aside the Interim Order dated December 3 by the Court of Appeal.
He also sought an order to grant special leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal order in the writ application No.363/2018. Rajapaksa alleged that the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to take cognizance of the absence of a proper and legally countenanced application before it in terms of the law in as much as inter alia the failure of the 122 MPs to have supported their application with affidavits countenanced by law.
He stated that the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to take due cognizance of its lack of jurisdiction to hear and determine the said writ application in which arose a number of matters involving and requiring interpretation of several constitutional provisions.
He further said the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to consider the legal effect of the cogent evidence adduced by some of 122 MPs by way of affidavits and documents, unedited Hansard issued officially by the office of the Secretary General of Parliament and the video footage extracted from the official website of Parliament depicting that the said uncorrected draft copies produced in court do not in fact depict accurately the Parliamentary proceedings of the said date and that there were in fact no valid votes of the No Confidence Motion passed in Parliament as claimed by the 122 MPs.
MPs Johnston Fernando, Dr.Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe, Dinesh Gunawardena and Chamal Rajapaksa also filed appeal petitions challenging the Court of Appeal order dated December 3.They cited UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and 121 MPs and 49 others as respondents.
These petitions had been filed through counsel Sanath Wijewardena.
The Court of Appeal on December 3 issued an Interim Order restraining Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, his Ministers, the State Ministers and Deputy Ministers from holding their respective offices until a final determination is reached with regard to the Quo Warranto writ petition filed by 122 Parliamentarians, including Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran with counsel Suren Fernando appeared for petitioners. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with Counsel Navin Marapana appeared for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena and Manohara de Silva PC, Ali Sabry PC, Romesh de Silva with counsel Sugath Caldera and Kushan de Alwis PC appeared for the other respondent-petitioners.

JO erred by voting for 19th Amendment - Keheliya
UPFA MP Keheliya Rambukwella admitted that the Joint Opposition (JO) was a party to a historical mistake by voting for the 19th Amendment without properly studying it in 2015.
Addressing a media briefing held together with UPFA MP Dilan Perera, Rambukwella confessed that they too were to blame for the political crisis the country was in today as a result of the vagueness of the 19th Amendment.
At that time, the political situation was very fragile, the President had taken over the SLFP leadership and all of us were under pressure. It was also passed in a hurried manner.We managed to make 132 amendments but when we called for a division on this matter (Article 70), the Speaker said it was too late.
He further explained that the current crisis was due to the 19th Amendment specifying whether Article 70 trumped Article 33 (c) or not.
I believe the architects of the 19th Amendment included Article 33 (c) which states that the President has the powers to to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament to prevent a repetition of the the Supreme Court ruling in 2002 which stated that significant changes to the nature of the Executive would need a referendum and two thirds majority, Rambukwella said.
Article 70 in the meantime states, The President may by Proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament: Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour, thus causing the present confusion.
Speaking on the UNPs demand to hold a Presidential election prior to a General Election, Perera noted that even if the President was convinced to call for an early election, a new President would still have to face a similar Parliamentary deadlock, If the Supreme Court is to rule that Parliament can only be dissolved after 4.5 years, a new President will also have to deal with this Parliament.
Parliamentary election according to the assumption of the 4.5 year rule, can only be held in March 2019 and a Presidential election in late December 2019 or early January 2020.
This would still mean that the current political crisis would continue for longer. Thus the only solution is a General Election. The political deadlock between the Judiciary, Legislative and Executive started on November 14 and neither can resolve it- it is up to the people now, Perera said.

JO hits out at US envoys remarks
Members of the Joint Opposition (JO) lashed out at certain Western foreign embassies for their unwarranted interference into the countrys domestic affairs.
American Ambassador Alaina Teplitz recently visited the chief prelates of the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters and she said democracy must be restored in the country but it is on their terms. She says that the Millenium Fund will only be released if democracy is restored, UPFA MP and JO member Keheliya Rambukwella said.
Addressing a media briefing with JO Member and UPFA MP Dilan Perera at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort in Colombo, he questioned as to why the American Ambassador did not take into account democracy when Provincial Council elections were delayed for the last 2.5 years.
These ambassadors and high commissioners are showing immense interest in our domestic affairs now, but did not have the nerve to go and ask the prelates to ask them to restore democracy by having elections, Rambukwella said. The former Minister observed that the country had educated and knowledgeable people to manage its own affairs, We cannot live like frogs in the well.We need assistance from others but not at the cost of our own sovereignty, right of franchise or the rights of the people.
He remarked that the UNP which was working closely with these embassies was trying to create an Arab Spring in the country, We all know what happened to those countries where America interfered.
I would not be surprised if Ranil Wickremesinghe tomorrow points to all the court cases and asks the UN to intervene in the country, Rambukwella said as he stressed that it was not about party politics now but the need to defend the countrys sovereignty from foreign interference.

Lessons in governance from Britains Brexit, and RWs exit
If you cast your vote at a general election, are you also casting it away for the next few years
That question is at the crux of the current national discourse on whether a general election should be held in the near future, or not. It is safe to say, that a majority of the people of this country want a general election at this point in time, and though that fact cannot be proven without an actual Referendum to prove it, it is safe to say it is an accurate reflection of reality, as all empirical data clearly points in that direction. The landslide general election victory for the PA and now the PA and UPFA combined, should perish all the talk about a 62 lakh mandate granted to UNP and allies at the last presidential election.
However, constitutional purists want no election, though under the above mentioned circumstances, me nor anyone cannot be faulted for stating that they are afraid of an election, and are using the constitutional fig leaf to avoid one.
But yet, the issue continues to remain in the public eye, not the least of the reasons being that the constitutional purists as they might be called, have gone to Court to stave off a national poll.
So, to begin at where this piece began, if you did cast your vote at a general election  or for that matter any major election  did you cast it away for the next few years
Well, the answer to that seems to be a definitive no, and it comes, these days in particular, from the so called mother of all Parliaments.
Even as this is written, it is palpably clear that Britain is moving towards another general election, or one more Referendum, on a subject on which Britons already voted in a national plebiscite two years back.
MAJOR TALKING POINT
Brexit, is not going to be a mere digression in this article, and that is fair warning! Brexit and what is happening now in UK is as relevant to the debate about whether you cast your vote away, as any other major talking point, in these days of heated political contestation in this country.
British Prime Minister Theresa May tried this week to sell her deal that would have got her country out of the European Union. But yet, unfortunately for her, almost before the ink was dry on her formula, she got wind of the fact that her plan would be voted down by a massive margin in the British House of Commons.
So, early this week, she chose to postpone the vote in the House on her Brexit plan. The move, which was very clearly designed foremost to save her own premiership from imminent doom, has caused chaos in the country, and it is now almost certain that all of this would end up with perhaps another so called Peoples vote on the matter of exiting the European Union, or another General Election.
UNLIKELY POSSIBILITY
Other scenarios are possible but are not likely, and one of them is that a leadership challenge aimed at Theresa May from her own Conservative party would bring an end to her premiership with the result that somebody else would lead the current Conservative government in the UK.
The shape of events as they are happening now however, seems to suggest that this is now an increasingly unlikely possibility.
It seems that the people very rapidly lost any semblance of confidence they might have once entertained, that Mrs. May would be able to solve the hideously vexed problem that is Brexit.
This is due to the totally farcical manner in which the vote on her deal was postponed, with some MPs who were willing to support her, learning about the postponement of the vote, on live television.
Opposition Labour leader Jeremey Corbyn called Mrs. Mays coalition a shambolic government on Tuesday, and it does seem that a vast majority of the commentariat in Britain are agreeing with him.
Whats clear from everything taking place in the mother of all Parliaments and whats playing out at this moment in the British media etc, is that there is nobody on any side of the divide who believes that another general election is anathema, or that another Referendum on Brexit for that matter, is out of the question.
Of course this is not to say that there arent some vehement objectors who do not like either possibility, but there is no unified formidable opposition to either of these moves.
What that means is that the people in the UK are in general open to the possibility of general elections, in what they see as a time of extraordinary political stalemate and uncertainty in the country.
STUBBORN SENTIMENT
To go back again then to where we began, nobody in Britain is in any manner seriously contending that when they cast their vote at the last general election, they cast away their right to vote again, before the term of the parliament is up.
There is no leader in Britain that is scared of a general election, even though there may be persons who are partial to avoiding one, because it may lead to a change of government.
Such persons are bound to oppose the idea of a general election at this time, but they would not do so with anything like the vehemence with which the UNP is opposing elections here in this country.
Why is there no such stubborn anti election sentiment in Britain
To be brutally honest about it, its owed to the fact that it would be hilarious for anyone in that country to deviate so much from the collective wish of the common denominator i.e: the desire of the British voters.
It is quite apparent that the people of the UK are so sick of the Brexit fiasco that they feel their politicians are inept and have mishandled the entire contretemps.
No matter where they may stand on the issues, meaning they could be strong supporters of either Remain or Leave, the overwhelming desire in the country, judging by the coverage of the issue, is that they do not want to see the chaotic situation deteriorate any further.
Mrs. May may not be a Ranil Wickremesinghe who entertains no contrary opinion over his view that he is entitled to the premiership, for at least another one and a half years, due to the fixed term Clause of four and a half years that came with the 19th Amendment. But of course it is likely that she would do her best to stave off a general election as well.
The difference between the Wickremesinghe brand of tenacity and hers, is that she is willing to acknowledge that her country is in crisis.
FIXED TERM ACT
Though she is very probably against a general election as such an eventuality would spell certain doom for her prime ministerial career, she is not dragging her country down with her by vehemently insisting that there should not be a national election no matter what, before the four years prescribed in the Fixed Term Parliamentary Act are up.
One reason things are so different in Britain, is that her fellow Conservatives are not delusional, whatever their faults may be.
They do not believe that they could or should push adamantly for extending the life of the current parliament, when they know fully well that such self indulgence would be treated with the scorn it deserves from among the ordinary voting public.
Those who argue that the immediate political uncertainty in this country was the creation of the president, and that it gives Wickremesinghe the right to inveigh against a General Election with all means at his disposal, should remember that Brexit was the creation of Theresa Mays Conservative party, as much as Ranil Wickremesinghes defeat at the last national election, the LG poll this year, was entirely the creation of his party, the UNP.
If there is further explanation that is needed on that claim, its obvious that Theresa May, to put it mildly, is a great deal more self effacing about her own partys role in the current crisis her nation is bedeviled by...
The people of UK, but more importantly the MPs in her own party rightly ensure that she is held accountable for her own follies, and thats partly because they are open to a keen contest for party succession.
Thats unfortunately not the case with the UNP back here at home. There is no healthy contest for succession within the UNP, even though there are so many contenders who are constantly entertaining the idea that they would walk in Wickremesinghes shoes, as next party leader.
But, when there is any mention of a serious contest for succession, there are many formidable players who would rather have Wickremesinghe than someone other than themselves as the successor. Each having daggers drawn at the other in this way, is a reality that is relished by Wickremesinghe, who preys upon such rivalries to bolster his dominant role in the party, as long as he wants to.
There is no similar conceivable situation in the British Conservative party in which, say, Boris Johnson would scuttle the hopes of any other contender, and go to the ends of the earth to ensure that another contender such as Jacob Rees-Mogg would fail, if he (Boris) himself is out of the running, due to a lack of support.
Theresa May hangs on to power these day for the rather simple reason that very few people would really want her job at this moment in which the country is mired in a crisis out of which there does not seem to be any easy way out.
PASSIVE
The other difference between the average British voter and the Sri Lankan counterpart, this writer suspects, is that back here folks are far more passive with regard to vocalization of their political preferences.
This does not mean that they do not engage in politics with a passion. But, historically their predilection, if you will, has been to bide their time and be silent until they could deliver the coup de grace at a national election by annihilating the pompous and those feeling entitled, or others who are deemed to have overstayed their welcome.
It is fair to say from the point of an objective appraisal that Britain, for all its chaotic politics, is not as polarized a political landscape as it is in Sri Lanka at the present moment.
It is no doubt a charitable view to take that sharp political divisions between the UNP and SLPP have led to the spineless UNP support for Wickremesinghe, under the circumstances that he quite obviously does not enjoy majority support in the country.
In short, it seems UNPers would rather have anyone  even the impossible Wickremesinghe than anybody from the SLPP-UPFA combine.
This is no place to analyze reasons for this type of pronounced polarization, though the reader would probably have a very good idea why there is such a sharp divide animating the politics of the country.
But no amount of hate for the other side should preclude the leadership and the rank and file of the UNP, from getting used to a political culture that takes into account the glaring realities, as obtains in the political landscape of Britain.
BRITAIN IS DIVIDED TOO
To add to that, it is not as if Britain isnt deeply divided. There is a yawning ideological chasm between the Conservatives and the very left leaning politics centred around the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
But British politics is real, not surreal in the way it often unfolds here. Leaders are rooted in the facts of the here and now, and so are their support bases.
Neither are blinded by partisan considerations when it comes to fundamentals such as a election, when it is painfully obvious that one is due.
Some may contend that there is however, deep division in the UK about a possible second Referendum on Brexit for instance, a so called Peoples Vote.
Of course there is such a gulf, but there is no rigidity of positions, a fact that is obvious from the daily editorials in the British media. If Mrs. May does not stay on, even though she has so far proved to be the great survivor, there is a great likelihood of a Peoples vote, or a general election very soon.
But even if she does survive, it would not be in a situation in which her leadership goes unchallenged.
Even as this is written, some forty MPs from within her own party are said to be planning to dispatch letters against her continuing leadership. In sum, its such a far cry from the non-democracy that is being touted here by Wickremesinghe as a fight for democracy, something being bought by his support base, largely for lack of alternative.

Most  influential film  ever made
According to a group of Italian researchers who analyzed 47,000 films across 26 genres, the most influential movie ever made is The Wizard of Oz!
No surprise there, as the fantasy blockbuster starring Judy Garland as Dorothy, a girl who gets whisked away to a magical realm, has long been considered a game changer in Hollywood.
According to The Guardian, the other films that join the Wizard of Oz in the top five are Star Wars, Psycho, King Kong (1933), and 2001: A Space Odyssey. The rest of the top 20 is peppered with the usual suspects, including Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Metropolis, Dr. Strangelove, and The Godfather.
The study also ranked the influence of certain directors and actors. Alfred Hitchcock topped the directors list, followed by Steven Spielberg, while Samuel L. Jackson topped the actors list, followed by Tom Cruise. The actress list was slightly less predictable: Carrie Fisher was named the most influential, while Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny in 14 James Bond films, was named second most influential.

MR, Cabinet Quo Warranto petition  fixed for argument on Jan. 16
The writ petition filed by 122 Parliamentarians who sought an order in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that Mahinda Rajapaksa and 48 others are not entitled to hold the office of Prime Minister, Ministers and Deputy Ministers was fixed for argument by the Court of Appeal yesterday.


Court of Appeal President, Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeyesekera fixed the matter for argument on January 16, 17 and 18. The respondents were directed to file their objections before January 4. The petitioners were directed to file their counter objections before January 11.
Meanwhile, an objection raised by respondents urging this writ petition be dismissed for not complying with rules that are mandatory to serve notices and provide relevant documents to the respondents was rejected by the Court of Appeal.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Gamini Marapana PC and Manohara de Silva appearing for the respondents told court that they were yet to receive full set of briefs relevant to the writ petition. We are raising objections for non-complying on rules that is mandatory to provide relevant documents to the respondents. The notices have not been served on several respondents, Counsel Manohara de Silva said.
However, Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran and Counsel Suren Fernando appearing for UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that they have already handed over the full set of briefs to several respondents even prior to supporting this writ application. Kanag-iswaran undertook to serve full set of briefs to all respondents. The Court observed that this petition was taken up as the first notice returnable date and the notices have been served on respondents.
On December 3, the Court of Appeal had issued an Interim Order restraining Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Ministers of the Cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers from holding their office until final determination of this writ petition filed by 122 Parliamentarians.
It was the view of this that damage that may be caused by temporarily restraining a lawful cabinet of Ministers from functioning would in all probabilities be outweighed by the damage that would be caused by allowing a set of persons who are not entitled in law to function as the Prime Minister or the cabinet of ministers or any other Minister of the Government. The magnitude of the latter damage would be very high. Such damage would be an irreparable or irremediable one. Such damage would also have far reaching consequences to the whole country, the Court of Appeal had observed. The Court of Appeal had further observed that this order would not affect the country since the Interim Order would only prevent respondents (individuals) from functioning as public officers. The Court was of the view that Parliament passed Vote of No-Confidence against the Government with majority on two occasion on November 14 and 16. The Court also recognized the national importance of the petition and thereby decided to issue an Interim Order that would affect until the final determination of this petition.
In this petition, the petitioners further sought an order in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that 49 respondents including the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the incumbent government are not entitled to hold the office of ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
The petitioners, the Members of Parliamentarians representing the United National Party, Tamil National Alliance, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and several other parties filed this petition naming 49 persons including Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, members of cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers as respondents.
The petitioners stated that on November 14, 2018, Parliament passed a vote of no-confidence against the purported government of the Respondents. They further stated that on November 16, Parliament passed another Vote of No-Confidence against the Government. They maintained that in terms of Article 48 of the Constitution, the Cabinet stood dissolved from November 14, 2018.
Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran and Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with Counsel Navin Marapana appeared for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena and Manohara de Silva PC, Ali Sabry PC, Romesh de Silva with counsel Sugath Caldera and Kushan de Alwis PC appeared for the other respondents.
Case against Prime Minister postponed to January
The Court today has postponed hearing the case against Mahinda Rajapaksa holding office as the Prime Minister is postponed to 16th, 7th and 18th of January, 2019.

New common entrepreneurship curricula  to be adopted by SLs training institutes
Expressing their commitment to improve vocational training, technical education, and enterprise development in Sri Lanka, eleven training institutes launched a set of common curricula for entrepreneurship training. The new curricula was developed in partnership with
the U.S Agency of International Development (USAID)-funded Youth Employability and Business Start-up Program (YouLead) by officials from the Industrial Development Board, National Enterprise Development Authority, University of Vocational Technology, Vocational Training Authority, National Youth Services Council, National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority, Small Enterprise Development Division, Department of Technical Education and Training, University College of Anuradhapura, Ceylon German Technical Training Institute and Sarvodaya Movement.
Helping bright young men and women to realize their dreams and set up a new enterprise is one of the most impactful activities we can do. Of course, not all will succeed, but those who do inject new ideas and energy in the economy, can employ other unemployed youth and help build a sustainable future for Sri Lanka, said USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Reed Aeschliman.
To fill a long-felt need for an updated curriculum for the Tertiary and Vocational Education (TVET) sector, the YouLead program brought together stakeholders to develop a common set of curricula based on international best practices and incorporating the latest competency standards. The new curricula also introduce more effective teaching techniques such as student-centered learning and case-studies.
The global-standardized syllabus has also been conceptualized to align with the local contextusing Sri Lankan examples and case studies where possible. The participating training institutes pledged to introduce the new curricula quickly and encourage Sri Lankas youth to set up their own businesses.
The literature on entrepreneurship training is limited, but training programs are often critiqued for their lack of practicality, lack of cultural sensitivity, and the lack of long-term vision. The current entrepreneurial training system appears to be facing the after effects of transplanting global practices without significant localization or identification of the grassroot-level challenges and therefore often dont resonate with our youth or build the confidence they need to start their own businesses. I am confident these joint curricula will be much more useful for our prospective entrepreneurs, said Dr. Premasiri Gamage.
YouLead is a $12 million program supported by the U.S. Governments development agency, USAID, and implemented by IESC - an organization that has worked with hundreds of private enterprises in Sri Lanka since 1965. It aims to improve technical and vocational education and training, create a more skilled workforce, and link youth to more productive careers by undertaking activities to support and strengthen students, teachers, institutions and entrepreneurs.
Under YouLead, IESC partners with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of Commerce, Arizona State University, Global Communities, Skills for Life, and Verit Research. YouLead also engages with private sector and public and private training institutes to help Sri Lankan youth become more employable and find career opportunities in fields with growing private sector employment demand.

New life to plastic bottles
Coca-Cola Beverages recently completed yet another successful Give Back Life campaign in partnership with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Eco Spindles Pvt Ltd, during the Sri Lanka-England cricket series which was held from October 10 to November 27. The Give Back Life partnership with SLC continues to make a difference by collecting and recycling thousands of PET plastic bottles at Cricket stadiums in Galle, Colombo, and Dambulla. Give Back Life encourages people to give new life to their PET bottles through a recycling process by Eco Spindles that coverts them into clothing, shoes, brushes and brooms, thereby adding value by preserving our unique environment and creating new livelihoods.
With custom-designed PET bottle collection bins placed at these cricket stadiums, the Coca-Cola team oversaw the collection of approximately a total of 400kg of PET plastic bottles over the course of the nine matches. Clad in Give Back Life t-shirts, the Coca-Cola staff on the grounds were actively involved in collecting used bottles while spreading the message and inspiring numerous spectators to join in.
Chief Operating Officer, SLC Jerome Jayaratne stated: The highly anticipated Sri Lanka-England tournament this year, drew large crowds to our stadiums from far and wide. With Coca-Cola having always been a strong supporter and advocate of the sport of cricket in Sri Lanka, we are very pleased to have been able to join its efforts in recycling and waste management through the Give Back Life campaign for PET plastic bottles. Since its inception, this island-wide campaign has continued to gain momentum and make a significant impact across the nation. It was very inspiring to see the cricket fans in and around the stadiums giving up a few moments of their time to pick up used bottles and dispose of them in a responsible manner. The Coca-Cola team certainly did an excellent job of spreading the Give Back Life message among hundreds of cricket fans who were present during the series and we hope that they continue making strides with this far-reaching cause.
Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. Lakshan Madurasinghe also said Our second Give Back Life campaign with SLC during the Sri Lanka-England cricket series yet again proved to be a successful effort and we hope that it took us one step closer to creating the habit for everySri Lanka to dispose their waste appropriately to better serve the country. This partnership with SLC and Eco Spindles enabled us to inspire numerous cricket fans across the island to rethink the way they handle waste and understand the tangible value of their used PET plastic bottles. Through more and more dynamic partnerships such as this, we hope to continue making a positive impact, one PET plastic bottle at a time.
Coca-Cola has continued to build on its partnerships with various local government authorities, civil society groups, NGOs and corporates, leveraging them to provide robust PET recovery solutions across the island. Through its multi-stakeholder, volunteer clean-ups and collection programmes, the Give Back Life campaign also drives community mobilization. Coca-Cola continues its plans to work with a host of partners in the coming years to deliver Coca-Colas World Without Waste packaging vision, which includes collecting and recycling a bottle for every 1 it sells by 2030.

EPRLF leader and former MP Suresh Premachandran commenting on the claimed agreements between the UNP and TNA, said, the TNA is forwarding conditions to support Wickremesinghe and not the Tamil people. I do not see that there is any point now placing conditions to the UNP as the TNA right from the beginning was very supportive of the UNP Leader.
Those conditions should have been given to him right at the very beginning when the TNA decided to support Wickremesinghe. He also said there was no point in putting conditions to Ranil, but those should have been given to the President because it is the President who takes the final decision.

No hate speech made against anyone - Ratnapriya
Trade Union Leader Saman Ratnapriya condemning misinterpretations into his recent controversial statement on the Presidents conduct said that it was not an intended hate speech.
He stated this at a press conference organized by the Trade Union Unity for Democracy at Rajagiriya yesterday.
Ratnapriya said, although some organizations supporting President Sirisena had lodged a complaint against that statement, he had not received any notice or information from any legal institution regarding that complaint so far.
He said he had acted within the democratic framework and did not utter words pushing masses into acting in hatred. Doing anything within the democratic framework is one of our rights, he emphasised.
He also said that his statement which made last week extracted some examples from the international arena just to explain the fate of autocratic rulers as he had the freedom of expression in a democratic society.
Referring to some media reports relating to his foreign tours made during the past three and a half years, Ratnapriya also confirmed that all the foreign tours he had participated during that period were official as a Trade Union Leader and none of them was illegal.
United National Partys key trade union, Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS), Vice Chairman Sunil De Silva also condemned taking legal action against his fellow TU leader stressing that as Trade Union leaders, they have the right to fight against injustice.
He said it is also their duty to apprise public of the inappropriate deeds of leaders in the country.
The Vice Chairman invited the working community to join them for a vibrant protest campaign to be held at the Galle Face Green on December 17 to protect democracy and the countrys Constitution.
