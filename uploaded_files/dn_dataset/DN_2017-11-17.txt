Constitutional reforms will provide solutions acceptable to all
A solution acceptable to all sections of society will be found through the Constitutional reforms that will be introduced by the government, said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara.
He was addressing a meeting held at Galle to mark the introduction of the Grama Shakthi programme on November 15.
Nanayakkara said whenever the government tried to bring in solutions to problems in the past, the Opposition had been obstructing it through demonstrations and other activities. Communalism had been an effective tool in gaining power in the country in the past. But todays scenario was completely different because the two major parties had formed a consensus government to resolve burning problems. This had given the government a god-sent opportunity to take decisions necessary for the countrys future programmes, he said.
This golden opportunity should be clinched by all because it would not occur again in the future, he said.

No scientific formula to increase hard and soft liquor at once
As the proposed pricing formula on alcoholic beverages in the 2018 Budget becomes a highly contested topic, co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara questioned critics as to how they proposed to increase the prices of both soft as well as hard liquor at the same time.
Earlier, the tax on alcohol was decided on a standard litre of alcohol but no one knows what this is based on. Taxing was ad hoc and ineffective, he said.
He was addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing on Wednesday.
Thus, a tax of Rs. 190 was charged for beverages with five percent alcohol or less, and a tax of Rs. 315 for those above five percent. In addition, foreign alcoholic beverages had an additional customs, PAL and VAT taxes imposed on them.
To amend this, the Budget followed a taxation system based on the percentage of alcohol in the drink, the same system which is followed internationally, explained the Minister as he stressed that this was more simplified and easier to follow.
He added that it was pointless to simply stress on increasing prices of alcohol without a scientific basis, as the more prices increased, more people were likely to resort to illegal drinks such as moonshine.
A poor man who can no longer afford a bottle of arrack is going to drink moonshine which is more dangerous. We need to have a different programme to stop them from drinking that rather than worrying about beer, stressed Jayasekara.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, highlighting a study conducted by the University of Colombo, stated that Sri Lanka took the number one position in Asia when it came to the consumption of hard liquor.
This study states that in Sri Lanka, 13 percent consume beer, 2 percent wine and 85 percent other hard liquor such as arrack, said Minister Karunathilake.
In certain districts such as Nuwara Eliya, close to 85 percent consume moonshine, he added.
Minister Jayasekara noted that the real problem was the unregulated moonshine with a much higher percentage of alcohol and not beer.
It is not true that with decreasing beer prices, all will start drinking beer or that the youth will start drinking. We have to realize that the youth today have other drugs, much more potent at their disposal, said Jayasekara. He explained that the President too was not in favour of the beer price decreasing and asked to increase it, but there was no scientific formula which could increase the prices of both soft and hard liquor at once.

Trinco oil tanks sufficient for entire region
If the oil tanks farm in Trincomalee is fully functional, Sri Lanka could have supplied fuel to even the rest of the Asian region, said Cabinet Sub-Committee Chairman and Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, yesterday.
The report submitted by the Cabinet Sub-Committee has recommended to the President to investigate as to who was responsible for the fuel shortage.
He said the CPC's failure to maintain adequate buffer stocks was the main cause of the issue.
"There may be an attempt to create an artificial fuel shortage to get another consignment on the spot price method. We must probe this thoroughly," he added.
He said the government has to take responsibility for this crisis as it affected the day today lives of the people. The CPC administration must not have any excuseS as is main responsibility is maintaining sufficient fuel stocks.
The storage capacity of the CPC is 90,000 MT. Even if the 20,000 MT of fuel was not available there was no reason why the CPC was not able to maintain a buffer stock, he said. "We should increase oil storage facilities and if the oil tanks in Trincomalee was fully functional, we could have supplied fuel to even the rest of the Asia," he said.

Adopt timeline for action: HRW tells Sri Lanka
Countries at the UN Human Rights Council should press Sri Lanka for a time-bound action plan on reforms during its third Universal Periodic Review, which began yesterday, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.
In a statement, it said successive Sri Lankan governments, including under President Maithripala Sirisena, had failed to ensure accountability for serious rights violations and other important commitments.
The Sirisena government made key pledges at the Human Rights Council in October 2015 to ensure justice, accountability, and security sector reform. The failure of the government to fulfil most of these promises, has brought its commitment to reform into question and dashed hopes of victims and affected communities, HRW Geneva Director John Fisher said.
The statement said the Sri Lankan government has taken several positive steps since the last review in 2012.
Human rights activists and journalists do not fear arrest for expressing their views and criticism. Allegations of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances against the Tamil minority have dropped considerably. In May 2016, the government ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Since 2015, Sri Lanka has invited several UN and other international experts to provide recommendations.
However, a number of urgent human rights issues are pending, many arising from the 2015 council resolution that promised to create four transitional justice mechanisms to address abuses linked to the three-decade conflict that ended in 2009. Thus far, the government has only established the Office of Missing Persons, but even there has procrastinated.
The governments budget outline for fiscal year 2018 contains no reference or allocation for the remaining three mechanisms. Other resolution undertakings, such as security sector reform and land reform, remain largely unfulfilled. In particular, the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has not yet been repealed; although the government claims it has not enforced the act for the last six months, many PTA suspects remain in prison and those finally released after years of detention without charge have not received redress. Protests across the country in recent months have demanded reform and justice including for PTA detainees.
During the review, governments should also raise concerns about womens rights and protections around sexual orientation and gender identity. Sri Lanka has discriminatory marriage and divorce laws that unfairly impact women from minority backgrounds. Laws that criminalize homosexual conduct remain in effect and are regularly used by the authorities to jail, bribe, and abuse men and women, it said.

AG objects to writ challenging gazette
The Attorney General appearing on behalf of Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, United National Party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and PAFFREL organisation yesterday raised objections in the Court of Appeal.
This is regarding a writ petition filed by six electors who challenged the legality of the Gazette Notification issued by Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government on the Delimitation Committee Report with regard to the boundaries in respect of Local Authorities.
The Court of Appeal three-judge-Bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya, Justice Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Justice Shiran Gunaratne fixed the matter for November 22 to decide whether court should grant an interim relief or not.
Six electors representing several Local Government institutions have filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal challenging the legality of a Gazette Notification dated February 17, 2017 ammending the boundaries, number of members and the constituents in respect of Local Authorities.
Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekara appearing on behalf of Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha raised preliminary objections against the writ petition urging the Court to dismiss it in limine.
He further argued that the subject matter of this petition cannot be heard in the Court of Appeal owing to lack of jurisdiction and stated that this matter should be referred to the Supreme Court, acting in terms of Article 125 of the Constitution.
DSG Obeysekara further said the petitioners have challenged the franchise rights of the people delaying to hold the local government election.
This petition had been filed by six electors representing the Colombo Municipal Council, Kandy Municipal Council, Paduwasnuwara Pradeshiya Sabha, Hali-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha and Embilipitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioners cited Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government and the Secretary to Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government as respondents.
The petitioners are seeking an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification bearing No.2006/44 dated February 17,2017 until the final determination of this application.
The petitioners stated that a National Delimitation Committee has been established with a mandate to make recommendations to the Minister of Local Government for the division of local authority areas to the wards and to determine the boundaries of each ward and assign a name and number of each such ward.
The petitioners stated that if any electoral process commenced in terms of the Gazette Notification which has been promulgated by the Minister ultra vires the powers vested on him in terms of Section 3D of Local Authorities Election Ordinance, irreparable loss and damage would be caused to the petitioners.
The petitioners stated that several wards in the Colombo Municipal Council which were designed as multi-member wards have been re-designed as wards which only elect one member to the council.
The petitioners stated that in promulgating the Gazette Notification, the Minister of Local Government has acted ultra vires the powers vested in him under section 3D of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
Counsel Yasas de Silva appeared for UNP. Counsel Chamara Nanayakkarawasam with Sunil Watagala appeared for the JVP.

AIA Insurance Lanka PLC recorded a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 189 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
Pankaj Banerjee, Chief Executive Officer of AIA Sri Lanka, said: AIA Sri Lanka has delivered a solid set of results for the third quarter of 2017. It is worth noting that AIA Sri Lanka continued to deliver on our key strategic initiatives against the backdrop of slower economic growthduring the third quarter of 2017.

The Company recorded a consolidated revenue of Rs 12,673 million, an increase of 17%, from Rs 10,794 million reported over the same period in 2016. This growth was mainly driven by the increase in the gross written premium (GWP) of Conventional Life business.
Gross written premium of Life insurance business increased by 13 per cent to Rs 8,415 million, from Rs 7,425 million reported over the same period in 2016. This was attributed to the improvement in persistency.

ARNOLD  from batting stylist to top TV broadcaster
From a stylish batting all rounder for Sri Lanka to a very knowledgeable, competent and listenable Television commentator for TEN SPORTS is RUSSEL ARNOLD. He hails from the school by the canal at Bambalapitiya, St.Peters College where he performed with great loyalty, honesty and dedication. It was from St. Peters that came other shining stars who rewrote the record books before him CLIVE INMAN, Dr. HERBERT FERNANDO, ROY DIAS, DAVID HEYN, AMAL SILVA, RUMESH RATNAYAKE and VINOTHEN JOHN.
Eye catching batsman
Left-handed, stylish and eye catching batsman who walked to the crease with his top shirt button undone INMAN holds the record for being the only Peterite batsman to score a double hundred 204 not out in the Battle of the Saints against St. Josephs College in 1954.
ARNOLD is another product to emerge from the stables of Dr. H.I.K.Fernando who imparted to him, not only the finer points of the game verbally, but also showed him the strokes of a left hand batsman, off spinner and safe fielder. ARNOLD had natural talent in him and Fernando had only to do a bit of polishing and ARNOLD shone in as if polished with Kiwi polish.
ARNOLD began to unwind and score bags full of runs, take vital catches, take wickets for SPC then join the club that has produced champion cricketers Nondescripts Cricket Club.
Tutelage of Fernando
Coming under the tutelage of former Sri Lanka opening batsman and wicket keeper RANJIT FERNANDO who showed him how to accustom to the mans game, from schoolboy level and finally sport the countrys colours.
So it can be seen that it was the two FERNANDOS who paved the path for ARNOLD to hit the bright lights in a career that brightened with every outing until he quit the game, leaving many exciting moments to remember.
I was on a tour of Zimababwe with the Sri Lanka cricket team covering the tour for the Daily News and the SUNDAY OBSERVER, where I had the good fortune to watch ARNOLD chisel out one of his treasured and memorable centuries in Bulawayo.
Effortless stroke play
I was in the company of Dr. Kitta Rajaratnam and his wife Soma who also soaked in the beautiful and effortless stroke play of ARNOLD. In Bulawayo Dr. Rajaratnam acted as the physician for the Sri Lanka team.
ARNOLD who has no connection to that balladeer EDDIE debuted in Test cricket against Pakistan in 1997 and his international debut was against South Africa in the following year. He showed ideal technique and temperament for both versions of the game. He started off as a batsman at the top where he made a lasting impression against Australia at the AIWA Cup of 1999.
Like all great players ARNOLD suffered a slump but by sheer courage and determination made big scores in club cricket which forced the selectors to recall him.
Favourite stroke
ARNOLDS favourite stroke was the cut shot which he played with aplomb and was a beauty when executing that stroke which brought him a lot of runs. He is best remembered when he partnered former master blaster Sanath Jayasuriya in his devastating knock of 189 in Sharjah against India.
ARNOLD batted in the number one slot for SPC where he showed good temperament against the new ball. But with former Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu hugging that slot, he was forced to find solace in the middle order.
ARNOLD it is said was forced to take to cricket by his grandfather. He was afforded the chance of a Test debut when regular opener Roshan Mahanama went out with an injury. His first foray into opening batting saw him make only 24 and 15 in the Test.
Known as finisher
ARNOLD was known as the finisher in the limited-over game, a role associated with Michael Bevan and James Faulkner of Australia. He performed magnificently in that role. His memorable knocks were 91 not out against New Zeland,76 not out and his three figure score and 51 not out against Zimbabwe, 57 against Pakistan,49 not out and 68 not out against India.
Arnolds knocks in Tests to remember - 123 and unbeaten 56 against Pakistan, 62 and 109 against England. He retired from the game after the 2007 World up. He is now a top class TV cricket commentator and TEN sports are fortunate to have him in their panel.
He is not biased like some commentators are, but gives praise where praise is due and is not afraid to take to task any cricketer who is not performing as he should and even administrators. ARNOLD can hold his own against the best in the world and can be classed with Indias Sunil Gavaskar in commentating.
RUSSEL ARNOLD is a pride to the game and country.

Botox for smooth Kate Middleton-like locks
Botox is no longer regarded as the trendy go-to treatment to banish wrinkles. A growing number of women are now turning to have their perfect blow-dries last longer and to stop them from sweating when they hit the gym, the Daily Mail reported.
Demand for the procedure has become so popular that dematalogists are calling the new trend Blotox.
Women reportedly want the treatment to keep their smooth locks intact like Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge.
How does it work The procedure works by "inhibiting the eccrine glands" as a result the reduced perspiration in the scalp causes less frizz and patients do not have to wash their hair as frequently, the report revealed.
Another reason it is applied on the scalp is to treat extreme sweating. "I have been doing blotox for about eight years," New York dermatologist Dr Michelle Henry told US Weekly. "I had a number of patients that were resistant to working out because they didn't want to ruin their hairstyle or blowout," she explained.
Dr Henry also claims it makes a big difference in the lives of working women who want to look great but who are in a constant rush. The treatment is said to help keep curly or kinky hair straight for longer than usual.
Clinical director Dr David Eccleston, is another doctors who swears by the treatment. "I have been using Botox for 20 years to treat everything from facial wrinkles to underarm sweating and migraine," he told the Daily Mail. Adding, "Botox stops sweating by blocking the nerve impulses to the individual sweat glands. When used in the scalp, sweating is reduced, thus reducing the tendency of straightened hair to return to its curly state."
Currently this new trend has become very popular in the US and UK.

Budget deficit  to reduce to  4.8% - Minister
Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said yesterday the main highlight of this budget is the expectation that the budget deficit would come down to 4.8 percent of the GDP.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said a heavy budget deficit of 5.7 percent and 7.7 percent of the GDP was recorded in 2014 and 2015 respectively. It is expected to reduce this to 4.8 percent through budget 2018.
We have also increased public investments significantly. Public investment which was Rs.487 billion in 2014 is expected to be increased upto Rs.761 billion through the budget.
Dr. Amunugama said that most of the people who engaged in corruption during the previous regime had purchased land and houses with their ill gotten money and that is why a capital gain tax was introduced.
The income tax revenue was Rs.198 billion in 2014 and we hope to increase it to Rs.375 billion in 2018. This income tax is applied only to rich people and we wonder why this income was much less during the previous regime. We have a doubt as who benefited from this,the Minister said.

Budget envisions SL as true maritime hub  Tittawella
The 2018 Budget proposals towards the liberalisation of the shipping industry were presented with a view to making Sri Lanka a true regional maritime hub, said Ministry of Finances Senior Advisor Mano Tittawella.
Speaking at the seminar on the national budget organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce yesterday, he said that the proposal to liberalise the shipping and logistics industry would also bring in additional foreign exchange to the country.
Tittawella said that the proposals are much more than merely relaxing the regulations on foreign players in the shipping and logistics industry. We want to send a message that Sri Lanka is liberalising. We also want to say that we are not limiting the industry to a few local companies.
Tittawella said that the government wants to broadbase the industry and create more competition and bring in more players, rather than confining the shipping sector to a few individuals and companies.
When we open up the industry, it would bring in significant economic benefits to the country.
He also said that one must not forget the benefits the export sector would have from these proposals. With the liberalisation, there would be competition, creating better benefits for exporters.
He also said the government has turned around one white elephant by leasing out the Hambantota Port and they are now in initial talks to also turn around Mattala International Airport.
Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance, S.R. Attygalle, answering a question from the audience said that there was a technical error with regard to import and offering tax concessions for electric vehicles.
This will now be implemented for vehicles under one year old.
He also said that the tax system proposed for the motor industry has simplified it and now it would be almost impossible to under invoice vehicles, by which the government had up to now lost a lot of tax revenue from motor imports.
Commenting on the carbonated drinks, he said that the new tax will apply according to the contents of sugar and drinks like soda would not have additional tax.

Review:
Charmed by the Chinese Heart!
For one night only, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra came to Colombo. The stage was set at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre last Friday, and the audience was packedfilling both the theatres ground level and its two balconies. From across the city, and indeed the country, patrons of the arts came to hear what the Orchestra had in store.
The China Cultural Centre in Colombo, which hosts an array of Chinese cultural events year-round, had arranged the Tianjin Symphony Orchestras performance. As the first in China to introduce western music to its audiences back in 1985, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra had a reputation that preceded the music it played. And when the orchestral members took to the stage, clad in formal wear that felt fitting of the momentous occasion, and then took their seats, they didnt disappoint.
For the next two hours, give and take, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra put on a performance that would put to shame any other citys.
The tunes fluctuated from songs native to the country of originsuch as Good News From Beijing Spreads to the Borderland and My Chinese Heartto songs that most western audiences might know, or at least recognize.
There was Brahms played, and there was also Quincy Jones, whose Bossa Nova rendition by the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra lit up the audience.
A particular highlight of the evening came during a male-female opera duet for the song, Libiamo Ne Lieti Calici, from La Traviata, an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi set to an Italian Libretto by Francesco Maria Piave.
Under immense pressure, the two soloists voices increased in their strength, reaching heights and notes inaccessible to the average human. All this, no doubt, was only added to by the impressive acoustics inside the Nelum Pokunaseemingly designed to bring out the best of sound.
Equally as impressive was that the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra performed to the highest and most meticulous of standards all without a conductor.
It was an usual sight to beholdno suit-clad figure standing in front, directing musicians one way or another. Instead, the musicians took their cues from each other, never missing a beat, never appearing unsteady or unsure of which key or note or song to play next.
This speaks to the intense, rote preparation and practice that undoubtedly went on behind the scenes and in advance of this performance.
The entire evening, if the audiences reaction is a proper barometer, can be classified as nothing if not an utter success.
What was meant to be the final song, termed Hooked on Classics by the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra, was an amalgam of various classics that sparked joy in the listeners ear. And at its conclusion, the applause was so overwhelming, so enthusiastic, that the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra had no choice but to perform an encore.
Playing Jacques Offenbachs Infernal Galop, also known colloquially as the Can Can Song, before transitioning into a more traditional Chinese orchestral song, Blooming Flowers and Full Moon, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra knocked the encore out of the park. The only possible fault with the evening is that it ended too soon.
Inside the theatre, I was lucky enough to be sitting alongside a delegation from the Chinese High Commission in Colombo, including the Ambassador Yi Xianliang. Throughout the evening, the entire delegation wore looks of pride stretched wide across their faces. And after hearing the performance of the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra in all its glory, I could easily understand why.

China pledges fair treatment of foreign firms as it opens up
China should improve the business environment for foreign investors and further widen access to its services sector, Vice Premier Wang Yang wrote in the official Peoples Daily, as the country seeks to raise its competitiveness in the global economy.
Wang was recently named a member of the seven-member Communist Partys Politburo Standing Committee, the height of power in China, at the partys twice-a-decade national congress.
Wang said China should also bring in more foreign technology and business expertise, not just foreign capital, while also stepping up its outbound investment and encouraging firms to expand globally.
The domestic and international trends facing (economic) opening are undergoing deep and complex changes. The opportunities and challenges are unprecedented, but the opportunities are greater than the challenges, Wang wrote.
At the recently concluded twice-a-decade Communist Party congress, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for making new ground in pursuing opening up on all fronts, and has pledged to allow greater access to Chinas markets for foreign investors.
China has been accused of unfairly subsidizing exports and of restricting foreign access to its domestic market, with U.S. President Donald Trump often complaining of the massive trade surplus China runs with the United States.
During his trip to Beijing this week, Trump again said trade between the two nations was unfair, while Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States.
Wang wrote that China should compete for global capital not by offering preferential policies, but by creating a fair, transparent, law-based and predictable business environment.
China must also protect intellectual property, not require technology transfer as a condition of gaining market access, and should treat domestic and foreign firms equally in government procurement and the countrys China 2025 plan to upgrade its manufacturing sector, Wang wrote.
China must focus on higher-quality production and building competitive advantages in technology, standards and brands as the traditional development model has hit a bottleneck, Wang wrote.
Labor costs continue to rise, resource constraints are increasingly tight, the load on the environment is reaching a limit, and traditional competitive advantages of opening have weakened, Wang wrote, while adding that Chinas large market, good infrastructure and environment for innovation give it advantages.
In line with regular pledges by government officials to open more sectors to foreign firms, Wang said China would focus on orderly opening of the financial, education, culture, and health care industries, while lowering market entry limitations on e-commerce, logistics, early childhood education and elderly care.

Citizens' Mail
Stop killer drivers!
Once again, we have seen the carnage and loss of innocent lives due to reckless driving by an irresponsible driver on a long distance bus. The Madurankuliya accident must never happen again, and seeing the footage in the electronic media one can imagine the horror experience and shock of the unsuspecting passengers. The bus was virtually decapitated into two.
It is sad that despite the prevalent motor traffic laws, the authorities are unable to prevent such accidents happening. One can only fear that accidents of this nature will only increase due to the development of express ways and better and wider roads between major towns in the country. The recent increase in fines for traffic violations is totally inadequate and will not serve as any form of deterrent. In my opinion, the punishments must go to the extent of life-bans from driving, cancellation of driving licenses for a longer period of time and convicting offenders on man-slaughter charges with long prison sentences, as in this instance when the driver was reckless and completely at fault for trying to overtake another vehicle when approaching a culvert. Authorities must increase highway patrolling and speed checking at regular intervals on all highways and main roads and consistently apply the laws if we are to eradicate this scourge.
Recently, I was on a company outing to Jaffna for which we happened to hire two super luxury buses which were regular Jaffna/Colombo route buses. On our return journey the driver of the bus I was in, failed to stop when the traffic police patrol flagged the bus down for overtaking on a bend at high speed, on the Aunradhapura - Puttalam main road.
The Police Patrol gave chase for more than 10 km and stopped the bus, severely reprimanding the driver, who had already being copped for several previous offences and was carrying only a temporary driving license at the time.
A majority of long distance drivers are known to be such reckless maniacs, and must be stopped at all costs, if we are to prevent such tragedies and loss of innocent lives.
The IGP, Ministers of Law and Order, Highways and Transport act fast and make road safety a priority!

Corruption case against Gota fixed for trial

A corruption case filed against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government by giving permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury was fixed for trial by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's court, today.
Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara fixed the case for trial on February 26 and March 26.
 Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate decided to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabaya Rajapaksa citing that the Director General of Bribery Commission is vested with power to file cases in the Magistrates Court in accordance with the Bribery Commission Act.
The defence raised preliminary objections alleging that the Bribery Commission Director General had filed this case without the written sanction of the Bribery Commission.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Bribery Commission.
President's Counsel Ali Sabry appeared for former Defence Secretary.
When the matter came up before the Chief Magistrate, seven accused, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Avant Garde Chairman Major Nissanka Senadhipathi, former Navy Commanders Somatilleke Dissanayake, Jayanath Kolambage and Jayantha Perera, Rtd. Major General Palitha Piyasiri Fernando and Banda Adhikari were present in Courts.
The charge sheets comprising 19 counts were served on the accused before the Chief Magistrate.
 Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate had at a previous occasion allowed to proceed the case in absentia of second accused Sujatha Damayanthi, former Additional Secretary to the Defence Ministry.
 The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against eight accused under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
 The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had had given permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury between August 7, 2012 and January 8, 2015 in violation of laws by providing unlawful income to this private company, amounting to Rs.11.4 billion.

CR favourites to topple CH today
CR & FC will go out as the favourites to overcome rejuvenated CH and FC but the game could be a closely fought out battle for supremacy in their Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby tournament match at Racecourse international grounds, Reid Avenue today commencing at 3.45pm.
Unbeaten CR have managed to win both their matches in this ongoing league tournament of 2017/18 winning against Air Force SC (21-9) at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana and a sensational second half rally win coming from 7-23 behind at half time to stun Navy SC 38-23. Acting captain cum centre Tharinda Ratwatte contributed a fantastic 23 points.
The red shirts will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Navy but will miss the services of their speedy captain and wing three quarter Kavindu Perera. He is out due to a three-match suspension slapped on him for a high tackle carried out in their opening fixture against the Airmen. Inspiring centre Tharinda Ratwatte will be in charge of the team as acting skipper for the second game in succession.
CR boasts of having in their ranks quality talented players in the form of Ratwatte, Kushan Indunil, Kavindu de Costa and Chanaka Chandimal who are playing a key role as the halves combination. Then comes the granite forward cum rolling maul pilot Supun Warnakulasuriya and players in the caliber of Charana Chamikara, Udara Gayan, Vageesha Weerasinghe, Reeza Rafaideen, Sashan Mohamad and ever reliable full back Rehan Silva.
CH and FC might look to register a shock win through their think tank and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa leading them from the front.
The CH and FC outfit has failed to live up to expectations losing (6-23) to Kandy SC at Racecourse grounds in their first match and lost to Army SC last week by (15-20) after leading 15-10 at the breather. CH who has faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players yet recovering from injuries is bound to field a couple of sidelined big names for todays game. However adding to their woes would be the absence of their granite number eight Chathura Dilshan due to a nasty injury he sustained in their opening game against defending champions Kandy SC. Most probably Dilshan will be out for the entire first round.
Rajapaksa will face another acid test after losing to the soldiers to obtain a win in this game, while the CR skipper Ratwatte has fared admirably well with the young resurgent force pulling off a superb win over formidable sailors last week. Hence they will go all out to pull this one through with a bonus point victory as well.
Last year CR & FC won the first round as well as the return match at Longden Place and Racecourse grounds respectively.
Teams:
CR & FC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Supun Warnakulasuriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Charana Chamikara, Gayan Jayamanna, Sashika Ashan , Vageesha Weerasinghe, Omalka Gunaratne, Kavindu de Costa and Chanaka Chandimal , Sashan Mohamad, Kushan Indunil, Tarinda Ratwatte (Captain), Reeza Rafaideen, Rehan Silva, Head Coach: Fereti Verabula (Fiji)

Drums of war Vs calling the nation to violence
People receiving media attention in a country such as political leaders and ex-Army officers directly or indirectly entertaining thoughts of violence and recommending such as a means of solving problems of a complex nature that crop up in a democracy is a dangerous trend that has to be seriously addressed. Failure to do so at the early stages can have disastrous consequences.
In 1971 I remember I was at a conference with the IGP with several other Senior Officers when the intelligence chief of the time interrupted this meeting informing the IGP that there was verified information to the effect that police stations would be attacked and arms and ammunition seized. The immediate reaction was one of total disbelief. However the information proved dead accurate. The rest is history.
As reported by several newspapers during the past few days, National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa has stated that Parliament should be bombed if the proposed draft constitutional reforms receive the two thirds majority.
Unlike in 1971 situation it is difficult to guess whether Weerawansa is rhetorically beating war drums, or genuinely attempting to scare the parliamentarians from voting to make up the two thirds majority. If it is the latter, the threat is a downright act of terrorism that has to be dealt with appropriately by law. The behaviour of a cornered tiger is unpredictable. Only the intelligence sleuths will be able to make a reasonable assessment of Weerawansas frightening outburst.
Several other politicians making comments in favour of Weerawansas threat and a retired Senior Army officer too joining the party, one begins to wonder whether the call to violence is becoming louder and clearer.
Nations topmost organisation
Parliament that represents the people is symbolic of the supremacy of the people. It is the nations topmost organisation. Any insult or threat made against Parliament directly or indirectly by a member of the public or even a Member of Parliament directly impacts on the entire population. No person born to, and has grown up in a democratic culture, with even an iota of knowledge and understanding of the role and importance of Parliament will even in the wildest of dreams entertain thoughts of degrading or destroying the hallowed institution.
Any act that has been committed detrimental to the security of parliament has been etched in history. The early Seventeenth Century gunpowder plot is annually commemorated as Guy Falkes Day. The measures taken to protect parliament from the forays of the Luftwaffe during world War-II and the secret procedures adopted to keep Parliament functioning for critical decision making are indeed high points in recent British history. In these circumstances, even a veiled threat to destroy parliament would have been considered high treason the punishment for which is death.
The insulting and degrading behaviour of some members of our parliament in recent times have certainly brought down the stature of the House, but in no way has been a threat to the existence of the House or its security.
On August 18, 1987 our Parliament came under a grenade attack at which an MP and official were killed. The attack was carried out by a former JVPer Ajit Kumar supposedly a kinsman of Weerawansa.
In this instance the real targets were the President and the Prime Minister. However they were not hurt. The objective was not to threaten, intimidate or extort. Nor was it done with the intension of destroying the institution of Parliament the primary symbol of our democracy. There was no prior warning or any demands.
Constitution making process
When I read the news about Weerawansas utterance, the thought that occurred to me was, what if an accused had in a court of law stated that the Court should be bombed if the verdict was not in his favour! He would have been promptly shoved into the court cell and summarily dealt with for contempt of Court.
With the entire country focussed on the Constitution making process, religion race and the nature of the state that have for decades been sensitive issues have turned out to be hot and burning issues. Historically, these issues have been directly or indirectly responsible for the violence of 1956, 1958, and 1983 not forgetting the thirty year war. With hordes of media men hawkishly waiting to capture whatever that come out of the mouths of politicians, the Buddhist clergy and other interested men and women, extremists and rabble rousers are having a field day.
Having been the Intelligence Chief of the country way back in the seventies, the writer is constrained to observe that the ground is being craftily and systematically prepared for violence and rebellion by some interested in toppling the government.
Having personally experienced mob violence both in Sri Lanka and the United States, it is akin to forest fires. With arson and looting; and fanned by rumour it becomes uncontrollable. Once the spreading flames gather momentum the perpetrators merge into the background as innocent spectators.
The utterances of the politician who once belonged to an outfit that believed in the violent overthrow of the state and the army officer who occupationally was submerged in a culture of legitimized violence should be taken as a fore-warning of violent situations to come. The government must act. It has the right to act. To nip in the bud any possibilities of the eruption of violence before they develop into uncontrollable, marauding juggernauts is the responsibility of the government.
There is another good reason why Weerawansa as a MP should never have threatened to bomb parliament. After all, membership of Parliament is the only job for which even the ability to read and write is not required. The value of the powers, perks and privileges enjoyed by MPs is inestimable.
Even emperors and kings can be envious of the hedonistic lives of our MPs. By threatening to bomb this fountain of sustenance and pleasure Weerawansa has committed an unpardonable act of gross ingratitude.

Enlighten the law enforcement
The Supreme Court, in a landmark judgement, has declared that the fundamental rights of a British woman, who had the image of a Buddha tattooed on her upper arm, had been violated and offered her compensation, amounting to Rs. 800,000. Justice Anil Gooneratne, with Justices Eva Wanasundera and Nalin Perera, agreeing, awarded the petitioner, Naomi Michelle Coleman Rs. 500,000, payable by the State, and, Rs. 50,000, each, by Police Sergeant Upasena and Katunayake Police Acting OIC Inspector Suraweera. Court also awarded Rs. 200,000 as costs, payable by the state. It held that her fundamental right to freedom from torture, right to equality, and, freedom from arbitrary arrest, had been infringed upon. It also ruled that the magistrate had no right to make a deportation order, and, that, deportation of a foreigner is governed by the Immigration and Emigration Act and the power to make a deportation order is vested with the subject minister.
The SC, certainly, has delivered a resounding slap in the face of the countrys law enforcement, and its allied agencies, which, in this instance, had clearly overstepped their mark, and, assumed the role of a Religious Police, ala the fundamentalist Muslim theocracies, in the Middle East. The SC has made its ruling based on the countrys laws and it has come to a clear decision that Ms. Coleman had not infringed any law of this country. Besides, she had been a practising Buddhist, and, had been attending meditation retreats in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and India. It is as a tribute, and, as a personal expression of her devotion to Buddhist teaching that she had a tattoo displayed on her right upper arm of a Buddha, seated on a lotus flower, she told court.
Well, the police, which, arrested Ms. Coleman, for displaying a Buddha tattoo on her person, could not have been all that enamoured by Buddhism, given the treatment meted out to her, following her arrest. According to the petitioner, the prison guard, who was in charge, while at court, had made several lewd, obscene and disparaging remarks, of a sexual nature. The woman prison guard had also demanded a sum of Rs. 10,000 from her, and attempted to take her mobile phone. She was also subjected to a full body search, by a female officer, and that an inmate provided her a mat, to sleep for the night, with 60 other inmates sharing the room.
This, certainly, is outright harassment, of a foreigner, by the law enforcement, with the clear intention to extract financial benefit, making use of the opportunity, with any insult to Buddhism furthest from their minds. There is no other explanation for the ordeal Ms Coleman was subjected to, which, to say the least, was exceedingly disproportionate to the so called insult made to the Buddha, by the display of a tattoo of the Buddha image.
There certainly are insults galore, made to the Buddha, and, His noble teachings, in this country, under our very noses, with the so called custodians of the Buddha Dhamma, the worst offenders. We see Buddhist clergy descending to the level of street ruffians, joining unruly mobs, in protest demonstrations, hurling missiles and objects at the police, bringing disgrace and dishonour to the saffron robe. There was also the instance, where, a member of the Sangha, who had earned much notoriety, creating a scene at a courthouse, for which he was charged for Contempt of Court. How, Muslim establishments, and businesses, were attacked, by mobs, led by groups of Bikkhus, no doubt, is still fresh in the minds of the public, as, with attacks on Christian denominational churches. The actions by certain members of the Sangha, who spew out rabid racist sentiments, at public meetings, and, discourses, too, no doubt, would not be endorsed by the vast majority of Buddhists in this country, who adhere to the Buddhas doctrine of ahimsa and tolerance.
We dont need a Coleman to desecrate the image of Buddha. It is happening in this country, day in and day out, with the offenders being none other than those espousing the Dhamma from the roof tops. True Buddhism is not the external, but the inner sanctity and the purity of purpose, nourished by the pristine teachings of the Noble One. Buddhism, which has stood the test of time for millennia, in this country, cannot be belittled, or insulted, in anyway, by the display of a tattoo, or any other external symbol. One often comes across tattoos of the crucified Christ, on the inner forearm, or, the chest of Christians. No hue and cry is being made that this was an insult to Christ.
It is hoped that this landmark judgement will put paid to the practice of the law enforcement in this country overreacting to, what is after all, a normal feature in the liberal cultures of the West. This is not to say that any brazen insult to Buddhism, or, any other religion, for that matter, by visitors to this country, should be condoned. What is important is to act with circumspection.

First Capital Holdings PLC (the Group) recorded a profit after tax of Rs. 731 million for the first half of 2017-18, a substantial increase compared to Rs. 406 million in the corresponding period of the previous year. Total comprehensive income for the first half was Rs. 641 million (2016-17  Rs. 406 million).
The primary dealer business dominated the Groups earnings reporting a profit after tax of Rs. 538 million for the first half (2016-17  Rs. 371 million), displaying an impressive performance.
First Capital Treasuries PLC capitalized on opportunities created by declining interest rates in the secondary market, realizing significant trading gains. With a track record of over 25 years, the company was the first licensed primary dealer appointed by the Central Bank, and is also the only listed and rated primary dealer in Sri Lanka, with a capital base of Rs. 2.2 billion. A strategic approach has led to improved activity in the corporate finance business, mobilising Rs. 13 billion for clients through structuring and placement of corporate debt securities and recording a fee income of Rs. 42 million (2016-17  Rs. 30 million) during the period under review.
First Capital Asset Management Limited recorded a substantial growth in funds under management to end with Rs. 6.7 billion as at September 30, 2017.
The Groups equity arm, First Capital Equities took several steps to strengthen its business by establishing strategic partnerships with brokering houses based in Asia and the United States, in addition to reinforcing its local efforts through the Groups expanding branch network. Whilst we are pleased with our performance to date, we expect earnings to moderate in the second half with interest rates stabilizing resulting in lower trading opportunities for the primary dealer business, said Director/Group CEO Dilshan Wirasekara.
However, we will continue to work throughout the year towards ensuring that our fundamentals remain strong to sustain our business in the long term. Our main focus is to enhance the fee-based activities and the management of risk, said Wirasekara.

Former England Under-19 captain guilty of exposure

London: Former England Under-19 captain Shiv Thakor was found guilty by a court on Wednesday of exposing himself to two women on a housing estate.
The 24-year-old Thakor, a professional cricketer with English county side Derbyshire, was arrested in July after the two offences in Mackworth, Derby, on June 12 and June 19.
One of his victims labelled him Shifty Shiv after he exposed himself through a gap in his jogging bottoms.
During a police interview, Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court was told that Thakor said he had already been sexually satisfied by his 16-year-old girlfriend so would not have committed the offences.
Giving evidence, Thakor also said he had a tendency to rearrange myself, both at the front and the back.
Thakor, from Derby, had denied exposing himself and intending to cause alarm or distress at a previous hearing in the same court.
He was convicted of both offences and granted unconditional bail until his sentencing on November 24.
Giving evidence, the first witness said Thakor was very quiet and very well-mannered, adding: He knew exactly what he was doing. In his evidence, Thakor explained his conduct by saying:
I have got a tendency, that is almost a running joke, that I tend to rearrange myself both at the front and back during games.
District Judge Andrew Meachin told Thakor: I'm in absolutely no doubt that both women have given honest evidence to this court.
I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you have committed both of these offences.
Thakor was suspended on full pay by Derbyshire after the allegations became public and has not played since June.AFP

Give me a break - Im not  a cricket robot, says Kohli
KOLKATA: India skipper Virat Kohli has reiterated that he needs a break from international cricket, saying I'm not a robot.
The star batsman is expected to be rested during the latter part of the Sri Lanka series which began in Kolkata on Thursday in order to be fresh for the tour of South Africa starting in January.
Definitely I do need a rest, why don't I said Kohli, who has played seven Tests, 26 one-day internationals and 10 Twenty20 matches in 2017, more than any other Indian.
I'm not a robot, you can slice my skin and check if I still bleed, he said.
Kohli has been named in the squad for the first two Tests against Sri Lanka but is expected to be rested for the third Test, three one-day internationals and three T20s that follow.
The 29-year-old batsman is one of the fittest cricketers in the international game but is still wary of burning himself out.
This is one thing I don't think people explain properly. There's a lot of talk from outside in terms of workload whether a player should be rested or not, he said.
All these things have be taken into consideration purely because of the fact that we have built such a strong core team now of 20-25 players. AFP

He Fell  and Found A Name..!
He fell! The pavement had been unkind to him, he hadnt seen the sharp stone sticking out, uneven, arrogant, catching his worn out, treadles soles and throwing him forward with a lurch. He lay quietly on the ground, waiting for arms he knew would come to help him up, but there were none.
He thought of friends, men and women who would have rushed gladly to lift him up from cruel, callous ground, but knew they were not there anymore; theyd also fallen, into deeper pits called graves or had been laid on cremation fire that had smoked their souls away.
He lay on the ground and looked sideways at the road; he saw people glancing at him, Hey, he tried to shout, Pick me up, will you! But no sound came from him, and the people seeing his lips move looked at each other and shook their heads, they thought he was drunk maybe.
Or maybe they did not want to get involved. Lifting an old man up, meant they would be late for work, for their movie, for a date with some new friend, their journey home, their bus that would come any moment. Lifting him up, meant involvement.
This was a city of concrete walls, concrete hearts. He pushed himself up a bit and slumped. There was no strength for him to lift himself.
Where was his son No, he had no son, not anymore. He had turned his face away at the bride hed brought home. How could you hed cried. We are Brahmin! We do not marry out of our caste! Get out! His son had left with Muslim bride in tow.
Hed heard theyd had a daughter. As he lay on the ground he wondered who she looked like. Did she look like his son, or did she have the pretty looks of her mother Her prettiness stole my sons heart! he muttered to himself even as he lay on the ground. He closed his eyes, then heard a voice, Wake up! Wake up!
He opened his eyes and wondered what the blackness was till he realized it was black clothing he was seeing; a woman in a burqa. Wake up! she said. Ah good your eyes are open! Now hold my hand and get on your feet. I saw you fall, I was at the bus stop, I thought youd scramble up yourself, but when you didnt I realized you needed help!
She pulled him up.
What is your name he asked. She told him, Its a beautiful name! he whispered. She patted the dust from his clothes, smiled and slowly walked away.
Son! he called his son on the phone later, What name have you given your daughter
Dad its you. Said his son, No, we havent named her yet!
May I visit my granddaughter he asked, I have a name for her..!

HYBRID VEHICLE LEASING MADE 70 to 30% : Finance Minister
The unity government has always listened to the people.Through the proposals of the people, we have been able to further satisfy them with this budget, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
We have taken measures to reduce the tax on electric vehicles from midnight on Wednesday, including used electric vehicles.Earlier we said leasing facilities for hybrid vehicles would be made 50 to 50 percent, but now we have further improved that to 70 to 30 percent, he said. Minister Samaraweera, making the winding up speech in the second reading of the Budget-2018 debate, announced details of the procedure for collecting VAT on the sale of condominium housing unit and the removal of restrictions on the foreign ownerships on the shipping and the freight forwarding agencies.
The minister relaxed the policies further and announced that the importation of vehicles has also revised the policy on Loan to Value (LTV) ratio on the financing for purchase of vehicles under lease basis.
Responding to the Joint Opposition, Samaraweera said the Joint Opposition members were talking as if they have awoken from the dead.
The Lamborghini tax was relaxed, the Marriage Tax was increased by Rs. 4,000 and the death certificate levy was increased by Rs. 2,000. I dont want to speak of how they presented the budget, but they put the country into an abyss.They failed to listen to the people and increased the price of many food items.
The Loan to Value Ratio will be revised and the Finance facilities could be provided by banks up to 50 percent of the value - for petrol and diesel motor cars,70 percent of the value - for hybrid cars and 90 percent of the value - for electric cars. Duty on locally assembled vehicles will remain as 30 percent and not 40 percent as announced in the budget on November 9, he said.
The tax concession announced in the budget 2018 for the imported brand new electric cars will be extended to cover used electric cars, which are not more than one year old.
According to a Gazette notification issued by the Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, the duty of the used electric cars that are not more than one year old will be reduced by around Rs. one million. Consequently, the duty rate applicable to electric vehicles (less than one year old) will be Rs. 12,500.00 per KW power of the motor of the electric car which is less than 100 KW power.
Speaking on the VAT liability on the sale of condominium housing units, he noted that the sale of condominium housing units will be liable for VAT from April 1, 2018. However, sale under a sales agreement entered in to, before April 1 will not be liable for VAT.
The Finance Minister said the country was now on the cusp of a current account surplus in the budget for the first time in decades. External reserves have stabilised after being decimated by the significant external debt repayments that had to be made to service the debts of the previous regime. The confidence of global markets has returned as indicated by the spike in foreign returns in debt and equity markets this year, he said.
The budget talks of a group of young people. They were forgotten by all the previous governments. he said.
He referred to the nearly 200,000 young people who reach the doors of universities and are turned back. The system had failed them but today our government has reached out to this pool of unique talent that needs to be empowered. The extensive reforms in this budget will empower this young talent, the Finance Minister said.

Indian opener KL Rahuls unwanted record
KOLKATA, Thursday : India opener KL Rahul added an unwanted record to his name as he was dismissed off the first ball of the first Test against Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Thursday.
Not just that, Rahuls Golden Duck came off the first ball of the match. A seaming delivery from Suranga Lakmal squared on the Karnataka right-hander inside the crease, forcing him to play away from his body and edge the delivery to wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella.
Rahuls golden duck ended his streak of seven consecutive Test 50s.
Rahul also became only the third batsman ever to be dismissed off the first ball at this venue (Eden Gardens). Sudhir Naik and Sunil Gavaskar are the two others on this unwanted list at this venue.
Overall, Rahul is the sixth Indian batsman to join the inglorious line-up.
Apart from Naik and Gavaskar, WV Raman, Shiv Sunder Das and Wasim Jaffer are the other Indian batsmen who departed on the first delivery in a Test match.
The batting legend Gavaskar has had distinction of being dismissed off the first ball of the match three times in his career (1974, 1983 and 1987).
Englands Archie MacLaren was the first batsman to depart for a golden duck. He was sent packing by Australias Arthur Coningham during a Test match in 1894 in Melbourne.
Meanwhile, this is only the second time that Rahul was dismissed for a duck in his Test career. The last time when he departed without troubling the scorers was in the Vizag Test against England in 2016. - NDTV

Jetwing Yala Salt of the Earth Cooking Class
Juliet Coombe learns how danger is the salt of pleasure and spices up her cooking style in a fish baking master class with Jetwing Yalas inventive executive chef Nalin Nanayakkara.
At 5.30am we headed off to buy the catch of the day a delicious white fleshy fish known as mullet and to make sure it was really fresh we bought directly from the local fisherman at Kirinda fishing harbour, which is just one of the highlights of doing a Yala hands on salt baking cooking class, an exciting experience run by Jetwing Yalas innovative executive chef Nalin Nanayakkara. Returning to the hotel after lots of negotiating on the fish price of the day the fish was cleaned and we washed as well, and once in chefs gear headed for the kitchen to learn how to cook our mullet with an infusion of spices mixed into a large mountain of salt, which is heaps of fun and not dissimilar to playing in a sand pit. Nanayakkara has experimented with cooking in mud, the sand dunes and many other things, but feels salt infused with spices as a baking material has far the best results.
Specially built roads
Nanayakkara had us mixing spices thirteen different spices in fact with sea salt and then packing the fish in until it was ready to bake for 22 minutes in the oven. Nanayakkara tells me and my two sons that the next time they pick up a salt shaker to season their food, to remember that eaten salt is essential to life and constitutes a mere 6% of the annual 200 million tonnes consumed in the world.
As our fish cooked like a salt bake we learnt how to make a chocolate bomb to go with it and I had also had a chance to find out more about salt as a cooking material. Amazingly this benign looking product has an extremely colourful history that will amaze you. Apart from embedding itself in cultural phrases like they are the salt of the earth and danger is the salt of pleasure and biblical metaphors for good people, it has been regarded in the past as the essence of good tasting food with wars being fought over it, governments being toppled over it and countries revolting over taxes on it. Indeed, it is thought that the French Revolution was partly owing to the salt tax, which after being repealed was re-imposed by Napoleon and only abolished in 1945. Gandhi in India famously led 100,000 protestors, in 1930, to obtain it from the sea to avoid paying tax on it as well as using it to inspire rebellion against British rule, which he finally helped to overthrow.
Salts known history goes back some 8,000 years when, in Romania, they boiled spring water to get it and on Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, there is a salt works still producing to this day that dates back that far. Salt has been pivotal to civilisation throughout history and an important trade article, transported around the Mediterranean Sea by boat, along specially built roads and through the Sahara on camels.
What is the other 94% used for Close to Sri Lankas heart is the production of iodised salt which has vastly reduced the incidence of brain retarded children and goitres, neck swellings and iron fortified salt that reduces anaemia and other iron deficiency health issues. There are many health benefits to eating salt but clearly, too much of a good thing will always have side effects and those with high blood pressure need to be careful.
Primary requirements
How did we manage before fridges were invented In the case of meat and fish, they were and sometimes still are wrapped in salt and when cooked in a bed of salt, provide the most delicious meal. People use it in animal feed, fertilizer, cosmetics and medicine. It is also used in a staggering 14,000 plus industrial products ranging from pool disinfectant, rubber, plastic, paper, glass, polyester, sodium hydroxide, magnesium sulphate, gypsum, potash, magnesia, household bleaches, detergents, dyes and soap.
In the past, salt was held in such high esteem that it was used in the Middle East to seal an agreement; by the Hebrews in their covenants with God when sprinkling it over meat offerings; and in ancient times of war, for salting the earth after victory to curse the defeated if they ever tried to re-conquer it.
Sri Lanka is blessed with both being surrounded by sea so no shortage of supply in salt there and having lots of sun and warmth, the two primary requirements of making sea salt  they simply have to channel the sea into inland lagoons, called salterns such as the ones at Hambantota, Bundala and Palatupana and wait for the sun to evaporate the water and crystallise the salt, which takes around 40 days. It is then scraped up and left underneath a covering of coconut leaves before being crushed and packaged. Sri Lanka consumes around 150,000 tons of salt per year and is curiously not yet self sufficient in it, but plans are afoot for it to be so by 2020 and even Jetwing Yala are getting in on the act as they are planning on creating their own salt spiced up mixes to sell. Who knows we may see a whole new style of food dishes with salts such as smoked, black pepper, chilli, garlic, curry and lemon and thyme coming onto the market.
Much more can be said about salt that would fill whole books and without it, there would be no life, so join the salt of the earth and get creative like Jetwing Yala chef Nanayakkara has using salt as an unique cooking method by infusing it with island spices. Once baked the fish was taken out and the kids were allowed to break it open sending salt flying in all directions a bit like an ice block, but always being careful not to break the fish skin, which would let the salt from outside get into the white succulent flesh. Once the salt had been removed the exterior skin and scales of the fish was peeled back and enjoyed with a variety of exciting curry saucy sauces.

A wild elephant caused a catastrophe at Mattala airport by crashing in and causing damages to the elephant fences in the past few days.
The elephant had roamed around in search of its usual habitat and the officers of the Department of Wildlife had failed to chase away the elephant since a couple of days.
Before Mattala Airport was constructed, the area was a thick forest where elephants used to roam freely. However, the development processes had disturbed the habitat of the elephants, causing many changes to the wilderness.
The suggested areas separated for elephants were also used for dysfunctional development processes and other corrupted businesses, said the Department of Wildlife.
Furthermore, the officers of the Department of Wildlife request to put an end to corruption and dysfunctional development in the areas and suggested to separate areas for elephants in order to protect them.

Lakmal rattles  India on rain-hit day
KOLKATA, Thursday: Sri Lanka paceman Suranga Lakmal jolted India with three wickets, including skipper Virat Kohli, to leave them reeling at 17-3 on a rain-hit opening day of the first Test on Thursday.
Lakmal claimed Lokesh Rahul with the first ball of the match at Kolkatas Eden Gardens and bowled six overs without conceding a run.
Put in after a long rain delay that washed away the first session, India batted for only 11.5 overs before bad light ended the day.
Cheteshwar Punajara, on eight, and Ajinkya Rahane, yet to open his account, were left at the end after India suffered early blows on a green wicket that offered bounce to the seamers.
Rahul edged a rising delivery to wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella before the crowd had even settled.
The paceman then took Shikhar Dhawan for eight, after the left-hander dragged a moving delivery on his stumps. That left the hosts on 13-2.
Pujara, who was regularly beaten by the moving ball, and Kohli tried to establish themselves before bad light forced the umpires to call an early tea.
The break did India no good as Lakmal returned to trap Kohli lbw for an 11-ball zero.
Kohli, in a desperate bid to avoid a rare duck in his glowing career, reviewed the dismissal but replays suggested the ball would have clipped his leg stump.
Soon Pujara, who played 43 of the 71 balls bowled in the day, and Rahane complained of low visibility against the seamers and the umpires halted play for the day.
Sri Lanka, who lost three Tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 international in a home series against India from July to September, are searching for their first Test win in India.

The land of Kangaroos
Kangaroos are unique to Australia and they take pride in calling the country the land of Kangaroos. Kangaroo appear in the Australian coat of arms, on the currencies and on the airline logos. Here is a glimpse of the kangaroo story.
Statics ofkangaroos
When living in Australia Kangaroos become a part of our life for it is called the land of kangaroos. Australia has earned this name for very justified reason, for the kangaroos are found only in Australia. They are all the time competing to outnumber the human population. It is believed that the Kangaroos are anytime in the range of 25 million in the country. The kangaroos are counted through aerial surveys.
It is very interesting to note that there are more than fifty varieties of Kangaroos in the country. They differ in size and colour but belong to the same family polyphyletic species. They are unique creatures for a couple of reasons. One reason is the female kangaroos having a pouch to carry the babies and, the babies live in the pouch at least nine months before they step on earth. They are so tiny at the time of birth and their journey from the womb to the pouch is a wonder of nature. There is no other heavy species that can jump like a rabbit. A leap of a grown kangaroo is about 25 to 30 feet.
Life span
The largest variety - Giant Kangaroos are about seven feet in length and they live more than two decades in the wild. The Eastern Greys are five to six feet in size and have a little shorter life span than the Giants. The Western greys live half the life of Giant reds. They live in groups and work for their protection and are prepared to fight for their protection. The strong hind legs are used to kick the enemy and the hands are used to punching. There are many incidents where human beings are punched or kicked by the kangaroos. The long, strong muscular tail is used to balance body.
Slaughter
Kangaroos are so vast in numbers the state issues licence annually to slaughter a specific number for meat and leather industry. The numbers killed are so high they remain the highest harvest of wild animals in the planet. For instance, in the year 2015 the kangaroos killed remain as 6.8 million. Australia keeps looking for overseas markets for the export of the meat. The specialty is the kangaroo meat is that they are the lowest in fat content.UK is currently the best buyer of kangaroo meat. Killing is done by shooting each kangaroo on the head. As kangaroos head is small there are instances of missing the target and the bullet hitting the neck or the chest.
Leather
Kangaroo leather is well popular in the leather industry in the world. Top brand names such as Nike and Adidas to use kangaroo leather in their productions. The exports of kangaroo meat and leather brought in 174 million dollars to the country. It has generated more than 2,000 jobs to the people of Australia.
The reason why the rapid growth of kangaroos is controlled by killing them is well explained to the people by the state. It is done with the good intention of controlling the harmful damage to the environment and to protect some varieties of grass that may extinct due to over grazing.

Lanka IOC reports Rs 177 mn loss for Q3
Since January 2017, Lanka IOC has incurred a loss of Rs. 964 million mainly due to losses being suffered by the company on sale of petrol and diesel.
The company had reported a loss of Rs. 652 million for the period Jan-Mar 17, Rs. 135 million for the period Apr-Jun17 and now has reported a loss of Rs. 177 million for the quarter Jul-Sep17.
The market prices of auto fuels were last revised in January 2015 and since then, prices have not been revised in the country.
The crude oil prices which touched a bottom of US$ 30/bbl, has now arisen to almost US$ 62/bbl but the retail selling prices have remained the same.
Further, during this period, taxes have been further increased but selling prices have not been increased. Above all, oil companies have to bear the burden of exchange loss too due to depreciation of Sri Lankan rupee by almost 18%.
The recent surge in the international prices of petroleum products have further added to the losses being made by the company.
Although, company has performed well in other business segments, but since 80% of its turnover is derived from auto fuels, the loss/gain on petrol and diesel finally decides the profitability of the company.
LIOC has repeatedly requested the concerned authorities to either increase the selling prices of auto fuels or reduce the taxes. For petrol, out of selling price of Rs. 117/Ltr, Rs. 57/Ltr goes towards taxes apart from other levies. Similarly, for diesel, out of selling price of Rs. 95/Ltr, Rs. 30/Ltr goes towards taxes apart from other levies.
LIOC commands a market share of around 16% in auto fuels and balance is with Government controlled entity. As per the sources, based on the prevailing international prices of petroleum products, oil companies in Sri Lanka are losing around Rs. 24/Ltr on petrol and Rs. 16/Ltr on diesel. In view of the significant losses being incurred by oil companies and its impact on Sri Lankan economy, Government of Sri Lanka is contemplating implementation of pricing formula in the country.

Maho tops Grade 5 Scholarship results
Grade five students of the Maho educational zone in the Kurunegala District have succeeded in achieving the first place in the island this year (2017) on the results of Grade Five Scholarship Examination -2017 conducted by the Education Ministry at national level.
But there is still a shortage of 380 school teachers at schools of this educational zone. Maho is one of the remotest educational zones in the NWP.
Even then, the primary school teachers and the respective school heads of Maho educational zone have shown the best results this year in spite of the existing teacher shortage. Even in 2016, the Maho educational zone had succeeded in achieving the best at national level on the results of Grade Five Scholarship Examination-2016.
There is a shortage of 58 primary teachers, 36 Maths teachers, 16 teachers for Buddhism, 19 teachers for Sinhala Language, 63 teachers for English Language, 18 teachers for History, 26 teachers for Science, 20 teachers for Geography, 18 teachers for Civic Education, 36 teachers for Tamil Language, 32 teachers for Arts, 12 teachers for Dancing, 27 teachers for Agriculture and Physical Education at present in these schools. However, there are excess teachers in many urban and leading schools in the Kurunegala town.
It is unfair to ignore remote schools of the Maho educational zone under these circumstances, said NWP-PC councilor Bandara Rajapakse, speaking at the recent NWP-PC monthly meeting held at NWP-PC auditorium. On that occasion, NWP-PC Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayke said that as Education Minister and the Chief Minister, he would take steps at the beginning of next year (2018) to recruit a batch of 1,500 graduates for the service of remote schools of the NWP and adequate number of teachers would be appointed to all schools where teachers are mostly needed now, out of those teachers.

SRI LANKA RANKED FIFTH OUT OF THE TOP 20 COUNTRIES POLLUTING OCEANS IN THE WORLD
FLOATING PLASTIC AND POLYTHENE GARBAGE ROTATING IN VORTEXES IN THE OCEANS ACROSS THE WORLD THREATEN MARINE LIFE
According to the scientific research findings of oceanographers and marine biologists, the main sources of marine pollution are oil spills, loss or dumped ammunition, garbage from ships and boats which mostly comprise of plastic and polythene containers, dumping of nuclear and industrial waste, lost cargo, sewage effluents and chemical fertilizers.
When it comes to Sri Lanka, the Global Coastal Index paints a very bad picture of its oceans with the island being ranked 5th out of 20 countries identified for dumping polythene and plastic to the oceans.
China ranks number one on the scale, responsible for marine pollution with a release of 8.82 metric tons of plastic and polythene garbage annually to the oceans.
Research carried out by the US based International Business Times (2010) covering 192 countries showed that Sri Lanka dumped 1.59 metric tons annually into the Indian Ocean.
One of the main sources of such waste stems from low income groups living in close proximity to river banks and fishing communities living along the coastal belt of Sri Lanka who are in the habit of dumping plastic waste material to the rivers, canals and other water ways. During heavy floods these plastic items end up in the sea. In addition, unregulated tourism hotspots along the beach tend to use the beach as a dumping ground for waste. Total ignorance of the damage caused by plastic and polythene garbage on environment and lack of civic consciousness of the Sri Lankans are the factors that aggravated the issues relevant to every aspect of environmental conservation.
Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumar, the General Manager of the Marine Environment Authority of Sri Lanka and former Head of the Faculty of Oceanography and Marine Geology, Ruhuna University has conducted extensive research on marine pollution. He is of the opinion that in resolving environmental constraints in Sri Lanka, a united effort by stakeholders is a must. In addition, all community members at the grassroots level should be made aware of the damage caused to the sensitive marine ecosystems and its biodiversity through the dumping of plastic garbage into the water.
IMPACT OF TOURISM ONTHE ENVIRONMENT:
Fortunately, those who earn their livelihood through the tourism industry are conscious of the importance of maintaining the cleanliness of the beach stretch and having the sea free from plastic waste.
The employees of majority of the beach hotels located around the coastal stretch of Sri Lanka are engaged in beach cleaning programmes with the participation of foreign holiday makers. This is being turned into a fast spreading and healthy trend among tourists who are environmentally conscious.
Unfortunately, local holiday makers who make brief visits to tourist resorts are often seen polluting the beach by dumping plastic waste such as plastic bottles, lunch boxes and numerous other plastic containers.
Marine Garbage Vortexes
Annually, more than 135,000 tons of plastic and polythene garbage have been dumped on a regular basis by fishing, naval and commercial vessels. It is also estimated, almost all the fishing crafts across the world engaged in fishing industry lose or discard about 149,000 tons of fishing gear comprising nets, ropes, traps, and buoys made out of plastic and polythene to the oceans.
This garbage dumped into the oceans turn into floating marine garbage vortexes. Due to the powerful wind movements in the oceans, ocean currents circulate forming huge vortices known in oceanography as  gyres which pulls in marine garbage comprised of plastic and polythene material in its center. There are five major gyres rotating in the oceans, namely the Indian Ocean Gyre, North Atlantic Gyre,
North Pacific Gyre, South Pacific Gyre and the South Atlantic Gyre.
Plastic and polythene constitute nearly 90 percent of garbage found in the oceans and marine scientists estimate that 46,000 pieces of plastic have been identified per square mile. Plastic material floats into the regions where ocean gyres circle large areas of calm water and this plastic debris twists and turns by ocean currents and accumulate in the gyres for years. These areas are known as garbage patches.
The Indian Ocean Gyre was discovered in 2010 and covers a large area of five million square kilometres or two million square miles. Scientific research on Indian Ocean garbage patch however is yet to be complete.
Marine garbage patches circulate in the open oceans and due to effects of suns rays, the marine garbage patches comprised of polythene and plastic break into tiny particles. This process known as Photodegradation; a process where solar radiation causes fragmentation is further aided by wave action. Some plastic pellets have been identified to be fragmented to tiny particles thinner than human hair and some cannot even be seen by the naked eye. These particles are not absorbed into the natural system and these tiny pieces of fragmented plastic and polythene are highly durable and sometimes last for hundreds to thousands of years.
GREAT NORTH PACIFICGARBAGE PATCH:
Captain Charles Moore discovered the Great North Pacific Garbage Patch which is also known as Pacific
Trash Vortex in 1997. After the Transpac sailing boat race held in 1999, Captain Charles Moore claimed to have come across massive stretch of floating debris in the Central North Pacific Ocean. It covers the water body of the west coast of North America to Japan. The weight of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch according to marine scientists is around seven million tons and is nine feet deep. The ocean currents of the North Pacific Gyre have trapped the plastic and polythene material floating in the deep sea. Research findings revealed that 60 to 90 percent of marine debris comprised of plastic and polythene. According to the scientific findings, Santa Barbaras National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis of the University of California (NCEAS), annually 8 million metric tons of plastic reach the oceans from around the world. Similarly the global consumption of plastic was estimated to reach over 297.5 million tons by the end of 2015.
PLIGHT OF MARINE ANIMALS
These microscopic plastic and polythene pellets rich in toxic material are swallowed by the zooplanktons and protozoans who form the basis of the marine food chain and thus affect the whole food chain. All marine creatures from the largest to the microscopic organisms swallow the sea water soup comprised of toxic chemicals produced by plastic decomposition. According to the US Department of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, floating plastic debris in oceans kill 100,000 marine mammals such as whales, sea lions and millions of sea birds annually. Scientific research findings have revealed, numerous shapes of plastic and polythene fishing gear abandoned or lost in the oceans have crippled nearly 30,000 fur seals a year.
Sea birds die entangled in plastic and polythene fishing lines. In addition, both sea birds and marine mammals swallow plastics. Porpoises and whales on the other hand have been suffocated by plastic bags. In order to find out the causes of death of sea turtles and sea birds, scientists have conducted dissections and gathered large amounts of plastic in their intestines.
Land based sources have been identified as causing eighty percent of worlds marine pollution. A recent study on the decomposition of plastic has revealed that tons of plastic waste floating in the oceans decompose speedily at a lower temperature than earlier revealed, releasing toxic substances into sea water. It is estimated that 260 million tons of plastic are used annually by human beings mostly due to its versatile nature, light weight, flexibility and moisture resistance. Human beings across the world consume fish that had eaten other fish which had already eaten toxic saturated plastic and polythene entered into the marine food chain. Thus, the final victims are also the human beings who should be held responsible for polluting the marine environment.
BLUE-GREEN ECONOMY
The 2018 Budget recently suggested several initiatives to clean up our beaches and protect our marine environment. Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera in his Budget speech acknowledged that as our ocean bed was almost 26 times the size of our land mass, the government would promote a Blue-Green Economy with a multi-pronged strategy with a focus on building the institutional framework, harnessing the existing activities while diversifying to others without compromising its ecological balance.
Accordingly it was proposed to allocate Rs. 25 million to have an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) mechanism which will be developed with the participation of all stakeholders.
To stop the risk of erosion of the coastal belt and its pollution, it was proposed to allocate Rs. 400 million to initiate a project on Beach Replenishment from Mount Lavinia to Ratmalana which will then be expanded to create further investments, especially in Tourism and Fisheries industries.
An investment of Rs. 800 million will also be made to protect the coastal belt from Negombo to Marawila, which will include the erecting of stone hedges, cleaning and replanting mangroves.
There are 116 lagoons and estuaries in the country. Lagoons have a unique eco system that must be safeguarded to support climate mitigation, resilient growth and conservation. As such, during 2018, the government will invest in 10 lagoons namely Negombo, Rekawa, Puttlam, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Nandikadal, Nayaru, Chilaw, Mundalam and Andikulama Lagoons a sum of Rs 1 billion. Such investment will be directed towards cleaning the lagoons, increasing the carrying capacity, supporting the existing livelihoods of fisherman besides Research and Development, Minister Samaraweera further stated.
The government will also invest a sum of Rs. 250 million to assist hotels and other industries that dispose of their waste into the lagoons to invest in technology to ensure zero discharge of waste into the lagoons.

More land for Shangri-La
The Hong Kong based luxury hotel chain Shangri-La, which opened its doors to the public yesterday, will be given an additional three and a half acres of land adjoining its hotel facing Galle Face Green. This land has been leased on a 99-year agreement for Rs. 13.1 million a perch, based on a reassessment of the land value carried out by the government.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing on Wednesday, explained that while the previous regime had leased out 10 acres to the hotel at a cost of Rs. 8.5 million a perch, the incumbent government had insisted that the value be reassessed and updated.
In 2014, the hotel chain had approached the government at the time for an additional 3.5 acres adjoining the hotel and submitted an Expression of Interest for its acquisition, said the minister.
The land which belonged to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development at the time, was assessed by the authorities to value Rs. 6.5 million a perch, he added.
On June 8, 2016, Shangri-La made another appeal for the land to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by the Prime Minister. He in turn submitted a proposal to the Cabinet asking that a new assessment of the land value be made as the 2014 value was too old, said Minister Jayasekara.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka who was also involved by then had informed the Cabinet in July that he was not against the reassessment.
Thereafter, in August 2016, then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had proposed that the reassessment be done according to the Swiss challenge method. A Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (CANC) was appointed for the purpose.
This resulted in the Cabinet on May 17, approving the assessment carried out by Perennial Holdings as per the recommendation of the CCEM, said the Minister. He added that they had also taken the decision to fast track the process and handover the land to the Board of Investment, so that it would come under foreign investments.
It is wrong to say that this was pushed by one minister. It was all done in a transparent manner.
As the land initially belonged to the Defence Ministry, the President insisted that the whole procedure should be transparent, explained Minister Jayasekara.

Mother killed by wild elephant attack
Villagers of Ampara district complain that wild elephant attacks in recent times have intensified and that the elephants are braving their way further into these villages in search of food and water.
Wild elephants damages are increasing daily in Thirukkovil, Alayadivembu, Pottuvil, Akkaraipattu and Addalaichenai villages and surrounding areas in the Ampara district that have instilled fear among villagers.
Residents said elephants have attacked houses, damaged trees, coconut saplings, home gardens, other crop cultivations and devastated paddy lands.
The residents seek refuge at night elsewhere for fear of the wild elephants. Peasants of these areas undergo great difficulty due to wild elephants that invade the area very often.
Meanwhile, a mother of 5 staying in Kannahi Village in the Alayadivembu DS division was seriously injured when a wild elephant attack caused her house wall to collapse on her on November 4 early morning. The seriously injured victim, T. Yogeswary, 55 of Kannahi Village, succumbed to injuries at the Akkaraipattu Base Hospital. Four wild elephants had entered Kannahi Village in the Alayadivembu DS division and damaged her house.
TNA Parliamentarian Kavithiran Kodiswaran visited Kannahi Village to look into the needs of the affected family.

New Constitution:
MR should have opposed resolution when it was brought to Parliament - Sampanthan
If Mahinda Rajapaksa was opposed to the creation of a new Constitution, he should have expressed his opposition at the time it was suggested without trying to stir communal tensions now by interpreting it as an effort to divide the country, Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan said in Parliament yesterday.
Joining the debate on the Second Reading on the budget proposals for the fiscal year 2018, Sampanthan appealed to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to cooperate in ensuring reconciliation in the country.
You are a very senior politician, who commands much respect from the people of this country and we want you to be a party to the making of a new Constitution, the Opposition Leader appealed.
However, Sampanthan said while Rajapaksa was in power for over 20 years, the people did not vote for him at the 2015 election.
The vote you received at the Presidential and Parliamentary election diminished considerably and the people clearly did not want you be elected as President or Prime Minister. That was the verdict of the people and that must be respected. However, the people have voted in an SLFP President and UNP Prime Minister, which means they want the two parties to work together for the benefit of this country, Sampanthan said.
The Opposition Leader said there was a resolution to concert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly, the Constitutional Assembly was to become a Committee of the whole Parliament and work was to commence in introducing a new Constitution. That resolution was circulated among the Members of Parliament and it was adopted in the House on March 9, 2016.
I want to ask Mahinda Rajapaksa if you were opposed to the introduction of a new Constitution, why did you not come to that session of Parliament and oppose that resolution Why didnt you come and say the country doesnt need this Why are you trying to stir communal feelings now Why did you not oppose it at that point of time Now the LG elections are going to be held, and you want to win the election and defeat the government which is your political right and no one can complain about that. But in order to achieve that you are trying to stir communal tensions in this country by stating that through this Constitution an effort is being made to divide this country. If that was your position, you should have come to Parliament at the time the resolution was adopted and opposed it. You did not do that. I am sorry to say that this is not the way to resolve the problems of our people, he noted.
Sampanthan said we have a situation where a resolution has been adopted at the UNHRC in October 2015. While that resolution welcomed the commitment of the Sri Lankan government to a political settlement by taking the Constitutional measures, it encourages the governments efforts to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority which is integral to reconciliation and the full enjoyment of the peoples rights.
Sampanthan pointed out that through this resolution, the country had given a commitment that it would take certain Constitutional measures to ensure reconciliation and peace in Sri Lanka. He said prior to 2015 our position in the United Nations became worse and there was a time when this country could have had economic sanctions imposed against us and the country could have been in a difficult position.
But, fortunately that did not happen because of the new direction taken by the new government, Sampanthan said.
I want to ask you are we not obliged to follow the commitment that we have already made to the UNHRC
Sampanthan said he held D.A Rajapaksa in high esteem as he was one man who crossed the floor of Parliament with S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike on principle.
Therefore, we would also like to hold you too (MP Mahinda Rajapaksa) in high esteem. Therefore, you must support the formulation of a new Constitution. I say to you, Mahinda Rajapaksa this is your fundamental duty and you must not fail in that duty, he said.

New app will help you eat your veggies!
In an attempt to tackle poor vegetable intake among adults, Australian scientists today launched a smartphone app that challenges people to eat more veggies.
The VegEze app aims to motivate people to add extra vegetables to their daily diets and form long-term, healthier habits through a 21-day Do 3 at Dinner challenge.
It helps people track their intake and tally up vegetable serves, with daily reminders and rewards to help people stay motivated and on-track.
"Our research found two out of three Australian adults are not eating enough vegetables, especially as part of their evening meal. Its time to find more engaging, effective approaches to help break these entrenched diet habits," said Manny Noakes, from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia.
"Committing to eating more vegetables every day is one of the most important ways we can improve our health today. Boosting your intake can be as easy as having three types of vegetables taking up half of your dinner plate," said Noakes.
After using the app every day, users would feel more confident in adding more vegetables to their menu.
"The beneficial nutrients and fibre from vegetables can help improve digestion, and fill you up - which can help reduce eating too much unhealthy junk food," said Noakes.
Since May 2015, researchers at CSIRO studied the dietary habits of more than 191,000 adults for its Healthy Diet Score research.
Further research of 1068 adults showed some people were being held back from eating more vegetables by low awareness, lack of time and low confidence.
To help people overcome these barriers, the VegEze app features educational resources such as a visual guide to specific vegetable serve sizes, vegetable recipes, nutritional information and motivational rewards.

Not your everyday story !
Eager hearts, impatiently waiting till its finally time to ride the magic carpet. But beforehand, the young cast of Aladdin from St. Thomas Catholic International College, Seeduwa has quite a way to cross. Aladdin, an adaption of the much loved musical will be staged on December 14 at Ave Maria Auditorium, Negombo at 6 pm together with the annual Christmas Concert, Rhythm of Thomians.
Theater is not something that one should consider as unimportant, said Director and Choreographer of the play Nigel White. Theatre makes one understand life and makes them smile. If it happens at the end of your performance, thats what matters, he said.
This years performance of the widely-loved tale, the elegant princess and her street boy admirers transformation, is not your everyday story, says the. The characters are not conventional and we are taking a new approach to the story. Getting the cast to absorb the idea of a musical was a challenge but once the children realized their own skills, they were
more eager to perform. The students practice to act, sing and dance and there is a lot of interest in them. I let the cast members build their own characters and there is something new every day. They keep on surprising you, White added.

The cast of Aladdin has 44 members from age 8 to 14. This is the second time the students of the College perform for the public. The students are tremendous, said Teacher in charge, Theatre Circle, STIC, Dilrukshi Perera.
They are capable, talented and well-trained. The play is colorful and full of activity, Perera noted. All cast members play a major role and it is lively throughout because it is a musical. The choral directing for the play is done by Emesh Wijewardene, she added.
Glowing brighter
For 14 year old Philip Francis, who is counting days to conquer the stage as Aladdin, the play reflects his life. It all feels familiar and I understand everything because I, myself, was born in an Arabic country, he said.
When Im in my character, I think and behave like Aladdin. Its like Im gone completely but only my character exists, said Francis.I have gained things in my life. But this is the biggest thing I received with which I can change the hearts of people, he stated.
When Im free, I read my script and Google for tips on acting, said Francis. Balancing school work and theatre is natural to me and I want to continue in theater because it opens up peoples hearts and shows them a different side of the world, he pointed out.
And he added with a nervous laugh that when he auditioned, he had a feeling he wouldnt get the role. But I feel there is something out there, paving me the way to do this.
Showcase talents
I just love theater! exclaimed fourteen year old Ishani Subasinghe with a wide smile. She gives life to the role of Jasmine. In theater, you get to express your emotions.
We all have talents and we get to showcase them on stage and show the world who we really are. Aladdin is not any drama. It is a musical. Its got comedy, adventure, romance and its an amazing opportunity to show your talents, Subasinghe stated.
Having studied in the United States when she was younger, and having acted in theater in the country, Subasinghe noted that compared to the US, theater experience here is different because we put out heart and soul to it. We practice day and night and we put all effort into making it a great success. Being in the play changed me a lot. I was a shy girl before but now I am braver and more confident. It is exciting when you perform to a large audience, it is an amazing feeling, she added.
Let out emotions
Shen Perera, with his lanky frame and mischievous grin, is sure that he is very much suited for the role of Jafar because I have this great, rough voice and the height for a bad guy. I had to amplify my voice so high to show a lot of emotions, said the 14 year old. My biggest challenge was to express the emotion of evil. After joining the play, I began to walk straighter, like a gentleman. The way I talk changed, as well. I also learned a lot of new words, Perera said.

Overcome challenges
Tharushi Salgadu, 13 year old student playing Genie, learned to overcome challenges through the drama. At first I couldnt sing well. I cried and cried but the director encouraged me and I practiced note by note. There is a scene where I have to jump quite high and I practiced for days before I could finally do it right, she explained with adorable solemnness.
Improving skills
Fifteen year old Nathan William, who is anticipating acting as the Sultan, enjoys the play because he gets to express all his emotions. When I perform, I feel like I am free and that the stage is my home. Theater improved my pronunciation, memorizing skills and even spellings, he said further. To William, carrying out his studying together with theatre is a challenge but he confirmed that he enjoys engaging in sports as well as theatre while doing his academic work. I wanted to try acting because I thought it would be fun to get to know others who shared the same interests.
Drama love
I love, love, love drama! exclaimed 12 year old Elizabeth Blackett. I forced my mom to let me act in Aladdin, she seems quite proud of her victory. She is a dancer in the play and said, When I am on stage, I feel like a different person. I feel so amazing, like I can do anything.
More disciplined
Twelve year old Omaya Perera recalled how she practiced hard to secure her role. In last years production, I came only once on stage, so, this time, I put in more effort and practiced very hard so I can have the role of Iago, she said.
Theatre has helped me be more disciplined. I talk a lot but when I am practicing, my teacher and the director disciplined me to concentrate, she added. I get good marks in school and I can balance my school life with theater. It helps me a lot in studies. When it comes to English, Im very fluent, now, Omaya said.
Teacher in charge, Perera added that the students in the theater circle are marvelous at studies. The best in academic studies are the children in the theater circle. They are stressful during lessons and this is a way to relax their minds. They are so enthusiastic. They practice till late night but they never seem to feel tired, Perera said.
The College theatre circle is hoping to participate in Inter-School Shakespeare competitions in 2018. My students are capable of it, said Perera and she added that the support given by parents should be appreciated.
Young hearts, bubbling with life and freedom thus learns to unfurl their wings on the radiant stage. It is a pleasant relief, indeed, to see them being guided in the right path.
Hope relies on the future that they will flourish as bright citizens who will love and respect art and endeavors such as this is a sign of that coming true.

Pallekelle industrial estate celebrates golden jubilee today
The Industrial Estate of Pallekelle, Kandy, coming under the supervision of the Industrial Development Board of Ceylon (IDB) will celebrate its golden jubilee today, with the participation of IDB Chairman Mahinda Jinasena, as chief guest.
The event to mark the completion of 50 years is jointly organized by the Pallekelle Industrial Association and the Office of the Superintendent of the IDB Industrial Estate.
The IDB, the Central Office operating from Katubedde, Moratuwa, is the prime state organization established to promote and develop industries in Sri Lanka and cater mainly to Sri Lankan enterprises, institutions and individuals.
Falling in line with this broad concept, there are 64 industries of different types operating now, under the aegis of the IDB in the Industrial Estate at Pallekelle, Kandy, 154 kilometres away from the City of Colombo. The estate covers a land area, a little more than 53 acres which comes within the Central Provincial Council and the Municipal Council of Kandy.
These factories provide 2,800 direct employment and thousands of indirect employment, a means of earning to many, who have no employment to boast about. Some of the industrialists operating here on the same land, focus their attention on the international market.
The Superintendent of the Industrial Estate Pallekelle, Kandy North, Gavarammana told the media that while they celebrate the golden jubilee of the industrial estate, its beginning was noteworthy as the estate was the rock on which many industrialists climbed the ladder of success.
The industrial estate was the stronghold on which one could heavily depend for land and other infrastructure facilities, if one had the will to begin and pursue an industry of ones choice. Of course it goes without saying that the industries commenced should be market-oriented if the industry wants to succeed and continue.
And we are told that all the industries begun in this Pallekelle estate had a great demand, a commendable market share, and their products were very much appealing to both local and foreign market. Such industrialists have found this estate a haven and 64 industrialists now operate successfully.
Gavarammana went onto say that the estate authorities here would give a helping hand to those seeking such help and guidance, creating confidence in them to proceed without hesitation. Looking back, what strikes one most was the fact that an institution set up to encourage and develop local industry, with an office on a plot of land found 12 kilometres away from the city, had taken the initiative to provide buildings necessary with three-phase electricity and other infrastructure facilities to those eagerly looking for means to commence industries of their choice.
The land is a big factor, without which no industrialist could think of beginning an industry. It was undoubtedly a blessing in disguise to many industrialists dreaming of setting up their industries and the industrial estate awaits with open arms to receive those who are keen, to start their industries here," he added.
With the passage of time, land was allocated to the industrialists and they had to put up their buildings, factories and like. I must commend those responsible in setting up the buildings especially the water tank which could contain 100,000 gallons of water, distribution line and the sewage and the washrooms, as they do well even now after five decades without any repairs or any alteration," Gavarammana said.
The industrial estate not only provides them the facilities to commence their industries but also make available other sources and resources useful to the industry and the people involved in a particular industry. We introduce new technology and give them the opportunity to visit foreign lands to study the market available and the type of goods they expect and the using of new technology to earn more foreign exchange.
He also said despite the fact that a part of the land belonging to the industrial estate was taken over by the Government in building the Victoria Dam and continuing with development work, the then Government had committed, the IDB has taken steps to construct new buildings on the available land, in place of those on the land that had been taken over by the state, without causing any hardship to the owners of the buildings.
Making reference to future plans of the industrial estate, Gavarammana said that steps would be taken to fall in line with the Government's concerted effort to make this a more environmentally conscious industrial estate.
We are very much concerned about the environment and we are operating our industries in an environment-friendly atmosphere. This was possible for us, for we educate, make the industrialists conscious of this fact. There is some sort of brainstorming sessions and collecting of information from the participants at seminars and workshops conducted for their benefit. We have now taken steps to divide this estate into eight regions with a view to ensure and maintain environment-friendly atmosphere," he said.
He also said with the submission of the new plan to create eight regions within the estate, the Commerce and Industry Ministry allocated funds necessary to improve the condition of the estate and every road within it is now fully carpeted and special roadways are set up for the easy movements of the workers. "We have also planted bamboo trees along the boundary separating land from the lakes.

## Title: A PARADIGM CHANGE IN WESTERN MEDICINE

## Date: Friday, November 17, 2017 - 01:00
A PARADIGM CHANGE IN WESTERN MEDICINE
Western medicine is highly advanced in that there is science behind it researching into causes of diseases and cures, metabolic processes, organ function and so on.
However, most of the treatments do not match up. Basically, treatment starts only after symptoms show up. The symptoms can be due to several illnesses. The treatment is sometimes based on educated guesses. The treatment suppresses the symptoms, eventually indicating an apparent cure, when in fact the illness remains under cover and may worsen covertly.
Besides, the treatment focuses on efficiency  the efficient use of the doctors time. This is, almost always, to the disadvantage and self-respect of the patient. A doctor does not probe your medical and life history to enable him to make a more plausible diagnosis; he listens to your narration of symptoms while writing the prescription. He cannot help it; he is following the system.
In addition, there are millions of drugs of various descriptions. A doctor cannot be expected to know all the pros and cons of each drug he prescribes; besides, the ultimate illustration of the pros and cons depends on the patient, because each patient has a different genetic build-up. This is not taken into account simply because it is not possible to do so within the limits of time and fees. Ultimately the patient is exposed to the possibility of a fatal reaction. Millions of people have died this way over the years; over a hundred thousand people die annually in the USA due to reactions from opioids. The pharmaceutical companies are being sued over opioids all over the country.
Medical practitioners
There are millions of research papers on all types of diseases, metabolic processes and the causes and results of their disruption, on damaging effects of drugs and vaccines. Medical practitioners cannot and do not keep themselves informed up to date, even if they specialize in treatment of a particular organ or an anatomical system.
As an example, if you have diabetes, you are prescribed metformin. Recent research has shown that diabetes is a disease caused by the immune system automatically and continuously attacking the body. Metformin will not stop that. Metformin will only control your blood sugar levels. The autoimmune damage is going on leading to more serious organ damage.
It has been found to be so with many other diseases. Therefore the current system has to undergo a change. This system does not successfully tackle current chronic diseases.
All this shows that the patient is exposed to serious ill-health because of insufficient dissemination of information to the caregivers and more importantly, because under the present system doctors do not obtain all possible information on the patients medical history, and other pertinent details. As you proceed into this article, readers will realize the importance of these two approaches.
Many western medical practitioners, researchers and thinkers have realized the importance of these approaches. An entirely new medical system is being developed by very highly qualified people in medicine, medical and scientific research, information dissemination, thought leaders and millions of current and prospective patients who have embraced this medical process after digging out the information themselves or from the crusaders of the new medical field. They have taken medical research along a different road and found many thought provoking results.
This medical system is called Functional Medicine [FM]. Basically it identifies the root causes of illnesses and treats the causes  very much like Ayurveda but with much more pinpoint accuracy, positive results and very little reliance on currently used drugs. Actually it can reduce the cost of medical treatment, reduce pain and suffering and positively cure chronic diseases.
This is not quack medicine. A few years after the postulation and illustration of this medical process by a very highly qualified medical doctor, the world recognized Cleveland Clinic in the USA, gave it a home in a building at the back of the Cleveland Clinic Campus. Now, about four years later, it is a whole Department housed in the entire second floor of the main building, with a waiting list of over 2,000 patients.
There was a highly successful FM Summit related to FM at the Harvard University in 2016. The worlds top-most promoters of FM took part with Harvard faculty and millions of viewers on TV. In a related development, the 10th International Conference on Autoimmunity was held in Leipzig, Germany in 2016.
Related research is going on in Israel supplemented by substantial annual grants by the National Institutes of Health of the US Department of Health. The lead researcher in Israel is recognized worldwide. Twenty eight of his students who have qualified as medical PhDs are heading Functional Medicine Departments of hospitals in several countries.
There are many more similar facts. Therefore, FM is definitely not quack medicine.
Human immune system
Functional Medicine recognizes the human microbiome and attaches primary importance to it. The human microbiome is the massive population of bacteria in the human body. The human body contains about 100 trillion cells, but possibly only 10% of these cells are actually human. The rest are from bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. They are mainly in the intestine, but are present in almost all bodily locations internal and external. Ayurveda also stresses that a healthy digestive system is crucial. It is the bacteria that keep the digestive system working well.
These bacteria and all other living beings, including humans, originated from the pre-historic pea-soup of simple life forms. Therefore there is a strong synergistic relationship between the human body and its microbiome. In fact they supply the human brain with very important nutrients and there is communication between them or the human gut, and the brain.
Living beings have an immune system. Seventy percent of the human immune system is in the gut. The immune system protects the body from danger. The danger comes from ingested foreign materials of genetic and chemical origin that are unrecognized by the immune system, and from pollution. The immune system is said to consist of several sub-systems specific to specific organs and areas of the anatomy. When something foreign is detected, the relevant immune sub-system reacts by sending antibodies to try destroy the intruder. Inflammation too is called into play by the immune system to destroy the intruder.
Our grandparents drank water from springs. They did not drink cola, soda or chlorinated and fluoridated water. We do almost desperately. The colas and sodas lead to diabetes, obesity and many other diseases. A Nigerian court has ruled against Fanta and Sprite. Chlorine is a strong irritant and fluoride is too, as well as being a disruptor of the hormone system. If the fluoridation of water is done by the waste product sodium fluorosilicate and not clean sodium fluoride, then we are exposed to heavy metal poisoning and radioactivity too.
Our grandparents didnt douse their food crops with pesticides and weedicides which are chemical poisons. We do, almost at a suicidal and homicidal level. Our food is doused in glyphosate used as a weedicide and desiccant, particularly on wheat, corn [maize], oats, sugarcane and soya  so much so that a major part of the population in North and South Americas and Europe have dangerous amounts of weedicide in their urine, feces, blood and breast milk. Glyphosate is a bactericide, a metal nutrient grabber, an autoimmune trigger and a hormone hacker  a serious danger four times over. (Things that disrupt the hormone system are called hormone hackers).
Our grandparents did not use aluminium utensils and vessels. We do, even though we know for a fact that aluminium can be a cause of dementia in late life. They did not use plastics or plastic coated utensils. We do. Plastics contain Bisphenol-A which permeates from hot plastics to food and drinks and through the skin. Bisphenol-A is a serious hormone hacker.
Our grandparents did not use detergents, scented soaps, anti-bacterial soaps, bleach, dry-cleaning chemicals, flame retardants in their clothes and household linen, or poisons to eliminate domestic pests or artificial fragrances to mask odours in the house. We do; we can do without them.
Our grandparents did not use cosmetics and body care products that have fragrances and lead in them. We do. They did not use table salt which is only sodium chloride, processed at very high temperature. They used sea salt which had its natural content of minerals just as seawater.
Next generation
Our grandparents did not have an environment severely polluted by vehicles spouting fuel vapours and exhaust gases, large dairy herds spouting methane, coal fired power plants and industries spouting dangerous particles and gases - all polluting the air, water and soil. We have, at a very alarming level.
Over the past century or less, we have been almost imperceptibly pushed into using hundreds of dangerous chemicals and exposed to hundreds more of air, water and soil pollutants. That is why we are getting very sick. We must take stock, take care and reduce these hazards in a disciplined manner. Or else we pay with our lives. Our planet will die and we too with it.
Recent research shows that,
*Our next generation will not live as long as us. That is a reversal of the usual trend to longer life.
*Even the current generation has a 50% lower sperm count. Will they lose their manhood later
Another cause for serious concern is that data from artificial insemination centers in the West show that in the case of 70% of the couples who seek artificial insemination, the male sperm cannot penetrate the female egg as it would do naturally. As such, the sperm has to be injected into the egg. Conclusion The sperm is weak. This is just one example of what is coming.
Most of our serious diseases have been identified as caused by autoimmune action starting in the gut and lungs. We feed our bodies with contaminated food, water and air - every day. They trigger the immune system. Daily inputs and accumulation of contaminants increase immune reactions until they become autoimmune reactions. Constant long-term auto-immune activity opens out spaces in the gut wall. Undigested food and bacteria pass through into the blood stream infecting it. Therefore, to survive as healthy individuals we have to be very well informed and disciplined about what we put into and allow into our bodies.

UNP will win elections: Ajith
The UNP is confident of victory in the next elections and it never wanted to delay them, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ajith P. Perera said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the second reading debate on the budget 2018 proposals.
Other parties symbols may be betel leaf, hand, bell or the lotus bud. What is important is their having a backbone to contest without hindering the elections by various ways including lawsuits, he said.
The Deputy Minister said the UNP was committed to strengthen democracy and would act against those who attempt to delay elections.
MP Mahinda Rajapaksa charged the government that they were delaying the elections. Then the Deputy Minister asked who delayed the elections other than the Joint Opposition members who filed the cases against holding the elections. Then members of both sides started to shout. At that time, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala instructed the Deputy Minister to continue with his speech but he offered his time to the opposition members.
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Kanchana Wijesekara said six persons went before the court against the elections. First one was from Matara, the Coordinating Secretary to the son of Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, the second was from Paduwasnuwara and he is with Dayasiri Jayasekara and the third was from Haliella and he is working at the Minister Dilan Pereras Road Development Authority, MP Wijesekara said. There are three more and they too are from the SLFP, not supporters of the Joint Opposition, he said.
The Deputy Minister thanked MP Wijesekara and said the UNP had not attempted to delay the elections. The UNP expects the elections and is prepared to face it, he said.
We are committed to protecting the peoples democratic rights and will not hesitate to take action against anyone who opposes them.
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said the Authority was not under him and those with it could contest from another party.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the Authority did not belong to Dilan Perera, and the third one was from Haliella.
Future generation will be made debt free
The government will not burden the future generation with debt via the meticulously formulated budget 2018, Women and Child Services Minister Chandrani Bandara said.
She was participating in the second reading debate of the Budget 2018 proposals in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Bandara said the budget reduced the prices of many essential items and state employees wages were increased.
The import duty on many food items was reduced. A successful budget merely does not reduce prices and increase salaries. This budget includes mechanisms to reduce the debt burden to release our future generations from the debt burden.
This is a revolutionary budget, she said. She said drugs and alcohol consumption was a major factor in crimes against women and children. Reducing beer prices would not prevent such crimes and illicit liquor consumption. Any alcohol or drugs harm people, she said. Therefore, she urged the Finance Minister to amend this clause in the budget.
Namal fails in Sujeewas challenge
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa failed to respond in Parliament yesterday to the challenge levelled by International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe on the content of the Civil Procedure Code.
The two members who are attorneys by profession were at loggerheads during the second reading debate on budget proposals over a number of issues including the bond commission issue, Daisy achchis bag of gems (Namal Rajapaksas great aunt) and how MP Rajapaksa passed his exams at the Law College.
State Minister Senasinghe was talking over corruptions committed during the Rajapaksa regime when MP Namal Rajapaksa raised a point of order interrupting the minister. You are talking of thieves and thieveries, MP Rajapaksa said. Today the CID informed the bond commission that you made 44 telephone calls to Arjun Aloysius, while you were attending the COPE investigation into bond scam. The one before us is also a thief.
State Minister Senasinghe responding to MP Rajapaksa said everybody knew MP Rajapaksas record of cheating. How did you get through the exams at the Law College queried State Minister. You wrote answers in a cool room separately from other candidates. You cheated law exams. Can you at least tell what is the first section of the Civil Procedure Code is about I challenge you to tell the House if possible and prove you know it. What is the first section of the Civil Procedure Code is about.
You are calling others cheaters, MP Rajapaksa said. How and why did you take 44 calls to Arjuna Aloysius Tell the House if you can.
I raise my question again, State Minister Senasinghe said. I will make it easier. Tell the House of any section of the Civil Procedure Code.
At this stage, MP Rajapaksa requested the Chair to stop Minister slinging mud at other MPs.
There are some more, said State Minister Senasinghe. You are the one who started this. What about the gem bag of Daisy achchi . I did not talk of how Thajudeen was killed. Thajudeen was killed and police and judicial medical officer reports were forged. Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed when he tried to publish an article on infamous MIG deal.
At this stage MP Rajapaksa challenged to reveal the names of the culprits.
I do not want to reveal names, said State Minister Senasinghe. You can ask your uncles and father who committed those crimes. I do not know why whenever I mention those names, one MP in the opposition gets agitated. It seems the hat fits that head.
Tell the House of 44 calls you took to Aloysius, JO MP Sanath Nishantha asked. You do not need to worry, said State Minister Senasinghe. I did not talk of your elder sister.
Poachers use hotels, inns to get into Sinharaja forest: Jayaratne
Mahaveli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne said several hotels and inns around the Sinharajah were reportedly used by poachers to access the forest for illegal activities.
He was responding to a query raised by UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana during the round of questions for oral answers.
He said these hotels and inns were not operated in the areas under the Forest Conservation Department or in the gazetted areas. These illegal access paths are being monitored and legal actions would be taken against them if any complaints were made, he said.
The Deputy Minister said five officers from the Forest Conservation Department and a range forest officer were suspended for felling trees worth over Rs. 90 million at Thabbowa recently. MP Pathirana said Police officers sometimes involved in such crimes.
The Deputy Minister said officials attached to the Forest Conservation Department as well as parliamentarians may be among the illegal racketeers.
Tax collection will double next year: Rajapaksa
The government expects to collect tax two fold in 2018 from the people and businessmen in comparison to the tax collected in 2014, Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the second reading debate on the budget 2018 proposals.
The MP said the budget has no proposals to provide reliefs to the public including farmers and investors and the tax collection would increase in future. IMF officials in Washington have made Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera an obedient disciple, MP Rajapaksa said.
He queried what had the government done with the collected taxes. They bought a military ship at a price nearly the price of Mattala Airport construction even there is no war, Rajapaksa said. The people were burdened to pay the loss of the bond transaction, he said.
He said the estimated loss the country incurred due to the bond scam was around Rs. 1,000 billion but it should be around Rs. 1,500 billion. He said the employment rate at 8.4 million two years ago has dropped to 7.9 million.The unemployment rate has increased by 0.47 million and the government was not able to bring in foreign investments, he said.
He said the government has burrowed Rs. 2,700 billion.
Budget does not promote green energy: Rathana Thera
The budget 2018 includes many suggestions to protect the environment while promoting small and medium scale industries, but it lacks substantial mechanisms to promote green energy, MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
He was participating in the second reading debate of the budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday.
The Thera commended the government for measures taken through the budget to promote environmentally friendly electric vehicles.
Rathana Thera said most of the state institutions were sold today and many were sold during the Chandrika Bandaranaike regime. Now the government is wondering what to do with the remains. These tax policies were presented during the J.R. Jayewardene era.
The new open market policy is liberal. If the governments open market policies are implemented, many industries, especially the footwear sector, will collapse. Therefore, I warn the government to pay heed to the danger, he said. This budget is called a blue-green budget, but it promotes industries. This would destroy our green lands, he said.
The budget promotes renewable energy, but today we pay more for fuel generated power than for power generated through renewable energy sources.
The budget has no proposal to address this issue. During the past 3-5 years, $ three billion was spent on importing oil and coal. The budget has certain proposals but nothing substantial to prevent this sum from going out of the country, Rathana Thera said.

Peru beats  New Zealand 2-0  to capture last World Cup berth
LIMA: Jefferson Farfan and Christian Ramos scored as Peru defeated New Zealand to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1982 on Wednesday, sealing the last ticket to Russia with a 2-0 win.
Farfan struck in the 27th minute and Ramos scored in the 65th to give Los Incas their fifth overall World Cup finals appearance and the first in 35 years.
The second-leg match at Limas Estadio Nacional was the decider after New Zealand and Peru played to a 0-0 draw in the first leg of their Oceania-South America playoff on Saturday at Wellington.
New Zealand, ranked 122nd in the world, was seeking a third World Cup finals berth after appearances in 1982 and 2010.
Peru attacked the All-Whites from the start, Incas defender Luis Advincula slamming a left-footed shot off the crossbar in the third minute to delight a full-throated crowd in the packed stadium.
The opening goal came after Christian Cueva raced down the left wing and flicked a pinpoint center pass with the outside of his right foot to Farfan.
The 33-year-old forward for Lokomotiv Moscow blasted a right-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area past New Zealand goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic and into the back of the net. AFP

PETROLEUM PRICING FORMULA FROM MARCH
Electricity will wait:Consistency in taxation and economic policy for next 3 to 5 years:
Deputy Treasury Secretary S.R. Attygalle yesterday assured that the pricing formula on petroleum products would be implemented by March next year.
You will have the formula for the New Year in April, he said addressing a post budget discussion organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
The electricity formula however is expected to be delayed, as, he said, it was more complicated, given the various subsidies given to electricity consumers.
A transparent energy pricing formulae and a Budget which would continue the fiscal consolidation process was an important condition stressed on by the IMF through their Extended Fund Facility Programme, he said.
Attygalle however stated that the pricing formula, be it for energy or alcohol was important to ensure consistency in the taxation policy of the country.
Our discussions with the chambers informed us that the business community was not looking for concessions but wanted consistency. It is key for any business to know what will happen.
That is why the Inland Revenue Act was introduced, and, despite pressures for amendments, even before implementation, but we stuck to it,added the Deputy Treasury Secretary.
A more cautious Senior Economic Advisor to the Finance and Mass Media Ministry Mano Tittawella observed that Confidence on consistency will only come when we are consistent.
This is the rationale behind the motor and alcohol pricing formulae in this Budget, he added.
Tittawella explained that the Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera was interested in maintaining a certain level of consistency in taxation and economic policy for at least the next 3 to 5 years.
We have a problem in this area but we hope to bring in some predictability to business, he added.
According to Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chief Economist Shiran Fernando, the lack of implementation of budget proposals over the last few years has resulted in the government on average missing their revenue targets by at least Rs.100 billion every year.
What was announced was not what happened. Thus, naturally there were pressures on the budget deficit,he quipped. The new Inland Revenue Act, he said, would bring in most of the government revenue next year as he stressed that if the government was able to implement at least 60-80 percent of their proposals, they would be able to meet 16 percent of their growth targets.
Tittawella added that the Budget Implementation Unit, to be set up at the Finance Ministry, would actively follow up on proposals and inform the general public on the progress of projects which have the greatest impact on income and expenditure of the government.

PMI for manufacturing down, services up in October
Sri Lankas Manufacturing Sector PMIrecorded 54.8 in October which is a decrease of 4.2 index points compared to September 2017, the Central Bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
This indicates that the Manufacturing activities expanded at a slower pace in October compared to September 2017. This was mainly driven by the New Orders and Employment sub-indices which moderated from the levels of increase observed in the previous month.
The Production and Stock of Purchases sub-indices also expanded at slower rates in October. Meanwhile, the Suppliers Delivery Time sub-index lengthened at a higher rate which was led by lengthening of delivery time of overseas suppliers due to the high demand for their supplies from other countries. Overall, all the sub-indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50.0 threshold signalling an overall expansion in October 2017, but at a slower pace than the previous month. Moreover, the Expectation for activities remains positive for the next three months.
The Services Sector PMIrecorded 55.3 index points in October from 57.0 index points in September 2017. This indicates that the Services sector continued to expand in October 2017 at a slower rate compared to September 2017.
Business Activity accelerated while New Businesses and Expectations for Activity decelerated in October compared to September 2017. For the same period, Employment and Backlogs of Work declined.
The increase in Business Activity was mainly observed in Financial Services and Telecommunication sectors, reasons being expansion of delivery channels and technology based improvements. Employment declined for the second time since the survey began in May 2015, due to non-recruitment for vacancies of retired employees and reduction in the number of casual staff mainly in the Accommodation, Food and Beverage sector.
Prices Charged increased at a slower rate in October compared to September 2017 while a decline in Prices Charged was observed in the Accommodation, Food and Beverage sector. Expected Labour Cost increased in October 2017 due to seasonal benefits such as bonuses and festival advances.

Poultry producers welcome maize import liberalization in budget
The recent budget proposal to allow feed millers to import maize under a special limited quota to meet the shortfall in the local supply was hailed by poultry producers as a strongly positive measure that will support greater efficiency within the domestic industry, ultimately enabling stronger international competitiveness for Sri Lankan poultry producers in the ensuing year.
As one of the highest revenue generating agricultural industries for the Government,Director of Crysbro, Shafeek Samad said that this was a welcome move considering the previous shortage of maize had a crippling effect on the industry, putting not just the poultry farmers in jeopardy but also the local maize farmer because the industries are heavily interdependent.
Maize accounts for approximately 60% of raw material inputs for the poultry sector. Prior to the recently announced reforms, the sector had been compelled to buy maize at Rs.52 per kilo when it could be sourced at Rs.35 per kilogram (CIF Colombo) when imported.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Sri Lanka is forecasted to produce approximately 180,000 MT of maize by the end of the year which is a significantly lower volume compared to the actual requirement of 400,000 MT amounting to a 40% decrease from last years yield of 242,000 MT.
This is an extremely timely intervention by the Government and a welcome one at that considering that the disposable income of citizens is increasing and as a result a surge in the demand for chicken can be expected.
Before this intervention, the biggest challenge facing our industry was the shortage of maize as well as the available maize being exorbitantly priced making it virtually impossible to be competitive in the international market let alone operate in the local market without hiking the price of end product. Despite this, we had managed to maintain the market price at Rs.420 despite extreme protectionism and so we believe the state has duly rewarded us for being patient and efficient, Samad said.
The local poultry industry continues to stand as one of the countrys most disciplined, well-organized and consistent taxpayers compared to other livestock industries paying approximately Rs. 16 billion a year at Rs. 85 per kilo.
With the shortfall in supply rectified, Samad expressed renewed confidence in the ability for Crysbro to tap into new markets overseas while contributing further to the economy to retain its continuous growth momentum, while earning greater foreign exchange and generating increased job opportunities directly and indirectly.

The power of the materials  engineer to the fore
University of Moratuwa's materials science and engineering (MSE) department via its research and development, training, testing and consultancy capabilities is on a quest to foster an endemic engineering culture of material science and engineering in Sri Lanka.
The annual Department-Industry consultative board meeting provides a forum for meaningful interaction between the industry and department staff.
The Universitys MSE Department Head, Sampath Weragoda, in an exclusive interview with the Daily News elaborated on MSEs capabilities and its vision of contributing towards sustainable development of the country.
Q. What is meant by materials engineering
Materials engineering enhance materials to perform at higher level to manufacture world-class products at low cost.
MSE is a combination of chemistry, physics and mathematics that contributes towards product innovation via R&D, stringent quality testing and cost reduction.
Materials engineering basically is studying the properties and characteristics of materials to learn how they behave when they are subject to varied conditions when used in the industry. A materials engineer will know exactly how materials will perform in that structure, based on the molecular makeup of the material.
Conventionally material engineering covers three different areas that are metals, ceramics and polymers aka rubber and plastics.
In contemporary times, material engineering is more bound towards nano technology, smart materials and molecular modelling where the behavior of molecules is simulated via computer programs. Here the molecular makeup is fed into computer program to ascertain its behavior in adverse situations when the material is used in manufacturing.
Q. What is the key object of this annual event of Moratuwa Universitys MSE department
Department of materials science and engineering is the only academic body in Sri Lanka that produces engineering graduates who are specialized in materials science and engineering.
The key object of MSEs annual event is to obtain feedback from the industry sector on performances of Moratuwa Universitys material engineers serving in the sector. We ascertain the adequacy of our graduate program to operate in the industry and seek innovative thoughts from the industry to enhance our program to suit the latter.
With a deeper insight to corporate life, university lecturers too could develop case studies and real-life examples that will endow students with the knowledge of genuine industry needs.
Emphasis is made on research and development and product innovation.
Financial support if needed for research projects of the respective sectors is available via the National Science Foundation, aka NSF, whose main task is to promote science and technology in Sri Lanka.
Moratuwa University too has funds available for industry based research with state-of-the-art analytical equipment and research laboratory that could be utilized by the former.
Q. How could Moratuwa Universitys MSE department contribute to enhance our countrys GDP
Sri Lankan industry sector was traditional in orientation. It had not been exposed to newest technology and lacked knowledge on materials engineering.
It has now realized the need for innovation to rub shoulders with the international scenario. To create more volume of marketable products at a lower cost, highly technologically oriented input is needed.
The Chinese market has sophisticated low-cost products. With mass production and export markets they benefit from economies of scale. If Sri Lanka is techno-savvy we could follow suit.
Integration between the university, state sector, business community and the government is vital to reap benefits from materials engineers capabilities.
Q. What are the potential markets for MSE experts in this country
Sri Lankan material engineers are yet to be fully utilized by the industry sector. Apart from NSF, our graduates are currently absorbed mostly by the construction sector. However material engineers are highly capable of contributing to the manufacturing sector too. Thus the manufacturing sector is our potential market.
Usually, Sri Lankas manufacturing sector contributes 16-17 percent to the GDP. In 2014, there was a value addition of one trillion rupees from this sector contributed by 16,000-odd individual establishments. Hence there is a vast untapped market potential in the country for materials engineers and a proactive approach is needed.

Daily News article of November 15:
Russia refutes British PMs claims
The Russian Embassy in Colombo, referring to an AFP news item published in the Daily News of November 15 under the title, Russia cant undermine West: British PM, has clarified Russias position in a statement made by Maria Zakharrova, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The full statement follows:
We have taken note of the statement concerning Russia made on 13 November by the British Prime Minister Theresa May at the Lord Mayor's Banquet 2017. This time our country is ranked first among threats to the international community, not just equal to others as before. Thus, the United Kingdom is making an attempt to claim global leadership in deterrence of Russia, in order to protect the existing world order, as PM Theresa May put it.
The assertions are not brand new, but the main common point behind them is the irresponsible and groundless nature of accusations against Russia. The idea of protection of world order sounds particularly cynical from the British Prime Minister. It is enough to recall the aggressive actions of the United Kingdom in Iraq and Libya which have led not to strengthening of the international law, but to numerous casualties and sufferings of millions of people and destabilisation of whole regions. At the same time, London shows fundamental incomprehension of current processes in the world and of the essence of the very UN Charter-based international legal order that the United Kingdom is vowing to protect.
The British society is currently not going through its finest hour due to the ongoing process of the existing EU and internal splits. It is understandable that an external enemy is direly needed to distract public attention for which role Russia has been chosen. It is deeply regrettable, especially now that the United Kingdom, considering its ambition to turn into a Global Britain, would benefit from multi-directional, pragmatic and efficient foreign policy. Such an approach would give UK extra opportunities on the emerging markets as well as strengthen its global standing through the development of dialogue with other countries. The path of confrontation chosen by London is unlikely to contribute to the achievement of these goals.

Most successful conductor with largest haul of awards
Sanjeev Jayaratnam shines at Asia Pacific Choir Games
Sri Lankan conductor Sanjeev Jayaratnam goes on record as being the most successful conductor at the Asia Pacific Choir Games with his three choirs - Children, Teens and Adults with a fantastic haul of one Grand Prix of Nations Trophy, two Champion of the Asian Choir Games Trophies, five Gold Medals and one Silver Medal at the recently concluded Asia Pacific Choir Games in Colombo
"Music should be about moving people  making them happy, transporting them to different places, and creating magic in the moment. I was so delighted with the results. The singers had worked really hard and I am immensely proud of them all. To God be the Glory", says Sanjeev Jayaratnam in a press release.
Out of the ten categories at the Asia Pacific Choir Games  two were won under the choral direction of Sanjeev Jayaratnam where Methodist College and Noted (the female ensemble) were adjudged winners of the Asia Pacific Choir Games in their respective categories of Youth Choirs with 88.25 points and Chamber Choirs with 87.00 points.
In the latest Musica Mundi World Rankings  Methodist College is the highest ranked Sri Lankan choir, also ranked 30th among Youth and Childrens Choirs and 104th among the World Top 1000.
Noted is now ranked 28th among Chamber Choirs and 166th among the top 1000  with the distinction of being the third highest ranked Sri Lankan choir.
The Old Joes choir which competed previously is the 2nd highest ranked Sri Lankan choir  being ranked 108th in the top 1000.
However The Revelations also conducted by Sanjeev Jayaratnam still has the distinction of being the highest ranked Sri Lankan choir ever - being ranked 4th in the world among Male Choirs and 94th among the top 1000 in 2008.
The other two Sri Lankan winners this year were Peshali Yapas Piccolinis in the Jazz, Pop and Show with 85.75 points and Priyeshni Peiriss Pestantia Chorale in the Musica Sacra with Accompaniment with 82.88 points.
The Methodist College Choir also went on to become the Winner of the Grand Prix of Nations in the Youth Choir category winning with a phenomenal 89.7 points  the highest scored by any Sri Lankan Choir in any category which proved that they were indeed in a class of their own.
"I am thrilled at the performance of our choir, very specially because of the honour they have brought to Sri Lanka.
I am really thankful to the Lord, for blessing us with the gift of music," said Mrs. Hiranya Fernando, Principal Methodist College.
In the second part of the competition, unfortunately, Jayaratnam fell terribly ill but was still able to bring out a superlative performance from the Chamber Choir Noted which won a Gold Medal and became the Champions of the Asia Pacific Choir Games with a very high mark of 87.00 points making them very clear winners and the Best Sri Lankan Womens Chamber Choir today.
Jayaratnam unfortunately couldnt conduct them once again, at the Grand Prix of Nations Competition. Noted had to perform without their conductor, but here too they performed very well and bagged a Silver Medal.
The Revelations Academy Childrens Choir also won a Gold Medal at the Champions Competition (85.63 points) and went on to qualify to the much higher level of competition - the Grand Prix of Nations category - where they once again won a Gold Medal (86.30 points), being beaten by the Childrens Choir Alie Parusa of Russia.
The other Sri Lankan Choir to take part in the Grand Prix was the Ladies College Intermediate Choir which was placed 3rd by a very narrow margin after giving a very spirited and energetic performance.

Seine net fishermens issues to be resolved before December 1
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had instructed relevant authorities to take immediate measures to solve all issues faced by seine net fishermen before December 1 and to implement a programme to issue licences for them.
During a discussion held on Wednesday at the Ministry premises with regard to the issues faced by these fishermen, Minister Amaraweera instructed Fisheries Director General Christy Lal Fernando to appoint a Regulatory Committee comprising representatives from the Fisheries Ministry, Fisheries Department, Coast Conservation Department and the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to find out the issues faced by seine net fishermen. He instructed them to investigate illegal seine net fishing practices and submit a report within a week.
The minister claimed that all future decisions on the seine net fishing industry will be taken after considering this report.
During the discussion, the minister said, around 18,000 fishermen are currently engaged in seine net fishing in Sri Lanka under 400 seine net owners. However, due to a labour shortage, most seine net owners use tractors to drag seine nets.
Following a research conducted by NARA which revealed that the beach and seabed are badly affected due to illegal seine net fishing, such as the use of four wheel tractors to pull seine nets, relevant authorities proposed to ban seine net fishing in Sri Lanka.
However, the proposal was not implemented since it would affect the livelihoods of people who depend on seine net fishing.
Considering this, the minister instructed the Fisheries Director General to issue licences only for fishermen who do not engage in illegal seine net fishing practices.
Minister Amaraweera stressed that legal action will be taken against those who practice illegal seine net fishing and that their licence would be cancelled. He added that all decisions will affect fishermen engaged in seine net fishing in Puttalam, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa.

Service industry leads China's  GDP growth
Chinese companies in the service sector saw stronger profit growth in the first three quarters thanks to rising demand for services and steady price rises, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday.
The companies saw their operating profit rise 31.4 percent year-on-year in the first three quarters, which was 8.6 percentage points higher than in the first eight months, according to the bureau.
The profit growth of the service sector was faster than that in the industrial sector, which saw 22.8 percent growth year-on-year.
Bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua said the service sector was a bright spot for the Chinese economy when all other major economic indicators pointed to a slight contraction in October.
The rapid rise in demand for services has led to a steady price rise, which contributed to the outstanding performance of corporate profitability in the service sector, Liu said at a news conference in Beijing.
The service sector's proportion of China's GDP has been rising steadily, surpassing 50 percent in 2015, indicating an improved economic structure.

At 77th birth commemoration in Bengal
SLC president pays glowing tribute to late Dalmiya
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala took centre stage in paying glowing tribute to the late Jagmohan Dalmiya on his 77th birth anniversary at the Crystal Room, Taj Bengal on Tuesday.
Dalmiya is literally revered as the godfather of Indian cricket as well as redefining cash strapped world cricket as an administrator.
Delivering the inaugural speech at the solemn commemoration to a packed audience, Sumathipala paid tribute to Dalmiya, who was born on September 30, 1940 and died on September 20, 2015. The SLC president identified Dalmiya as the doyen who championed the cause of cricket as a whole by his highly articulating negotiating skills. It propelled him to be a great administrator who changed the economics of cricket. Such was his broad vision when he administered the game as the ICC chairman in 1997 and as the BCCI president in 2001. Dalmiya had left behind a lasting legacy that continues to nourish the hallowed game.
Sumathipala particularly recalled a passage of time when Dalmiya truly displayed his vast acumen in coming to the rescue of Sri Lanka by sending a combined Indian-Pakistan team for a show of strength cricket match during the 1996 World Cup when Australia and West Indies refused to play in Sri Lanka following unrest after the countrys Central Bank was bombed.
As the SLC president put it, that was a critical period for Sri Lanka as co-host of the 1996 World Cup when countries refused to play in Sri Lanka. Dalmiya got the organising committee for the 1996 World Cup  PILCOM to put things in perspective for Sri Lanka by his spirited gesture of swiftly stringing that team to play in Sri Lanka. Mohammed Azharuddin, who led the Indo-Pakistan team, was present among the audience and got to know the inside story behind his appointment.
Sumathipala narrated how deft Dalmiya was in getting Azharduddin to lead that team that included Wasim Akram.
Jaggu called up Intikhab Alam and got him to agree that Akram would play under Azharuddin, while Intikhab would be the manager. I think he was a born negotiator... one who had the knack of getting everyone under one roof. His vision and extraordinary leadership skills always stood out. His legacy lives on, recalled Sumathipala.
Among the audience were Syed Ashraful Haq, who served as the first and only CEO of the Asian Cricket Council, and Iftikhar Rahman, a well-known official from across the border.
Indias 1983 world cup winning captain Kapil Dev was the other chief orator who held the floor in paying homage to Dalmiya whom he described as my hero to resounding applause. It was Dalmiya who paved the way for a good life for Indian cricketers, said Kapil who believed that Dalmiya was the best administrator in all sport in the last 50 years.
When we were playing, we would always look at the wages of English and Australian cricketers and wonder when we would manage to come close. Twenty years later, they are the ones yearning to earn like Indian cricketers. The credit for this goes to my hero, said Kapil. The occasion was rounded off by Indian captain Virat Kohli presenting the late Dalmiyas widow, Chandralekha Dalmiya with a bouquet.

SLFP has no hand in delaying LG polls: Dayasiri

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara today in Parliament stressed that the SLFP has no connection to the petition challenging the gazette notification on Local Authorities to which concerns were raised that the LG polls could be further delayed.
The Minister, making a personal clarification in the House, refuted Joint Opposition (JO) MP Kanchana Wijesekaras allegation that the SLFP members were behind the said petition, and said that it was an organized attempt to bring disrepute to the SLFP.
He also criticized Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera for giving time to the JO member to sling mud at the SLFP.
Petitioner named Rajapaksage Keerthi Mahinda Karunathilake Kumara is in Paduwasnuwara electoral seat. I was appointed the electoral organizer of this seat barely four and half months ago. I had not done politics with him before. He was a supporter of a former Deputy Minister, he said.
We fellow SLFP members work in this coalition Government based on the SLFP-UNP MoU. We have no secret deals like some in the JO and the UNP. Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera allowed MP Wijesekara to take four minutes of his time to sling mud at the SLFP, he charged.
However, Chief Government Whip Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera denied this allegation, adding that the UNP gave no additional time to the JO, but the JO MP interrupted and read out the list of names of the petitioners.
I have no deal with the JO. I dont have such a history as well. We want the LG elections as soon as possible. We are keenly watching what is happening, Deputy Minister Perera replied.

Softlogic Holdings group revenue up by 6.4% in 1H
Softlogic Holdings PLC Group revenue grew 6.4% to Rs. 31.1 billion during the first half of the financial year with the quarter also registering a similar growth of 6.5% to Rs. 15.9 billion.
Group top line for the six months was led by Retail (30.8%), ICT (26.4%), Healthcare Services (19.1%), Financial Services (16.5%) and Automobile (3.8%).
Sales contribution from the leisure activity has been trending up as two of the Groups hotels reported healthy occupancy levels during the quarter. Mvenpick Hotel Colombo is yet to contribute to Group profitability.
Adverse weather conditions affecting retail demands, the high interest rate regime, in the absence of the insurance transfer for the quarter and the general depressed economic climate, combined together posed a challenge for the Group.
Nonetheless, the future outlook will depend on several macroeconomic factors but the Group is positioned well enough to overcome such hurdles, Chairman Ashok Pathirage said.
As business is cyclical, third quarter results are more robust than the second quarter due to the optimism of Christmas sales, which the Group will undoubtedly benefit from during this period.
Gross Profit improved 21.2% to Rs. 11.2 billion during the 1HFY18 indicating a healthy improvement in GP margin from 31.5% in 1HFY17 to 35.9% in 1HFY18.
The quarter too registered similar GP margin improvements taking the quarterly gross profit to Rs 5.7 billion (up 21.1%). Cost control measures and economies of scale helped maintain profit margins amidst systemic challenges.
Distribution and administrative expenses increased 15% and 16.8% to Rs. 1.6 billion and Rs. 6.4 billion respectively during 1HFY18.
Consequently, operational expenses for the cumulative period increased 16.4% to Rs. 8 billion while a 16.7% growth was denoted during the quarter to Rs. 4 billion.
Quarterly operating profit increased 44% to Rs. 2.2 billion taking the cumulative operating earnings to Rs. 4.1 billion (up 39.6%). A strong improvement in operating profit margins was seen during the first half of the financial year from 9.9% in the comparative period to 13% with the quarter too witnessing an improvement from 10.2% in 2QFY17 to 13.9% in 2QFY18.
Group EBITDA for the quarter improved 42.1% to Rs. 2.9 billion while the cumulative EBITDA increased 40% to Rs. 5.4 billion. Profit before tax for the cumulative period was Rs. 1 Bn while the quarter reported a PBT of Rs. 358.1 million. Profit after taxation for the first half of FY2017/18 closed at Rs. 677.9 million with the quarter concluding with a PAT of Rs. 248.2 million. Retail sectors cumulative revenue was Rs. 9.6 Bn with the quarter reporting Rs. 4.7 billion. ODEL and Softlogic Retail continued to be dominant contributors to the sector performance. Retail sector cumulative PAT reported a strong growth of 21.8% to Rs. 313.8 million despite the quarter being dragged down by lacklustre retail demand to report a PAT of Rs. 91 million.
Hospital groups topline was led by Central Hospital Ltd., (36% contribution), followed by Asiri Hospital Holdings PLC (31% contribution) and Asiri Surgical Hospital PLC (26% contribution). ICT sector revenue was disturbed with the slowdown of the Microsoft handset business and with fierce competition faced by Samsung.

Stunned Zimbabweans ponder life after Mugabe
ZIMBABWE: Zimbabweans were weighing an uncertain future without President Robert Mugabe Thursday after the army took power and placed the 93-year-old veteran, once seen as a liberation hero, under house arrest.
Most people in the country have not known a time without Mugabe, who has been at the epicentre of public life since coming to power in 1980 on the countrys independence from Britain.
The nation was left stunned after the ailing leader was confined to his residence late Tuesday as soldiers took up positions at strategic points across Harare and senior officers commandeered state television.
The Southern African Development Community bloc, currently chaired by Zimbabwes powerhouse neighbour South Africa, was to meet in Botswana later Thursday to discuss the dramatic situation.
And though nothing has been heard from Mugabe or his wife Grace directly since the start of the army operation, many Zimbabweans are hopeful that the crisis will mark the beginning of a more prosperous future.
Our economic situation has deteriorated every day -- no employment, no jobs, Tafadzwa Masango, a 35-year-old unemployed man, told AFP.
We hope for a better Zimbabwe after the Mugabe era. We feel very happy. It is now his time to go. Harares residents have largely ignored the military presence on the streets and continued commuting, socialising and working much as normal, while analysts speculated that Mugabe and the army could be negotiating a transition.
Derek Matyszak, an analyst at the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies, said he expects Mugabe and the military are thrashing out a handover to a new head of state.
I think Mugabe can still stay in the country. I think they would like to present him as a liberation icon and accord him due respect.
The difficulty, and this has always been the difficulty for the Mugabe family, is guaranteeing Grace Mugabes safety... on the demise of Robert. The international community will also be watching the next phase of the crisis closely.
On Wednesday the African Union issued an unusually terse statement that said the situation on the ground seems like a coup and called on the military to pull back and respect the constitution.
Britain, Zimbabwes colonial ruler until independence, called for calm and warned against handing power to an unelected leader.
Nobody wants simply to see the transition from one unelected tyrant to the next, said British foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Zimbabwes army was set on a collision course with Mugabe last week when he abruptly fired his vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa -- a lynchpin of the defence and security establishment.
Mnangagwa, 75, was previously one of Mugabes most loyal lieutenants, having worked alongside him for decades.
But he fled to South Africa following his dismissal and published a scathing five-page rebuke of Mugabes leadership and Graces political ambition.
Army chief General Constantino Chiwenga gave an unprecedented press conference on Monday, flanked by dozens of officers, and warned Mugabe that he would intervene if the president continued to purge the ruling ZANU-PF party. Mnangagwa has been embroiled in a long-running feud with Mugabes wife Grace, 52.
Both were seen as leading contenders to replace Mugabe but Mnangagwa had the tacit support of the armed forces, which viewed Grace -- a political novice -- with derision. In a sign that the military was purging the first ladys backers, a Grace loyalist widely reported to have been detained by the army appeared on state TV late Wednesday.
Kudzai Chipanga, leader of the ZANU-PFs youth league, apologised for criticising Chiwenga following the generals threat to intervene against Mugabe. - AFP

## Title: SWORD OF DAMOCLES UPON JURORS MISUSING FACEBOOK
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, November 17, 2017 - 01:00
SWORD OF DAMOCLES UPON JURORS MISUSING FACEBOOK
Jurors who post or communicate with the parties of an ongoing criminal trial would be guilty of an offence of contempt of court. In other words, comments made by jurors in respect of pending legal proceedings in which they are a part of, constitute an offence. Once a juror posted on Facebook actually excited for jury duty tomorrowits gonna be fun to tell the defendant theyre guilty.: P (Martha Neil, American Bar Association Journal 2010).
Now jurors should be more concerned of their behaviour in social media. Many jurors around the world are being sent to jail due to improper communication of criminal matters they are involved as jurors. The reasons for such sentencing is the substantial risk of prejudice bearing upon the case. In terms of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (the Criminal Procedure), serving as a juror in Sri Lanka is a prestigious position and considered a liability of citizen (Section 244). Therefore, once appointed, a juror must attend the proceedings unless there is any sufficient cause preventing him from participating (S. 215).
If jurors were found guilty for contempt of court committed by social media, they could be served with a custodial sentence and their service as a juror would be terminated. Jurors should keep in their minds that if they suffered imprisonment more than one month they shall not serve as jurors forever (S. 245 of the Criminal Procedure). According to a research, 62% of the jurors are not aware of recent prosecutions of jurors. In other words, only 38% of jurors are aware of news and stories about jurors acting improperly (Prof. Cheryl Thomas, University College London, Faculty of Laws).
Recent prosecutions of jurors
In Attorney General Vs. Joanne Fraill, British Court sentenced a juror for eight months imprisonment after being found guilty of contempt of court as she had communicated with a defendant through Facebook. On September 15, 2017, the Attorney General of UK Jeremy Wright QC, has requested Judges, solicitors and victims groups to submit evidence about the impact of social media on criminal trials. This submission would be open until December 8, 2017. In Attorney General Vs. Stephan James 2012, a juror was convicted for disclosing juries deliberations to a defendant.
Even obtaining information about a defendants previous conviction from the internet could create a potential risk of being prejudiced in respect of such defendant (R Vs. Thakrar 2008). In Attorney General Vs. Theodora Dallas 2012, a juror was jailed for six months for contempt of Court because she had researched the accused on the internet and found information regarding a previous conviction of the accused and then disclosed them to other jury members. Misuse of the internet by a juror is always a most serious irregularity, and an effective custodial sentence is virtually inevitable to ensure that the integrity of the process of trial by jury is sustained.
In Regina Vs. Karakaya 2005, court held that the material obtained by the juror from the internet after the jury had retired, contravened the principles which prohibit the use of information, potentially relevant to the outcome of the case, privately obtained out of court by a juror, as well as the reception of further material after the jurys retirement.
What is this offence
According to Section 227 (3) of the Criminal Procedure of Sri Lanka, if a juror held any communication with any person other than with a fellow juror upon the subject of the trial such a juror shall be deemed to be guilty of contempt of court and shall be punished accordingly. The consequence is, that the juror concerned loses his freedom of expression laid down in Article 14 (1) (a) of the Constitution if he is guilty of contempt of court which is a restriction imposed upon him by Article 15 (2).
In case where the jury is allowed to separate during the course of any trial, court has to assure that the jurors may be first sworn or affirmed not to hold communication with any person other than a fellow juror upon the subject of the trial during such separation (S. 227 (2). Not only jurors but also any other person or entity has no unfettered right to publish judicial proceedings (Hewamanne Vs. De Silva 1983).
The Court empowered to punish jurors
In view of the Judicature Act No. 02 of 1978 of Sri Lanka, every High Court shall have power and authority to take cognizance of and try in a summary manner any offence of contempt committed against or in disrespect of its authority, and on conviction to commit the offender to jail or a fine or both such imprisonment and fine (S.18).
In addition to High Court, the Article 105 (3) of the Constitution has conferred powers to the Court of Appeal to punish for contempt of any court, tribunal or institution with imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit. Thus, either High Court or Court of Appeal could punish the jurors for contempt of court in respect of improper communication during jury trials.
Admissibility of digital evidence in juror contempt
Jurors contempt by misuse of internet could be now easily proved as the digital evidence is admissible in courts. According to Section 5 (1) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995 of Sri Lanka any information contained in any statement produced by a computer shall be admissible as evidence. Hence, messages or chat history between jurors and accused found on the Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Skype, Viber or any other communication platforms could be used against jurors. Although not particular in the realm of juror contempt, it was held in many cases that digital evidence could be admitted in Sri Lanka. (Marine Star Vs. Amanda Foods 2007, MIT Vs. DPJ Holdings 2009, Peoples Leasing Vs. Iran Fernando & Others 2008)
Furthermore, video conversations are now admissible as evidence in courts. In Abeyagunawardane Vs. Samoon and others 2007 it was held by the Court of Appeal that admission of video recordings is governed solely under the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995. According to Section 4 (1) of the said Act, contemporaneous recordings are admissible as evidence. Additionally, even audio itself has been admitted by courts. In Abu Bakr Vs. Queen 1953, it was held that contemporaneous recording of speeches could be admitted in evidence. In re S.A. Wickramasinghe 1954, Court held that an electrical recording of speech made on a tape recorder could be admitted in evidence.

Thera critiques land acquiring process for Central Expressway
The process of acquiring land for the Kurunegala - Dambulla stretch of the proposed Central Expressway had caused great inconvenience to the respective land owners in Dambulla, said Athuparayaya Bodhirukkarama Viharadhipati Ven Aluthgama Upananda Thera, President Patron of the Union of landowners surrendering properties for the Expressway.
He said two problems had arisen regarding the payment of compensation to the acquired land which they discovered after discussions with officers of the Dambulla Divisional Secretariat and higher officials.
One is that compensation payments relevant to the Dambulla Viharaya's Rajakariya land was being paid to the Buddhist Affairs Commissioners Department rather than tenant residents in the lands.
Only a part of the compensation is paid from the proceeds of selling trees and other vegetation on lands taken over are paid to the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya. Similarly, there had been no response as to the procedure adopted regarding the take over of state lands where people were residing.
Since the majority of people resident in lands to be taken over were living under deep mental distress, authorities should either resolve this problem in a fair and just manner and inform them in writing about the procedure adopted in this connection.
Ven. Upananda Thera said his organisation is not opposed to development projects of this nature or engaged in politics to topple governments but solely interested in ensuring justice and fair play to innocent people losing land for this project.
He said another problem was that decisions taken by the government in this matter does not filter down properly to the affected people.

Work with energy to alleviate poverty: Minister
The Samurdhi campaign is designed to alleviate poverty in the country. The programme was designed after a comprehensive study of Grameen of Bangladesh, Kibbts of Israel, Samuel Undong of South Korea etc. to address the issue of poverty, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the ceremony to award 1,904 appointment letters for new Samurdhi Development Officers at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on November 15.
He said most of the appointees are young, who have the energy to work with the people by facing any challenge for the task of poverty alleviation.
You will be getting the chance to work with underprivileged villagers and they will call you Samurdhi Mahaththaya or Samurdhi Nona out of respect. Your duties will include participating in funerals, weddings and other special events to provide assistance. Whenever they need your support, you must be at their door-step. We will provide all facilities without delay, he said.
He added that as a campaign, Samurdhi is strong enough to facilitate the people financially since the fund is quite large.
We have about Rs. 20 billion, he said. Unfortunately, during the last 10 years, the Samurdhi campaign was not treated well and did not earn well as it has not invested money in the proper places with good rates. Sometimes they had invested money with 2 percent or 3 percent rates for the last 10 years.
But if they invested the money in banks with good rates, we could have earned at least Rs. 40 billion, the minister stressed.

Zimbabwe latest: Mugabe makes first public appearance

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has made his first public appearance since the country's army took over on Wednesday.
He attended a graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare.
Mugabe had been under house arrest for days. The army made its move after a power struggle over his successor.
The military said on Friday it was "engaging" with Mugabe and would advise the public on the outcome of talks "as soon as possible".
He joined the crowd in singing the national anthem and walking slowly up a red carpet.
Neither his wife, Grace Mugabe, nor Education Minister Jonathan Moyo were present.
His attendance at the graduation is an annual tradition but few expected to see him there after he was put under house arrest, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports from Zimbabwe.
The army took control after Mugabe last week sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, signalling that he favoured Grace Mugabe to take over his Zanu-PF party and the presidency.

Zimbabwe latest: Mugabe 'resisting calls to resign'

Zimbabwe's long-time President Robert Mugabe is reportedly refusing to step down immediately, despite growing calls for his resignation.
The 93-year-old was put under house arrest during a military takeover on Wednesday, amid a power struggle over who would succeed him.
There has been no official word on the outcome of talks he had with regional envoys and the army chief earlier.
But sources say he has so far refused to agree to move aside.
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said earlier it was "in the interests of the people" that Mugabe "resign... immediately".
The army moved in after Mugabe last week sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, signalling that he favoured his wife Grace Mugabe to take over his Zanu-PF party and thus the presidency.
The BBC's Andrew Harding, in Zimbabwe, says that if President Mugabe can be persuaded to step down officially it could help legitimise the military's dramatic intervention.
On the streets, it is hard to find anyone who wants Mugabe to stay on, our correspondent adds, but negotiating the manner of his departure and some sort of transitional agreement to follow could take some time.
