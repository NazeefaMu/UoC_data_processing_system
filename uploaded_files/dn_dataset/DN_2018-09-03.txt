Payment of taxes, a social duty
Payment of taxes is not a burden but a social duty. Sri Lanka too should introduce laws to punish people evading taxes and those aiding and abetting them under criminal law as in developed countries like England, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue Ivan Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a public seminar and awareness programme on the Island Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 held at Kurunegala, organised by the Inland Revenue Department recently.
Dissanayake said tax revenue contributed to a mere 10 percent of the total national income. But in comparson to this, even in more underdeveloped countries, tax revenue accounted for at least 20 or 34 percent of total national income.
Now they had been able to increase tax revenue to about 14 percent of the total income through much effort. The payment of the first instalment under the new Inland Revenue Act was due on August 15 and the department had collected Rs.30 billion as tax revenue in compassion to Rs. 21 billion received as first installment under the earlier Act by August 15, 2017. By July 31, the department had opened 86,000 new tax files due to people volunteering to pay taxes. He said his department was thankful to everyone who came forward to pay taxes on their own accord, he said.
Artistes recently agitated against the Withholding Tax. Now the tax which was 14 percent subject to Rs.500000 per year has been reduced to 5 percent. Cabinet approval has already been received to reduce Withholding Tax on leasing from 10 percent to five percent.

Alankara and Geshany Balder: A create collaboration
In another example of serendipitous creative collaboration, leading jeweler Alankara and local artist Geshany Balder joined hands to launch Alankaras latest offering  an exquisite new collection called Dawn To Dusk.
The jewelry brand is committed to promoting local artists in Sri Lanka, by including their art in display units at the flagship Alankara shop at Odel in Colombo 7.This alternative exhibition space creates a new everyday audience for up-and-coming artists like Geshany.
The Dawn to Dusk collection is made exclusively in gold and diamonds, and features uniquely designed pendants, earrings and rings. As the name suggests, the pieces are designed to be worn throughout the day, and into the night, holding their own at any hour, with any attire and on any occasion.
Roshini Sangani, Director of Alankara, explains the similarities between Geshanys work and the new collection Dawn To Dusk features very organic lines and shapes, and we felt that Geshanys art really complimented the look and feel of our range. Her use of soft colours and gestural shapes created an ideal backdrop for the pieces in our collection, and we found that our inspiration had stemmed from an identical place  elements found in nature like rocks, waves, branches and clouds.
Sri Lankan born Geshany, has family roots in Germany and studied art in both Europe and Asia. She bases her work on neo-surrealism, seeking to distort the elements of time and space and explore what lies beyond our everyday reality. Examining the unknown and delving into both interstellar and inter-dimensional worlds; Geshany also includes mythical characters in her art.
Geshany herself felt an immediate link to the Dawn To Dusk collection These are truly beautifully crafted and versatile pieces of jewelry. They enhance any look. I really appreciate the fact that Alankara invited me to be a part of this collection, the support from brands like Alankara is invaluable for local artists like myself, and I am very happy that they intend to continue melding their creative output with that of local artists. Explore more of Geshanys current art projects through her Instagram page - @geshany_balder.
We have been delighted with all the artistic collaborations we have entered into so far, and we will continue down this path in the future, confirmed Roshini. In Geshany we saw someone who was as committed as we are to creating art that opens the mind to new discoveries; that shared goal made working with her a very easy and enjoyable experience. -PH

Ali bowls England to series win over India
Southampton, Sunday: Moeen Ali bowled England to a series-clinching 60-run win in the fourth Test against India at Southampton on Sunday.
Victory, achieved with more than a day to spare, left England an unassailable 3-1 up in the five-match series against India, the worlds number one ranked Test side, ahead of Fridays finale at The Oval.
India, set 245 to win, were dismissed for 184 with recalled off-spinner Ali taking four for 71 in 26 overs on a wearing pitch, including the key wicket of star batsman Virat Kohli (58).
That gave Ali a match return of nine for 134 following his first-innings five for 63.
It was another star turn at Hampshires headquarters from Ali, who took six for 67 when England beat India by 266 runs in the corresponding Test at Southampton four years ago.
While India captain Kohli and his deputy Ajinkya Rahane (51) were sharing a century stand for the fourth wicket, the tourists had hope of chasing down their stiff target.
But after Ali dismissed both senior batsmen either side of tea, India lost four wickets for 13 runs before Sam Curran, capping another fine all-round display, ended the match by having Ravichandran Ashwin lbw for 25.
After they were dismissed for 271 in their second innings, England made early inroads into Indias top order.
KL Rahul was bowled for a duck by a Stuart Broad delivery that kept cruelly low.
James Anderson, surprisingly, wicketless in an India first innings of 273 that featured Cheteshwar Pujaras excellent 132 not out, then struck twice.
He had Pujara lbw for just five on Sunday and his next over saw Shikhar Dhawan (17) well caught in the gully by Ben Stokes.
That double strike left paceman Anderson on 559 Test wickets and just four behind retired Australia great Glenn McGraths mark of 563, the most taken in Tests by any fast bowler.
India were again looking for another major innings from Kohli, who had already scored two hundreds this series and would pass 500 runs for the campaign during Sundays innings.
England thought they had the worlds number-one ranked batsman lbw for nine to Ali.
But after Englands review of an original not out decision from Kumar Dharmasena, third umpire Joel Wilson ruled there had been an inside edge.
At lunch, India were 46 for three with Kohli 10 not out and Rahane unbeaten on 13.
Kohli had moved on to 15 when he survived another huge lbw appeal from Ali.
Although he looked out, with the ball striking him low down and in front of the stumps, Dharmasenas decision was upheld on review because the ball had pitched outside off stump with the batsman playing a shot.
Kohli went to fifty with just a third four in 114 balls when he clipped Anderson off his pads through square leg.
It had seemed as if England had missed a huge chance when Alastair Cook dropped Kohli off Ali at short leg.
But the very next ball saw Kohli get a thin glove and this time Cook made no mistake.
Kohli reviewed, but to no avail, before appearing to exchange angry words with Broad.
The scale of Indias task was evident from the fact they had only three times before scored 200 or more in the fourth innings to win a Test match outside of Asia. AFP

TRIBUTE
Maj. Gen. Chagie Gallage
A silent warrior
Major General Chagie Pamoda Gallage, a true patriot, soldier to the core, as well as an inspiring military leader and gentleman, hung up his uniform on August 31, after 35 years of service to the nation after reaching the maximum permissible age of service (55 years) in the Army. Having known Major General Gallage for over three decades, I trust that I could pen many distinct attributes of him with authority and accuracy. Major General Chagie Gallage, whom I would respectfully and fondly call hereinafter as Chagie, was my senior colleague in the Army; an officer of repute of the prestigious Gajaba Regiment, who always upheld customs, traditions and ethics of the organisation and left a legacy that cannot be repealed in the Sri Lanka Army and the Gajaba Regiment.
General Gallage is no doubt a national figure. To gain such recognition, he neither blew his own trumpet nor did he write an autobiography. It is the humility embedded in his persona that brought him this adulation. Although Chagie became popularly known to the public in Sri Lanka because of the decisive role he played in the final thrust against the LTTE during 2007 - 2009, he had always been popular among his comrades in the Army, batch mates, old Anandians, the motor racing community, as well as his relatives and friends.
Burly and diminutive, a keen ruggerite and a Scout at school, Chagie joined the 19th Intake of the Army as an Officer Cadet in 1984. He took to the military career like a fish taking to water. I recall seeing him for the first time at the Military Academy in Diyatalawa from a batch junior to him, and essential attributes of a great military commander were evident all over in him, even at that very formative stage of his military career. Tough and robust, mentally and physically, Chagie was charismatic and inspiring to watch.
Chagie, as a person, is always willing to help others. He is one in a million who never changed his qualities from his youth to date. That is to say that if you had known Chagie in 1984, when he was 20 years old and even in 2018, when he was in his mid-50's, you would meet the same character, which is not so with many others. He was an adornment to the positions he held and did not use the positions to adorn himself. This no-nonsense officer could also get stubborn easily and stand for what is right against all odds, which sometimes got him into trouble.
Chagies contributions to the Gajaba Regiment has been outstanding. The Gajaba Regiment is synonymous with Chagie Gallage. Chagie, as a young subaltern in the mid-80s, was a skillful and tactically-sound combat fighter who operated along with his rifle-company in many areas in Jaffna. His first independent command was to guard the Nagadeepa (Nainativu) island in 1986 with his platoon. He played a key role in 'Operation Vadamarachchi' and 'Operation Clean-sweep'the two military operations led by late Generals Kobbekaduwa and Wimalaratne, which were launched to rid the terrorist out of Jaffna peninsula in 1986.
I presume that Chagies stint at the Sri Lanka Military Academy (SLMA) as an officer instructor, is one of his most memorable. Working under late Major General Gamini Gunasekera, Chagie not only excelled in training Officer Cadets, but also became one of the pioneers of organising motor racing competitions in the Army, in partnership with the Sri Lanka Auto-sports Drivers' Association (formerly SLARDAR)a journey that began at Fox-hill, Diyatalawa. The motor racing track at the Gajaba Regiment in Anuradhapuara, is a result of his hard work.
During most of his long and enduring military career, Chagie served in an operational area or at a military training institute. He is one of the few officers in the Army who always commanded respect not only from his subordinates, but also from his superiors and peers. Battle-hardened Chagie was the first choice of any senior military commander to include in their team of field commanders for operations. Thus, Chagie was seen in almost all major combat operations in all fronts in North and East, during 1985 to 2009.
Some called Chagie a meticulous man because he goes into minute details of any assignment, and that particularly is the reason for his success. Be it official or private, he was always well-focused on whatever he was doing. Duty was always at his heart that he would stay the whole day in uniform doing his job and exceeding expectations of his superiors. Chagie would do all the work around him, disregarding whether that work is within his purview or others, and would stay backstage without claiming credit for the achievement. By doing so, he gained a reputation among senior officers as well as confidence among juniors, which was one of the reasons for his seniors to count heavily on him and his juniors to place their faith in him.
Calmness in crisis is a much required quality of a good battlefield commander. Once, during an intense battle at Karadipokku in Kilinochchi, during Operation Sathjaya in 1996, the Army suffered heavy casualties and the battle was about to be lost. It was at that crucial moment that Chagie arrived without waiting for instructions from superiors and led his elite Airmobile troops to control the situation. The LTTE later fired mortars at the Advanced Dressing Station (first-aid point just behind the line of fire), while he was being treated after the battle. At this moment, while others were running for cover, while carrying their saline bottles in hand, Chagie lit a cigarette.
During the Humanitarian Military Operation, Chagie, as a Brigadier, commanded the Commando Brigade which had been grouped with some infantry battalions, with which he moved into action against the LTTE in the Eastern Province, in 2006. His leadership was instrumental in liberating the Southern region of East that included the LTTE stronghold Thoppigala. Then he switched to the Wanni theatre with the beginning of operations in the Northern front in 2007. He raised the Task Force-1 there and launched it from Mannar, along with the Commando Brigade, which was later driven by his closest friend in the Regiment Maj. Gen. Shavendra Silva, until the completion of the Eelam War, which was later known as 58 Division.
Thereafter, being away from battle due to a brief illness, Chagie returned to the field in 2009 to Command the 59 Division in Mullaitivu. On completion of the campaign, Brigadier Chagie Gallage was promoted to Major General well ahead of most of his peers, on merit. Chagie not only earned medals multiple times for his bravery in battle, but also worked hard to for his juniors to be able to earn such medals as well.
Chagie is extremely innovative; he could device things when the resources were scarce or unavailable. I recount how Colonel Chagie, as the Commandant of Army Training School in Maduruoya, in 2004, was instrumental in conceptualising and forming the highly-skilled Special Infantry Operations Teams (SIOT) of the Army, together with Lt. Col. Ralph Nugera, realising a vision spelt out by then Inspector of Infantry Major General Sarath Fonseka. It was these SIO Teams that boosted the fighting capacity of the infantry and fought as vanguards of the advancing army during the Humanitarian Military Operation. On another occasion, during the middle of the same military campaign, the army encountered highly-fortified LTTE fortifications built on Ditch cum Bund, commonly known as DCB (DCB is a line of bunkers coupled with about 10-foot-wide water obstacles in front of them). These obstacles hindered the movement of the army. Chagie, as the Director Training, under the direction of the then Army Commander, created special teams and trained them on a special battle drill that eventually enabled troops to cross these LTTE obstacles.
Any army would pick one of its highly professional and loyal military officers to command its Presidential Guard force that provides protection to the Head of State. His superiors at that time, had no hesitation in recommending Chagie to that vital appointment, which he held for four years from 2010. Matured to the core and dedicated to excellence in all its manifold facets from command to instructional, the army received Chagies services as a Tactical Level Commander and thereafter, as an Operational Level Commander, proving himself a well-accomplished General officer. The army, in particular and the country in general, received a tremendous service from this legendary military leader of our time. Yet, he never grumbled about what he did not receive in return.
The Leadership of Maj. Gen. Chagie Gallage should be researched and documented for the benefit of budding military leaders. A good source for such a research is his close associates in and outside the army, who know his inner qualities well. It is my sincere wish as well as of many others whom I know, that the outstanding potentials of Major General Chagie Gallage (retired) may be utilised for the benefit of this country for a few more years.

Excellent academic
It is with deep sorrow that I pen this note of appreciation on our respected senior lecturer, Professor S.H. Hasbullah, who passed away on August 28, this year, at the Jaffna University.
He was born and bred at Erukkalampiy in Mannar. He graduated from the University of Peradenya and pursued a Doctorate in Geography, in British Columbia, Canada.
Apart from his academic responsibilities, he toiled for social empowerment. There would be many students and academics, local and foreign, that would be mourning him, and they would hold on to his memory forever, for inspiration and guidance.

Point of view
Markets reversed course this week as positive news about the potential return of State-owned pension fund (EPF) to the equity market revived sentiment and helped the Index recover from its 17-month low of 6010.23 points.
Equities have been on a consistent downtrend over the last five weeks amid i) lackluster corporate earnings over the June18 quarter, ii) a Moodys report highlighting Sri Lankas higher-than-peer vulnerability to USD appreciation due to tighter external refinancing conditions in the next five years and, iii) price pressure on corporate heavy-weights in the banking and telecom sectors amid media reports of proposed levies on these two sectors.
News of the potential return of the EPF (which was a key institutional player in the domestic equity market and which has been absent from markets since 2015) amid more sufficient safeguards to improve transparency and accountability in trading guidelines therefore boosted sentiment significantly, causing the broad-share ASPI to gain 70 points following the news.
The gains on the Index helped offset the 42 point loss at the start of the week, and helped the Index close up 28 points (0.46%) higher while average daily turnover levels over the week improved marginally from that of last week (Rs.0.55Bn cf. Rs0.48Bn last week) .
The ASPI lost 1.1% (67 index points) over the month of August, adding on to the 0.8% lost over the month of July, and increasing the YTD loss on the Index to 5.2% from the 3.4% YTD loss recorded in H218.
The foreign equity sell-off on the Colombo bourse meanwhile eased somewhat over August, with the net foreign outflows over August falling to Rs. 0.59Bn from net foreign outflows of Rs. 1.20Bn over July. In the absence of any negative news related to taxes, markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Domestic and global pressures push LKR down 5%
Sri Lankas trade deficit widened to $795Mn over Jun18 (cf. $554Mn in Jun17) leading to a narrowing of the countrys cumulative Balance-of-Payments (B-o-P) surplus upto Jun18. The B-o-P surplus between Jan-Jun18 fell to $1.1Bn from $1.6Bn during Jan-Jun17 amid a widening trade deficit and slower external sector financial flows.
Higher import expenses on fuel, vehicles, transport equipment (particularly fuel imports which rose notably due to higher price and volume of crude oil/refined petroleum) outpaced the increase in export earnings from textiles and garments, bunker and aviation fuel and commodities (rubber).
In terms of service account inflows meanwhile higher earnings from tourism were offset by lower workers remittances. Meanwhile, although the financial account of the B-o-P was buttressed by the IMFs 5th EFF tranche and 3rd tranche from the Hambantota Port sales proceeds, continued portfolio outflows from the Government securities market and CSE added some pressure on the B-o-P. Despite the countrys gross official reserves remaining at $9.3Bn, the LKR depreciated 3.4% against the USD by June 2018 and by 5.0% YTD reflecting not just the above developments in domestic markets but also developments in global FX markets.
The appreciating USD has impacted nearly all emerging/frontier market currencies as the USD has strengthened sharply this year amid tightening monetary policy in the U.S. and the intensifying trade dispute with China.
However, Moodys noted last week that Sri Lanka remains among the countries most vulnerable to USD appreciation as its i) external debt repayment requirements increase materially in 2019-22 and ii) 46% of the GoSLs gross borrowing requirement (18.5% of GDP) is foreign currency denominated.

Car registrations increase in past three months
Car registrations have sky rocketed in the last three months mainly in the small car category that account for close to 90% of volumes.
The impact of the recent increase in minimum duty rates will only be reflected in registrations towards the end of the year for there are large stocks of unregistered cars in the market and many more on the water that will not be taxed at the higher rates. It may also be appropriate to reinstate the 50% LTV rate on financing of hybrid cars from the current 70% - excess credit towards purchasing of cars is driving imports and holding up the cost of borrowing which has not tracked policy and GSEC yields downwards.
On the flip side taxi hailing platforms like Uber and Pickme have created a professional class of drivers who need financing to get their first vehicle thus any measures to curtail funding is a regressive measure  in such instance the car is a production asset rather than a consumption asset. Getting policy always right is very difficult for there are winners and losers thus one has to balance the various interests.
The restriction imposed on civil servant car permits such as eligibility and transferability have been relaxed which has resulted in a supply of 6-8,000 permits. A bearer of a permit is entitled to a discount of Rs. 3.6 million on the excise taxes payable irrespective of the CIF value of the vehicle.

Colombo Dental Hospital, an eyesore
The unavailability of a canteen at the Colombo Dental Hospital is a grave and serious shortcoming.
This government hospital located close to the Colombo Eye Hospital, usually gets filled with hundreds and thousands of dental patients who come for treatments, from various distant places such as, Beruwala, Kalutara, Matara, Hambantota, Kandy etc. Among them there are infants, school children, old people and pregnant ladies and the clergy who faces much inconveniences due to non-availability of a proper place to have something to eat or drink.
At the OPD the patients are much inconvenienced due to the quick disappearance of the patients calling number which is displaced on the TV screen. Patients are of the view that all other unnecessary numbers displayed on the TV screen, except the calling number should be erased, otherwise the patient who seeks his or her reference number (calling number) gets confused, when looking for the relevant number.
If any patient misses his/her calling number displayed on the TV screen, at any unexpected moment, the relevant patient is urged to rush to the counter for getting the missed number.
But unfortunately, the unkind counter clerk (man or a woman) gets annoyed when the patient asks for the number and blames very unkindly.
Then, the patient will have to rush to the ground floor counter where all the counter clerks are helpful and kind to give the missed number soon.
It is much known and everybody knows that the majority of government hospital workers, including the doctors are extremely unkind, cruel and unhelpful towards innocent helpless patients when asking for a help.
This writer, therefore wants the Health Ministry authority and the Health Minister to look into the affairs and services and duties done by the so called Nightingales and doctors in government hospitals, and take necessary actions against those who work unkindly, mercilessly and inhumanely regarding the treatments and services towards patients.

Dignified enduring mission
Part I
The universe has endowed the human beings with a higher cognitive capacity, which surpasses that of all other living beings, probably as a means of ensuring the existence of the world. Thus, we are born into this world and lead our lives as social beings. Concerning our lifespan from womb to tomb, and even further in case of illegitimate conceptions or illegal exhumations, Sri Lanka Police is entrusted with the bounden duty of shouldering the constitutional responsibility and ensuring the safety of the general public of our motherland. Adopting the Buddhist words of wisdom, Dhammo hawe rakkhathi dhammachari (One who lives with the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma) as its motto while wearing the emblem bearing a dauntless tusker in the middle and the dharma chakra (Dharma Wheel) on the head, Sri Lanka Police is dedicated towards maintaining law and order while safeguarding lives and property of the Sri Lankan community. This is considered to be one of the major organisations among the three government institutions which were initially established in this country and its glorious history and the 152nd anniversary is thus celebrated with great vim and gusto.
Sri Lanka Police also marks the inception of the first security service in Sri Lanka. The history of the security service of this country goes back to the reign of King Pandukabhaya and this service owes its origin to the position named, Nagara Guththika. It has gradually evolved up to the Dutch and Portuguese eras. After occupying the maritime areas of the country in 1796, the British established a police service in this country. The Police Force was further streamlined under the regulations imposed by the Act bearing No. 14 passed under the British Crown in 1806 and at the time the Police Force consisted of 28 Police Force Constables. Payment of salaries to the Police Force was made with effect from July 9, 1833.
civil administration
Then, 47 police stations were established centred on commercial cities and 585 police officers were deployed for city protection duties. Maradana Police station was recorded in history as the first police station to be established in this manner. With the appointment of George William Robinson Campbell as the first Inspector General of Police on September 3, 1966, as per the provisions of the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, the inauguration of the police service as an organisation in this country took place constitutionally. The said date has been declared as the Police Day. Since the appointment of Sir Richard Aluvihare on January 6, 1947 as the first Sri Lankan Inspector General of Police, the occidental aura emanated from the police service has begun to be overpowered by the Sri Lankan spirit.
At present, Sri Lanka Police functions under the Ministry of Public Administration and Law & Order and has become a solid government institution which consists of 64 Functional Divisions, 42 Territorial Divisions, 491 Police Stations and strength of more than 90,000 police officers.
The term Polis has been derived from the French language and it means, the guardian of the civil administration. There is no other public institution than police organisation which faces greater challenges in a country where the civil administration is in effect due to the absence of internal disputes. Sri Lanka Police, which has encountered three internal civil disputes, has faced many daunting challenges subsequent to the war situation prevailed for three decades in North Eastern provinces.
The duties of a police organisation in other countries are crime investigation, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management. However, the professional role of a Sri Lankan police officer is played in a more complex way. In addition to the basic police duties such as crime investigation, crime prevention, maintenance of law and order and traffic management, the citizens of the country currently expect the police to perform tasks such as implementing laws on liquor and narcotics, prevention of communicable diseases like dengue, protection of forests, coastal conservation, wildlife conservation, prevention of illegal sand mining and illegal excavation, even though there are separate government bodies which are functioning to implement such environmental laws. At present, even the safety of the railway crossings is ensured under police supervision. Thus, the duty of the police officer has become extremely complex.
On the other hand, it brings us great pleasure to think of the sense of confidence Sri Lanka Police has inspired in the Executive, Legislature and the general public for choosing us to assign a significant share of all these tasks. In other countries, usually, the police officers are not assigned to other duties. However, the Indian Police are deployed for the performance of other duties and a different structure has been designed for that purpose. The officers of Sri Lanka Police are discharging those duties on a daily basis and sometimes even the officers of the Special Task Force, which is the elite paramilitary forces unit of Sri Lanka Police, might assume the role of a valiant soldier while discharging ordinary police duties.
Sri Lanka Police that has inherited a proud history of 152 years is offering many services covering various fields to more than twenty million Sri Lankans. Protecting lives and property of Sri Lankan citizens, Sri Lanka Police has presently become a bosom friend of the general public and it stands upright like a giant tree above a thick canopy of praise, blame, commendation and criticism while confronting all the difficulties and challenges around the clock in both sun and rain.
The number of police stations that were 437 in 2015 have been increased up to 492 to date by the present Inspector General of Police, Pujith Jayasundara, who pays special attention towards improving the basic facilities and service facilities necessary to fulfil the public needs efficiently by bridging the gap between the public and police. This provided a great relief for the people who had to travel a long way with great difficulty to get services from police. New police stations have been established by further segmenting some of the larger police areas. This has further reduced the population density of the respective police stations and therefore those people have been able to get their services more efficiently.
challenges of preventing crimes
Furthermore, taking measures to develop human and physical resources in Sri Lanka Police with the intention of ensuring the security of the society in a peaceful country can be perceived as a huge achievement of the citizens of this country.
Numerous are the social, economic, political and cultural problems faced by the citizens of this country in which a population of more than twenty million comprises of a mosaic of cultures and races such as Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers who are following religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Catholicism and Islam in this country. Various measures are being taken by Sri Lanka Police for preventing crimes and minimizing crimes through the application of knowledge, technology and training to overcome those challenges paying attention to the crimes against the lives and property of those diverse communities. Although it is said that the crimes are on the increase at present when compared with the statistics on reported crimes it becomes clear that the number has only decreased.
This becomes evident when analyzing statistical data of 15 years in which the tendency to talk about criminal incidents have increased. Criminal incidents were also reported during the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 when compared to the present.
However, since news articles on war had occupied more space on newspapers, incidents of crimes did not attract much public attention. After the year 2009, headlines related to war had been replaced with headlines about criminal incidents, creating a basis for discussion. That is not a factor which should be construed as an increase in crimes.
For an example, reports on criminal incidents occurred during the year 2008 and 2017-2018 (up to July 31) are given in the table.
A growing trend in rape cases can be observed and it should be mentioned that this major social problem has been caused due to the parents inability to recognize their responsibilities towards children. The number of rape cases reported in 2017 is 1732. Out of those, 294 instances are related to rape cases in females over 16 years and the number of rape cases committed with the consent of females below 16 years is 1205. The number of rape cases in females below 16 years committed without consent is 142. Since the children under the age of 16 should be under the protection of their parents; these children must have become rape victims as a result of not getting proper attention and security of their parents. It becomes clear that the duty of police has been performed efficiently by bringing the percentage of solving rape cases up to 94.2% in 2018. Further, it becomes evident that citizens should also assume their share of social responsibilities in the process of crime prevention.
Through the application of modern technology for investigating crimes, Sri Lanka Police have been able to initiate a significant development in the field of investigation. A great assistance is being given by Scene of Crime Officers (SOCO) who has undergone a proper training, officers and hounds of Police Kennels Division, Fingerprint Officers and Photographers of Police Criminal Records Division to facilitate the investigations and to identify criminals.

Eduard Hempel invests US$ 15 mn on Tamba Villas Thalpe
Eduard Hempel is set to launch his latest venture, Tamba Villas Thalpe with an investment of US$ 15 million in Thalpe next month.
Tamba Villas Director and Co-Project Principal, Eduard Hempel speaking to the Daily News Business, said that they are going to construct 37 Villas on a four acre property in Thalpe.
The 37 villas includes seven swimming pools throughout the estate and an eighth 23 metre wrap around pool, custom-designed ponds with tropical landscaped gardens which would commence in early 2019, while the project is scheduled to be completed by early 2021, said Hempel.
Tamba Villas is a delightful private coconut estate which is set back 300 metres from Thalpe beach (on the land side) surrounded by gardens and swaying palm trees.
The Southern coast which in recent times has witnessed a flurry of development and related activities, will soon be home to an idyllic, luxurious, yet at the same time, a home away from home development; Tamba Villas, said Hempel.
The Villas have been designed by an award-winning Singaporean Architectural team, to create a coastal lifestyle design with high-end amenities for living, working or early retiring in a much sought-after area in the South of Sri Lanka.
We want to give each home owner an idyllic life in a beautiful, safe space with all the comforts of modern day living, a place that affords them a 5-Star life-style; in short Tamba Villas in Thalpe. Tamba Estates Ptv Ltd, a Sri Lankan Limited company, owns 100% of the land that Tamba Villas will be built on, said Hempel.
The biggest plus point in economic terms for real estate developers was the fact that foreign investors can now buy freehold in a condominium development. On July 30, 2018, the Sri Lankan Parliament ratified an amendment to the laws so that foreigners can now buy Freehold ground upwards. Previously, foreigners could only buy Freehold from the 4th floor up, and consequently Sri Lankans were wary of buying the lower floors since they couldnt sell them to foreigners. This was having the effect of bending new buildings out of shape all over Colombo, as developers dedicated the first four floors to car parking. After all, Sri Lankans quite rightly didnt want to purchase a property with a market that is limited, but this latest development now opens the doors wide for foreigners to invest in real estate in Sri Lanka, he said.
We are incredibly excited, as we are just going into market with our delightful condominium/Villa development in Thalpe, and it is the first of its kind in the country. Foreigners can now own their Free-hold, which opens up the doors globally, he said.
Each villa has been named after a tea estate and the overall look and feel is highly reminiscent of world renowned architect, Geoffrey Bawa. The courtyards and verandas and the general feel of the buildings echo that grandest and most delightful and celebrated period of Sri Lankas architecture, the Colonial period. Tamba Villas hearkens back to a bygone era where leisure and sheer gentility were the order of the day. Serenity, respite and tranquillity, combined with modern day 5-star amenities and luxury pampering, will be our hallmark, he said.
We are confident that the villa will be an excellent investment. Property prices have been steadily going up over the last 5 years and will continue to rise, given our strong tourism sector and growing economy, he said.

Emerging Vietnam as a powerful country
In 1930, Naguen Ai Quok aka Ho Chi Minh established the Communist Party of Indo China in Vietnam. It paved the way to the National Movement in Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh educated the general people on the nature of colonialism and the class strata of Vietnam social structure. Vietnams National Movement gradually integrated with the National Liberation Struggle. Then the Vietnamese people understood that the future society should transform into a socialist society.
With the leadership of the Communist Party, they were able to integrate masses such as workers, peasants, male and female, youth and intellectuals to one platform on a large scale. This led to the establishment of relations with the worldwide progressive and revolutionary movements.
During World War II, the Vietnamese people were geared up for the national liberation movement. With the launching of an armed struggle against the French Colonialism and Japanese aggression by the liberation forces of Vietnam, they established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2, 1945.
With the aim of re-invading Vietnam, the French colonialists waged another war in December, 1946. This compelled Ho Chi Minh to assemble the Vietnamese as a nation to fight back and protect newly established Democratic Republic. Following the lapse of seven years of war, Ho Chi Minh provided leadership to win the war against the French Forces in 1954 which took place at the Dien Bien Phu. After the Geneva Convention, Vietnam was demarcated temporarily into two at the 17th post of the Benhai River. Thereby, the French Forces were withdrawn totally from Vietnam.
War destruction
Vietnam had to be united after conducting an election in 1956. With the assistance of America, administrators in the South objected to this. While building Socialism in North Vietnam, people had to fight severely against neo-colonialism. On April 30, 1975, they were able to reunite Vietnam by chasing out the Saigon Forces who were being assisted by the American Forces at that time. After that, the emphasis was made on the destructive problems faced by them. Bombs had been used against Vietnam which was three times bigger than the bombs used for the World War II. Twenty million of holes of bomb-shelling were left behind. Damage was prevalent across the island. Likewise, out of 15,000 villages nearly 9,000 villages were damaged in South Vietnam.
Economic centres, bridges and roads which belonged to North Vietnam were attacked by these nasty forces. The shortcomings and difficulties of the economic situation in the country circa 1981 were analysed thoroughly. But the results were not so satisfactory. Between 1984 and 1985, agricultural activities were at a standstill and the economic inflation rose up to 500 percent. Common masses started to migrate by boats. A new economic programme such as re-emerging doimoi, acceptance of truth and to face challenges was put forward by the governing Communist Party of Vietnam in 1986.
Thirty two years have lapsed since the adoption of the doimoi reconstruction programme which was adopted in 1986 by the sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam. A new Chapter has been created on this modern programme of three decades of the History of Vietnam. This helps achieve the requirement of the Vietnam population of 85 million.
Economic development
Today, Vietnam is among the fast emerging countries in Asia on economic development. Vietnam is behind China in economic development. However, China is now being superseded by Vietnam on poverty alleviation. Townships in Vietnam are great in appearance and busy in reality. In 1992, the poverty level was at 30 percent. It has now come down to 5 percent. According to the estimates of the United Nations, Vietnam will reach the world targets of the poverty alleviation soon.
Today, the cultural life of Vietnam is of a very high level. The interest of the Vietnamese people in news, information, newspapers, magazines, sports and social partnership has increased considerably. About 54 numerous categories of nations live in Vietnam and they always take steps to strengthen cultural heritages and lawfulness. Co-existence among them has been fulfilled under the stage patronage.
Although they have achieved these targets, they expect to reach the level of high-technique by 2020. History of 25 years of development will not be a long period. But their historical achievements through Doimoi will be recognized and honoured internationally in the future decades of the new millennium.
Vietnam is an emerging mighty state, the 73rd National day of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was celebrated this year. We also celebrate the 107th anniversary of the visit of Ho Chi Minh to Sri Lanka. We also celebrate the 107th anniversary of the visit of Ho Chi Minh to Sri Lanka. On his way to France, Ho Chi Minh spent one night in the Colonial Hotel in Colombo on June 14, 1911 (now it is called the New Colonial Hotel). Vietnam Embassy in Sri Lanka was re-established in 2011. It is a stepping stone in strengthening relations between Sri Lanka and Vietnam on economic, cultural and other numerous activities.

Fastest clapper
A Florida nine-year-old applauded his way into the Guinness Book of World Records by clapping his hands 1,080 times in one minute.
Guinness World Records said Seven Wade, 9, became interested in the hand-clapping record after seeing the previous record holder, Eli Bishop, on the record-keeping organization's YouTube channel. Wade said he studied the former record-holder's technique until he was able to best his record of 1,020 claps in one minute.
"Seven badly wanted to break the world record and began bursting into random clapping episodes every chance he could to make his point!" said Wade's father, Chikako Wade. "Eventually we told him that if he really wanted us to take him seriously about making an official world record attempt, he would have to prove it by setting up a daily practice schedule where he would speed clap in longer intervals than his usual 15 to 20 seconds."
Chikako Wade said his son started a practice regimen that saw him setting time aside for clapping several times a day. "I think it was important for Seven to witness and understand that a lot of preparation and planning goes into something like this. It's not enough to just be good at something," the father said.
"Practicing was only the beginning. Researching the rules and requirements, setting up the attempt, hiring the studio and sound engineers, recruiting the needed photographers, videographers and time keepers, and keeping up with the paperwork all took an incredible amount of dedication. I really wanted him to experience a complete and official Guinness World Records title attempt, even if he did not succeed in breaking the record. I think it's important to celebrate his skills. I am grateful to Guinness World Records for giving him the opportunity to achieve recognition for such a fun and unusual talent! The experience from start to finish was invaluable." UPI

Federer beats Kyrgios, Kerber, Zverev toppled at US Open
NEW YORK: Five-time champion Roger Federer found a new way to amaze Saturday as he reached the US Open last 16 with a 6-4, 6-1, 7-5 victory over Nick Kyrgios.
The second-seeded Swiss withstood an early onslaught from the unpredictable Aussie, firing 51 winners that included an unlikely forehand flicked around the net post that Kyrgios couldnt believe.
Definitely a bit of luck and good feet, Federer said of the shot that denied Kyrgios a game point -- although the Australian would go on to hold for 4-3 in the third set.
Federer had the luxury of a two-set lead when the duos most entertaining exchanges thrilled the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd.
Things would have been much different if Kyrgios could have converted one of four break points in the seventh game of the opening set.

I think if he breaks there he probably runs away and wins that first set, Federer said. He came out firing a lot of aces and feeling good. But Federer escaped, breaking Kyrgios to pocket the first set and dominating the second.
Hes an unbelievable frontrunner, Kyrgios said. When he gets in front, theres not much you can do. Federer will be seeking a 13th appearance in the US Open quarter-finals when he plays Australian John Millman, who reached the last 16 of a major for the first time with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 victory over Kazakhstans Mikhail Kukushkin.
Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic was up late on Ashe against French veteran Richard Gasquet. Djokovic beset by injury and self-doubt to start the season, broke out of the doldrums with his 13th Grand Slam title at the All-England Club.
He backed that up with a Cincinnati Masters title to put himself into the title mix along with Federer and world number one Rafael Nadal despite his relatively modest sixth seeding.
The third round was the end of the line for mens and womens fourth seeds from Germany -- Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber.
Kerber, the 2016 US Open winner tying to become the third woman in the last 20 years to win both Wimbledon and the US Open in the same season, was bundled out by Slovakias Dominika Cibulkova 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Zverev, the 21-year-old sensation who has lifted titles in Munich, Madrid and Washington this year and reached finals in Miami and Rome fell, 6-7 (1/7), 6-4, 6-1, 6-3 to veteran compatriot Philippe Kohlschreiber. It was another Grand Slam disappointment for Zverev, touted as the youngster most likely to end the major dominance of Federer, Djokovic and Nadal.
Kohlschreiber will seek a quarter-final berth against 2014 runner-up Kei Nishikori after the Japanese downed Argentine Diego Schwartzman 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.
Kerbers defeat followed the early exits of world number one Simona Halep and No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki -- who were both also seeking a second Grand Slam title of the year. Kerber didnt blame a domino effect for her departure.
I just try to go my way, Im not looking around who was winning or who was losing, said the German, who was at a loss to account for a bad day at the office.
You have sometimes days where you are trying everything, but its not really working as you wish, she said.
Cibulkova, the 29th seed, moves on to face 2017 finalist Madison Keys, who shook off a slow start to beat Serbian Aleksandra Krunic 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Sixth-seeded Caroline Garcia of France also departed, beaten 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) by Spains Carla Suarez Navarro, and Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova sprang a surprise, too, with a 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 7-6 (7/1) victory over 13th-seeded Belgian Kiki Bertens.
Suarez Navarro, seeded 30th, next faces 2006 champion Maria Sharapova, who defeated 2017 French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko 6-3, 6-2.
Vondrousova, through to a Grand Slam third round for the first time, will play Ukraines Lesia Tsurenko, who defeated Czech Katerina Siniakova 6-4, 6-0 after taking out Wozniacki in the second round. AFP

Financial auditing framework unveiled for informal, unlisted businesses
A pioneering financial auditing framework was unveiled for informal enterprises and unlisted businesses in Colombo on August 30.
As a result of the new framework, more than one million registered SMEs and countless other unlisted businesses in Sri Lanka finally get their long awaited break to become credit worthy and receive access to finance by clearing the biggest obstacle they have been facing; inability to be officially audited and show a verified financial statement, despite maintaining their own bookkeeping. The latest audit framework, modelled on the famed Nordic SME auditing, now equips the informal economic sectors to be credit-worthy on their own with any Sri Lankan bank or other financial institution, finally ending the credit-cum-financing blockade that relentlessly plagued these sectors for many decades.
Even the World Bank supports Sri Lankas initiatives to develop comparable national accounting and auditing frameworks, the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen said addressing the launch of Sri Lanka Auditing Standard (SLAuS) for the Audits of Non  Specified Business Enterprises (Non-SBEs) by the Chartered Accountants Sri Lanka at CA Sri Lanka office, Colombo.
Called as Sri Lanka Auditing Standard (SLAuS) for the Audits of Non  Specified Business Enterprises (Non-SBEs), this is also the first ever such SME bookkeeping audit framework to be introduced anywhere in South Asia (Among examples of SBEs are public listed firms and firms handling public money such as Finance companies). CA Sri Lanka, observing the adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS) for SMEs was low due to their complexity, has pioneered the non-SBE SLAuS. Since the International Standards on Auditing (the ISAs) globally used in todays auditing have become more extensive, complex and therefore impractical for SMEs to use them, the simplified version for Sri Lankan small businesses by CA Sri Lanka called as non-SBE SLAuS was launched.
This stand-alone 60 page new SLAuS is a departure from the one-size-fits-all financial reporting and eases the complex reporting burden on private firms towards a practical and real-life framework, through a cost-benefit approach but with much less technical sophistication. This new SLAuS is modelled on similar auditing frameworks adopted by some Nordic countries. CA Sri Lanka believes that around 450 Lankan audit firms can start using the new SLAuS for non-SBEs on their clients from now on. The new SLAuS for non-SBEs is for unlisted firms/SMEs, and also for SMEs using SLFRS for Smaller Entities. SLFRS says any business with more than Rs 500 Mn annual revenue cannot use the SLFRS for Smaller Entities but have to go for SLFRS for SMEs or the full SLFRS. Therefore SBEs (Eg public listed firms and firms handling public money such as Financial institutions) should use the full SLFRS and not the SLAuS for non-SBEs. Chairman of CA Sri Lankas Audit Framework Subcommittee Sanath Fernando said that SMEs finally get their chance to become a formal entity-to be officially audited and receive a verified financial statement and as a result, for the first time to be bankable with Lankan financial institutions.

Full of life!
Julia Flores Colque still sings with joy in her indigenous Quechua tongue and strums the five strings of a tiny Andean guitar known as the charango, despite a recorded age of almost 118 years.
In her long life, she has witnessed two world wars, revolutions in her native Bolivia and the transformation of her rural town of Sacaba from 3,000 people to a bustling city of more than 175,000 in five decades.
Her national identity card says Flores Colque was born on Oct. 26, 1900 in a mining camp in the Bolivian mountains. At 117 and just over 10 months, she would be the oldest woman in the Andean nation and perhaps the oldest living person in the world. But Guinness World Records says it has received no application for her and Flores Colque doesn't seem to care that her record hasn't been confirmed. She hasn't even heard of the reference book.
These days, she enjoys the company of her dogs, cats and rooster. She is lucid and full of life, and she loves a good cake and singing folkloric songs in Quechua to anyone who comes to visit the dirt-floor adobe home she shares with her 65-year-old grandniece.
"If you would have told me you were coming, I'd have remembered all the songs," she said jokingly while playing the diminutive guitar. She then dipped a finger into a cake, and smiled while she licked the frosting. "She's always been active, easygoing and fun," said the grandniece, Agustina Berna.
Growing up, the now-centenarian herded sheep and llamas in the Bolivian highlands until she moved in her teenage years to a valley, where she began selling fruits and vegetables. The produce became her main source of sustenance, and she still maintains a healthy diet though she does indulge in the occasional cake and glass of soda. She never married and has no children. The previously world's oldest person, a 117-year-old Japanese woman, died earlier this year. Nabi Tajima was born on Aug. 4, 1900. Her passing apparently leaves Flores Colque as the world's oldest living person.
Sitting in the sun on a rustic bench, she seems eternal or like an ancient statue carved in stone. She is hard of hearing, but she remains sharp and scolds her smallest dog whenever Blanquita tries to venture out into the street. Just a few years ago, she still walked briskly. But then she fell and hurt her back. The doctor said she would never walk again. She proved the doctor wrong. AP

Galaha hospital attack suspects remanded
Seven suspects resident at the Deltota Estate in Galaha who were arrested by the Galaha Police in connection with damages caused to public property and the vehicles of two doctors attached to the Galaha hospital during the recent mob attack on the hospital have been remanded.
The arrests were made on September 1 following investigations into the incident.
The mob attack followed the death of a one-and-a-half-year old boy admitted to hospital in a critical condition on August 29.
Following the boys death, a mob of over 10,000 people stormed hospital and went on the rampage damaging public property and held the medical officer in charge hostage for over 10 hours. Police managed to take the doctor to safety getting him to wear a police uniform to disguise as a Police officer.
Thereafter, Central Province Health Services Director Dr. Shanthi Samarasinghe instructed two investigation teams to ascertain whether the death was caused due to negligence of the doctors and assess the damage caused to public property.
Dr. Samrasinghe said hospital staff other than doctors would be asked to report to work at the Galaha hospital from today. But, doctors have refused to take up duties at the hospital.
The doctors on duty at the hospital on the day of the incident have been transferred to the Health Services Directors Office with immediate effect.
Police conducting investigations with the help of video clips obtained by people are due to arrest more suspects.
The Peradeniya Inquirer Into Sudden Deaths who held the inquest in to the childs death recorded an open verdict and sent body parts of the deceased to the Government Analyst for examination and a report. Police investigations are continuing.

Global security challenges
The world is vastly different today than it was 70 years ago, when the dust was settling on the battlefields of World War II. The world may have enough nuclear weapons to destroy not just the Earth, but the entire Solar System, but the threat of two countries engaging in war at this point of time and expanding into World War III is somewhat remote. Instead, there are a variety of other factors and circumstances that threaten civilized societies all over the world. Some, such as terrorism are man-made but others, such as Climate Change are natural processes perhaps aggravated by Man.
The main thrust of this reality is that security of nations can no longer be viewed in one or two dimensions. This was the focus of the just-concluded Colombo Defence Seminar 2018 with its theme Security in an Era of Global Disruptions, which is highly appropriate in the present context. Indeed, security has become a global issue that requires a global response. Even the most powerful of nations cannot face this evolving situation on their own.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe summed up this scenario in his keynote address to the Colombo Defence Seminar, where he noted that the 21st Century opens up in an age facing an array of traditional and non-traditional security threats emanating from natural calamities, climate changes, human exodus and displacement, violent non-state actors, issue of ethnicity, new-fangled ideology, religious radicalism, cyber-terrorism and political activities. All these add up to violent extremism, which Prime Minister Wickremesinghe described as the greatest threat and challenge of the 21st Century.
This poses a challenge to Armed Forces which are still primed for traditional combat and conventional warfare. Sri Lankan Armed Forces have the distinction of defeating a terror group once described as the most brutal in the world by the FBI. But post-conflict, while being alive to the threats posed by elements here and abroad who still believe in that violent ideology, the Armed Forces have to evolve with the times and safeguard the country from some of the threats mentioned earlier. Cross-border or trans-national terrorism is on the rise  these are terrorist groups which espouse violent and dark ideologies that have no place in civilized society. As they are displaced from some of their traditional strongholds, they choose to operate from other places where they might not come under scrutiny. All countries have to be alive to this threat and also ensure that there is no room for religious or ethnic radicalism. The recent arrest of a Sri Lankan in Australia over ISIS-inspired terrorism-related offences shows the dangers of radicalization, regardless of geographical location. Better Intelligence gathering and sharing is essential to combat global terrorism and radicalism.
Our Security Forces and Police have commendably risen to the occasion during times of natural calamities such as the Tsunami, landslides and floods, which may intensify in the future due to Climate Change. Though denied by some, it is a fact of life. From deadly heat waves to record floods in places where it hardly rains, the worlds climate patterns have gone haywire and we must be ready to deal with those challenges.
The Security Forces have already intervened to prevent drug-running and human trafficking on the high seas. Trans-national organised crime is another area they should be concerned about. Cyber-terrorism is very much in the news these days, as attempts have been made to hack sensitive Government information in many countries. Our world is virtually run by computers and fears have been expressed that cyber terrorists could literally bring everything down either by hacking or spreading malicious software. We must be on guard against any such attempts  again, regional and worldwide cooperation is called for.
As noted by the Prime Minister, the nature of conflict and warfare is also changing. Conflicts are no longer limited to conventional weapons and battles. Drones are extensively used in modern conflict, both in surveillance and attack modes, the latter with sometimes disastrous results. Todays laser-guided weapons systems can attack with deadly accuracy. In the near future, robots may be extensively used in battles and soldiers themselves wear robotic exoskeletons that will give them more powers so to speak. Indeed, it is boots on the ground that really matter in the end, in spite of all the surveillance and intelligence etc.
But there is no doubt that the world will be a much better place without conflict. Total world military expenditure rose to $1739 billion in 2017, according to new figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). This is a staggering amount, that can easily resolve some of the developing worlds pressing problems. It is in the interest of the international community to work towards peace. This is a very complex process with no overnight answers. Yet, a few of the worlds long-running conflicts have ended with peace over the last few years. The lesson to be drawn from these experiences is that conflict management and resolution demands a more comprehensive and integrated approach than ever before. Peace must be a global aim  and a global effort.

Guinea pig sanctuary
A woman has dedicated her life to caring for thousands of rescued guinea pigs. She says the furry little creature is her spiritual animal. For the past 20 years, 49-year-old Saskia Chiesa has been running Los Angeles Guinea Pig Rescue in Chatsworth, California.
She decided to open the rescue after finding there was no place in the area for rescued guinea pigs to go. I decided to rescue guinea pigs because its my spiritual animal, Saskia says. The memory of my first guinea pig, I picked it up and I was just so taken. I was just totally mesmerized, it was just this beautiful creature. Ever since then, you know, my whole lifes gone to the pigs.
Saskia expected the rescue to start slowly but found herself with 20 guinea pigs within the first month, all of which were suffering from health problems. Since then, the rescue has become home to 250 guinea pigs at a time  and Saskia is always taking in more.
She says that understandably, life at the sanctuary is very hectic.
I was expecting one or two to start with but there were 20 of them. They all had skin diseases so I was thrown in the deep right away.
Due to how busy it gets, Saskia has taken on volunteers to help run the sanctuary including Melissa Brown, who says the pigs have changed her life.
I just love this place. I call this pig paradise, this is my home away from home, Melissa explains.
I love when kids and families come in here, and theyre just so excited and overwhelmed because theres a lot of guinea pigs. Theyre life-changing  I have suffered with anxiety, depression, just a lot of emotional problems growing up, and I feel now that the therapy that they give me, I definitely could have benefitted in my earlier years and I wish I couldve known that.
Alongside a roof over their tiny heads, the rescue centre also provides health checks for the guinea pigs, and services such as manicures and hair styling to give them a touch of luxury during their stay.
We do health checks where we just do a little scan, a nail clip and of course, we do adult matchmaking services, says Saskia.
So, if we have a guinea pig whos lonely then you can bring the guinea pig and well just have a few play dates. Same-sex of course because we dont breed here.
The sanctuary puts all the guinea pigs up for adoption and Saskia is passionate about educating people on how to give them the best care possible.
She says that the tiny animals require lots of space, which most definitely does not include the small cages you can sometimes see them be put into at pet stores.
Its cruel actually, to have them in the smaller cages because they do want to walk around, she says.

## Title: How human rights shaped a novel

How human rights shaped a novel
Before I wrote a novel, I worked as a volunteer phone counsellor, then in a local youth charity, and then writing, commissioning, and editing work on human rights abuses for an NGO. Though the offices changed, the work always began with listening to personal testimony and then providing context: the reports went into internal files or to social services. The human rights reports got published and quoted by bigger organizations such as Human Rights Watch and the US State Department.
The work took me across the UK and Northern Ireland. I went to Jordan, where people from Iraqi minority religious and ethnic communities, such as Yazidis and Mandaeans who had fled the war shared their memories with me.
In Rwanda women who had survived the genocide in 1994 brought out photographs of people they had lost.
I spent time with a group from different communities in Kosovo, who talked of the impact that the conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s had taken on their lives and their determination to build different futures.
In Srinagar I met a group of chefs preparing a wedding wazwaan (feast) in a small courtyard; they spoke of their work and daily lives as well as the effects of ongoing terror, the years of Indian Army surveillance and violence they had experienced.
Some had lost relatives: people had been disappeared over years and never been found. The travel my job required was extreme, which I loved, and I am still in touch with some of the people I met. But I reached a point where I had to stop.
Recorded voices
Excavating peoples trauma for work is a strange kind of life. It takes a toll on the person talking. The person listening knows this, and must continue for deadlines and money. The more I worked, the more time and memory, news and rumor, began to bleed into each other. Recorded voices said the same things over and over as I transcribed, even as my subjects lives were moving on. Yet the hardest part was the form in which I had to write. It felt repetitive and limited. I could only include blank facts, such as numbers of people killed, some edited interviews, and geographical and historical context. Footnotes: churned media (which showed how difficult it is to gather information in such circumstances). Human rights reports are important and necessary; we trust them to highlight abuse and to hold institutions to account. But I became exhausted. I was not alone: the mood in the organizations I worked in was constantly fraught, and our jobs were always precarious.
I had always written fiction for myself. Now I wondered if I could make something more of it. I thought it might balance my doubts about researching others stories and then presenting them with an objective eye. So I began work on We That Are Young.
The novel is based on Shakespeares King Lear. The play begins with the division of a kingdom, a partition that sets its characters against each other in a form of divide and rule, where daughters must compete for land and for a fathers love. It spoke to me of the first conflict of which I had become aware, the one that was in my family history: the 1947 Partition of India. It caused the migration of millions of people along religious lines of Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, and the deaths of a million as well. My grandparents left their home in what is now Pakistan and went to New Delhi. My grandmother was young, and pregnant, my mother born in December that year. My parents later left India for the UK in the 1960s.
Indian freedom
Partition stories were passed down to me by my mother and aunts, and later by the poetry, myths, and tales of home. I read Indias great antiwar epic the Mahabharata but also books by Sidwa, Chughtai, Kushwant Singh, Sahni, Hyder, V.S Naipaul, and Salman Rushdie. The work of Indian freedom fighter Mulk Raj Anand gave context to why I had been born in England, and why my grandmother, in India, never wanted to visit us. She held the British responsible for her personal losses in 1947.
There was also the reality of the ongoing conflict in Kashmir, which began with Partition and came to a peak in the 1990s. At the time, there was little international intervention; human rights monitors have only rarely, and with limited access, been able to investigate. In the same decade, the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia was unfolding. I read the news, I heard from family: I was very aware that while my peers in the cities of Srinagar and Sarajevo were living under sanctions and siege, I was at school studying Shakespeare for my final exams.
In Kosovo they were denied access to formal education and jobs. Some took up arms to fight for independence. By the time NATO bombed Kosovo and Belgrade I had edited my student newspaper and was about to graduate university with a degree in theology. I wrote one of my finals essays on Lear.

Colombo Defence Seminar  2018
Ideals converge to tackle the unthinkable
For two days, each year, 1,000 army personnel as well as foreign experts, gather to discuss global security threats at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo. Since its inception in 2011, the annual Colombo Defence Seminar has been host to discussions on urgent topics, a theme that continues in 2018, with discussions centring on Security in an Era of Global Disruptions.
One of the speakers, Aamna Rafiq, a research associate at the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad, (ISSI), explained this years theme with a quote from former U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld: there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsthe ones we dont know we dont know.
In essence, Rafiq (through Rumsfeld), described the conference in terms of the possibilities of knowledge in an era when the limitations of knowledge converge with the limits of imagination. The purpose of Sri Lankas annual Defence Seminar, in this context, is global preparedness for the unimaginable.
The theme of disruption could be broken down into two categories: human disruptions and technological disruptions. Within the scope of human disruptions, participants talked about global migration, political extremism, and urbanisation. Climate was broadly included in the topic of human disruptions, for being induced by human actions, as well as a security threat to social, economic, and political systems. In examining technological disruptions, participants talked on cyber-security, social media, artificial intelligence and future power.
Human disruptions
Early on, Dr. Carolyn Halladay, a senior lecturer and Academic Associate at the National Security Affairs Department of the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, contextualised global migration: in 2017, she said, 258 million people, or 3.4 percent of the worlds population, consisted of migrants; while today, migration flows are as high as they were during the end of WWII.
Halladay provided a more nuanced understanding of global migration as well: At some level, these issues, the issues that cause global migration, she said, are interconnected, and impermeable borders will not solve the problem. Halladay highlighted that the global communitys focus on strengthening borders would not solve the problems of migration. Instead, she said that embracing migrant communities to some extent, while utilising their strengths, may be a more productive approach to migration.
Another speaker, Eva Svoboda, turned the migration problem inside-out, in a similar way that Halladay did. Svoboda, the International Law and Policy Deputy Director in Switzerland, as well as a leader in in the International Red Cross organisation, said, The most effective way to prevent displacement is to prevent conflict. But Svoboda, recognising the improbability of her request, argued for a more moderate respect of international humanitarian laws that are already in place.
In the same panel, Dr. Lauren Twort of the Royal United Services Institute in the UK, spoke on the rising levels of global migration to urban areas and the threats that urbanisation poses to global security. By 2050, she said, Asia and Africa will account for 87 percent of all of the urban population, a total of about 3.5 billion people. Poorly managed urbanisation, cautioned Dr. Twort, can create more poverty and conflict. Trends of urban migration require proper infrastructure and coordinated planning, she said, not only from a human perspective, but also from a security perspective as urban spaces are the most vulnerable to terrorism and natural disasters. There doesnt seem to be a stop in terms of movement towards cities, said Twort, highlighting a need for urban security planning.
The question of future urbanisation was also raised while discussing climate change. Because of the changes in climate, said Colonel Jethrow Chipili from Zambia, the population that was once in rural areas is moving to urban areas. Chipili focussed on Tworts description of the easy targets that heavily urban areas posed and mentioned the possibility of urbanised warfare. We are mostly looking at using unconventional methods of warfare, he said, such as chemical weapons. Resources have become scarce as a result of climate change, and social instability as well as economic instability would be some of the consequences of climate change in future, he added.
Technological disruptions
The seminars discussions of technology showed a range of perceptions on controversial topics regarding technology. Technology is like a paradox, said Roshan Chandraguptha, Information Security Engineer from the Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) in Sri Lanka; It has numerous opportunities and challenges.
Dr. Kirklin Bateman, Retired Colonel of the U.S. Army, discussed the terrain of cyber-security since 2007. He highlighted the Russian hacking efforts in Estonia (2007), Georgia (2008), Ukraine (2014 and 2017), and the United States (2016) and mentioned the Stuxnet attack on Irans nuclear infrastructure (2010). In terms of cyber-restrictions, Bateman referenced the restrictions that China and North Korea employ to manage their citizens access to information. He said there was a need to balance education, and training in the government as well as private training, adding that addressing cyber-security threats requires a national strategy.
The seminars discussion on social media and authenticity was led by Dr. Rafiq. She said that more than half of the worlds population used social mediaincluding Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms. She described social media as a possible form of colonisation, with companies such as Facebook owning social media empires, that control vast amounts of personal data. Rafiq questioned, How and to what extent can people safely use these platforms but offered no concrete conclusions. She said social media had the power to reinvent and recreate reality. As one example, she described the potential of social media to create narratives for conflict. Rather than merely sharing the narrative of a conflict, she said social media could perpetuate specific narratives that may be removed from the physical reality of a conflict.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) was discussed briefly, but constructively, by retired Group Captain Ajay Lele, who is a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), New Delhi. AI has been around since the 1950s, he said, but requires a significant amount of data to be effective. He added that whereas AI was difficult to analyse when it first came into being in the 1950s, at present, new and unimagined horizons for AI were emerging. The Chairman of the panel, Dr. Harinda Vidanage, Director of the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) summarised the point: If you look at the past four, five, or even 10 years, so much data has been created through social media information, that finally, AI got its data.
Impressions of global experts
The Daily News spoke with several of the experts, asking them their perceptions of how helpful the Defence Seminar was in addressing problems that mattered to them, and whether or not they would return next year.
The Defence Seminar is good, Major General Lo Adeos from Niger, said, Its an opportunity to bring many people together to look to the future. This was the Major-Generals first Defence Seminar, and he said it had exceeded his expectations. He said that given the opportunity, he would return next year.
Its educative, Brigadier General H. Ngusa from Zambia, said; Theres a lot weve learnt that we didnt knowparticularly on cyber-security and cyber crimes and how it affects media operations. Brigadier General Ngusa said that discussing those aspects at the Defence Seminar, resonated with the challenges to security faced by his government in Zambia: We must find a way of addressing it, as well as coming up with a cyber policy.
Brigadier General M. Abo Tague from Niger, agreed with Generals Adeos and Ngusa and said, The Defence Seminar is helpful for everybody. In contrast, General Tareq Al Zaabi from the UAE, was less enthusiastic and was unsure whether or not he would attend next years seminar.
Two naval captains from Sweden, who are based in New Delhi, had attended the Defence Seminar 2017, and explained why they had returned this year. Its a good conference, Captain Tas said. Last years seminar was relevant, Captain Henriksson said, adding that its topic, Coutnering Violent Extremism, is always on the top of our list. So, when I got the invitation this year, I decided to go. Though the captains were not enamoured by all of the discussions at the seminar, Captain Henriksson said, its very good networking as well, and saw it as a valuable opportunity to meet with people from the U.S., Australia, Japan, China, Russia, and Europe.
Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam gave the Valedictory Statement at the Seminar, re-emphasising the importance of hosting an international conference on Security in an Era of Global Disruptions. Security, which in fact, can be seen as freedom from fear, he said, is essential for every human being, as well as society.
Kariyawasam, highlighting his thoughts on security disruptions in an evolutionary context, said It is a fact that disruptions have given rise to everything, including the evolution of our planetand at every stage of this evolution, there were disruptions to the status quo. However, Kariyawasam also acknowledged that never before in history, had there been an era where a single species caused disruptions on a global scale.
On a philosophical as well as a factual plane, he said; as Homo sapiens have become the dominant species, it is their responsibility to protect all life, not just human life.
He spoke on the intersections of disruptions taking place in the current global security landscape and concluded that, We must take our citizenship seriouslynot just for our countrys citizens, but the citizens of the world.

It's about when you eat!
Delaying breakfast until 10am and eating dinner around 6pm can help reduce fat University of Surrey researchers tested nine people for BBC show Trust Me, Im A DoctorThe volunteers they tested lost almost 2 per cent of their body fat in ten weeks
When it comes to losing weight, it appears that when you eat may be just as important as what you eat. In fact, an early dinner combined with a late breakfast may cut body fat and help you to eat less, research suggests.
People told to delay breakfast until about 10am and sit down to dinner at around 6pm lost twice as much body fat as those eating at their normal times. They ate less fat and sugar and drank less alcohol thanks to a consumption window of up to eight and a half hours a day and a ban on snacks after dinner, allowing their bodies to fast for longer.
Researchers at the University of Surrey tested nine people for the BBC show Trust Me, Im A Doctor. The volunteers lost almost 2 per cent of their body fat in ten weeks.
The study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Science, reveals that while participants didnt lose much more weight by adjusting meal times than those who kept a normal routine, the reduction in fat may mean they would do so in the long run because the body would start burning its energy reserves. dailymail

Japan women improve to win rugby gold
JAKARTA--Japans womens rugby sevens team gave itself a timely boost two years out from the Tokyo Olympics when it beat China 7-5 and won the Asian Games final for the first time on Saturday.
While Japans men have dominated Asian sevens for years, the women have struggled to stay ahead of their regional rival.
Japan was beaten by China in the last Asian Games final four years ago, and recently lost its spot to China as a core team in the world sevens series.
But with Tokyo hosting the Olympics in 2020, Japan has been working hard to develop and promote womens rugby, and this gold medal could not have come at a better time.
Japanese womens rugby has got a long history but we havent been achieving our big targets in for the last 10 to 15 years, Japan coach Kensuke Iwabuchi said.
Now that rugby is in the Olympics, weve really put a lot of effort into womens rugby, and the number of players has been growing for the last five years. With this gold medal, hopefully more Japanese girls are going to start playing.
Starved of possession, Japan defended magnificently for almost the entire match. Japan scored a converted try through Yume Hirano on a counterattack but was otherwise pinned inside its own territory and under constant pressure from a Chinese team that is also eyeing Olympic gold.
The Chinese rugby federation has hired coaches, strength conditioners, and video analysts from powerhouse New Zealand to set up new programs, and is committed to the long haul.
In terms of planning, infrastructure and sheer playing numbers, theres no reason why China cant be up there, although were under no illusions that its going to take a while, China coach Chad Shepherd said.
There are more girls playing than ever before and were putting structures in place to identify and develop the top players. The giant carrot of course is the Olympics.
Japans men found themselves on the losing side this time when they lost the final to Hong Kong 14-0. Salom Yiu and Alessandro Nardoni scored tries. Considered the spiritual home of rugby sevens, Hong Kong rarely wins international tournaments and lost two Asian Games finals to Japan before finally getting one over its greatest rival.
This is huge for Hong Kong rugby, coach Paul John said. In the last two Asian Games weve finished with silver and gone very, very close so its brilliant to finally get the gold.

Kalana under treatment at Ridiyagama
Kalana - the elephant of the Vishnu Devale in Devinuwara injured due to alleged neglect by its owners, was taken to the Ridiyagama Safari Garden under the Department of National Zoological Gardens yesterday for treatment.
Two persons were arrested for neglecting the elephant and they were released on a Rs. 100,000 surety bail each when they were produced before the Matara Magistrate.
Kalanas mahout and the Secretary to the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya Basnayake Nilame were arrested last Tuesday in this regard.
Kalana was allegedly chained at the same place in the Devinuwara Vishnu Devalaya for about three years. Its legs had been injured and infected.
The arrests were made following a Police complaint lodged by Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma and the Wildlife Department officials on Monday. The Deputy Minister intervened after environmentalists and social media activists told him the issue.
Veterinarians of the National Zoological Gardens Department are treating the elephant. They inspected the elephant on Saturday. The elephant was gifted to the Devalaya in 1989 by former President, the late Ranasinghe Premadasa.

Knowledge in wilderness
They are undergoing intense training in combat. They are being taught how to survive in a conflict situation, to outwit and overpower the enemy. They are being taught how to strategize. They have been taught how to move stealthily and think under pressure. In other words, they are being taught how to be brave and tough soldiers. These are educationists who are being trained in harsh conditions.
Daily News went on an army tour to Diyathalawa where one received first -hand experience what military training is like for these teachers.
The Officers of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) have been enlisted from the Sri Lanka Education Service, most of them, are teachers who work at government, semi-government and private schools. Some of the officers are principals as well as officers at the Education Administrative Service. These officers are performing an outstanding contribution towards cadetting, doing it voluntarily, in addition to classroom teaching assigned to them in schools.
These teachers do not do this for financial remuneration. They do it for the love of it. This is because they want to pass down what lessons they have learnt from the military. They do not weather the hardships in the hope of glamour or recognition. They are teachers who want to pass down knowledge and do society a service. They dont have to do it because joining the military service is not compulsory. They do it because they believe they have a duty towards society.
The Initial interviews for the enlistment of Probationary Officers for Probationary Officers Course Intake - 39 of National Cadet Corps were held from May 21 to May 25 at Head Quarters National Cadet Corps Pamankada. More than 200 teachers below 35 years of age in Government Schools around the country applied for this interview. Those who qualified from the first and second interviews and the medical test were selected for the Course.
Officers intake 39 of the NCC is currently under training in the forests of Diyathalawa. It comprises 59 Probationary Officers -46 males and 13 females. The vision of the Sri Lankan government is to make the officers, great visionary and exemplary human beings who can be the pillars of cadetting and society.
The Training course is a 45-day military course started on July 25, at Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force Training School, Diyathalawa with theoretical and practical knowledge in order to enrich them to be resourceful platoon commanders at schools. Upon completion of the course they will be attached to the school where they are teaching and after a one-year probationary period, they will be commissioned in the rank of 2nd Lieutenant with the recommendations of the respective battalion Commanding Officers.
Their role and task are to train cadets at schools with a view of attracting the youth towards cadetting, so youth can be charismatic personalities and forceful leaders in society with integrity and dedication. Cadetting is a field that has potential because of the discipline and spirit of courage it imparts in the youth.
At the Diyathalawa training camp, we saw how these teachers are toughened and how they are trained in tactics such as planning an attack or defensive tactics. Armed with blanks they charged down the hills with their war cries, armed to the teeth in camouflage, trained by their tough taskmasters who are senior officers in the army.
Daily News spoke to one trainee, an English Teacher of Mahinda Rajapaksa College Homagama Madara Umayangani to find out what her experience was like.
I have never experienced this before. It is totally new. This is a totally military environment. We were civilians before and it was very difficult to get oriented to this environment. Everything is new for us. The staff and the officers are very helpful to get us orientated to the environment. They have instructed us how to do the tasks properly. They taught us everything about the military, especially the discipline aspect because the army discipline comes first. Discipline was the first thing we learnt after coming here. Through discipline, we learnt so many things such as the operations taking place in the army. We learnt how to read maps and lay the ambush. We learnt how to camouflage ourselves. It was theoretical with a lot of emphasis on practical knowledge, said Umayangani.
Umayangani commented that the overall experience has been extremely valuable as they have learnt so much about the military part of life.
We have learnt about uniformity and how to work and behave as a team. It is a marvellous experience. All my fellow companions teach different subjects in different schools all over the country. We were selected to the national cadet corps after around two interviews and then we had a medical exam. Coming here was difficult because there were around 200 applicants and only 59 were selected for this course. I consider this a very valuable opportunity, explained Umayangani.
She also commented that the group activities have been challenging and new and that learning them has also been fun.
We need to use what the environment has given us such as when camouflaging ourselves. Everybody has been really enthusiastic and positive about the entire experience and the training course. We were taught how to ambush, kneel down and fire with the rifle, and this was a new thing since we have never touched a rifle before. We got this valuable opportunity to go to the snipers home area and fire with real bullets. It is a very rare chance for anyone in the world, pointed out Umayangani.
There is an idea in the present day government that leadership in the form of platoon commanders must be further strengthened at schools, stabilizing and improving cadetting so the good work can be continued. The status of the cadet infrastructure in Sri Lanka is commendable. There was a representation of Cadets from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives at the Centenary Hermann Loos Challenge Trophy in Rantambe last year.

Lanka could develop Blue Economy - Dr Amunugama
Lanka was capable of developing a Blue Economy opined Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, & Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage
Opening a new building at the Ocean University of Sri Lanka recently he said that, taking advantage of the countrys location as an island nation surrounded by the ocean, having no conflict with any other country about ownership and located adjacent to the most frequented sea-route in the world, Sri Lanka could develop a Blue economy.
The Minister who identified many economic activities associated with the sea, pointed out the many employment opportunities open to graduates of the Ocean University, including service in the merchant marine.
The minister referred to the international practice of registering ships in foreign countries under flags of convenience, for several business advantages, and mentioned the possibility of negotiating for the permitting of such ship registration in Sri Lanka, on condition of the employment of a minimum number of trained Sri Lankan personnel on each such ship.
Referring broadly to the countrys prevailing education system, the minister said a radical change in the system is called for urgently. The minister pointed out that the traditional school and university education is unable to produce the type of person required at the present day work place. He said that his Ministry has now taken up the task of creating an alternative system of education to produce the technically and vocationally qualified personnel required by the modern factory and the business place.
The minister said that he issued three directions as soon he assumed duties. The first was that the intake of students to all the training institutions under his ministry should be doubled.
The second was that the curricula in these institutions should be upgraded to international standards.
The third was that courses of training of minimal importance should be discarded for concentrating on courses with significant employment potential.
He said that he has also directed that English and IT should mandatory to all trainees. Dr.Amunugama pointed out that the knowledge of an international language is essential at a modern work place.
So was IT. Hitherto knowledge in these subjects was mostly confined to children of affluent families. However his desire is that all rural children and children from disadvantaged backgrounds acquire that knowledge, declared Dr. Amunugama.

Life saving diabetes test
The glucose tolerance test is the standard method for detecting diabetes. But our new study suggests a different test can identify the disease earlier than the glucose tolerance test.
Diabetes kills 3.4 million people worldwide each year, and the figure is expected to continue rising. It kills people through secondary diseases such as heart disease, stroke and kidney failure.
And the longer diabetes remains untreated, the greater the risk of developing these diseases, so early detection is vital.
Diabetes is detected when the body can no longer regulate blood sugar levels. Blood sugar is controlled by insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas. This hormone lowers blood glucose by making the bodys cells take it up, where it is stored or used for energy.
There are two major forms of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is an autoimmune disease where the body destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Type 2 is a progressive disease where the body first becomes resistant to insulin. Initially, the body makes more insulin to keep blood sugar levels in check, but the pancreas then wears out and blood glucose levels become dangerously high.
Fat as the new marker
In type 2 diabetes, the bodys cells become resistant to the effects of insulin before diabetes develops. This made us wonder whether we could detect earlier stages of the disease, when the body is insulin resistant but before the pancreas has worn out and blood glucose levels have increased. We focused on investigating how the body becomes unresponsive to insulin.
To do so, we considered fat, not glucose. Obesity is now established as the leading cause of type 2 diabetes. One of the main ways obesity is thought to cause diabetes is by body fat  adipose tissue  not working properly.
Healthy adipose tissue takes up the fat we consume and stores it until needed for fuel, such as at night when we sleep. When obese people eat a meal, their adipose tissue does not take up the fat. Instead, the fat is directed into other organs, such as the liver and muscle, where it causes insulin resistance.
Insulin acts as a signal and attaches to a receiver on the outside of cells, called the insulin receptor. The insulin receptor activates lots of other signals inside the muscles or liver that tells them what to do, such as: take up glucose. But when the cell is full of fat it muffles the signals. The fact cells dont respond to insulin makes them insulin resistant. The body tries to get around this by turning up the amount of insulin to make the cells take up the right amount of glucose, overcoming the effects of the fat.
Strong evidence
The concept faulty adipose tissue can cause insulin resistance and diabetes is strongly supported by evidence from people with lipodystrophy  a condition where the body lacks adipose tissue. People with this condition have severe insulin resistance and diabetes.
Importantly, the adipose tissue of obese people is also bad at releasing fat when they are asleep, meaning obese people have to use lots of glucose when they are sleeping, to provide energy. The test doctors use to diagnose diabetes is the glucose tolerance test. It is usually performed in the morning before people have eaten. The person is then given a drink containing glucose  sugar  and blood samples are taken over the next two hours.
People  and mice  are classed as having diabetes if they show high blood glucose levels during the test. But we suspected some obese people would pass the test because their adipose tissue does not release enough fat, and their body is primed to use glucose in fasted states, such as when they are asleep. Conversely, if we gave obese people a large meal, the fat they should store in adipose tissue would go to organs, such as muscle, and cause insulin resistance, causing them to have high blood glucose. independent

Literacy light focuses on fight for learning right!
International Literacy Day (ILD) will be celebrated on Saturday week, September 8 around the world . Its theme this year reads Literacy and skills development. Despite progress made, literacy challenges persist and at the same time the demands for skills required for work, evolve rapidly.
Literacy is probably the single-most important part of education. Without literacy, all other learning is impossible. Literacy involves using reading, writing, speaking, listening, and viewing to gain more knowledge.
Without the ability to learn any of these skills, there is absolutely no way to acquire more knowledge. Literacy is essential for learning. It is crucial that language arts teachers are not the only ones in the school stressing the importance of literacy. While the language arts teachers may be the only ones truly teaching literacy, it is the job of all educators to facilitate literacy learning. Literacy must come before any other learning can occur, and we cannot grow as a society without literacy.
This year, ILD explores and highlights integrated approaches that simultaneously can support the development of literacy and skills, to ultimately improve peoples life and work and contribute to equitable and sustainable societies.
The purpose of this observational day is not only to combat illiteracy but also to promote literacy as a tool that could empower individuals as well as whole communities. It is from these humble beginnings that International Literacy Day has bloomed into a tool that could help millions of people around the globe.
International Literacy Day serves to recognize the importance of literacy and acknowledge the need to create a globally literate community. Literacy refers to a person's ability to read or write, an ability that connects and empowers people, allowing them to communicate and interact with the world, and one that the United Nations considers to be a basic human right.
Today, approximately 16 percent of the world's population, two-thirds of which is female, is unable to read or write at a basic level in their native languages. Illiteracy in nearly all parts of the world has been linked to socio-economic issues such as poverty and demographic factors such as gender. As of 2016, about 775 million adults lack even the most basic, minimum literacy skills all over the world. Today one in five adults lack minimum literacy skills, with two-thirds of them being women. Some 67.4 million children throughout the world are not enrolled in school and miss out on basic fundamentals of education.
However, thanks to the efforts of UNESCO and World Literacy Day, more and more people are becoming literate and about 4 billion people are currently literate, as of now.
UNESCO states the importance of literacy on their website: Literacy is a human right, a tool of personal empowerment and a means for social and human development. Educational opportunities depend on literacy. Literacy is at the heart of basic education for all, and essential for eradicating poverty, reducing child mortality, curbing population growth, achieving gender equality and ensuring sustainable development, peace and democracy. A good quality basic education equips pupils with literacy skills for life and further learning; literate parents are more likely to send their children to school. Also literate people are better able to access continuing educational opportunities and literate societies are better geared to meet pressing development .
Literacy is the light that guides us all. In the simplest terms literacy can be defined as the ability of an individual to read and write in any language. It is extremely important for an individual to be literate in order to carry out a smooth livelihood and considering this in order to spread awareness about importance of education as well as literacy.
On this day every country prepares and carries out different kinds of expeditions and indulges in different kinds of international literacy day activities. The main motive of the world literacy day is to draw the attention of the individuals of different societies and communities of the world towards the importance of the literacy. The day mainly emphasizes the importance of literacy as well as the adult education to the people all over the globe. A lot of people today cant read or write their name and the reason behind this is illiteracy. Most of the countries of the world have an extremely low literacy rate despite the fact that world international literacy day has been commemorated every year.
Literacy is the ability to read, write, speak and listen in a way that lets us communicate effectively and make sense of the world. Lacking vital literacy skills holds a person back at every stage of their life. As a child they won't be able to succeed at school, as a young adult they will be locked out of the job market and as a parent they won't be able to support their own child's learning. This intergenerational cycle makes social mobility and a fairer society more difficult.
People with low literacy skills may not be able to read a book or newspaper, understand road signs or price labels, make sense of a bus or train timetable, fill out a form, read instructions on medicines or use the internet.
There is no doubt that literacy is a fundamental tool to achieve success and further career opportunities and on a whole improve the quality of life individual and communities they live in. Having the skills to communicate, read, and write is vital for social and economic development. It allows individuals to expand their knowledge and understanding of society. It also assists people to adjust to their environment.
Literacy is not simply the ability to read and write, but rather the ability to use these skills and communicate effectively. In modern society and our globalised world, literacy is far more diverse that simply reading a book and understanding what we have read.
Having a population with high literacy skills also helps a country as a whole and improves the ability of a nation to tackle different social challenges it faces. Countries with strong literacy skills generally have a better standard of health and outcomes for individuals. Highly literate populations and communities are in a far better position to deal governance in a highly diverse society.
Literacy is a fundamental human right and the basis for any individuals ability to learn. It is essential for social and human development and provides an individual the skills and empowers them to transform their lives, in turn, an improved standard of health and ability to earn a higher income.

Is literature dead
One evening not long ago, my fifteen-year-old son, Noah, told me that literature was dead. We were at the dinner table, discussing The Great Gatsby, which he was reading for a ninth-grade humanities class. Part of the class structure involved annotation, which Noah detested; it kept pulling him out of the story to stop every few lines and make a note, mark a citation, to demonstrate that hed been paying attention to what he read. It would be so much easier if theyd let me read it, he lamented, and listening to him, I couldnt help but recall my own classroom experiences, the endless scansion of poetry, the sentence diagramming, the excavation of metaphor and form.
I remembered reading, in junior high school, Lord of the Fliesa novel Noah had read (and loved) at summer camp, writing to me in a Facebook message that it was seriously messed upand thinking, as my teacher detailed the symbolic structure, finding hidden nuance in literally every sentence, that what she was saying was impossible. How, I wondered, could William Golding have seeded his narrative so consciously and still have managed to write How could he have kept track of it all Even then, I knew I wanted to be a writer, had begun to read with an eye toward how a book or story was built, and if this was what it took, this overriding sense of consciousness, then I would never be smart enough.
Storytelling flow
Now, I recognize this as one of the fallacies of teaching literature in the classroom, the need to seek a reckoning with everything, to imagine a framework, a rubric, in which each little piece makes sense. Literatureat least the literature to which I responddoesnt work that way; it is conscious, yes, but with room for serendipity, a delicate balance between craft and art.
This is why its often difficult for writers to talk about their process, because the connections, the flow of storytelling, remain mysterious even to them. I have to say that, for me, it evolved spontaneously. I didnt have any plan, Philip Roth once said of a scene in his 2006 novel Everyman, and if such a revelation can be frustrating to those who want to see the trick, the magic behind the magic, it is the only answer for a writer, who works for reasons that are, at their essence, the opposite of schematic: emotional, murky, not wholly identifiableat least, if the writings any good. That kind of writing, though, is difficult to teach, leaving us with scansion, annotation, all that sound and fury, a buzz of explication that obscures the elusive heartbeat of a book.
For Noah, I should say, this was not the issuenot on those terms, anyway. He merely wanted to finish the assignment so he could move on to something he preferred. As he is the first to admit, he is not a reader, which is to say that, unlike me, he does not frame the world through books. He reads when it moves him, but this is hardly constant; like many of his friends, his inner life is entwined within the circuits of his laptop, its electronic speed and hum.
He was unmoved by my argument that The Great Gatsby was a terrific book; yeah, yeah, yeah, his hooded eyes seemed to tell me, thats what you always say. He was unmoved by my vague noises about Fitzgerald and modernity, by the notion that among the peculiar tensions of reading the novel now, as opposed to when it first came out, is an inevitable double vision, which suggests both how much and how little the society has changed.

Living with an invisible pain
The piece toady brings to the centre a condition known as endometriosis which afflicts women relegated currently as a womans issue and one related to their health. For those affected it literally paralyses them. Syl suffers from endometriosis. Endometriosis (endo) currently has no known cause and no cure. It can cause severe pelvic pain and infertility. Back in 2013, Syl's university tutor, who also had endo, offered to mentor her through an honours thesis on coverage of endometriosis in the media.
Their web search for media mentions of endometriosis returned zero mentions of the disease in any major Australian media outlets over 10 years. The tutor withdrew her offer, saying Syl couldn't do a literature review with nothing to review.
Lobbying a pharma giant
Today, Sylvia, 27, is having a good day. She's able to sit upright on a chair opposite me and her mum, Lesley at their home in Sydney.
In the past, endo often left her unable to sit up, walk or even do up her jeans. Syl feels much better now partly thanks to effective excision surgery, daily self-management and Visanne - a drug designed to treat endo.
This medication is now available in Australia because Lesley and Sylvia took on pharmaceutical giant Bayer - and won.
Lesley discovered that Visanne was having success in treating endo-related pain overseas, but Bayer would not bring it to Australia and New Zealand. The marketing manager said I'd need to convince them there's a market for it here, she says.
Lesley started emailing her friends, but Syl thought there had to be a quicker way.
She shared her story on Change.org, asking people to sign their petition targeting Bayer. The signatures would prove the need.
In total, they got 74,064 signers. Though the medication does not work for everyone, the pair was thrilled. Lesley wrote to supporters online: Together, we've changed the mind of one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies.
From there they founded their own not-for-profit, EndoActive, which raises awareness, provides evidence-based information and advocates on behalf of the 700,000 women and girls with endo in Australia.
Me and my endometriosis
They convened Australia's first patient-centred endometriosis conference in 2015.
Women were in tears before they even walked through the doors, relieved they were finally being taken seriously, Lesley says. Many women are not believed or told painful periods are normal.
This awareness, along with work by others, helped bring about Australia's first National Action Plan for Endometriosis, launched last month.

Endo epidemic
[Endo] is a silent epidemic, hidden due to stigma, misunderstanding, and society's easy dismissal of the importance and severity of pain in women, says Dr. Susan Evans, a gynaecologist who is chair of the Pelvic Pain Foundation of Australia.
****
Endometriosis and pelvic pain
Dr. Evans says: Throughout the world, endometriosis and pelvic pain are under-recognised, under-researched, under-managed and under-supported. There's vast unmet human need in this area and change has been slow.
Gynaecology & Endometriosis Centre at Sri Jayewardenepura
The Medical Faculty of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura Gynaecology Endometriosis Centre (SAMAGE) was established at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital (Kalubowila Teaching Hospital) under the professorial unit in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Sri Jayewardenepura.
The SAMAGE centre will be a referral centre for all complex gynaecological problems with special interest in endometriosis. Dr. Dhammika Silva, Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist will be heading the Gynaecological team at Kalubowila.
****
Insane toll
It's estimated that one in 10 women have endo. It occurs when tissue similar to the womb lining grows outside it in other parts of the body (from reproductive organs up to the brain), in some cases strangling and gluing together other organs, causing excruciating pain.
It takes, on average, seven to 12 years to get diagnosed. Symptoms vary but can be devastating: many experience crippling pelvic pain, 30% have fertility problems, and 66% experience pain during sex. Syl would often turn up to work then vomit violently straight away. She was constantly fatigued. Two surgeries took months to recover from. Endo symptoms are so weird and so random you feel like you're going insane, she says. I still get anxious that people think I'm faking it.
The problem is endo is an invisible illness. The other day I had conjunctivitis Syl says. Everyone was saying you poor thing'. I thought, this is nothing! If only endo was this obvious.
Women have had to face such challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of endo, that Health Minister Greg Hunt made a national apology in December to recognise the pain and problems they've encountered in receiving adequate medical advice and treatment. Hearing that was so moving, Syl says.
Mr. Hunt recently made a A$4.7m (2.7m; $3.4m) commitment to the National Action Plan for Endometriosis and Syl now sits on the steering committee. Their first meeting will have many action points but debunking myths is high on Syl's list.
Like so many women, I was told by a doctor that getting pregnant would help my pain, she says.
I was 21, in agony and without a partner. I asked my best friend, who's gay, if he'd consider having a baby with me. Mum considered recruiting her friend's son. I'd never even met him. That's how desperate we were. Now we know pregnancy isn't a cure. We need to re-educate doctors as well as patients.
****
Frozen Pelvis
Dr. Silva speaking to some of the local media, he stated that there was a time when frozen Pelvis, a condition caused by severe endometriosis was inoperable. It was considered so because it involved even the ureters, bowel and nerves around it.
While Kalubowila Teaching Hospital has a centre for treatment. For the average Sri Lankan woman outside of Colombo who may well be suffering there may well be little assistance.
For couples or partners it must cause havoc leaving the woman sufferer high and dry with little or no recourse to advice or relief.
They would also be treated as freaks with unusual health problems with failing relationship issues.
The numbers would clearly overwhelm even Kalubowila if it were to be the only facility in the country. Would Sri Lanka like Australia consider a national focus

Maintaining your home garden
The elaborate and beautiful The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is perhaps one of the original models of edible landscaping. It is said to have been a creation of stupendous beauty with a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines. According to some sources the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled between 605 and 562 BC, built the Hanging Gardens, so we can place its existence in that time period. Though some cast doubt about its actual existence, it is a perfect example of mans desire for beautiful gardens.
People realized that in addition to growing crops that provided a nutritious, healthy and balanced diet they could also beautify their gardens by growing crops that provided this diet as well as make the garden attractive. However beautiful gardens continue to exist and are not confined to ancient times. From the 10 of the most beautiful from across the globe, Kenrokuen, Kanazawa, Japan is rated as one of the most beautiful and one of the finest examples of Japanese gardens. It was built over the course of 200 years. This shows how much precision and love has gone into designing this beautiful garden. Brooklyn Botanic Gardens is known for its 200 cherry trees. The cherry fruit is packed with full of health-benefiting nutrients and unique antioxidants. Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K. N. K. Jayathilake on edible landscaping and its benefits. There are obviously mental and emotional benefits in maintaining a beautiful home garden similar to mental and emotional benefits that you get from listening to music. There is immense satisfaction in maintaining a beautiful home garden that provides all of your needs. Of course there needs to be a certain plan when maintaining a home garden that provides nutrition and one that is pleasant to look at. There are so many features to a Home Garden  such as flower beds, pathways in the garden, ponds with or without fish and arches, said Jayathilake. Ornamental plants are known for their attractive leaves more than the flowers. The shape and colour of the leaves is very pleasing. So the idea here is dual purpose. Rambutang, Pineapple and Mango are three of the most popular fruits in Sri Lanka. In addition to being very nutritious the colours of red, yellow and green can really enhance the beauty of the home garden. Of course these fruit trees need plenty of sunlight and in addition to providing nutrition and beauty they provide shade which can be very soothing, explained Jayathilake. Bushes are another beautiful feature of the home garden. Bushes with all kinds of bright flowers can drive away any feeling of melancholy. However if we can grow Oranges, Lemon, Carambola (star fruit) and Pomegranate, we can have a garden that is a splash of beautiful colours. These bushes must also be grown in places with adequate sunlight. Aroma is also another factor we must consider. The sense of smell can instantly titillate the taste buds. Smelling fresh vegetables and fruits coupled with knowledge that it is home grown is very gratifying, added Jayathilake In small spaces it is a very good idea to grow creepers since they are vertical. Hanging creepers with flowers is also one way of making your home garden more interesting. Here you can grow Spinach and Wing bean creepers which is practical and healthy. Erosion can also be a problem in your home garden. You need to control the erosion. This can be controlled by cultivating cover crops. For this you can use leafy vegetables  Gotukola, Mukunuwenna and Aloe Vera. Sweet Potatoes are a beautiful shade of yellow and are nutritious, pointed out Jayathilake. Another way you can beautify your garden is through creating borders. For this you can use water ponds. Water is one of the most beautiful creations of nature. It is soothing and refreshing. Around pond borders you can grow Kan-Kung. If you are creating pathways in the garden you can grow on the borders - Cabbage, Radish, Chinese Cabbage, Dubai Rose and Mukunuwenna. It is a good idea to mix these plants with each other. Borders for the plant beds can consist of lettuce, leaf vegetables and radish, said Jayathilake.
In your home garden you need plenty of compost. If you want to have a healthy home garden you need plenty of rich compost. Crops grown with organic fertilizer are much tastier and healthier than crops grown with chemical fertilizer. The crops need necessary nutrition for growth and a quality harvest
It is also important to have a surplus. If you do not have a surplus when the stock of plants is over you will be left with a barren land. Always have a surplus of fruits and vegetables so when the present batch has been used up there will always be an extra crop. In addition to all of this there needs to be proper irrigation in the home garden. The plants need to be pruned so the garden will not look uncared for and wild. It has to be harvested at the proper time, said Jayathilake.

COMPOST
Compost is a natural fertilizer made from decomposed leaves and animal remains. Since urban home gardens are not located in a village setting, cow dung and waste from other farm animals like chickens will not be readily available. This is why we can use kitchen waste that will be composed of discarded vegetables. In an urban home gardens the material used is available in the home itself. Trees and bushes can be pruned and added to the barrel method or the live compost cone method. All this will cost you very little.
****
ADDED VALUE TO HOME GARDEN
What is the point of having an inanimate, dull and lifeless home garden It is boring! What is the point of a silent and desolate home garden You need to interact with your home garden! It needs to interact with you! There needs to be the sound of birds and bees! It has to be full of life! Animals (with the exception of pests) breathe life into the beauty! The butterflies, chirping of birds in the sunlight and shade, and the wind moving through the leaves, the natural coolness that the garden brings all bring value to the home garden and the movement of squirrels.

Major boost for Eastern tourism
Batticaloa and the adjoining areas which were devastated by war and the tsunami will gain a major economic transformation when internal air flights are started soon linking Colombo Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Sigiriya and Palali.
This will be a major boost to the tourist industry in particular, which will provide ample job opportunities and income avenues to the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said the Batticaloa airport has already been rehabilitated by the Civil Aviation Authority and talks are underway with two local companies for launching internal air flights.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting after opening the MJF Centre at Kalkudah on September 1.
The Prime Minister said Batticoloa and other areas in the East are now on the fast track of development through Information Technology to cater to the needs of educated youth belonging to all communities in the region.
The Prime Minister said Merryl J. Fernando of Dilmah fame had volunteered to help the Batticaloa district and improve the living standards of the people. Steps were being taken to help children with special needs launch Kadju cultivations, help small scale business ventures through the centre opened that day.
It was common to see areas are lagging begind in development. But, the government has decided to fast track development in those areas. Merryl Fernando and the M.J.F. Foundation had launched a special programme and we all should appreciate these endeavours, the Prime Minister said.
The government had paid special emphasis on the eastern Province by creating the Trincomalee Development Plan. Infrastructure facilities had been developed in the region steps had been taken to develop industries in the areas, he said.
The cashew crop derived from plantations in the area could be sold in the Batticaloa district itself at a profit in the region. The hotel school set up at the centre will provide training to youth in the area people would be able to earn an additional income by providing accommodation to tourists in their homes.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that eventhough he would like to implement the envisaged future development plan within a month or a year, it was a difficult task which would consume time. The government was aware of the difficulties faced by the people in the past few years. But, now the task has to go ahead to implement the plans which the government could not implement single handedly without the assistance of one and all.
The programme launched through the Dilmah Group was a farsighted one reaching the rural sector. It would provide assistance to every home. When such institutions initiate programmes of this nature, they could be included into the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme.

The petition which is available online has been initiated by media personality and former Consul General for Sri Lanka in Toronto, Bandula Jayasekara.
Dilum Alagiyawanne, who is a part of this endeavour, responding to the Daily News, said that they are hoping to collect as much signatures as possible before concluding the process in the next couple of weeks. He said that elephant and animal lovers, both local and global, have responded to this petition eagerly.
Alagiyawanne said that they are trying their best to get all eight elephants which are currently at the Dehiwela Zoo freed. We have many wild elephants in the country. So they need not be kept at the zoo as well. Therefore, if we can release these caged animals to a better place like Ridiyagama Safari Park, it would be a great step ahead, he added.

Prices of 23 drugs drop
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the government reduced the prices 23 pharmaceutical drugs including 10 expensive cancer drugs and some medical equipment, with effect from midnight on Saturday.
The gazette notification bringing the price reduction into effect was issued on midnight Friday, Minister Dr. Senaratne said, at the opening of the 39th Osu Sala of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation at the Peradeniya University premises on Saturday.
Accordingly, the tender prices of 10 expensive cancer drugs have been brought under control and the maximum retail prices of 13 selected drugs have been regulated. In addition, the maximum retail price of the blood glucose meter has also been regulated. The minister went onto say that the government spends around Rs. 4 billion annually for cancer drugs. However, the government has been able to save around Rs.2 billion by controlling tender prices.
While noting that some cancer drugs were very expensive, the minister said 95 per cent of cancer drug imports were undertaken by the government.
Most cancer patients and their families dont have the means to buy such expensive cancer drugs, he said.
The minister also said that the price of insulin used to treat diabetic patients has been brought down to Rs.1,200 from Rs. 1,760.
The blood glucose meter which was Rs. 5,260 is reduced to Rs. 2,750 and blood glucose test strips have been brought down from Rs. 90 to Rs. 60, he said.
The minister said the 13 selected drugs subjected to price reduction include antibiotics, drugs for neurological diseases, asthma, and epilepsy, drugs for diabetes including insulin, and drugs to control cholesterol.
The minister said the government spends around Rs. 7 billion annually for drug imports.
He recalled that the present government in October 2016 took steps to regulate the prices of 48 essential pharmaceutical drugs and as a result the prices of about 400 drugs sold under various brand names were reduced significantly.
With the latest effort, the minister said prices of 74 pharmaceutical drugs have been regulated and this means the prices of around 1,000 drugs sold under various brand names have come down.

Protest in Galaha over hospital closure
A large group of people held a protest in Galaha town yesterday demanding that authorities re-open the Galaha Hospital which was closed following a tense situation last Tuesday after the death of a child.
The people in Galaha complain that they are inconvenienced by the closure of the hospital as the next nearest government health facility is in Deltota, which is 10 kilometres from Galaha.
Last Tuesday, the Police Special Task Force and riot squads had to be deployed following a tense situation outside the Galaha Hospital. The situation arose following the death of an infant who had been admitted to the hospital for treatment.
An angry mob of close to 2,000 attacked the hospital forcing police to be deployed to provide security to the premises and the staff. The crowd alleged that the one-and-a-half-year-old child died following a delay in administering treatment at the hospital.

Safe to scoff
Many of us are scared to eat the food in our fridges when its out of date - but some foods actually last much longer than weve been led to believe.
You could unwittingly be wasting food by throwing it away for no reason as contrary to popular belief, not all foods have a definite expiry date. Here we reveal the ones you can keep long after the date on the label.
While some foods should always be chucked after their use by has passed, there are other guidelines you can take with a pinch of salt.
It is always wise to pay attention to the dates when it comes to meat, fish and seafood but plenty of other foods are perfectly fine to eat. Here are 18 foods you can safely eat past their use by date. From eggs to milk, here are their surprising findings.
Biscuits: Although your favourite snacks might lose some of their freshness once their best by date has passed, you can eat them for a few weeks after.
Dried pasta: While dry pasta usually comes with a long shelf life, you can push this to three years if it is stored in a cool, dry and airtight environment.
Canned goods: Most tinned food will come with a best before date that is years ahead, but adding on extra time wont hurt you. As long as your cans are undamaged and stored somewhere cool away from direct light, then they can last four around four years.
Bread: The use by date on bread assumes youve left it out in the kitchen you can extend this by up to two weeks by keeping your loaf in the fridge.
Pickles: Preserved foods such as pickles can last for up to two years past their use by date if theyre stored in an airtight container in the fridge  but they may start to lose some of their crunchiness.
Eggs: If you keep your eggs in the fridge, you can eat them up to three weeks after the use by date. But, beware of any unpleasant odour when you crack them  this means they should be chucked.
Chocolate: As long as your chocolate tastes ok, youre pretty much good to go. Sometimes a white film might form on older chocolate, which is caused by the sugar crystallising, but it wont harm you.
Hard cheese: Mould is unable to penetrate harder cheeses such as cheddar, so you can cut off any mould and it will be safe to eat.
Frozen vegetables: If your veg is kept frozen, in theory, it can last indefinitely.
Yoghurt: As long the yoghurt hasnt been opened, you can usually enjoy it for two weeks after the sell-by date.
Salad leaves: As long as your leaves havent gone mouldy, its perfectly safe to eat them past their use by.
Spirits: When taken care of properly, spirits such as whiskey can be kept open-endedly and the same goes for gin and vodka.
Milk: You may be worried about milk, but as long as it tastes and smells ok you can ignore the sell-by.
Soy sauce: Packed with salt, which acts a natural preservative. As long as you keep the bottle closed, soy sauce will remain usable and the condiment remains fresh for years after its unsealed.
Sugar: As long as sugar is stored in a cool container thats air-tight against moisture, it will last indefinitely.
Honey: Technically, honey doesnt go off as it is a natural antimicrobial, meaning it does not decay.
White rice: This refined grain has been packed with preservatives and packets that have not been opened, or grains that are sealed in an air-tight container, are unlikely to decay.
Vinegar: As vinegar is often used as a preservative, its shelf-life is indefinite.

Secrets hidden among plants
Gardening is hardly a straightforward practice  goodness knows it takes skills, dedication and more than a little luck to grow flowers and veggies. But while certain facts about gardens are perplexing, some are just plain fun, silly, or even mind-boggling.
1. A sunflower is not just one flower.
Both the fuzzy brown center and the classic yellow petals are actually 1,000  2,000 individual flowers, held together on a single stalk.
2. There are more microorganisms in one teaspoon of soil than there are people on earth.
It is alive! That fact might make you itchy, but microbes are important for keeping your soil full of nutrients.
3. Plants really do respond to sound.
Studies have shown vibration (like music, or perhaps even the sweet sound of your voice) can affect plant growth.
4. Butterflies might be more attracted to your weeds than your flowers.
Colorful blooms aren't the chief reason these insects love your garden  it's more about the fragrance and nectar. New cultivars of popular flowers have been bred for enhanced colour and size, but have often lost their fragrance in the process. Everyday weeds like dandelions and clovers might actually be the most appealing things in your yard to butterflies. Taking care to choose heirloom flower seeds can get them to also fly your way.
5. A little baking soda can help you grow sweeter tomatoes.
A regular sprinkling of this kitchen staple into your plant's soil can help reduce acidity, which sweetens up your crop.
6. Some of your favorite fruits are actually in the rose family.
Apples, pears, peaches, cherries, raspberries, strawberries, and more are rosaceae, making them cousins to the long-stemmed Valentine's Day variety.
7. The right orchid combination can smell like your favorite dessert.
Did you know that the vanilla bean comes from an orchid varietal And it's not the only sweet-smelling kind: "An oncidum hyrbrid called Sharry Baby smells like chocolate. The cymbidium Golden Elf smells lemony, and the phalaenopsis violacea has a cinnamon scent.
8. You don't need to be a dedicated composter to reap similar benefits.
Call it cheating, but applying used coffee grounds, eggshells, chopped-up banana peels, and other organic matter directly to your soil (no composting required) can offer plants nutrients as they decompose. For already-growing beds, scatter and bury the items within the first few inches of soil.

Sharapova lights up US Open again with win over Ostapenko
NEW YORK: Maria Sharapovas love affair with New York nights continued Saturday as the 2006 US Open champion swept past 10th-seeded Jelena Ostapenko and into the fourth round at Flushing Meadows.
Sharapova is now undefeated in 22 night matches at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.
Theres no doubt I feed off this energy, Sharapova said. We all spend so much time on the back courts with our teams practicing.
When you get a chance to come out here why not give everything that you have. After some shaky moments in her first two matches, Sharapova charged through the opening set, aided by 27 unforced errors from 2017 French Open champion Ostapenko.
Ostapenko cut that down in the second, but she couldnt halt five-time Grand Slam winner Sharapova, aiming to bounce back from a first-round loss at Wimbledon this year that was followed by injury withdrawals from tournaments in San Jose and Cincinnati.
Sharapova next faces Spains Carla Suarez Navarro, who ousted sixth-seeded Caroline Garcia of France 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4).

SL, Maldivian journalists share experiences
In the coming weeks the role of civil society and the role of the media in the Maldives will be more important than ever, regardless of the outcome of the election, said Phillipe Dickinson, Second Secretary at the British High Commission in Sri Lanka, addressing journalists from Sri Lanka and Maldives at a workshop in Colombo last Thursday.
The two-day workshop implemented by Internews and supported by the British High Commission in Sri Lanka was held to build a network between Maldivian and Sri Lankan journalists.
We are meeting here today on the International Day of the Disappeared. During the past 11 years more than 900 journalists have been killed for doing their job, Dickinson said. Sadly, the impunity rates for these crimes are shockingly high and 90 percent have gone unsolved.
Such incidents erode press freedom and deprive entire societies of important information.
In an era of fake news, social media trolls and foreign attempts to manipulate elections, the free and responsible press faces new challenges. Solidarity is really important to face these challenges by supporting each other and sharing your practical experiences, he said.
Journalists from the Maldives enlightened their local colleagues of the challenges they are facing, while their local counterparts including prominent journalists like former Sunday Observer Editor Lakshman Goonasekera, Sitha Ranjani of the Free Media Movement and Amantha Perera, together with civil society activists including Jehan Perera and PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi enlightened them of their experiences in the past few decades.

Smart for our own good
I enjoyed Michelle Deans Sharp: The women who made an art of having an opinion, but I have to admit that most of my enjoyment consisted of daydreaming about all the books I was going to read after I finished it. There is a whole literary subgenre now that trades in this sort of deferred pleasure  books with subtitles like My year of reading or Unpacking my library or One hundred books I read in the bathtub during my sabbatical in the south of France. When you read about someone working their way through their intended-to-impress reading list, it helps you to imagine that you too are capable of accomplishing such a feat. Often, these books involve either a man reading the Greek and Roman classics or a woman tackling the thick Victorian novels  canons both familiar and fusty enough to keep me from losing my mind with envy.
Not so in the case of Sharp. Dear God, what a sexy reading list Michelle Dean has put together. Never have I seen so clearly that my dream version of myself  the person I always assumed I would grow up to be  is a drily witty, slightly abrasive woman in a black turtleneck whose end table is stacked high with yellowed paperback copies of lesser-known works by Susan Sontag, Joan Didion and Hannah Arendt. If I were living my best life, I would spend my evenings at parties declaiming at length about the virtues of Arendts unfairly neglected biography of Rahel Varnhagen, and if any man dared insult me by bringing up Heidegger, I would put my cigarette out on his arm.
Literary women
Dean does an excellent job of moving swiftly through her list of writers, culling from these women who made an art of having an opinion quotations, jokes and arguments most likely to appeal to the literary women of 2018. Did you know that Rebecca West once called out H. G. Wells, for the sex obsession that lay clotted on [his novels] like cold white sauce only to shortly thereafter become his lover
I was also delighted to learn that, in her early twenties, Arendt liked to write long, dire predictions for herself in the third person, like this one: Most likely she will continue to pursue her life in idle experiments and a curiosity without rights or foundation, until finally the long and eagerly awaited end takes her unawares, putting an arbitrary stop to her useless activity. Dean, herself an accomplished book reviewer, has an eye for excellence in the reviews of others.
She notes how Malcolm Cowley, unlike most of the other critics of the time, was able to identify the strength of Mary McCarthys sexually explicit, wildly popular short story The Man in the Brooks Brothers Suit: Miss McCarthy has learned the difficult art of setting everything down as it might have happened, without telling a single self-protective lie. Could an author of autobiographical fiction receive a higher compliment than that Perhaps the finest moment in Sharp, though, is Dorothy Parkers parodic takedown of F. Scott Fitzgerald:
Polished sides
Rosalind rested her nineteen year-old elbows on her nineteen-year-old knees. All that you could see of her, above the polished sides of the nineteen-year-old bathtub, was her bobbed, curly hair and her disturbing gray eyes. A cigarette drooped lazily from the spoiled curves of her nineteen-year-old mouth.
Yes, Parker anticipated the recent, scathing Twitter thread Describe yourself like a male author would by almost a hundred years.
What Im saying is, this book lands right in my wheelhouse. I would go so far as to say that Sharp was written expressly for me (a former English major in her mid-thirties with such an over-romanticized view of the Intellectual Life that she accidentally spent more than a decade in graduate school), except that its actually dedicated to Every person whos ever been told, youre too smart for your own good. Unfortunately, no one has ever told me that  though Id certainly like to believe that people were thinking it. (I would also like to say that, after I read Sharp, I immediately went out and read the Rahel Varnhagen biography and formed my own sharp opinion on it; but in reality all I did was to add a bunch of titles to my Goodreads list and then ignore them in favour of my advance copy of the new Tana French.)
Now that a month has passed, I have finished exactly none of the books I thought Sharp was going to inspire me to read, inducing a more cynical mood. Sharp is not, in fact, a memoir about the experience of reading the work of twentieth-century female writers. It is a book about those women themselves, consisting of thumbnail profiles and quick critical assessments of Dorothy Parker, Rebecca West, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, Joan Didion, Nora Ephron, Renata Adler and Janet Malcolm, with excursions into the work of two others: Zora Neale Hurston and Lillian Hellman. Dean opens the book by announcing, I gathered the women in this book under the sign of a compliment that every one of them received in their lives: they were called sharp. Well, OK, but theres got to be more to it than that. My sense is that Dean originally planned to write about women who worked as cultural critics  reviewers of literature, drama and film  but that as she got swept up in her research, she expanded her definition of a critic so widely that the word no longer functioned as a useful criterion for inclusion, and so she was forced to cast about for another, without quite landing on one that satisfies.
Simple-mindedness
It feels as if the women on Deans list do have something important in common, but the precise nature of that something is surprisingly hard to pin down. They could not all be described, for one thing, as feminists: Sontag roared at Adrienne Rich about the simple-mindedness of feminism, having previously defended it, and Ephron felt uneasy about organized feminist efforts at the Democratic convention in 1972. Likewise, only some of these writers  Sontag and Arendt  were capital-I Intellectuals. Kael was a movie critic. McCarthy and Hurston were best known for their fiction. Adler is most famous for her reportage. The famously witty Nora Ephron, meanwhile, in addition to writing the screenplay for When Harry Met Sally and the gut-busting novel Heartburn, once wrote one hell of a parody of Ayn Rand:
Twenty-five years ago, Howard Roark laughed. Standing naked at the edge of a cliff, his face painted, his hair the colour of a bright orange rind, his body a composition of straight, clean lines and angles, each curve breaking into smooth, clean planes, Howard Roark laughed.
On the other hand, one suspects that some writers on the list (Arendt, for example) wouldnt know a good joke if it jumped up and bit them. Times Literary Supplement

South Korean Rugby Sevens team dash Sri Lankas medal hopes
Sri Lankas hopes of winning at least a bronze medal were dashed when South Korea scored a convincing 36-14 win in the third place decider of the Rugby Sevens at Palembang, Indonesia yesterday.
The South Koreans dominated the first half with tries from Chang Younghung, Kim Jeongmin and Jan Jeongmin which gave them a 19-0 lead at the breather. However the Lankans reduced the deficit after half time when Tharinda Ratwatte scored a try which he himself converted.
The South Koreans came back storming to score tries through Kim Hyunsoo (one) and Kim Jinhyok (two) to make it 36-7 before Sri Lankas Jason Dissanayake scored a try which was converted and the score read 36-14 at the final whistle.
Earlier Sri Lanka put up a gallant display against mighty Japan when they went down fighting 10-12. Sri Lanka got off to a flying start when Kavindu Perera scored a try in the very first minute of the match but Srinath Sooriyabandara missed the difficult conversion. The Japanese hit back through a brilliant try by H. Kosuke which levelled the scores.
The Lankans went ahead once again when skipper Sudarshana Muthuthanthri scored a superb try to make it 10-05 in favour of Sri Lanka. However Japan grabbed the lead when Katsuyuki Saki scored a brilliant try after running through virtually the entire Sri Lanka defence to score under the posts and the Japanese ran out winners by 12-10 much to the relief of their supporters.
Skipper Sudarshana Muthuthanthri said that the Sri Lanka Rugby Sevens team had high hopes of winning a Silver medal when we were leading 10-05 in the second half but we let the game slip out of our hands which resulted in us being relegated to the bronze medal decider against South Korea but we surrendered tamely to the South Koreans which dashed our medal hopes.
Lack of international exposure for our players was the reason for our defeats as both Japan and South Korea are regularly taking part in International competitions.
The Sri Lanka mens volleyball team finished in 13th place after beating Vietnam by three sets to nil in the 13th place decider. They won the first set 25-21, the second set 25-21 and final set 25-20.
Sri Lanka ended up without winning a single medal which is the fourth time it has happened with the earlier occasions being 1982 (New Delhi) 1986 (Seoul), and 2010 (Guangshu).

Sri Lanka attain second win over India 101-29
Sri Lanka Netball scored another century to convincing winners over rivals India, boasting a 101-29 score-line at the second day of the Asian Netball Championship in Singapore Yesterday.
The height of Tharjini Sivalingam was certainly a factor, as the 2.06m-tall Goal Shooter sunk in 51 goals from 57 attempts, with a 89% shooting percentage. Sri Lanka last won the tournament back in 2009, but will fancy their chances based on the form they have shown in the opening stages of the M1 Asian Netball Championships.
Sri Lanka scored the 25 points in the first quarter when Indian only scored eight points and also they secured the second quarter as well with 33-4 points. Last two quarters were concluded 20-7 and 22-10 respectively.
Sri Lanka coach Thilaka Jinadasa commented: We are very confident as all these years weve been doing well in the Asian Netball Championships. The advantage we have is that Tharjini is back on the team after four years, so we have a better chance of winning this year. We also have consistency  whoever I put on the court can play whatever we have practiced and we have a strong set up on court.
I think we need to work more on our defensive line. Its hard to do that against teams like India and Chinese Taipei, but when we play against an experienced team, it will be a different ball game.
Sri Lanka tops Group B with two wins out of two games after beating India 101-29. They are through to the Cup grouping (Group E).
Malaysia followed up their victory over Japan yesterday with a convincing 74-13 win over the Maldives. Despite a spirited start by the islanders, Malaysia pushed on strongly throughout the game and look to be a strong contender to retain their Asian Netball Championships crown from 2016. However, it was a below-average shooting percentage from the team, and will be a key focus for the team as they as they move towards the next round of games where they will meet rivals Singapore and Sri Lanka.
Singapore put in a strong performance to overwhelm an inexperienced Pakistan side in their second match of the M1 Asian Netball Championships, to take the win with a score line of 84-17.
In the final match of the day, Hong Kong ran out 65-38 winners against Thailand. With both a height and experience advantage, Hong Kong dominated the first two quarters of the match. Thailand closed the gap in the second half, narrowly losing the third (13-15) and fourth (914) quarters as Hong Kong slowed down but ultimately, it wasnt enough.
With Hong Kong just needing a win over the Philippines tomorrow to secure the top spot in their group, they will value the stern test they received today.
Day 3 of the M1 Asian Netball Championships will see India take on Chinese Taipei at 1pm, followed by Hong Kong matching up against Philippines. Japan will battle it out with Maldives at 5pm, and the final game will be between Brunei and Pakistan at 7pm.

STAX presents research on investment, lanka-singapore  FTA potential
To raise awareness on current and future investment potential in Sri Lanka, leading management consulting firm STAX delivered a presentation on the SL-SG FTA and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) dynamics and opportunities, at the recently concluded Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Business Council.
The meeting, which took place at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, was attended by the board of the SL-SG Business Council, together with representatives of companies maintaining business ties with Singapore.
Drawing on STAXs extensive research capabilities and experience operating in the Singaporean market, Manager, Firaz Markar presented an overall view of key challenges in investment, potential opportunities for investment and growth, and the significance of the SL-SG free trade agreement to council member companies.
Singapore and Sri Lanka continue to share significant cultural and economic affinities, and over the past year, this relationship has manifested in increasing trade. Today, Singapore ranks as Sri Lankas 8th largest trading partner, and at present, there are over 90 Singaporean businesses  including major multinationals  that operate in the country, generating approximately 241 million dollars in investment in 2017.
Many of these companies choose to invest in Sri Lanka to take advantage of regional and relationship-driven benefits. Sri Lanka has the benefit of positive relationships with some of the largest economies in the Asian region, as well as access to trade routes and markets. However, while FDI has been improving over the recent past, we still attract investments at a much lower rate and scale than its regional counterparts.
He further explained how most of Sri Lankas FDI had been generated through the telecommunication, manufacturing, and tourism sectors, while the IT sector had also shown improved potential with export growth of 18-19%.
Citing the results of a recent study carried out by STAX among foreign companies that have invested in Sri Lanka, he noted that the most pressing concerns for foreign investors remained a shortage of qualified labour, the high cost of setting up business, insufficient levels of productivity, and policy instability.
However, given the potential of Sri Lanka as a hub for regional trade, Firaz said that a positive conclusion to the SL-SG FTA would serve as a signal for other nations to also enter into similarly liberal agreements with Sri Lanka to take advantage of reductions in tariff lines, labour movement and government procurement.
Such a transformation would enable Sri Lanka to serve as a gateway for global firms to gain access and negotiate deals with the ASEAN bloc, potentially expanding the scope of Sri Lankas economy by several orders of magnitude.
Liberalization of labour movement is of course a complex issue, but if policies stipulate that companies that have invested and set up businesses may be allowed, within specific criteria, to have some movement of labour, the Sri Lankan economy as a whole will benefit strongly, Firaz said.
He advocated for the establishment of a clearly defined and articulated national value proposition across industries, moving forward. This is in parallel to financial incentives geared to sustainably attract capital into key industries keeping with a portfolio approach to FDI. Ideally, all this would be managed under a single umbrella organization tasked with setting and enforcing rules and guidelines.
In that regard, he noted that the 50% reduction in tariff lines - which will grow to 80% over the next 12-15 years - together with the first ever inclusion of government procurement will enable unprecedented opportunities for Sri Lankan businesses to compete for government contracts in Singapore. Similarly, it would incentivize Singaporean companies to engage in similar projects locally, enabling the country to benefit from the introduction of improved standards, international best practices and knowledge transfer opportunities.

Top Tomato Growing Tips
Growing tomatoes is often the impetus for starting a vegetable garden. Unfortunately, there are few vegetables that are prone to more problems than tomatoes. Start here with some time-tested tomato growing tips, to ensure your tomato bragging rights this year.
Dont crowd tomato seedlings
Tomato seedlings need strong, direct light. Unless you are growing them in a greenhouse, your best option is to use some type of artificial plant lighting, for 14 - 18 hours every day. When youre ready to plant them outside, choose the sunniest part of your vegetable garden to plant them in.
Tomato plants need to move and sway in the breeze, to develop strong stems. That happens naturally outdoors, but if you start to grow your seedlings inside, you will need to provide some type of air circulation.
Preheat the soil
Tomatoes love heat. They wont really start to grow until both the soil and air temperatures remain warm. You can speed things up in the soil by covering the planting area with black or red plastic a couple of weeks before you intend to plant. Those extra degrees of soil warmth will translate into earlier tomatoes.
Bury stems of tomato plants
Plant your tomato plants deeper than they come in the pot, all the way up to the top few leaves. When planted this way, tomatoes are able to develop roots all along their stems. And more roots will make for a stronger plant.
Mulch tomatoes after soil has warmed
If you are not going to leave plastic mulch on the soil, hold off on putting down mulch until after the ground has had a chance to warm up. While mulching does conserve water and prevents the soil and soil born diseases from splashing up on the plants.
Remove bottom leaves of tall plants
Once your tomato plants reach about 3 ft. tall, remove the leaves from the bottom 1 ft. of stem. These are the oldest leaves and they are usually the first leaves to develop fungus problems.
Pinch plants for more tomatoes
Pinch and remove suckers that develop in the crotch joint of two branches. They wont bear fruit and will take energy away from the rest of the plant.
Water deeply and regularly while the fruits are developing. Irregular watering leads to blossom end rot and cracking.
A lot of vegetable gardening is at the mercy of the weather, but sometimes we can help things along. There are two types of tomato plants. Determinate tomatoes reach a certain height and then set and ripen their fruit all at one time, making a large quantity available when youre ready to make a sauce.

Tottenhams Son avoids military duty with Asian Games gold
JAKARTA, Indonesia  Tottenham forward Son Heung-min will get to skip military service.
Son avoided the service obligation when South Korea defeated Japan 2-1 in the Asian Games soccer final on Saturday.
The South Korean government rewards holders of Asian Games gold medals and all Olympic medals with the exemption. Military service is compulsory for South Korean males, and Son would have faced at least 21 months of service and the loss of millions in income.
Son had a hand in both goals, and ran wildly around the field at the end, hugging teammates while hundreds of South Korea flags were whipped about in the stands.
He was thanked Tottenham for allowing him to play in Indonesia, where he captained South Korea.
I feel great, feel unbelievable, feel amazing, he said. With the match in extra time after 0-0 in regulation, Son got the break he wanted from teammate Lee Seung-woo.
In the 93rd minute, Son broke toward the middle and shuffled a pass to Lee, who drove the ball with his left foot into the top of the net. He immediately posed atop signage beside the field, celebrating his minute of glory.
South Korea clinched it eight minutes later on a leaping header inside the far post from Hwang Hee-chan. The 101st-minute goal prompted Son to embrace South Korea coach Kim Hak-bum on the sidelines.
Japans Ayase Ueda scored on a header with five minutes left to make it close.
South Korea had 65 percent of the possession in regulation time, and had a wide edge in shots, and shots on goal.
Son almost got the winning goal himself, but his shot just seconds into extra time sailed inches wide of the far post.
Saturday was the last full day of competition at the Asian Games with only one medal event on Sunday  mixed triathlon. The closing ceremony is also on Sunday.
China, Japan and South Korea  as always  dominated. But several other nations closed ground slowly, making the Big Three not quite as dominant.
China had 289 overall, with 132 gold, 92 silver and 65 bronze. Japan won 204 (74-56-74) and South Korea had 176 (49-57-70). They were followed in the gold-medal ranking order by: Indonesia (31), Uzbekistan (21), Iran (20) and Taiwan (17). India and Kazakhstan each had 15.
Japan came up short as South Korea won gold in baseball with a 3-0 victory. In the bronze medal game, Taiwan pummeled China 10-0.

Two EX-Presidents honour McCain as Trump plays golf
US: Two ex-Presidents from opposing parties united Saturday to honour US Senator John McCain, in a momentous funeral that championed his aspirations of political comity but also rebuked the tribalism and division trafficked by Donald Trump.
As millions tuned in to the nationally televised memorial attended by the breadth of Washington powerbrokers, Trump himself was notably absent -- leaving the capital to head to his golf club in Virginia just when eulogies to McCain were being delivered.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump has been criticised for playing golf and launching a Twitter rant about Canada during John McCains funeral.
Leading political figures, including three former Presidents - Barack Obama, George Bush and Bill Clinton - came together to pay tribute to the late senator from Arizona.
But the current US President, who was not invited to the memorial at the Washington National Cathedral, decided to head to a Virginia golf course.
Some Twitter users quickly urged Mr Trump to show some respect, asking him to stay off the platform while McCains funeral took place at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.
President Trump reportedly arrived at the golf course just as the funeral was getting underway.
And while Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama offered subtle swipes at the current commander in chief, McCains daughter Meghan used the words of Trumps campaign slogan to deliver a searing, unmistakable rebuke.
The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great, she said, to extended applause.
As Bush and Obama praised McCain for repeatedly placing country over party or self, the stunning contrast between the unifying ceremony under the neo-Gothic arches of Washington National Cathedral and an outcast Trump only highlighted the astonishing state of US politics.
Hailing his friend as an extraordinary man who embodied what is best in America, Obama said McCain, who battled fiercely but respectfully in the political arena, made us better presidents -- just as he made the Senate better, just as he made the country better. He was echoing similar sentiments expressed minutes earlier by Bush, who defeated McCain in a hard fought Republican primary battle in 2000, only to see that bitter rivalry melt away into a lasting friendship.
While Bush and Obama hail from different parties, their message Saturday was clear: US politics can and should rise to a higher level with the example set by McCain.
We never doubted the other mans sincerity or the other mans patriotism -- or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team, Obama said of his rough but respectful campaign battles with McCain.
So much of todays politics, our public discourse, can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult, he added.
Its a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. McCains final public ceremony before his private burial Sunday at the US Naval Academy in nearby Annapolis, Maryland highlighted the warrior politicians call for healing.
Perhaps above all John detested the abuse of power, could not abide bigots and swaggering despots, said Bush, as Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner sat in attendance.
Trumps Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly were also present.
But it was the gathering of heavyweights from both parties past and present that drew more attention, including Bill and Hillary Clinton; former vice presidents Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Joe Biden; and former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright and John Kerry.
International dignitaries were also in attendance. On the guest list provided by funeral organizers was President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine, where McCain helped support opposition to Russian aggression, and Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza.
McCain, who died last Saturday at age 81, has been lionized over the past week of emotional commemorations, including his congressional colleagues bestowing him the rare honor of lying in state in the US Capitol on Friday.
At the funeral, which McCain spent months organizing as he battled cancer, Meghan McCain delivered a tear-filled tribute to her father.
And while Trumps name was not mentioned during the ceremony, McCains daughter drew a clear and damning distinction between her father and Trumps combative politics.
We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness -- the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, she said, criticizing those who lived lives of comfort and privilege, while he suffered and served. Earlier Saturday, the flag-draped casket of McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam for more than five years, was taken by honor guard from the US Capitol and placed in a black hearse.
It stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to allow his widow Cindy McCain to lay a wreath honouring all who died in the conflict.
She had been stoic throughout days of commemorations for her husband, but on Saturday during opera singer Renee Flemings performance of the ballad Danny Boy, she lay her head on son Jacks shoulder and wept.
Today we lost our hero, our friend, our mentor, our father, our grandfather and our husband. Together we mourn and together we go on, she wrote on Twitter.
Aside from Trump, another notable figure not invited to the funeral was McCains 2008 running mate Sarah Palin, who became associated with the far-right movement that in some ways nurtured white identity politics. - AFP

Outgoing Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Samarasekera
Upholding the dignity of Parliament for two decades
Every time the Members of Parliament get to the middle of the House, he rushed to the podium where the Mace is kept to prevent the MPs from grabbing it. He has intervened on countless occasions to separate the MPs who were falling out with each other, and interestingly, he has removed about 10-15 MPs from the Chamber on the orders of the Chair, for misbehaving.
Privileged to have a ringside view of the main Chamber and be very much at the centre of the affairs of the House for more than two decades, outgoing Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekera spoke to the Daily News, recollecting his profound memories of Sri Lankas Parliament.
Anil Samarasekera, who retired on August 30 after 22 years of Parliamentary service, will take up his new role as a Consultant to Parliament from today (3). Samarasekera has been asked by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take up the affairs of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Communal and Religious Harmony, which will be appointed shortly.
That is what I have been assigned for the moment and more responsibilities will be given in the days to come. I am happy to extend my advice on security matters and any other related areas when Parliament needs such help, said Samarasekera, commenting on his new appointment.
Prior to joining Parliament as the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms on November 1, 1996, Samarasekera was a commissioned Naval officer and also received one years training with the Indian Navy.
There were only two ways to leave the Navy officially; either you have to contest in an election or you have to wear the robes. I preferred the first option and gave my nomination for a by-election, and then left the Navy. But the training I had in the Navy was of great help to me throughout my 12-year stint as the Serjeant-at-Arms, he recalled.
Samarasekera said that he was deeply honoured to work under incumbent Speaker Jayasuriya, adding that he considers it a rare privilege. He immensely admired the qualities and personality of Jayasuriya, and went onto state that he was the best Speaker that he had worked under.
Parliamentary scuffles
Samarasekera refreshed his memory to speak on a few interesting episodes that he had witnessed in the Chamber. He recalled that the in-House clash of MPs on June 8, 2004, where Ven. Akmeemana Dayaratana Thera and Ven. Kolonnawe Sri Sumangala Thera were attacked, was the worst incident that he had seen in the Chamber. A group of UPFA MPs, who were in the then ruling party, assaulted the two JHU monks and tried to obstruct the swearing in of new MP Ven. Akmeemana Thera. Both the monks were badly injured and hospitalised after the assault, he recollected.
There was a real brawl going on between the Government and the Opposition. Some went up to the Speakers chair and they were fighting even behind the Speakers chair. I had to rush to Speaker W. J. M. Lokubandara and hold his chair as otherwise he would have fallen, he said.
What we usually do is that we try to separate the two clashing parties, but we may not succeed all the time, he added, also recalling the recent incident where UNP backbencher Sandith Samarasinghe had to be hospitalised after an in-House free-for-all. At the end of the row which broke out when Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka took the floor on May 3, 2016, MP Prasanna Ranaweera and Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma were suspended from Parliament for one week by the Speaker for their unruly behaviour. The retiring Serjeant-at-Arms remembers this incident as one of the worst brawls in recent times in Parliament.
Lost in his overwhelming memories, Samarasekera went on to add, There have been many instances where the MPs stormed the well of the House, displayed banners and posters or various other items not allowed in the Chamber or hurled various objects at each other. There have been times that MPs battles of words ended up in exchanging fisticuffs.
Asked whether physical strength mattered in his job, Samarasekera laughed and said, Physical strength mattered to hold onto the Mace at times of chaos when MPs tried to run away with it.
Dancing with the Mace
The Serjeant-at-Arms is the custodian of the Mace which symbolises the authority of Parliament. The Mace is composed of a staff of ebony with ornamentation in silver, 18-carat gold and blue sapphires. It is a gift from the British House of Commons. It was valued 2,500 sterling pounds in 1949. It weighs 28 pounds and measures 48 inches in length, said Samarasekera who carried the Mace at the commencement and the end of each days sittings.
He recalled there have been ample times when the MPs tried to grab the Mace and run to obstruct the proceedings. One such incident he remembered well was how JVP Trincomalee District MP Jayantha Wijesekera ran off with the Mace on February 22, 2007. This was following a speech by then JVP Parliamentary Group Leader Wimal Weerawansa (Weerawansa defected from the JVP in 2008) on the Ceasefire Agreement between the Government and the LTTE.
I went and spoke to MP Weerawansa asking his intervention to get the Mace back. He asked me not to worry stating that MP Wijesekera will soon return the Mace as he cannot hold it for a long time. As said, the MP handed over the Mace within about 5-10 minutes. The House resumed with the Mace in its rightful place following a 10-minute suspension, he reminisced.
He also recalled that MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage ran off with the Mace on the day that two monks were attacked in Parliament. MP Aluthgamage was dancing with the Mace in the members lobby. With much effort, we managed to get the Mace back after about 35-45 minutes, he said.
Samarasekera also called to mind how late MP T. Maheswaran ran away with the Mace on December 4, 2004, while his UNP colleagues were demonstrating demanding the suspension of Parliament until former Minister S.B. Dissanayake (a UNP MP at the time) was released from jail. This was soon after the Supreme Court convicted MP Dissanayake for contempt of court for a speech he made. The Mace was slightly damaged as a result of that incident, he explained.
Another unforgettable incident is how the Opposition members sneaked a mini-coffin into the main Chamber. They had assembled the coffin at the members wash rooms. Therefore the Parliament security personnel could not detect it during the routine checks at the entrance, he remarked. He was referring to the mock funeral procession enacted in the Chamber on June 19, 2003, by the PA and JVP members including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa (the then Opposition Leader) and former Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne (a senior SLFP member at the time) in protest of political killings. Joseph Michael Perera was the Speaker at that time.
Infamous peduru party
Refreshing his memories on the day the Joint Opposition staged an all-night demonstration on the floor of the main Chamber, Samarasekera said, My Deputy, Assistant, a few other Parliamentary service assistants and I were up throughout the night. From time to time we went in trying to negotiate with them to leave the Chamber but none of them wanted to do so, he said.
This was on April 20, 2015, barely three months after the election defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Joint Opposition staged the protest against summoning the former President to the Bribery Commission to record a statement.
Altogether there were about 20 MPs inside and they stayed until about 5 am in the morning. Some MPs were sleeping, some were seated, some were even reciting gathas and preaching Buddhism and some were meditating. We didnt provide them any food, but on and off they walked out and came back, he narrated.
The outgoing Serjeant-at-Arms said that within his tenure, he had asked about 10 MPs to leave the main Chamber as their dress did not match the approved dress code. He further said that there were about 10-15 incidents where he was asked to remove the MPs for disobeying or disregarding the authority of the Chair, for deliberately interrupting the proceedings, or violating Parliamentary Standing Orders.
In such instances, the Speaker has to pass a motion with the consent of the House. Most members did obey and walk out when I spoke to them, but in the most recent case of MP Dinesh Gunawardena, he refused to go. That is why the Parliament Police had to be called in, he said.
The list of MPs he was asked to remove also includes seniors like former Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne and MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara.
Candlelight session
Samarasekera said that he would never forget the day that Parliament conducted a brief sitting while the whole area was inundated due to flood water. This was on November 11, 2010, when the heaviest rains in 18 years submerged the Parliament building. There was about six inches or more of water in the Ground Floor. When I went to my office to get dressed, I saw my shoes floating in the water in the changing room. I had to wear the wet shoes, he said.
Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa took a boat to enter Parliament. The MPs and Parliamentary staff came in armoured personnel carriers. We got the services of the Army and the Navy. We had to turn off the power because the area where the transformer was, was also flooded, said the retiring Serjeant-at-Arms, who among his many other duties, also had the duty of providing a safe and secure environment in the Parliament Complex.
We had a brief session with candlelight. Another exception on that day was that all Hansard reporters were seated inside the Chamber, because they could not hear as there was no power, he added.
Ceremonial farewell
He has no doubt been listening to many Parliamentary speeches while in his seat next to the main door of the Chamber. When asked to name the Parliamentarians he liked to listen to the most, he said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe comes in the first place on that list.
The other Parliamentarians he mentioned were Rauff Hakeem, Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Dinesh Gunawardena, R. Sampanthan, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Thalatha Athukorala, Gayantha Karunathilake and incumbent Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri.
Asked as to how he compares the dignity and decorum of the House during the 22 long years he witnessed Parliamentary proceedings, he remained non-committal.
When asked what qualities a Serjeant-at-Arms should have, he observed that the person holding that position must be impartial, intelligent and loyal to the superiors.
On August 24 Parliament accorded a ceremonial farewell to Samarasekera. Members from both the Government and Opposition took the floor to appreciate him for a job well done. During the Vote of Appreciation, Minister Rauff Hakeem lauded Samarasekera for truly living up to the motto Disce Aut Discede (Learn or Depart), observing that both of them share the same alma mater - Royal College, Colombo.
Samarasekera was the fifth to wear the mantle of Serjeant-at-Arms after M. Ismail, J.R. de Silva, Ronnie Abeysinghe and Wijaya Palliyaguruge. On his last day in the post, Samarasekera officially handed over the Mace and sword, which were traditionally under his custody, to his successor Narendra Fernando.

Vigneswaran hints at forming political party
Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran has hinted at forming a new political party at an event organised by the Tamil Peoples Alliance (TPA) at the Kandar Madam area recently.
He has said a new peoples movement devoid of party politics is needed to make a revolutionary change in the country. Vigneswaran has said that such movements have made significant social, political changes in other countries and it is time that such a peoples movement begins in Sri Lanka.
Vigneswaran has said he is open for public opinion on forming a people-oriented political movement. He has said the Tamil Peoples Alliance has the power of the people for such an endeavour and he is seeking the opinion of the TPA on forming a movement.
The Chief Minister has told that he has several options in politics. I would have to retire from politics or I should join another political party, or I should form a new political party or else create a peoples movement.
Vigneswaran has said that continuing a newly political party is a great challenge.
TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran has said Vigneswaran is under serious mental pressure, so he is not communicating his ideas correctly. Sumanthiran has said that initially Vigneswaran has spoken of three options he had, but later on, he has put four. Sumanthiran has said the TNA is not responsible for the mental stress that the Chief Minister is undergoing.
MP Sumanthiran has made several observations on the new constitution. He has said a new constitution is a fundamental necessity and the Sinhala majority should accept it.
All the problems of Tamil people will not be solved by a new Constitution, but a new Constitution is fundamental. Without this, no issue can be addressed, Sumanthiran said at an event in Galle on Constitutional Reforms.
In a country with a permanent majority, it is important to share powers of governance in such a way that all people have equal citizenship rights. Sri Lankas Sinhala majority acknowledges injustice of simple majoritarian rule and clamour for reform and justice for other people, he said.

We understand our situation of not winning a single medal - Sports Minister Faizer Mustapha
Sports Minister Faizer Mustapha said that despite high hopes of winning medals at the just concluded 18th Asian Games held in Jakarta, Indonesia, it was disappointing that our sportsmen and sportswomen failed to perform as expected.
The Minister also said that there are shortcomings regarding sports in Sri Lanka and that there is a difference of opinion that various sports associations and sports clubs have.
I think were really disappointed about not being able to win a medal. But, we know our situation. We need to think how we are going to go from here. We have to accept that there are some shortcomings in our system,  the Minister said.
I spoke with the Minister of Sports in Indonesia. He agreed to provide our players the opportunity to practice in order to improve the knowlege and improve the overall experience of our athletes. I think our biggest problem is that our sports associations have difference of opinion. This causes various problems and divisions amongst our sportsmen,sportswomen and coaches, Minister Mustapha said.
The Minister said that sports law has been violated and that he will make tough decisions to give the pride of place to sports.
Our sports law is being violated and no one takes the necessary action regarding this matter. Coaches should not head any sports association. But, at a glance, there are a number of coaches who hold high office in sports associations. That is why I made an announcement to the media that I would take action in this regard. We have a big shortfall, the Minister said.
Approximately 170 athletes participated at this years Asian Games and there are allgations and accusations that certain sportsmen below par had been included for such an event. The Minister said that he was of the opinion that sportsmen and sportswomen who are capable of winning medals should be sent to inportant sporting events like the Asian Games.
But, a majority of officials in the National Olympic Committee were of the view that athletes should be given an opportunity to gain experience, the Minister said.
The Army Commander and myself who appointed the chairman of the Selection Committee are new. Its a new experience for the both of us.
My argument was that we should have sent a smaller contingent of sportsmen and sportswomen who could compete at international level. That is why I set a 25 million rupee limit.
But the majority of the view was that if our players had international experience, they would have the courage and strength to gain more success.
I have been in the Rs. 25 Million plus limit as my policy is that the best sportsmen of players should be sent to compete abroad, the Minister said.
The Minister said the most talented sportsmen and women in our country had participated at the Asian Games so that the country would have stood a good chance of winning a few medals.
We have limited resources. I sought Cabinet approval to provide adequate funds and facilities to provide our athletes a good training. Sports federations, the National Olympic Committee, our Secretary to the Ministry and the Secretary of State can act according to the countrys requirements. There are shortcomings.
There are questions. However, our aim is to encourage our athletes and players, the Minister said.
We are working on seeking the services of Susanthika Jayasinghe as an advisor in the future, Minister Mustapha said.
The parents of the athletes should not only think of their children but the country in general, he said.

World Dive Chess Championships
Chess players showed off their skills - as well as their lung capacities - at the World Dive Chess Championships in London.
The underwater chess tournament, which took place Saturday in London, featured players taking turns diving underwater to make their moves on a chess board submerged in a pool. The rules require a player to make a move before coming up for air, and the next player must then go underwater until they have made a response move.
Organizers said the aquatic twist makes the ancient game of chess more challenging and faster-paced. UPI
