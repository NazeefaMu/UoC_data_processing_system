Angkor Wat earns Over $43 m from ticket sales
CAMBODIA: Revenue from ticket sales at Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat temple has reached $43.3 million in the first nine months of 2015, up 0.24 per cent year-on-year, an official statement said.
From January to September this year, the ancient site received 1.52 million tourists, an increase of 1.8 per cent over the same period last year, said the statement released by the state-run Apsara Authority, which manages the ancient Hindu-temple site.
Three largest sources of foreign tourists to the temple were from China, South Korea and Japan, Xinhua news agency reported.
Angkor Wat temple, inscribed on Unesco's World Heritage List in 1992, is Cambodia's most popular tourist destination. It is located in Siem Reap province, some 315 km northwest of capital Phnom Penh.
Entrance fee to the site is $20 each day for a foreigner, $40 for a three-day visit and $60 for a week-long visit. - IANS

Asian jumbos play key role in spreading green cover
INDIA: Asian elephants play a vital role in the ecology of the forest and help spread green cover because of their eating and movement pattern, says a study by the researchers of the Indian Institute of Science and Princeton University.
The researchers studied the eating and movement pattern of the domestic cattle, buffaloes and pachyderms as they are the ones who often venture inside the core of the forest and also travel a significant distance daily. More importantly, these species are herbivores.
They also chose the Buxa Tiger Reserve for their research. The core area of the reserve consists of native vegetation, surrounded by areas consisting of plantations and degraded forest tracts. According to a 2003 estimate, there are 217 elephants in Buxa.
In the study conducted by Nitin Sekar and Chia-Lo Lee from Princeton University and Prof Raman Sukumar from the IISc over three fruiting seasons (2010-2012), the researchers chose three species of plants for their study: Dillenia indica (the elephant apple), Artocarpus chaplasha (the chaplash) and Careya arborea (wild guava). These are mostly eaten by the cattle, buffaloes and elephants.
"It is well known that elephants can swallow very large seeds and excrete them undigested. Sometimes, seeds that pass through the elephant gut germinate better than those that are taken directly from the tree. Elephants are also able to disperse seeds far and wide due to the fact that they tend to cover several kms every day," the research paper said.
In the fruit trees chosen by the researchers, they found that the elephant apple produces relatively hard fruit that are about 430 gm in weight.
Because the hardness of the elephant-apple fruit, it makes pachyderms its predominant consumer. Chaplasha and wild guava trees produce softer fruits, which are easy for smaller fruit-eating species to handle.
The researchers conducted several feeding trials in order to observe how much of each species of fruit passed through each of the three animals' (cattle, buffaloes and elephants) guts, as well as the time spent in the gut.

The Boundary-breakers in the Catholic Church
Practically all the Religious Congregations in the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka emphasise the mystical dimension and are involved in charitable works in Sri Lanka. Integration of the prophetic dimension and commitment to social justice and eco-justice is not much visible publicly in these Congregations. However, there are a few individuals within these Congregations who are committed to the prophetic ministry because they possess an integrated biblical spirituality.
They reach out to the unreached, touch the untouched and try to create awareness about human dignity, promote socio-economic development, bring social esteem and facilitate social integration. In the words of Pope Blessed Paul V1, "they are enterprising and their apostolate is often marked by an originality, by a genius that demands admiration. Often they are found at the outposts of the mission, and they take the greatest of risks for their health and their lives" (E.N 69).
There are people within the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka and in the larger society who feel oppressed, victimized and helpless. They are struggling to survive as human beings with dignity due to poverty. There are groups that suffer social exclusion because they are prevented in some regions / dioceses in Sri Lanka from experiencing social equality due to caste system and poverty. Sr. Sandra Schneiders, IHM, professor of New Testament Studies and Christian Spirituality at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, California asks: "Are Religious a general ecclesiastical "work force" to be deployed by the hierarchy according to institutional needs or are they called to respond to particular, actual challenges in a variety of particular places and settings among particular groups and people of all kinds (some of whom are rejected by the religious institution itself) whose needs cry out for ministerial attention The theology of "charism" in relation to Religious life itself and the variety of Congregations, suggests the latter."
What is our perception Are the Religious as Consecrated persons and Congregations as collective Bodies in Sri Lanka giving social significance and legitimation to dehumanizing systems and situations by their silence, past-oriented directives or other external factors Or are the individual Religious as Spirit-filled persons and their Congregations in Sri Lanka very attentive and responsive to the above-mentioned painful oppressive situations not only as individuals but also inter-Congregationally Or are
they waiting for natural and people-made disasters to happen for such collaborative efforts Pope Francis in his Apostolic Letter on the occasion of the Year of Consecrated life says: "I also hope for a growth in communion between the members of different Institutes.....This would make for a more effective prophetic witness."
Jesus, the Boundary-breaking prophet
One of the most striking prophetic symbolic actions of Jesus was crossing social and religious boundaries by his open table fellowship with the excluded ones by subverting the purity laws of Israel. Jesus who was Spirit-filled was a boundary-breaking prophet.
He broke the Sabbath in order to help the people in need (e.g, Mk 3: 1-6 Let us remember God of Exodus through His Word and Spirit is present in a special way where life is threatened and de-humanised and asks people to choose life (Deut. 30:19).
He continues to rescue people from oppression and leads them to freedom and fuller life by the instrumentality of "new Moses" who respond to Him.
The prophetic ministry of the Religious (men and women)in the Catholic Church embodies three dimensions, namely the call to resist through non-violent means the evil of victimization of people by oppressive forces and systems, the promotion of human dignity and the empowerment of the poor so that they can experience unity, social equality and also abundant life.

KONDAYAS BROTHER REVEALS ALL
Confesses to the murder of little Seya
Kondaya re-remanded pending DNA report
Kotadeniyawa group corr
Minuwangoda Chief Magistrate D.A. Ruwanpathirana yesterday re-remanded Dunesh Priyashantha alias Kondaya, the main suspect in the Seya Sadewmi rape and murder until October 19 pending his DNA investigation report.
The second suspect, I.P.Saman Jayatilleke produced in Court by the CID yesterday was ordered to be produced before the Gintec Institute, Borella on October 6 for a DNA investigation and report by the prison authorities.
Police had strengthened security in the Court premises when the case was called yesterday. Jayatilleke was brought to Court under stringent security by the CID while the main suspect was produced by the prison authorities themselves.
The second suspect beingbrought to Court
Inspector Ravindra Wimalasena making submissions in Court on behalf of the CID said the IGP entrusted investigations into this case to the CID on September 16. He said: When investigations were made about the main suspect reported to be hiding in Ingammaruwa in Akarangaha it was revealed that the suspect had fled to Bemmulla, Gampaha. Thereafter, the main suspect was apprehended with the support of residents. There was information about crimes committed by the main suspects brother on earlier occasions. When a statement was obtained from him he alleged that the crime was committed by the first (main suspect).
Inspector Wimalasena said since the two statements submitted corroborate which each others, steps were taken to call for a DNA report on the first suspect. He said since the DNA report has not been received, he moved Court to re-remand the first suspect. Inspector Wimalasena said the second suspect was released after recording a statement from him.
This was a crime against the entire society rather than a single family. He would therefore expect all parties to perform their duties in a responsible manner. Attorney Asela Rekewa assisted by Dilan N. de Silva and Nivon Gamage watched the interests of the aggrieved party.
As revealed in the Daily News yesterday, Saman Jayalath, the elder brother of Dunesh Priyashantha alias Konadaya had confessed to the murder of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi of Kotadeniyawa, the CID informed courts.
Dunesh Priyashantha alias Konadaya had earlier confessed to the rape and murder of Seya.
However later Priyashantha had told the CID that it was his brother who had committed the crime.
Kondaya had told the CID that he had confessed to the crime as his brother had forced him to do so.
Kondaya has said that he had confessed out of fear for his elder brother.
With the latest revelation of Priyashantha, the CID arrested Jayalath on Saturday. Following the arrest the Court allowed the CID to detain the suspect for 72 hours and interrogate him.
According to the CID, the suspect had entered the house with the intention of raping Seya Sadewmis mother whom he barely knew. When I entered their house that night through an open window, I saw Seyas mother watching TV. I waited till she switched off the lights, the suspect had said.
He had confessed to the Police that his intentions changed when he saw five-year- old Seya who was lying in the bed with her mother and other siblings.
Instead of harming her mother, the suspect had kidnapped the child with the intention of raping her. According to his confession, the suspect had carried the girl in his arms and raped her in a paddy field close to her house.
When the girl began to shout, the suspect had strangled her neck with the t-shirt she was wearing,the CID said.
The suspect had admitted that he raped the girl several times, even after strangling her.
Then he had thrown the body of the five-year-old old girl into the jungle.
The suspect, Jayalath gave a two- hour long separate statement to the Magistrate in the latters office room last afternoon.
Meanwhile, sources said that there are some discrepancies related to the technical evidence, including medical reports, presented in relation to the case against Priyashantha alias Kondaya.
Police also said Kondayas elder brother had described in detail how he had committed the crime.
Earlier Priyashantha too had given details to the CID officers on how he had allegedly committed the crime.
The Police said there are some contradictions in the confessions made by the two brothers.
The Police earlier arrested two other suspects - a 17-year-old school student and a 33-year-old man - in connection with the crime. They were later released after the CID informed courts that their DNA tests did not match the samples with those obtained from Seyas body.
Meanwhile, the Minuwangoda Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered to conduct a DNA test on the suspects. They were also remanded till October 19.

Cooking up a storm!
Paul Bocuse is an Icon in the Culinary World. He is highly respected and his cuisine has set new standards. In January 1987, Paul Bocuse created the Bocuse dOr, a revolutionary gastronomy contest, giving young chefs a unique opportunity to demonstrate their skills, offering them a tremendous springboard for their careers. From one competition to the next, its international influence has grown constantly.
The idea: to bring together 24 young chefs from all over the world, among the most promising talents of their generation, and have them prepare amazing dishes within an allotted time period, live in front of an enthusiastic audience. To decide between them: a jury composed of the most illustrious chefs of the planet. Beyond a mere cooking contest, the Bocuse dOr is a show that draws extraordinary media coverage. Many talented chefs have made a name for themselves thanks to the contest. Along with the successive creation of contests in Latin America, Asia and Europe etc. Bocuse dOr has become a showcase revealing outstanding talents and gastronomic trends from all over the world.
Beyond the competition itself, the Bocuse dOr has created its own family: a global network of chefs, future celebrities and famous cooks, and partner companies. They all share the same values of creativity, rigor and innovation, are committed to passing on their skills and have a passion for fine food and Art de Vivre. The ixsth Edition of the Competition to select the Asian finalists will take place in the Asia Pacific Region in April 2016. 24 countries will participate and the top four countries will be invited to the 17th Global Final in Lyon, France in January 2017.

Spearheading the Bocuse d Or Sri Lankan chapter is the culinary guru himself Rohan Fernandopulle together with an executive committee of some of the most renowned chefs in Sri Lanka: Dhaithya Krawage, Chandrasiri Sudusinghe, Kithsiri De Silva, Alan Palmer and Buddhika Samarasekera.
Leading the frontier with such extraordinary strength within the culinary industry, team Sri Lanka participated at the Asia Pacific finals in Shanghai and was short of one mark, to be selected to participate in Lyon 2015. At the competition held in 2013, team Sri Lanka was selected to participate at the World Finals in Lyon, France, after being placed amongst the top four at the Asia Pacific competition.
This years competition will be conducted by Bocuse d Or Sri Lanka together with Sri Lanka tourism and CHSGA.

Crocodile captured in combined operation
The joint operation to capture the crocodile
The crocodile that was observed in the sea off Dehiwala, Wellawatte over the past few weeks was caught in hours in an operation launched by the Wildlife officials, with the assistance of the Police, Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Conservation Department, in the sea off Galle Face yesterday.
The crocodile which is estimated to be around 8 feet in length was spotted in the sea off Galle Face last week, but, officials did not succeed in catching it due to inclement weather. The wildlife officials believes that the crocodile may be around 8 years old. According to a Wildlife Department spokesman, the crocodile was taken to the Ape Gama premises where food can be supplied to it.
We hope to keep the crocodile at the Ape Gama premises for a few days temporarily under our observation, she said.
She said the crocodile would be released to a national park or a forest reserve later.
She requested the public to inform the Wildlife Department if a crocodile is spotted in the beach or sea off the land.
A 17 foot saltwater crocodile was sighted roaming in the sea off Mount Lavinia, Dehiwala and Kollupitiya recently. It was found dead on September 23 despite several attempts made by Wildlife officials to rescue it.

Elders, an asset and not a burden
In Sri Lanka persons aged 60 years of age and above are called elderly.
Increasing elderly population has become a global trend including Sri Lanka.
In 1971 Sri Lankan elderly population was 6.3% of the total population and in 1981 it was increased up to 6.6%. Today it has become more than 12% and it is expected to be 20.7% by the year 2031.
When considering the population structure those who are completing 75 years of age and more are called old-old category. In our set up old old category of elderly persons are increasing with the time. According to the country statistics in 1971 old old category represented 19.5%, in 2012 it was 24.2% and it is expected to be 29.9% by the year 2031. This gives an alarming sign for the policy makers and programme planners to focus more when developing programmes for the elderly.
Though increasing elderly population presents challenges in many forms, it has to be taken as an assert and not as a burden. Of the challenges health, social and economical challenges have become more prominent.
Non communicable diseases are more prevalent among elderly in the society. In the current society every one is engaging in busy schedules. Unhealthy life styles including poor dietary habits, lack of exercise and mental stresses and malpractices like smoking commonly lead towards ill health. Same as other aged groups many of the health problems among elderly are the results of those risk factors which originate either during pregnancy, childhood, youth or adulthood. Implementation of active healthy concept is initiated to overcome such situations during old age.
Promotion of active healthy ageing starts before birth. It is a life course approach and progress from womb to tomb. Longer the elderly person live actively and healthy they enjoy their life with independence and giving more contribution and participation towards society. Active healthy ageing needs prior planning without waiting someone to be 60 years of age. It does not concern only on health but focuses overall quality of life of the elderly. That explains the necessity of strengthening muti-sectoral collaboration with a special attention towards social services and education sectors.
Disabilities restrict activities
Disabilities are more common among elders. Vision problems, hearing problems and mobility problems are common among them. These disabilities restrict activities of daily living of elders and their independence. Many disabilities need rehabilitation. Most of the disabilities are preventable with early identification and early interventions. Some disabilities take place as a complication of non-communicable diseases like diabetes mellitus. Community need proper awareness on preventive factors as well as facilities and service availability for prevention of disabilities and rehabilitation.
Many elders live alone. Loneliness and isolation has become a major issue among them. Illnesses like dementia are common among elders. Active healthy ageing addresses promotion of mental well-being of elders. There are many simple identified activities to be done to maintain mental well being. The problem among us is we are not focusing them as they seems to be simple and less costly. How many of us are having hobbies or how many of us are engage in recreational activities Common answer would be negative. Though promotion of active healthy ageing starts from early life if someone is already in the elderly group is also not late to start active healthy ageing life. For many persons life starts from age of 60 years. You may have many hidden capabilities which are good for the society and hobbies within you which you may not know. During your old age it is the golden time to take them out and practice in a productive manner and positive manner. Through these activities you are promoting your mental well-being even without much of an effort.
Engage more towards e-world only
Elders are a resource to the society. Their knowledge, skills and life experiences are vast. But unfortunately shifting of such capabilities to the younger generation is limited. Younger persons are over burden with academic stress or engage more towards e-world only. They may not in a capacity to appreciate the values of our elders. Most of the time there is a generational gap which makes elders and younger apart. Shifting of extended family system to the nuclear family system has become another contributory factor for this situation. Strategies should be drawn according to needs of the family or culture to narrow this gap. By doing it elders get better mental well being and younger get more productivity and better attitudes.
Community needs to be aware for the activities identified to promote active healthy ageing among elders. Such information can be obtained through various services available in the health institutions both in the curative and preventive sector.
Every year 01st of October is declared as the International Day of Older Persons. Sustainability and age inclusiveness in the urban development is the theme for this year. Creating an age friendly environment for elders has become a timely need in the society. To become such environment friendly it has to be more accessible and safe for the elders. Focusing more towards accident free and availability of disability accessibility for elders would be more productive. When it comes to availability of disabled accessibility facilities authorities need to concentrate more towards providing them according to the standards and guidelines instead of building them in a hazardous manner. Age friendly city concept is already implemented in our country and it is progressing successfully at Wallawaya, Monaragala district.
Ensuring enabling supportive environment for elders will enhance their participation, dignity, independence and self-fulfilment. All these are contributory factors for the promotion of active healthy ageing.

Feral kitten with no back legs gets tiny wheelchair
UK: A small rescued feral kitten with no back legs has been able to walk for the first time after a charity had a kitten-sized wheelchair made for the tiny survivor.
Cassidy the kitten was born to a feral mother and was discovered at around nine weeks of age, with his two hind legs missing and a series of health problems.
"By the time he was rescued, he had nearly starved to death and his depleted body had stopped fighting a horrific E. Coli infection in both stumps," a spokesperson from the Tiny Kittens Society wrote on its website.
The society rescues stray, feral, abandoned, unwanted and abused cats in Canada, and founder Shelly Roche has a theory as to how Cassidy managed to lose his legs.

Greece hoping winter will slow migrant flow
GREECE: Greece's migration minister said the coming of winter was a "good season" that should slow the refugee wave and allow the beleaguered nation to organise its resources.
"Winter is a good season for us to get organised because the (migration) flow is reduced," Yiannis Mouzalas, junior interior minister for migration, told Vima radio.
Greece needed the time to ready itself "in case we have renewed migration flows from springtime onwards," he said.
The latest UN refugee agency figures show that nearly 400,000 people fleeing war and poverty have reached Greece from neighbouring Turkey this year.
Most are from Syria but there are also Afghans, Pakistanis, Iranians and other nationalities.
But crossing the Aegean Sea this time of year in inflatable dinghies can be perilous.
With winds frequently exceeding 40 kilometres (25 miles) an hour, more than 100 migrants including several children have died or gone missing in the last two weeks alone in at least seven boat accidents, according to Greek figures.
In the summer, when the refugee wave first began to spike, Greece was criticised by the UN and rights groups for leaving entire families stranded on eastern Aegean islands for days, without food, shelter and access to sanitation.
The authorities subsequently chartered ferries to swiftly bring the migrants to the mainland, from where they make their way north towards other EU states.
A reception camp opened in Athens in August but with over 2,000 people arriving from the islands on a daily basis, more facilities are urgently needed.
Authorities on Thursday moved about a thousand mainly Afghan refugees who were sleeping on the streets to a former Olympic sports hall in western Athens.
There are also plans to utilise an empty army camp on the city's northwestern outskirts.
"We have promised to ease the burden placed on communities by the enormous refugee flow," Mouzalas said. "We are creating a network (of facilities) to reduce the pressure wherever it builds up," he said.

Greek trying to cope with mountain of lifejackets
GREECE: For the thousands of refugees and migrants landing on its beaches every day, Greece's Lesbos Island is a step to safety and a brighter future in Europe.
But the continent's biggest migration challenge since World War II is now presenting an unexpected environmental headache: What to do with the vast heaps of lifejackets and inflatable boats left behind by the arrivals
On the beach of Skala Sikaminias on Lesbos northern coast, a key landing point for migrants, a group of municipal employees are loading discarded jackets and dinghies on a truck.
We've barely finished when it's time to start all over again, sighs Mr Yiorgos Katsanos, the deputy mayor in charge of waste management.
The city has mobilised 12 additional staff to handle the overload and sends two trucks and a crane to clear the beaches every day.
For the time being, the thousands of life vests and boats are deposited at a dump further north. Until a permanent decision on what to do with it emerges, they're being left there.
The municipal vehicles can only access areas served by roads, and there are plenty of inaccessible coves littered with debris.
With materials such as these, the only solution is recycling, says Mr Katsanos.
The plastic could be used to make water tanks to be used in fire-fighting, he notes.
But we have not found a company prepared to undertake this job, he adds.
To some of the reporters and volunteers who gather on the beach each day to greet the arrivals, a lifejacket can be a kind of trophy.
Some have even ended up on Internet auction website eBay, allegedly to finance humanitarian operations, says Mr Katsanos.
If only they actually saved lives. But no, they're junk hastily made in Turkey or cheaply ordered from China, the deputy mayor adds.
They were really flimsy, not very solid at all, says Mr Sajjad, a 22-year-old Afghan who paid 7 euros (S$11) for his own life vest in Turkey.
As in the case of his fellow travellers, he discarded it as soon as he set foot on the island.
Mr Sajjad said he was grateful he never actually had to use the vest, as he cannot swim.
More than half a million people have reached Europe via the Mediterranean this year - including over 310,000 landing in Greece, figures from the UN refugee agency show.
Nearly 3,000 others have died or disappeared during the crossing.
Two more people - a woman and a child - drowned on Wednesday off Lesbos.
Greece and other European countries have repeatedly criticised Turkey for not doing enough to stamp out smuggler networks that profit at the expense of the migrants, many of whom are fleeing the conflict in Syria.
The smugglers charge exorbitant prices - up to US$2,000 - for passage on board flimsy vessels that frequently sink, dooming entire families.
In mid-September, France suspended an honorary consul and maritime supplier in the Turkish holiday resort town of Bodrum who was secretly filmed by France 2 television selling dinghies to refugees.
But there are also questionable practices closer to home.
On Lesbos, after the migrants and volunteers who help them have moved on, locals derisively known as crows move in to scavenge what they can.
The gutted boats will never sail again but plastic can be reused for making tarpaulin, and wood for fences.
Engines can also be resold at a tidy profit.
On the neighbouring island of Leros, police recently arrested four people found to have appropriated a combined 35 engines from migrant boats.
There's a black market for everything, said Mr Michalis Dimou, a local coast guard.
We've arrested a few people but right now the priority lies elsewhere, he shrugs.

Responding to UNHRC resolution
Japan to extend fullest cooperation to Lanka
Japan will extend its fullest cooperation to Sri Lanka in responding to the UNHCR resolution through a domestic mechanism, said Japans Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida when he met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo yesterday morning.
He said the efforts taken by the present government of Sri Lanka to rebuild and regain local and international confidence lost during the past is most commendable and praiseworthy.
Kishida said as a close friend Japan would assist the new Sri Lankan government of good governance with all possible assistance towards its efforts to build a new country.
The Japanese Foreign Minister also commended Prime Minister Wickremesinghe for steering Sri Lanka towards a non aligned foreign policy breaking off from the past decade.
Kishida said he firmly believed that the mutual discussions between the two countries in the next few days would help further cement mutual relations between Sri Lanka and Japan.
Japan, he said, was paying constant attention towards attempts made by the National Unity government to create an environment conducive for investments in state and private sectors.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said Japan was one of the five countries Sri Lanka established relations after gaining independence.
The foundation for Sri Lanka-Japan friendship and relations was laid by late President J.R. Jayewardene. It was taken forward by subsequent leaders of Sri Lanka, he said.
The Prime minister said the two main parties in Sri Lanka had come together to establish a national unity government after six decades.
The new government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena was striving to take the country forward by stabilising good governance, democracy and human rights. Sri Lanka had dedicated itself for the cause of peace in the region and help and assistance from Japan was vital in promoting peace and development in the Asia Pacific region, he said.
Since Asian representation in the UN Security Council was insufficient Sri Lanka would lend its full support to Japan in seeking a seat in the Security Council, the Prime Minister said. Ministers Ravi Karunanayake and Susil Premajayantha, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, Sri Lanka Ambassador in Japan Prof. Dhammika Ganganath Dissanayake, Assistant Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetty, Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister Prof. Monty Cassim, Advisor to the Ministry of National Policy and Economic Affairs R. Paskaralingam were also associated with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at the discussion.
Japanese Ambassador in Sri Lanka Kenichii Suganuma, Director General South Western and Eastern Asian Division of the Japanese Foreign Ministry Takio Yamada and Takashi Ariyoshi were among the Japanese delegation present.

Late bedtimes could lead to weight gain
US: Teenagers and adults who go to bed late on weeknights are more likely to gain weight than their peers who hit the hay earlier, according to a new study.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, found a correlation between sleep and body mass index (BMI).
The researchers analysed longitudinal data from a nationally representative cohort of more than 3,300 youths and adults in the US, and found that for every hour of sleep they lost, they gained 2.1 points on the BMI index.
This gain occurred roughly over a five-year period.
Moreover, exercise, screen time, and the number of hours they slept did not mitigate this BMI increase, according to the study published in the journal Sleep.
These results highlight adolescent bedtimes, not just total sleep time, as a potential target for weight management during the transition to adulthood, said Lauren Asarnow, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in UC Berkeley's Golden Bear Sleep and Mood Research Clinic.
The study analysed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which has tracked the influences and behaviours of US teenagers since 1994.
Focusing on three time periods - the onset of puberty, the college-age years and young adulthood - researchers compared the bedtimes and BMI of teenagers from 1994 to 2009.
Adolescents in the study reported their bedtimes and sleep hours while researchers calculated their BMI based on their height and weight. The results of the study suggested that adolescents who go to bed earlier will set their weight on a healthier course as they emerge into adulthood, Asarnow said.

The Man Who Lives Without Money
Irishman Mark Boyle tried to live life with no income, no bank balance and no spending. Heres how he finds it.
If someone told me seven years ago, in my final year of a business and economics degree, that Id now be living without money, Id have probably choked on my microwaved ready meal. The plan back then was to get a good job, make as much money as possible, and buy the stuff that would show society I was successful.
For a while I did it  I had a fantastic job managing a big organic food company; had myself a yacht on the harbour. If it hadnt been for the chance purchase of a video called Gandhi, Id still be doing it today. Instead, for the last fifteen months, I havent spent or received a single penny. Zilch.
The change in life path came one evening on the yacht whilst philosophising with a friend over a glass of merlot. Whilst I had been significantly influenced by the Mahatmas quote be the change you want to see in the world, I had no idea what that change was up until then. We began talking about all major issues in the world  environmental destruction, resource wars, factory farms, sweatshop labour  and wondering which of these we would be best devoting our time to. Not that we felt we could make any difference, being two small drops in a highly polluted ocean.
But that evening I had a realisation. These issues werent as unrelated as I had previously thought  they had a common root cause. I believe the fact that we no longer see the direct repercussions our purchases have on the people, environment and animals they affect is the factor that unites these problems.
The degrees of separation between the consumer and the consumed have increased so much that it now means were completely unaware of the levels of destruction and suffering embodied in the stuff we buy.
Very few people actually want to cause suffering to others; most just dont have any idea that they directly are. The tool that has enabled this separation is money, especially in its globalised format.
Take this for an example: if we grew our own food, we wouldnt waste a third of it as we do today.
If we made our own tables and chairs, we wouldnt throw them out the moment we changed the interior dcor.
If we had to clean our own drinking water, we probably wouldnt shit in it.
So to be the change I wanted to see in the world, it unfortunately meant I was going to have to give up money, which I decided to do for a year initially. So I made a list of the basics Id need to survive. I adore food, so it was at the top. There are four legs to the food-for-free table: foraging wild food, growing your own, bartering and using waste grub, of which there far too much.
On my first day I fed 150 people a three course meal with waste and foraged food. Most of the year I ate my own crops though and waste only made up about five per cent my diet. I cooked outside  rain or shine  on a rocket stove.
Next up was shelter. So I got myself a caravan from Freecycle, parked it on an organic farm I was volunteering with, and kitted it out to be off the electricity grid. Id use wood I either coppiced or scavenged to heat my humble abode in a wood burner made from an old gas bottle, and I had a compost loo to make humanure for my veggies.
I bathed in a river, and for toothpaste I used washed up cuttlefish bone with wild fennel seeds, an oddity for a vegan. For loo roll Id relieve the local newsagents of its papers (I once wiped my arse with a story about myself); it wasnt double quilted but it quickly became normal. To get around I had a bike and trailer, and the 55 km commute to the city doubled up as my gym subscription. For lighting Id use beeswax candles.
Many people label me an anti-capitalist. Whilst I do believe capitalism is fundamentally flawed, requiring infinite growth on a finite planet, I am not anti anything. I am pro-nature, pro-community and pro-happiness. And thats the thing I dont get  if all this consumerism and environmental destruction brought happiness, it would make some sense. But all the key indicators of unhappiness  depression, crime, mental illness, obesity, suicide and so on are on the increase. More money it seems, does not equate to more happiness.
Ironically, I have found this year to be the happiest of my life. Ive more friends in my community than ever, I havent been ill since I began, and Ive never been fitter. Ive found that friendship, not money, is real security. That most western poverty is spiritual. And that independence is really interdependence.
Could we all live like this tomorrow No. It would be a catastrophe, we are too addicted to both it and cheap energy, and have managed to build an entire global infrastructure around the abundance of both. But if we devolved decision making and re-localised down to communities of no larger than 150 people, then why not For over 90 per cent of our time on this planet, a period when we lived much more ecologically, we lived without money. Now we are the only species to use it, probably because we are the species most out of touch with nature.
People now often ask me what is missing compared to my old world of lucre and business. Stress. Traffic-jams. Bank statements. Utility bills. Oh yeah, and the odd pint of organic ale with my mates down the local.

Many shades of truth
Sigiri Graffiti No. 395 reads, Hama jene ran-vanun dut-mo yi boru kiyat. Pranavitana translation goes as We saw the golden-coloured ones, thus everyone utters false words.
Clough and also Carter translated boru as lie, falsehood and untruth. Prof. Senarat Paranavitana explains the term boru, which he translated as false wrods in his Sigiri Graffiti. The word boru..may not, in the 9th century, have had so depreciatory a meaning as is attached to it in the modern language. He believed that it would have meant imaginary because when the visitors saw the paintings of golden-coloured beauties, they could have imagined they were alive. In his opinion, it is a compound of bo (Sanskrit bahu - many) and ru (rupa- form/image), then it means manifold image or multiple image.
Prof. W. S. Karunatilleke also gives the terms not true and falsehood, and gives the etymology as Bahu-rupa many forms, and that in Tamil it is Purai. But there does not appear any connection with Pali, where falsehood is Musa.
He quotes from Natya Sastra that the manifold image is Rasa, and from Dandin, that erotic sentiment is by being united with the multiplicity of images. With the first contact with an object, the mind could form its own continued images, which may not be based on reality, that is what could be considered as imagination and the word boru. Parnavitana brings up another example, keppa (derived from kalpa) and says it originally meant fiction (i.e. mental construction).
Alberto Moravia wrote Lattenzione in 1965, which was translated as The Lie. It is about a novelist watching himself writing a novel. Times Literary Supplement said, The Lie is concerned with truth, with reality.... Moravia is not the only author who used the title The Lie. Chad Kuldgen wrote The Lie in 1997, describing the wild and amorous universe of college today. Joshua Leonard produced the film The Lie (2011) about a man who tells a lie to get out of work. The most recent is Helen Dunmores love story titled The Lie (2014).
Perhaps all works of fiction could have the title The Lie because it is what writers create out of their imagination. There cannot be any truth in a work of fiction, or it becomes a biography or a factual report. But then there is also the saying Truth is stranger than fiction. It is not possible to draw a line between truth and a lie, not only in our fiction, but even in our history. Most of the history of the world had been written centuries after the events, and we do not have any archaeological evidence to confirm many of the incidents had occurred, or if some of the historical personages had ever lived.
There are even autobiographies which are far from the truth, but which we cannot consider as lies. Then it is difficult sometimes whether to group them with a work like Moravias Lie. An autobiographer has to be careful not to offend the people around him, and not to harm the image he has built up, so he often avoids mentioning important events, or embellish others. Then there are other autobiographies, which read like their own works of fiction, like Mark Twains autobiography, which was published one hundred years after his death. We do not know if he is still pulling our leg.
We face the same situation with paintings and sculptures of historical characters. Most often they had been first created very much later, only from the descriptions which had come down by word of mouth. In that sense such images would be nowhere near an Identikit image created by a police artist, working on details given by a witness, and using most sophisticated computer software. Yet we do not consider them as lies. We do not consider as lies or falsehoods, even the recreation of pre-historic scenes like the diorama of the two people walking away from the volcanic eruption 3.6 million years ago.
Today many of us consider Wikipedia as the absolute truth, as the omniscient organism. Yet not everything posted on Wikipedia is true. The best example is the Bicholim Conflict. Wikipedia described a war in a region called Bicholim in Maharashtra, India, in 1640 between Marathi forces and the Portuguese. It was posted in 2007, and continued to be accepted as the true happening till end of 2012. When it was realized that there never had been such a war. Today it is listed in Wikipedia under the List of Hoaxes. Based on this incident, should we accept all the wars described in history books, like the Kalinga War by Asoka.
All religions declare the importance of the truth. And ye shall know the truth, and truth shall make you free. (John 8:32). Truth cannot be suppressed and is the ultimate victor (Yajur Veda). And whenever you give your word, say the truth (Al-Anaam 6:152) The Fourth Precept undertaken by Buddhists the world over should be a precept to be observed by all humanity. We could all follow it, irrespective of our religious beliefs and faiths, because it is a guidance that would have been given by all founders of religions - Refrain from incorrect speech.
Incorrect speech, covers not only the lies, falsehoods and untruths, but also half-truths and distorting or concealing the truth. It is only when we use the terms truth and lie, that we cannot draw a line between them, because people could argue that truth comes in varying shades of gray. But incorrect speech is very clear and covers what is not true, what is half true and even harsh, violent, hateful speech.
Fiction, poetry, and art should remain within Samma Vacha (correct speech) even while stepping outside truth, using boru to mean imaginary.

A new Mental Health Bill will be presented to Parliament soon to replace the Act on Mental Health enacted in 1892. The draft Bill is before the Cabinet Sub Committee for approval, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, a National Mental Health Policy is also ready, offering fresh guidelines on services and manpower resources of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The new law and the national policy will together contribute to drastic changes in the present approach to treating mentally ill patients.
One significant change is that mentally sick patients will be able to be admitted to any psychiatric unit in the country, the sources said. The Act will also look into strengthening long term and interim care units across the island, the sources said.

Online fundraising for Oregon shooting hero nears $700,000
US: An online campaign to pay for the treatment and recovery of an Iraq war veteran hailed as a hero during the Oregon college massacre raised almost $700,000 in just one day, the website showed on Saturday.
Chris Mintz, 30, is credited with likely saving the lives of fellow students when he prevented the 26-year-old gunman fromentering a classroom at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg before police arrived.
The shooter later committed suicide. Mintz, a mixed martial artist and bodybuilder who was studying fitness technology in the hope of becoming a personal trainer, drew fire that left him with seven bullet wounds and two broken legs, his former girlfriend said in an interview.
More than $680,000 was raised from just over 20,000 donors in one day, according to the GoFundMe site set up by Mintz's cousin, Derek Bourgeois. - AFP

Parliamentary oversight and self-interested politicians
In Sri Lanka, almost all the elected representatives invest millions and billions to get elected to Parliament at an election. It is the common belief that politics is the most suitable career if you need to be superfluously rich within a short period in the country once called - Wonder of Asia. In reality, having invested large sums of money and effort for elections, after they get elected, naturally - they have no option other than resorting to various means - illegal, corrupt, or fraudulent, to reap profit to remain in Parliament, term after term. We should, therefore, remember the politicians are self-interested individuals and they are only interested in looking after their personal interests rather than that of the public. Does this mean the elected representatives cannot fulfil the role  PARLIAENTARY OVERSIGHT
Lee Kuan Yew had said: My problem was to find big men for the big jobs that were vacant. There was no shortage of big chairs. The problem was how to find chaps with enough grit and ability to fill these big chairs. The Singaporean rulers have been able to lead the country to the status  developed nation and one of the least corrupt countries -in the world thanks to the leadership given by LKY and his capable team. Can we expect Sri Lankan leaders to perform like LKY and his team
I must mention a key aspect of this success story is extraordinary oversight activity by the Parliament and the principle of meritocracy in recruitment and retention of capable and dedicated personnel, and paying them purely for the performance alone (not seniority or political influence). Human capital (capable, committed and honest) is the engine to drive economic growth and development. The other important factor is no democratic system of government could survive without transparency and accountability. This is a responsibility which lies broadly on the large shoulders of parliamentarians elected by the people. The present government must remember this is exactly where MR government failed. Having faulted MR paid the supreme price for misrule despite the fact that they won the long, devastating and the so-called unwinnable war.
Public policy and peoples needs
The new government led by MS/RW too must be saddled with the same problem of finding suitable human capital for the top jobs.
Nevertheless, the PM has correctly identified that primarily the core function of Parliament should first be addressed  OVERSIGHT  to ensure speedy, efficient and effective implementation of policy, proposals and actions on behalf of the people. PM has, therefore, stressed the importance of the role of Parliamentarians as a priority matter. The PM sent a message very loudly and issued a warning at a seminar held in Parliament that as the body that represents the people, Parliamentarians must essentially be committed to ensure that the administration of the public policy reflect and meets the peoples needs. PM has also stressed that Parliamentarians should ensure that agreed policy is properly implemented and delivered to target citizens while looking after state revenue. Parliamentary oversight, therefore, to be more precise is the review, monitoring and supervision of government and public institutions, including the implementation of policy and legislation.
Let me now briefly set out the key functions of parliamentary oversight as follows:
* to identify and stop abuse, arbitrary behavior, or illegal and unconstitutional conduct on the part of the government and public sector institutions - the protection of right and liberties of citizens;
* to hold the elected government to account in respect of how tax payers money is used - improve the efficiency, economy and effectiveness and stop waste misuse, abuse, corruption, fraud etc. of government operations;
* to ensure that policies, plans and decisions announced by the government and authorized by Parliament are actually delivered, implemented and achieved - monitoring the achievement of goals set by legislation, projects, proposals and programmes; and
* to improve the transparency, openness, and compliance of laws, rules, regulations applicable procedures in every single government operation and enhance public trust in the government, which is itself a condition of effective policy delivery
Obviously, State power had been largely concentrated in the hands of a few individuals rather than in democratic institutions in the last few years. Parliament, therefore, had become too weak to function effectively and was simply a rubber stamp. The Parliamentarians did not have the sense of duty and beyond that the passion to the Nation. They failed to carry out meaningful and effective oversight functions. They did not identify and meet the needs of the citizens.
Oversight is all about keeping an eye on the activities of the executive on behalf of its citizens and holding the executive to account. Furthermore, another important element of oversight concerns the budget; checking that spending decisions are in line with the national priorities.
A majority of the Sri Lankans due to these deficiencies were determined to change the creeping authoritarianism and wanted  an opening up of a democratic political order. In my view, the majority also did not wish to continue in isolation internationally and drawing flak from the West and numerous human rights groups too. Those who did this change expected the newly elected government to address these issues pertaining to justice, human rights and also to make an attempt to re-establish universal democratic values and accepted norms in the country.
Rajapaksa regime
The present rulers must be aware that there were accusations to the former regime that there was corruption, nepotism, misrule, authoritarianism, majoritarian nationalism, and many more.
The President defected from the Rajapaksa regime as the Common Candidate backed by the then Leader of the Opposition, and assured to abolish executive presidency and establish rule of law, good governance, and numerous Independent Commissions etc.
Accordingly, President MS won the support of all the liberal forces in the Sinhala Community. Tamil and Muslim Community too by then had decided that the former regime should be toppled.
I must, therefore, add that the voters should not be taken for granted. They did exceptionally well and effected regime change peacefully. The UNP/UPFA coalition should find solutions for issues such as employment and poverty and strategies to take advantages of the opportunities. They should also learn from lessons in the past and be more efficient at managing depleted resources. Economists use total factor productivity (TFP) to measure such efficiency. A country with a high TFP produces more with a given amount of inputs, such as capital and labour, than does a country with low TFP. It may be worthwhile for Sri Lankan rulers to study the Chinese experience how they cracked open their Soviet-styled economy to private enterprise and foreign investment in the early 1980s. In fact, Indians too stepped up during the same period and could not make sufficient progress due to squabbling politicians and held up reform. In China, factories etc. came up with authoritarian efficiency; in India, major investment projects were stalled. China became the workshop of the world and India missed out on the mass manufacturing that generates jobs and exports.
It is a pity Sri Lanka too started ambitious programmes then on the same lines. UNP regime introduced concepts such as Free Trade Zones, export oriented garment factories in villages etc. They also faulted. The country is yet lagging behind due to politicians and the bureaucrats. They could not repair the problems.
In 1972, the then PM Mrs. Bandaranaike changed the countrys name Ceylon to Sri Lanka and made it a republic. We sell our tea internationally even now as Ceylon Tea. In 1978, Executive Presidency was introduced. AirLanka was also established and began operations. Singaporeans worked with us initially to develop the airline. They left us when the new airline decided to buy two second hand aircrafts against their advise. They had said it was bound to fail and it did. MR established Mihin Air. Country lost billions.
It is the system that needs to be improved. Our investments in education, health, transport etc. were drastically reduced. Every successive government did ad hoc changes. Since independence, they failed to improve the fortunes of the country for the people.
Democratic governments
The voters elected the MS/RW government because the former UPFA regime failed to alleviate poverty and overcome, corruption and misrule. Construction of highways and beautification of cities did not contribute to achieve sustainable economic growth and development in order to create employment and reduce poverty.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a MAKE IN INDIA campaign, with a roaring lion as its logo intending to turn the country into a manufacturing powerhouse to rival China. Prime Minister Modi also simultaneously took steps to streamline the cumbersome process in the public sector, which held back numerous projects  small, medium and large. In Sri Lanka too these issues have to be addressed effectively and efficiently, if the newly elected government needs to do the desired CHANGE.
I also wish to quote what I myself wrote previously: Parliamentarians need to be told that democratic governments that fail to deliver basic levels of stability and services risk losing their legitimacy. Good governance is the only way in which governments and public sector institutions could guarantee the rule of law, promote economic growth, and provide some measure of social protection to citizens. Generally, the term democratic governance refers to a governments ability to deliver on these promises while adhering to democratic values of transparency, representation, pluralism and accountability.
In fact, government accountability is achieved through the use of a variety of mechanisms  political, legal and administrative  designed to prevent corruption and ensure that politicians and public officials remain answerable and accessible to the people they serve. In the absence of such mechanisms, corruption may thrive again.

Political turmoil in Maldives allowing IS space to establish terror root
US: Maldives appears to be emerging as yet another potential hub for the Islamic State (IS) and their supporters.
Well placed sources here have revealed that the ongoing political turmoil in the Maldives, a tropical nation of 26 islands, is giving space to the IS or ISIS to establish a dangerous and frightening terror presence that could have adverse internal security and economic repercussions, both in the short as well as the long term.
The sources said the political turmoil in the archipelago has surfaced because of the existence of two distinct camps  one supposedly loyal to President Abdulla Yameen and the other to Vice President Adeeb.
Late last month, in an alarming revelation, Islamic radicals linked to IS and the jihadist group Bilad Al Sham Media, which is believed to be based in Syria and the Maldives, claimed responsibility for the September 28 explosion aboard a speed boat that was carrying President Yameen and First Lady Fathimath Ibrahim. Both narrowly escaped with their lives, but their bodyguard and an official attached to the Presidents Office suffered injuries and had to be admitted to the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in capital Male for treatment.
According to sources, a three-minute-long YouTube video carrying the IS logo has triggered speculation of the IS or ISIS being behind the incident reportedly because its demands for the release of Adhaalath Party leader Sheikh Imran and the withdrawal of the new anti-terror bill are yet to be met.
The reported IS involvement, appears to indicate the possibility of Maldives security forces getting increasingly radicalised, and the well placed sources are claiming that the attack on President Yameen could not have taken place without IS elements penetrating the countrys elite Maldivian National Defence Force (MNDF).

Ponytail males and bald spot tales!
The sixties, oh for the swinging sixties, the era we baby boomers still long for. Mention of the sixties rouses strong exciting emotions among many of us who were teens and now in our mid and late three score and something years. Many can look back at this decade of youth, excitement and inventiveness as a real turning point in societies around the world.
Still it is regarded as one of those decades which have now taken on an almost mythical aura. In a decade dominated by youth, the vogue burst into bloom in our own conservative island nation.
The country too was to soon witness a seismic shift in music, movies, clothes and hairstyles. Sri Lanka was swinging and the Galle Face Hotels Coconut Grove and the Ceylinco Hotels Akasa Kadey were the scene, meaning the chic places to go. Colombo was buzzing with show bands and pulsing with half a dozen separate veins of excitement.
Yes siree, and zapped with the taste of rebellion I was in the thick of it all. Even as a school-going teenager I swung into the action as a stage-stomping presenter in the exhilarating entertainment circuit. Boy, oh boy, I was in my element making whoopee as well as pretty good moolah in the process.
And yes, everyone seemed to be letting their hair down, both literally and figuratively. They did so without a care for the existing conservative greased down city slicker styles. Slightly longer hair trends of the day were influenced by Elvis into the 60s. Most maverick lads traded their crew-cuts and parted with their side partings for longer brushed-back hair styles.
So I simply let my mane grow and sort of fantail reasonably longer at the back. Certainly not in the messy hippie fashion but nonetheless quite hip or modernist mod at the time. Besides to give you a better idea of the image, it resembled the Johnny Weismuller Tarzan look. Although my kid sister Ann said uncharitably that my new-look appearance reminded her of Cheetah, Tarzans pet chimp.
But then it was only a matter of time before some of my peers graduated to wearing pony-tails and rat-tails which were referred to derogatorily as male-tails. Which reminds me of a recent strange coincidence that brought about a good deal of sixties nostalgia. I am talking about just the other day when I was working on the computer quite at peace. Apparently a black and white photograph had slipped out of a book our maid was dusting.
She had handed it over to my wife while going into gales of giggles. The better half duly brought it to me with the maid following and still in the throes of her irrepressible magpie titters. The maids name is Maggie. I have dubbed her the magpie and have added the Sinhala vernacular to the moniker, Polkichchi. The wife flipped the photograph on my desk with the legerdemain of a casino dealer. It landed face-side up on the desk as she queried: Guess who
I adjusted my glasses and took a cursory glance. The face looked distantly familiar. Then it hit me with sudden clarity. It was me! I mean the youthful me of the rebellious period with overgrown hair. The mug was sans the jowls and the double chin of the fat-faced brigand who of late stares back at me from the mirror while I shave. I usually glower back at the hostile image which in turn gives me the most irritatingly patronising curled lip smirk.
I tossed the picture back at my wife and wisecracked: Who is he Pretty good looking chappie! Its probably one of your old Hollywood pinup boys I knew the cheeky quip was a cinch for a pinch. And I was right. Ouch! But I bore it stoically with an infuriating grin or was it a grimace as she sashayed out mumbling something about the vanity of old duffers. The maid followed still giggling.
When I was around 19 an acquaintance dubbed Kaputa, for obvious reasons, used to sport a pony-tail. There was nothing unique about it at the time because he possessed a reasonable head of hair. But the old adage still stands good, with a little amendment of course: Boys will be boys and so will a lot of middle-aged men. The maxim appeared spot on for Kaputa, bald spot and all, because the male-tail remained even when he was 45-years-old and displaying a fast receding hairline.
That was bad enough contending with the decline and fall of the hairline empire puns and witticisms that followed his pony-tail. But now pushing 70 he appeared at a recent cocktail party completely bald in front but still sporting a thin, itty-bitty little rat-tail held back with a rubber band at the back of his shiny noggin.
His appearance naturally provided a great deal of grist for many an imbibing wit. To make matters worse he had grown a bushy beard to hide a multitude of chins. This prompted our incorrigible wit Surchepps to proclaim: His beard makes him look like he has his head on upside down. And then the whole caboodle of snipers began firing their derisory fusillades at him. Friend Collie who is being follically challenged as well, but with no signs of a male-tail quipped: There are three ways a man wears his hair. Parted, un-parted or like Kaputa ... departed.
And somewhere from the back of the dimly-lit bar emerged the voice of another anonymous guerrilla marksman who had Kaputa in his cross-hairs: For heavens sake make sure he doesnt fall and suffer a hairline fracture.
I did a lot of horsing around during my youth but was too conservative to pony my tail.
There was a time when I fashioned my hair according to the existing style. But now I have to fashion it according to my existing hair.
And by the way if any of you out there appear curious about my old pin up photo just shoot me a mail and I pledge to send it to you. Conditions apply however: No charges. Voluntary contributions can be made out to the Cancer Society. Comments permitted. Giggles strictly forbidden!

## Title: Power of the Gratitude Habit

Power of the Gratitude Habit
There's a small habit that I practice, that can turn difficult situations into much better ones - and it won't surprise you. It's the habit of gratitude.
This is such a simple habit, and it's one that we often forget to practice. But when we do, it can transform our entire perspective, and with it our whole life.
Let me give you an example. About 10 years ago, I remember being caught in a rainstorm and being soaked, and also feeling generally stressed about being broke and hating my job and unhappy with my health. I was a bit depressed about it all, actually.
Then I decided to make a mental list of everything I was grateful for, right there in the rain. It was a long list, and while I can't remember everything on it, some of the things I remember include:
I'm married to a beautiful, loving, supportive wife.
I have five wonderful kids (at the time - now I have six).
I am employed.
I am relatively healthy (maybe I was overweight, but I didn't have chronic illness or pain).
I have loving family (parents, siblings, extended family) who I love dearly.
I live on a tropical island where the rain is actually refreshing when you're sweating from the heat (I now live in northern California, but I was on Guam at the time).
I am alive.
I can taste delicious food, smell flowers, see art, hear music. What miracles!
I have friends. I can run. I can love.
I can pick mangoes from the huge tree in my yard. I can read novels, my dearly beloved novels! I am not starving, homeless, destitute, alone, destroyed by a natural disaster.
The list was probably 4-5 times as long, but you get the idea. The things I was taking for granted were now put front and center before me. The things I was feeling bad about didn't go away, but they were put in perspective. They were blended with more powerful elements of my life into a mix that is ultimately true beauty and love.
Yes, there are bad things in my life, and it's OK to feel bad about them. But it's also important to remember the rest of my life, and to remember that even the bad things make life as complex and interesting as it is. Life would be boring without challenges!
The transformation of how I felt about my life, in that moment in the tropical downpouring rain, was really remarkable. All from making a simple list.
I've used this process hundreds of times since then, and it transforms everything:
When I'm feeling mad at someone, I can try to see what about them I'm grateful for.
When I procrastinate with a project, I can look at why I'm grateful to be able to work on that project.
When I get injured or sick, I can remember that I'm grateful just to be alive.
When I lose a good friend, I can grieve, but also be grateful for the time I had with them, and all that they gave me.
When something bad happens while traveling, I remember to be grateful for traveling at all, and that these challenges are what make the travel an adventure.
When someone doesn't like what I do, and criticizes me, I can be grateful they care enough to even pay attention. Attention is a gift.
I'd like to make a small recommendation that could be powerful if you often forget to practice gratitude: start a small daily habit.
Just a few minutes per day of journaling, meditating on gratitude, or just thinking about what you're grateful for in life. Do it every day, with a reminder, and see if it changes anything.
Don't rush through it, don't do it mindlessly, really try to feel gratitude for everything you list. Feel the amazingness of the things in your life.
I dare you to be complacent about life after doing that.

Rooted down
Conservationists and Indigenous communities share the aim of preserving biodiversity, even if their incentives differ. That creates a grim irony when tribal peoples are estranged from the environment they have safeguarded, for the sake of safeguarding the environment.
New research on how Indigenous communities in Papua province, Indonesia conserve the forest resources they rely on concludes, The potential tragedy of the unseen sentinels is that so much may be lost simply because we failed to open our eyes to look. Working closely with three communities to examine their conservation practices, a team of scientists associated with the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) discovered each has a system for monitoring resources and responding to threats. Challenging assumptions that Indigenous communities damage forest resources, the research feeds into a growing body of evidence that natural resource management by local communities can be more effective and cost-efficient for large-scale conservation than government-sanctioned protected areas.
To contextualise this study, let us first consider the conservation contradiction that exists.
Vedda community
This contradiction has been unfolding around the world, much to the detriment of traditional custodians like the Wanniyala-Aetto of Sri Lanka, the Karen of Thailand, the Baka of Cameroon and the Kalahari Bushmen of Botswana. Tribal peoples are being booted from their customary forests and ancestral lands not only to make way for agricultural, mining and logging concessions (land grabs that are widespread and have been well documented) but also in the name of wilderness, to keep forests pristine and away from the pilfering hands of human exploitation. On the surface, the creation and expansion of inviolate zones, in the form of national parks and sanctuaries, are a win for environmental aims; however, communities that call these forests home and rely on their resources for survival become conservation refugees.
Disenfranchised, they are cast as conservation opponents, accused of damaging natural resources; they are marginalized to resettlement areas on the fringes of reserves, forced to eke out an existence on government handouts, by begging or stealing from their former forest home to survive.
This is a serious problem, as a 2014 Survival International report, Parks Need Peoples explains. Overnight, resources that have sustained the tribe since time immemorial are out of bounds. If they hunt in the park they are accused of poaching. If they are caught gathering, they can be fined or imprisoned. For example, since the Wanniyala-Aetto peoples in Sri Lanka were disenfranchised for the Maduru Oya National Park in 1983, they have reportedly been killed, beaten and arrested for subsistence hunting on their ancestral land. In Cameroon, eco-guards, partially funded by WWF and the German Government, are accused of human rights abuses and torture against the Indigenous Baka.
Survival International Director, Stephen Corry said, in a Guardian piece, that the expulsion of Indigenous communities from their customary territories is based on unscientific assumptions that tribal peoples are incapable of managing their lands, that they overhunt, overgraze and overuse the resources on their lands.
Its no coincidence that 80 percent of the worlds biodiversity is found on the lands of tribal peoples and that the vast majority of the 200 most biodiverse places on Earth are tribal peoples territories, Survival International reports, By developing ways to live sustainably on the land they cherish, tribal peoples have often contributed  sometimes over millennia  towards the high diversity of species around them.
At the Asia Regional Conservation Forum in Thailand last month, a Karen leader appealed to the Thai Government to be more considerate of Indigenous peoples whose customary land had been turned into official conservation zones. We are not the destroyers of the forest. We have nurtured our natural environment through our use and conserve practice, which is part of our simple lifestyle and culture. The forest we manage, including our practice of shifting cultivation that provides us food security, are better conserved and enriched with biodiversity.
American professor and philosopher, J Baird Callicott criticizes the idea of wilderness as environments that are free from human habitation as an ethnocentric concept with foundations in Western discourse. He notes the name wilderness constructs landscapes in a way not shared by all social groups; indeed, there is no translation for the word in many languages. Soon after the worlds first national park  Yellowstone  was created in the United States in the 19th century, the local Native American tribes were expelled from their traditional lands to conserve the wilderness.
The paradox here is that Indigenous peoples, as CIFOR studies have shown, are actually stewards of the forests  their very survival depends on fostering sustainable relationships with surrounding ecosystems.
Conservation friends not foes
CIFORs new study, Unseen Sentinels: local monitoring and control in conservations blind spots, is significant because it reveals how Indigenous peoples are protecting vast natural areas. Co-author, Senior Associate at CIFOR and scientist based at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Douglas Sheil said effective local protection is undermined, not because these local systems are invisible, but because no one recognizes what they see.
For conservationists pushing for the expansion of protected areas, the study highlights the potential dangers of alienating people from their environment, and represents a neglected opportunity to support them doing what they already do, Sheil said.
Territories of the three Papuan communities studied  Kay, Metaweja and Yoke  overlap with the Mamberamo-Foja Wildlife Reserve, a conservation zone spanning two million hectares and brimming with biodiversity. While being aware of the parks protected status for the past decade, the communities maintain their traditional land claims, customs and tribal systems.
They hunt crocodiles, catch fish and collect forests resources in their territories. Rather than revealing a pattern of over-exploitation, the study found respected individuals or groups have a recognized responsibility for protecting key resource-rich areas.
Illustrating this, in Kay, hereditary stewards called Ijabait live at strategic points along the Tariku River.

Heaven on earth
Surviving the impossible
Aishwarya Rai did it in Provoked. Now it is Preity Zintas turn to play despairing housewife in award winning filmmaker Deepa Methas Heaven on Earth. The film portrays the story of a heart wrenching plight of a young wife on the first go but it has hope and survival embedded into the folds of its plot.
The movie details the ill fated arranged marriage of a vibrant young Panjabi girl named Chand and her temperamental Canadian husband, Rocky. The movie opens with the party bidding goodbye to Chands single life back in India.
Next it shows the blushing young bride getting ready to meet her husband and his family in Toronto. Metha sets the tone of the production from then on, projecting the discomfort and ill nature of Chands spouse and his family.
Our hunch is proven correct through Rockys domineering mother. His father is good natured but too mild to control his children and wifes behaviour.
Rockys sister and her family too depend on Rocky to look after their needs. The eldest child is prone to playing pranks while the youngest is too little to be of any comfort to Chand. Her husband is cold and distant and seems to notice her only to vent out his anger.
Desperate to contact her family in India and with no one to talk to Chand turns to her factory fellow worker, Jamaican born Rosa, for help. Her friend sees past Chands attempts to hide her bruises and gives her a root saying that it a magic potion which will make whoever drinks it fall hopelessly in love with her.
Though her first attempt backfires, Chand begins to have visions of a cobra in her backyard and with these hallucinations Rockys role too seems to change from a tyrant to a protector.
Mehta normally engages a lot of imagery in her movies. Heaven on Earth is no exception. From the moment that it is indicated that the merriment is limited to the opening scenes and the images shift to a darker and gloomier atmosphere we realize that joy is short lived. The shift of the coloured scenes to black and white display the moment that Chand imagines what could have taken place had things been just as she hoped in her marriage. However unlike her previous works, the imagery in Heaven on Earth seems overdone. Mehta follows her regular beat in questioning family values and cultural norms in Heaven on Earth as well. One such instance is when one character of the movie says that hell is better than a heaven without dignity. However unlike in movies like Fire, the universal quality of Heaven on Earth is evident for it centers on domestic violence away from an Asian set up, via a immigrant family living in a western country. No matter where they live, in most communities, women are meant to obey physical wrath with silence.
Many other movie makers have dealt with the theme of domestic violence in their movies so it is inevitable that Heaven of Earth would be compared with them.
Though it has often been weighted against Jag Mundhras Provoked starring Aishwarya Rai and Naveen Andrews, one look at Heaven on Earth makes you realize that this is a story that stands on its own.
The only common factor they possess is that both are very disturbing films on the plight of women who had to leave their native country and make a living with their husbands. Heaven on Earth also deals with a mythical element via the cobras tale.
The star of the show is no doubt Preity Zinta who gives a stellar performance as the battered housewife, Chand. Vansh Bhardwaj too brings depth to Rockys character. Both lead actors do well in bringing uniqueness to characters which could easily have fallen into stereotypes.
For instance instead of playing the wounded victim, Zintas character tries to understand and rehab her husband against all odds. Similarly Bhardwaj proves that Rocky is not entirely a villain. He does display his softer side in rare instances. This may not be Methas best work but the movie is worth a watch for its casts yeoman effort and its unique storyline.

Taylor Swift Loves SNL
Was she angry Taylor Swift had a surprising reaction to the SNL sketch that mocked her and her Bad Blood posse, HollywoodLife.com can EXCLUSIVELY reveal. She was totally flattered by it!
Taylor Swift, 25, has reacted surprisingly well to being taunted on the Miley Cyrus-hosted SNL episode that aired Oct. 3. Shes flattered the show poked fun at her but believes Miley Cyrus, 22, may have had a hand in making the skit happen, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned.
Taylor was flattered by the SNL sketch about her, you know youve made it when youre being parodied by the SNL team, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. She thought it was really funny, and has already been joking with her Bad Blood gal pals about it, who are equally as amused.
But despite being able to laugh at herself, Taylor is convinced that nemesis Miley had some hand in the sketch coming to fruition. Taylor is adamant that Miley mustve been an influence on the sketch, even though she wasnt in it, the source adds.
As we told you, Taylor and her squad were mocked by the comedy show in a Walking Dead-like clip. Its seems bizarre that a skit about Taylor would appear on the same episode that Miley hosted. Could it be purely coincidental We dont know. But one things for sure, we cant wait to see where their feud goes next. Its heating up, girls!
Meanwhile, Taylors squad has been largely absent during her Canadian leg of her 1989 world tour. Fans who may have expected her pals, including Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Selena Gomez, may have been disappointed that their favorite stars havent appeared lately.
However, rest assured, Taylor has provided her followers with two excellent duets. On her first night in Canada, she performed two Keith Urban hits with the country music star. Then, on Oct. 3, Taylor was joined on stage by Charli XCX for an energetic performance of Charlis hit Boom Clap that wowed the audience.
But back to the SNL sketch, HollywoodLifers. Did you think it was funny Let us know in the comments below.

The Academy provides the space free of charge to the artists, and opens the ensuing event up to the public to create stress-free entertainment with a tranquil ambience. Open to the public from 7.30 to 9.30 pm, its the perfect pit-stop to unwind and avoid rush hour traffic after a hard days work.
The premise behind Thursdays with AFA is to create a friendly and healthy environment for artists in Sri Lanka to perform and grow their talents in a relaxed and encouraging atmosphere. The informal setting is the perfect opportunity for the less assertive artist to hone their skills and cultivate confidence in front of an intimate and welcoming audience. The event is also a good occasion to network and meet other artists for a collaborative project.
The event was launched on September 24, and the opening act was a soulful original song by Kirk Michael, an acoustic guitarist and singer. He followed this act with a catchy rendition of Walking on the Moon (originally by Police) with an experimental and rewarding reggae twist. Kirk was followed by a walk-in artist, rapper Abadi, who decided to do a few impromptu raps to fill in a time slot. The third act for the evening was the young artist, Lara Modder, enlivening the evening with her performance of Pumped Up Kicks (by Foster the People), Radioactive (by Coldplay), and Drops of Jupiter (by Train). After ending her planned-performance, Lara bravely took requests from the audience including an impressive rendition of Zombie by the Cranberries. The evening quickly dissolved into magic and mayhem with a happy mix of collaborations between the artists and sing-alongs by the audience.
This was exactly the atmosphere that the Academy of Fine Arts was striving for. The Managing Director of AFA, Shyamala Pinto-Jayawardena said, An Artist needs the right atmosphere, an inspirational space to think and grow with self-confidence, and an abundance of encouragement. AFA will always aim to provide a creative space for artists from various walks of life to blossom.
The free event on alternate Thursdays is a deliberate move by the Academy to give young creatives free use of the Academy space to encourage the arts be it for musical, dance, stand up comedy, poetry readings, skits, or just about any form of creative Art! The Academy provides the cosy space for various forms of art with the aim of creating a platform to support and promote amateur artists, and a hub for like-minded people to mingle, and find inspiration.
If you would like to use the AFA open mic space to perform, hold a workshop, practice or just jam, contact the Academy on [emailprotected] or 077 920 8445.

TURNING TECHNO
Mention Sri Lankan music and her name automatically crops up. Her inimitable deep voice opened a new chapter in Sri Lankan music history and reached far beyond local horizons, as far as to win international aesthetic appeal.
If I were 21 years old today my main aim would be to learn some of the features related to the modern technology. Many people have mentioned that my songs have been featured in the internet: on youtube, a blog, facebook, twitter etc. I know nothing about them today. Therefore I am sure I would be eager to learn about these features and include them in my lifestyle, says the dame with a sonorous voice who has entertained masses with her evergreen songs.
At 70, Nanda Malini says that though she does not know the first thing about such technological devices, she believes that she has not missed out much, music vise.
I am very satisfied with my songs. The modern technology could not have made them better. It was the golden age of music when I was in my early 20s. Even if I was 21 today I am sure I would have used the modern resources to gift something worthwhile to the country, she said.
She notes that though new genres of music like r&b, hip hop and reggae had entered the scene her heart would still lie in light classical music.
Though I would be 49 years younger, I am sure that my tastes would not have changed. You cannot change your preferences because they are innate qualities. Sure, I would enjoy listening to other musicians displaying their talents but I would stick by my own style, she added. Apart from music she has a passion for travelling. She says that she would like to travel far and wide but mainly to Asian countries like India and Myanmar.
If I were 21 years old today my main aimwould be to learn some of the features related to themodern technology. Many people have mentionedthat my songs have been featuredin the internet: on youtube, a blog, facebook,twitter etc. I know nothing about them today
My dream is to visit Borobudur, Indonesia. I feel that we can relate to these countries because our cultures are alike. We feel a sense of belonging even if we visit a kovil or temple in these countries. I love that homely atmosphere, she said. Queried if she would ever migrate to another land Nanda said that such a though would never cross her mind.
A visit is ok but I do not feel like settling down in another country. Sri Lanka is home. I belong here, she added firmly
She enjoys traveling to Anuradhapura to look at the ruins. Therefore more visits to the ancient city will be on the cards. She would also like to visit Jaffna and see the situation there with her own eyes.
She says that she will spend more time reading books and newspapers as well as watching dramas.
However I would never pursue acting. Though I have my own political ideologies, a political career is not for me, she mused.
Many young girls in their 20s show interest towards fashion and make up these days. Nanda too believes that she would try to educate herself about the subject.
My style is simplicity. Therefore whatever I do to beautify myself, I would not go to the extreme. I like to lead a simple lifestyle. Though I have visited many countries I do not like to bring back a lot of items from them. I like to keep my home less crowded as possible. I have never purchased items apart from a CD or any small items which have to do with my music. I have never brought back suitcases filled with stuff, she revealed.
For many young girls 21 spells the age ripe for romance. Nanda believes that she too will be ready to give it as shot if she encountered the person of her choice.
Many girls marry at 25 years these days. There is no reason to delay that chapter in your life if the right person comes along, she said.
She has seen some youths who possess qualities she would have had if she was around their age.
They are keen on meritorious activities. If they see an old man trying to cross the road they do not hesitate to help him. I believe that I could have been included in that crowd because I too like to help the less privileged, she concluded with a smile.

Yoko Ono Talks John Lennon, Art and Paul McCartney's Complaints
Ono on what she and Lennon learned from each other. Plus she responds to McCartney's comments about Beatles songwriting credits.John Lennon made drawings before he met Yoko Ono in 1966, but it was only after he started a relationship with Onoat the time a rising art starthat he really came into his own as an artist. Over the course of their time together, the Beatle went from rendering cartoons influenced by British absurdist humor to a simple but elegant style that was indebted to both contemporary minimalism and traditional Japanese painting. His modest, intimate portraits of Yoko and their son Sean provided a fitting visual accompaniment to the music he made about their lives together.
How are you
You know, busy. That's good.
You have this exhibit opening soon.
I know. I'm really happy about that, because this is John's 75th this year, so I wanted good representation of John in many places. And this is one that's very good.
What in particular makes you excited about it
When John was alive, he wanted to do an art exhibition, and somehow there was such a heavy prejudice at the time, that one person in one field, that they should always stick to it and never go out of it. So he was, you know, he was not getting his due.
It seems like he's had more recognition as an artist since then.
Yeah. After John's passing, the first thing I thought was... well, I have to finish Milk and Honey [eds. note: the album she made with Lennon]. But after that, I thought we should do something about John's artwork. So I got these professional people who create that kind of program, and that worked very well. Now his work is shown in many places.
Both you and John were musicians as well as visual artists. Did you draw a distinction between the two, or were they two sides of the same creative process
We didn't have any plans about it. When John did artwork, he just did it, and I did things that way, too. It worked very well that way.
It seems that the two of you learned a lot from each other. What did you learn from John, as an artist, and what do you think he learned from you
Well, I don't know what he picked up from me. I think that the fact that we were together did something, probably, but I wasn't doing the kind of artwork that he was doing, and he wasn't doing the kind of artwork that I was doing. That was very lucky. [Laughs] We didn't fight about it.
Are there different aspects of his personality that came through in his visual art, rather than his music
I think so. Rock 'n' roll is a different animal. There's a kind of macho element that they tried to bring out. He did create many beautiful, sweet songs as well. Actually, when he did something really macho it was great. [Laughs] With John, he just liked to [make art] like he was a little child. Actually, when he was a little child, he did incredible, cynical stuff that most people would never think was done by a child. He was extremely developed in that way already. You could put it in a newspaper or something like that. When we met and we were together, he was mostly very happy about the fact that we were together. Then Sean was born. All that affected him. He really felt, I think, good about it, and that comes out in his work. But also, there was still some little cynical stuff in there, too. It was very, very interesting watching that.
You and Sean are the subjects of a lot of his pieces. In John's music at the time, it seemed like he was really striving to find some sort of happiness, but in his artwork, there's a feeling of contentment already.
I was kind of embarrassed that we were almost the only subject matter. Something was coming out of him very naturally at the time, so I wasn't going to stop it. Many artists before him and after him have used their wives or children as subject matter. Because they were together, and it was very easy. I think that he just felt that he wanted that side of him to come outhis love for his life, which he didn't have very much of before we were together. He was celebrating that.
How do you choose which pieces of his to show or publish
I always think that I have to choose something that would really represent John, in a way. But it's all that. I just realized that he was, not just prolific, but so good. When he was doing something, he just did it, but extremely fast. I enjoyed watching it over his shoulder. Anything I chose to put in an art show, or something like that, I was really in love with that particular drawing or serigraph or whatever. The reason why I could just love his work, hands down, was because the way he created artwork was so different from me. We had very different kinds of formats. Like I said before, there was no competition. I just loved the things that I could never have done.
Paul McCartney recently told Esquire UK that he's a little dissatisfied with the way that Beatles songs are all credited to Lennon-McCartney, even if John didn't contribute to them. What do you think about that
Well, I'm sure he has so many painful memories. Somebody who was very close to him as a partner passed away. At the time, John was only 40, and none of us thought he was going to go. That must have been a great shock to Paul as well. I think that he's also a very sensitive artist, so instead of expressing his sorrow in a direct sort of way... He just wanted to say some things that he didn't want to say, probably, but he just said it.
