Army to gun down with Fijian power
The Sri Lanka Army Sports Club founded in 1961 is a Division A rugby union team based in Sri Lanka that plays in the Dialog Rugby League in Sri Lanka. In 1961 Army SC together with Division B teams from Air Force, Navy, Police SC and University were permitted to play alongside the Division A clubs, Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club, Colombo Hockey and Football Club, Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbula Athletic & Cricket Club, Dickoya-Maskeliya Cricket Club, Uva and Kelani Valley Club in the Clifford Cup competition.
The expanded competition, allowed all thirteen clubs to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the season the best eight teams went on to play in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup.
In 1973 Army SC, captained by S.P. de Silva, shared the Clifford Cup with Police SC following a 19-all draw. It wasnt until 1975, under Saliya Udugama, that Army SC won the Clifford Cup outright for the first time by beating Air Force SC 43. In 1978 the Clifford Cup was awarded to the League champions and the knockout competition was played for SLRFU Presidents Trophy. In 1979 Army SC won the Presidents Trophy at Galle Face, led by Daya Ratnayake, beating a strong Havelock Sports Club 213. In 1981 Army won the Presidents Trophy again under the captaincy of John Senaweera.
Army SC this season will be captained by their hardy third row forward Manoj Silva. Former Vidyartha College Kandy centre Imanka Ariyapala will be his deputy and will continue to play as centre.
The soldiers have a very good young and experience player combination that will perform very well in the upcoming season. They are actually in the team building stage. Their aim this season will be to at least finish third or fourth in the league and to reach the semi-final stage of the Clifford Cup knockout.
The new players who will boost Army are former Police, Up Country Lions and CR & FC full back Shanaka Kumara, Peterite winger Kamesh Fernando, Dinusha Nilanga Ariyapala, younger brother of vice captain Imanka Ariyapala, fly half Ashan Bandara of Vidyartha College Kandy and full back Bavantha Perera of St. Sylvesters College Kandy.
For the second successive year Army will be coached by famous Papua New Guinea national coach Fijian Fereti Verebula. Having the services of a foreign coach for the season will boost Army SC as Verebula has vast experience in the coaching field where he was a part of the Papua New Guinea national 7s team and also had a coaching stint in New-Zealand premiership team. His fellow countryman Imanueli Veikoso called Rathu (Red) among players and official of Army rugby will be the fitness trainer.
Army Rugby Squad : Manoj Silva (captain), Rasika Abeynayake, Dinesh Suranga, Nissanka Perera, Yohan Dilshan, Asoka Jayalal, Aravinda Karunaratne, Shanaka Kumara, Thirusha Adikaram, Nishantha Kobbekaduwa, Thushara Perera, Mohamed Akram, Widurangalage Udara, Upul Abeyratne, Eranda Piyatilleke, Sampath Roshan, Sajith Melan, Danushka Malith, Migara Madugalle, Danushka Malith, Asitha Yasasmin, Rizvi Mohamed, Sahan Umagaliya, Imanka Ariyapla, Victor Pradeep, Isuru Shantha, Asela Wijesinghe, Madushan Chandrasekara, Sameera Bulathsinghala, Gayan Salinda, Kamesh Fernando, Dinusha Nilanga Ariyapala, Ashan Bandara, Bavantha Perera, Sudaraka Dikkumbura.

Benedictine athletes finish 2016 season on a high
St Benedicts College lay claim to be the unofficial number one athletic team for the year 2016 displacing Maris Stella College, Negombo by winning four important titles and finishing close runners up in two other events.
The Benedictines started the year winning the Colombo Zonal Athletic Championship convincingly beating all other leading schools. Next they annexed the Western Province Athletic Championship, the province being the strongest in the country and followed it up by winning the glamour event of the schools athletics calendar - the All Island Schools Relay Carnival at Bogambara, Kandy. They then capped it all with a glorious victory at the
Sir John Tarbet Junior Athletic Championship held at the Mahaweli Embilipitiya Stadium last month where over 7000 athletes from every nook and corner of the country took part, displaying the immense interest and the wealth of talent available in this country, which if properly harnessed could easily make Sri Lanka the best in Asia.
The Benedictines finished close runners-up at the All Island Schools Athletic Meet and the Sir John Tarbet Senior Athletic meet mainly due to injuries to some of their top athletes. However that has to be accepted as injuries are part and parcel of sports. The Bens also won the inaugural Josephian Relay Championship.
The hallmark of the Benedictine success has been their strategy of approaching every event as a Team. Efforts made to instill this idea into the minds of the athletes are bearing fruit with the juniors in particular.
The seniors are taking a little more time to imbibe it fully. However their total domination in the relay events shows that they are moving in the right direction. At the Junior Tarbet meet their victory was entirely a team effort with just one individual gold together with other placings, a strong contribution from relays and substantial amount of points gathered through the merit points earned by the juveniles, namely under 13s and under 12s they managed to chalk up 64 points - 11 points ahead of St. Josephs College with Maris Stella College a distance third.
The Benedictine star athlete Sahan Rajapaksa was unfortunately sidelined for most part of the season with a leg injury. He should come back strong and fit in 2017. The emerging stars of 2016 were the all round athlete Avishka Dananjaya Ratnayake, a brilliant hurdler, long jumper and a sprinter, the junior sprint champion Santhus Weerasinghe, who won 2 Golds at an international meet in Russia and, the Gold medal winner of under 15 Discus throw Sasanka Wijesinghe.
The athlete who should be mostly credited for the teams success is the captain Shiran Angelo Jeganathen, who led by example and being a source of great strength to the indomitable Master in Charge and Junior coach Nuwan Abeywickrema. Team mentor Old Ben Sriyal de Silva, an outstanding past athlete and All Island Schools coloursman made a significant contribution towards bringing St. Benedicts College to the top in the schools athletic scene, working very closely with the sport co-ordinator Rev. Brother Pravin Vaz, coaching and support staff and taking care of the needs of the individual athletes. Rev Brother Director Henry Dissanayake and Benedictines in Sri Lanka and overseas have readily supported and closely followed the progress of the team.

Western oil giant looks set to return to Iran and its gas fields
Patrick Pouyanne, Chairman and CEO of French energy company Total visits the Shetland Gas Plant on May in the Shetland Islands.
French oil giant Total is expected to sign a deal Tuesday with Iran to develop the country's largest natural gas field, paving the way for Western oil companies' return to the Persian Gulf country.
Total would be the first European integrated oil company to sign a contract to develop Iranian oil or gas assets after the lifting of sanctions on Tehran earlier this year.
The deal would also advance Iran's goal of tapping its vast oil and natural gas reserves, which are the fourth and second largest in the world, respectively. Total and other European energy giants began pulling out of Iran in 2008 as the international community ratcheted up sanctions on the country over its nuclear program. CNBC

Vinod Weerasinghe wins Gold Division in dramatic finish
Vinod Weerasinghe annexed the champion's trophy in the Gold Division,(age category 15-17+) when the Prima Regional Junior Open Golf Championship was concluded at the scenic Nuwara Eliya golf course recently.
After two rounds, there was a 3-way tie for the lead between Armand Flamer Caldera, Taniya Minel and Vinod Weerasinghe, all bunched on 167.
Champion Vinod takes his aim
The tie for the lead, forced a Sudden-death Play-Off to decide the winner and on the 2nd Sudden death hole Armand bowed out, leaving Taniya Minel and Vinod to fight it out. The 3rd sudden death hole was halved and the 4th sudden death hole (18th) saw Taniya sitting pretty to make a Putt from about 8 to win. Vinod was three off the green and danger looming. However, Vinod displayed a calm and collected attitude to chip into the hole from off the green, piling the pressure on Taniya Minel to hole the Putt for a half, which was too much pressure for the 14-year-old, who proved her potential standing up to the boys with a great performance. Vinod deserved victory having lost out in a similar sudden death play-off to Armand Flamer Caldera in the Regional Junior Open played in Victoria Golf & Country Resort in August.
In the Silver Division, age category 12 -14+, Yevin Samarartne studying in Australia displayed great skill to overcome another rising star Kayla Perera to win the division by one stroke over the two rounds.
Nirekh Tejwani beat Danushan by one stroke to win the Bronze Division, well clear of the rest of the field. The Bronze Division was worked off over two rounds of 13 holes per round.
N.W.G. Shanal Binushka was the clear winner in the 9 & under age category, Copper Division beating the runner up by 12 strokes.
The two round aggregate over 9 holes of 93 was very impressive.
Results:
Gold Division: 15-17+
Winner: Vinod Weerasinghe (Sudden Death play-off) 167*, 1st Runner-up  Taniya Minel, 2nd Runner-up  Armand Flamer Caldera

Opportunity beckons
When the national selectors named Upul Tharanga as the replacement for injured captain Angelo Mathews for the ongoing Test series against Zimbabwe there was a mixed reaction to it. Some were of the opinion why the selectors should fall back on a tested and tried cricketer while some thought that he was too old (forgetting that he was still in his early thirties) and past his prime and the place should have gone to a youngster.
Well, as things have panned out Tharanga has started to repay the faith the selectors had kept in him by scoring a century in the first Test and following it up with another important knock of 79 in the current second Test. On the first occasion Tharanga batting at Mathews position at number five contributed a useful 110 not out enabling Sri Lanka to build on partnerships in the lower order and get to a match winning score of 537.
In the second Test his half-century proved invaluable as it once again provided the team with a base to reach 500 plus for the second time in the series. He came to bat with Sri Lanka not too comfortably placed at 84-3 and forged a partnership of 143 with Dhananjaya de Silva that helped the side to recover to 255 for five and finally post a 500 plus total. Tharanga in fact became the first victim of the Decision Reviewing System (DRS) which made its debut in Zimbabwe in the ongoing second Test when he was caught at slip off the wicket-keepers pads  a decision which was initially negatived by the umpire but challenged by Zimbabwe was over turned.
It was not Tharangas fault that the century he scored in the first Test at Harare was his first in ten years after his 165 against Bangladesh at Bogra in 2006. It is the longest gap between Test centuries by a player since the Second World War. Since making his debut against India in 2005 Tharangas had a rather lopsided Test career. He was within the framework till 2007 after which his form fell away and he was more in the limelight as a one-day cricketer. He returned to Test cricket after seven years in 2014 with a solid knock of 83 against South Africa blunting the threat posed by Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander, Morne Morkel and Imran Thahir at Galle. But failed to hold his place appearing in only a further five Tests in the next two years before the current Zimbabwe series where he has been picked to strengthen the middle order. Primarily Tharanga came into the national side as an opening batsman and to his credit it must be stated that despite the ups and downs he has gone through in his career which would have made any other cricketer hang up his boots he has continued to play the game scoring heavily in domestic cricket and his selection to the Test side against Zimbabwe is due reward for his persistency and commitment.
Tharangas only 31 but having broken into international cricket at the age of 20 it seems that he has been around for so long to some because his appearances for the national team in Tests and ODIs have been rather sporadic. He is at an age where a cricketer peaks in his career and one hopes the Zimbabwe tour is the turning point.
Following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan, Sri Lanka needs a player of Tharangas caliber and experience in the team to not only strengthen the batting but also provide invaluable insight and input to team strategies etc.
Following the form he has displayed in Zimbabwe Tharanga has been further rewarded by the selectors by being asked to captain his country in the one-day tri-series (featuring Zimbabwe and West Indies) which follows the two Tests as Mathews and his deputy Dinesh Chandimal are still recovering from their injuries and are unavailable for selection.
Tharanga has captaincy experience having led NCC (a club he has represented since the age of 15 from Dhrmasoka College, Ambalangoda) to become the Premier league champions in 2013-14 and also led Ruhuna in the inter-provincial tournament.
A naturally gifted left-hander Tharanga is the second batsman in the world to be involved in a double century plus partnership in ODI cricket seven times, the only other player to achieve that feat being Ricky Ponting of Australia. He holds the world record first wicket partnership in ODI cricket of 286 with Sanath Jayasuriya, the present chairman of selectors as well as the second highest partnership for the same wicket of 282 with Tillakaratne Dilshan. Tharangas innings of 174 (not out) against India at Kingston in 2013 remains the second highest individual ODI score for Sri Lanka after Jayasuriyas 189 also against India.
Tharangas career has also had its downside. He has bitter sweet memories of having lost his family home to the 2004 tsunami including all his cricketing gear which Sangakkara graciously replaced and, being slapped with a three-month ban after being tested positive for a banned substance during the 2011 World Cup.
When Sangakkara retired from Test cricket, it was to Tharanga that the national selectors turned to fill the all important number three slot in the batting, but he could not fulfill that task.
Tharangas career has been full of opportunities of this nature which he has not been able to grab and cement his place in the team. The current tour of Zimbabwe is another that has come his way and one hopes this will be the turning point of his rather chequered career.

Karting stars Ashvitha, Maryse represent Sri Lanka in Malaysia
Sri Lankan karting stars Ashvitha Wickrama and Maryse Navaratne are taking part in the worlds first all-women extreme 4x4 challenge, SHEMUD 2016 that began on Saturday and conclude on November 11.
Hailed as being the female version of the world-renowned Rainforest Challenge (RFC), this years competition will bring together 10 fearless, all-female teams from around the world to take on the thick jungles of Malaysia.
Veteran Sri Lankan 4x4 driver Sean Hameed, the representative for RFC in Sri Lanka, was tasked by SHEMUD International to find two suitable female drivers to represent Sri Lanka in this grueling four wheel drive challenge, set in the thick of the rainforest in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, under extreme monsoon conditions to boot.
Familiar with her racing background and confident of her abilities, Sean approached Ashvitha with the SHEMUD proposal, and with the blessing of her father Pubudu Wickrama (a veteran Sri Lankan rallying champion and four-wheel-drive enthusiast himself), she accepted the challenge without hesitation.
Ashvithas first task was to find a Co- driver who was willing to take on the demanding competition beside her, and her first choice was Maryse Navaratne who also jumped at the opportunity. Already notorious figures in the Sri Lankan karting circuit as the 2015 Ladies category Champion and Runner-up respectively, Ashvitha and Maryse are teammates on Devils On Wheels, the countrys first all-female karting team.

India threatens to cancel England Test in funds row
NEW DELHI: Indias cricket board threatened Tuesday to cancel the first Test against England, less than 24 hours before it was due to begin, unless judges lift a freeze on its bank accounts.
The supreme court last month ruled that the board would have to seek prior approval from a special panel investigating its governance in order to release funds to state associations which host Test matches.
But in a petition filed to the apex court on the eve of the start of the first Test in Rajkot, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said the order meant it was impossible to cover the matchs running costs.
Unless money is disbursed to the board, the match between India and England cant take place, said the petition, which is due to be heard later in the day.
The court slapped the restrictions on the BCCIs accounts after the board failed to implement a series of reforms that had been recommended by a panel headed by a former top judge, Rajendra Mal Lodha.
The Lodha panel has accused BCCI officials of behaving like lords, after they repeatedly ignored the deadlines to implement reforms of what is world crickets wealthiest and most powerful board.
In its submission challenging Tuesdays petition, the panel said that the BCCI was in contempt of court by not implementing its recommendations which include age limits for office-holders.
The BCCI had earlier complained that the funding freeze was hampering organisation for a series last month against New Zealand, but the three Tests went ahead as scheduled in the end.
The BCCI has insisted it is not running away from implementing the reforms after scandals including accusations of corruption and match-fixing that tarnished the Indian Premier League (IPL), a glitzy Twenty20 tournament run by the board.
India and England are due to play five Test matches in November and December as well as a limited over series early in the new year.
Both teams are already in Rajkot and have been already been holding nets ahead of the start of the series. The respective captains Virat Kohli and Alastair Cook are expected to hold press conferences later Tuesday. AFP

The match was played in four 20-minue quarters and the winners led in all four quarters (1st: 12-6, 2nd: 36-6, 3rd: 43-11) before the final tally.

Baby Boycott Hameed to make England debut
RAJKOT: Teen sensation Haseeb Hameed will make his Test debut against India, England announced Tuesday, capping a fairytale rise for a player dubbed the Baby Boycott for his uunflappable batting style.
At 19 years, Hameed will become the youngest player to open the batting in Englands Test history after skipper Alastair Cook named him in the starting XI for the series-opener beginning in Rajkot on Wednesday.
To average 50 in Division One (of the English county championship) as a 19-year-old is an incredible feat, Cook said of Hameed, who has drawn comparisons to batting legend Geoff Boycott for his solid technique and knack of playing lengthy innings.
I remember how hard it was and I was nowhere near the player he is at 19, Cook said at the pre-match press conference.
Cook, 31, also sought to dampen speculation about his future as Englands Test skipper after admitting that he could quit following the current tour of India.
He was speaking in response to his interview in this months Cricketer magazine in which he said he did not know how much longer he would carry on at the helm, saying the end could come after the India series.
Ever since the Sri Lanka series before the 2015 World Cup I have been open and said well take it series by series, Cook said.
When someone asks For how long you see yourself as the captain ... I said I dont know, it could be two months which could be the end of this series or it could be six months or the next one or two years, he said.
This is the kind of answer I gave and obviously headlines have been made. But my situation hasnt changed... So to me, its business as usual. Its a mountain out of a molehill. The left-handed opener, who is set to break Michael Athertons record of 54 Tests as England captain in Rajkot, stopped short of naming the playing XI since he said he had not had a good look at the wicket.
But he said Ben Duckett, who opened in the last Test against Bangladesh, would drop down the order to accommodate Hameed while the struggling Gary Ballance has been dropped.
Hameeds first cap comes on the back of an impressive 1,455 first-class runs from 20 games and some strong shows in recent England warm-up matches.
Hes incredibly unflappable, said Cook, lavishing praise on the youngster who has an Indian-born father.
He looks a very good player of spin. He picks length very well and uses the crease well, both forward and back.
Stuart Broad bowled at him last summer and was almost straight on the phone to me saying how impressed he was with this guy.
Its really exciting. Of course there are going to be some tough moments for him over the next few years of playing Test cricket, but this guy can play. Indian skipper Virat Kohli meanwhile said he would not be haunted by past failures against England, having scored just 322 runs in 17 Test match innings against them.
When India toured England in 2014, Kohli averaged just 13 as India lost the series 3-1 in what was the low point of an outstanding career. It was a phase when I did not perform too well, Kohli said.
It was England but it could have been any other country in the world. It made me realise that I need to up my game.
I am thankful to England as I have been a very improved cricketer from thereon. I just take it (that phase) as a setback in my career. AFP

Male journalist wins IOCs Women and Sport award
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, Monday  An Ethiopian journalist on Monday became the first man to win an Olympic award aimed at promoting women and sport.
Dagim Zinabu Tekle claimed the honour as founder of a radio programme designed to encourage women and girls to become more involved in sport and to pursue their goals and dreams.
First awarded in 2000 the Women and Sport trophy was handed over to Tekle by International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach in Lausanne.
Tekles programme has invited 12,580 guests - sports leaders, coaches, professionals and sportswomen engaged in local and international womens sports activities - on it since it was first aired five years ago.
This has significantly raised awareness among the public of the achievements and success of these women, the IOC said. As well as Tekles global honour there were five continental awards handed out in Lausanne - including to Australia former womens international footballer Moya Dodd, for championing womens rights in Oceania. Other recipients were Rwandan Felicite Rwemarika (Africa), American Carole Oglesby (Americas), Maria Leonor Estampador (Asia) and Denmarks Majken Maria Gilmartin (Europe).
Bach commented: These Women and Sport Awards are very important because without these personalities whom we are honouring, the athletes could not achieve their goals.
These personalities have assisted and inspired athletes.
They have been fighting for the right of the female athletes, they have encouraged them.
We are extremely grateful to them. AFP
