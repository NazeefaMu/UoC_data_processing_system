No suspense, no tension
Bryan Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse takes us back in history to the origin of the X Men. The setting is a classroom, and a teacher lectures middle school students. The year in discussion is 1973, when the vigilante mutant Mystique accidentally exposed her kind to the rest of the world.
Unfortunately, Singer's latest venture to the X-Men universe has its sights set lower than the altering of history. This is to be expected since Days of Future Past drew a lot of its power from the need for revisionism, especially after Brett Ratner's blood-thirsty X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006.
Psylocke, Apocalypse and Magneto
The success formula of the previous two X-Men reboots is the fact that both did not comprise a villain. X-Men: First Class saw the story of two gifted friends who meet at a crossroad of history and become great friends.
Central antagonist
The issue with X-Men: Apocalypse is that Singer could have taken the story to so many directions but still chooses an overly hackneyed one. Almost all the stunts involved in the film set off a dj vu aura.
A feature to note is that the latest villain of the series has nothing unique about him. He is vaguely alien and has been waiting to take his vengeance from mankind for a long time. Named En Sabah Nur, aka Apocalypse he wishes to cleanse the earth of the weak and rebuild it anew. He is the central antagonist, the ancient mutant who rises from the pyramids, an archetypal villain that has no organic connection with the first two movies. It feels like an excuse to bring the X-Men back into action. This factor has been present in almost all the superhero movies up-to-date.
The film opens in 3000 BC Egypt. We see a supernatural force shaking up a pyramid. As bodies are buried under what seems like a catastrophe, we are left confused about what exactly happened. A dazzling time travel through the birth of Christ and other political and cultural signposts bring us to the 1980s. When the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur wakes up thousands of years later sending vibrations across the earth, it changes the lives of the X-Men, who are living in peace.
Diverse powers
The film is best when engaging its actors' strengths. Each superhero has diverse powers. One of the most entertaining events of the movie is when Quicksilver comes to the rescue. His episodes of rescuing students and a dog from Professor Xaeviers school is a joy to watch. Even the cast's new additions: Sophie Turner as telepath Jean Grey and Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, alias Cyclops seem equipped to give their roles some depth of feeling.
James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, and Evan Peters play some of the other significant roles
Though the movie is a shade darker than the previous ones. It recycles most of the most elements of the earlier two films: family, friendship and the eternal question if mutants are better humans than humans themselves.
If you are a great X-Men fan, you will enjoy this movie. Otherwise you will feel like you are seeing fragments of some superhero films you have already seen in the past. X-Men: Apocalypse is screening at Majestic Cineplex and Savoy theatre.

A Flying Jattsimilar to KRRISH
Tiger Shroff admires Hrithik Roshan. The young actor believes he has studied the star so much that it reflects in his performance at times.
In a candid chat with DNA, the Baaghi star said that the poster of his next, A Flying Jatt, gives off Krrish like vibes. "I didn't do this on purpose, but if you notice the first look of 'A Flying Jatt' and an old poster of 'Krrish,' the body language looks a lot similar. I guess I have studied him so much that I feel like him sometimes," the daily quoted him as saying.
The posters of A Flying Jatt and Krrish may appear similar, but the story is way different.
"I admire him so I think about him like that  maybe think about how he would have stood, how he would have danced or said something in a particular scene," he elaborated.
However, Tiger doesn't play the crime-fighting, people-saving caped crusader in A Flying Jatt. He gets to fall in love with Jacqueline Fernandez and even break a leg with her. Directed by Remo D'Souza, the film is scheduled to arrive in theatres on August 25. IBT

Murray wins record fifth Queens title
Britains Andy Murray dismantled Milos Raonics huge serve to become the first man to win the Queens Club title five times.
Raonic led by a set and 3-0 before Murray became the first player this week to break the Canadians serve, doing so twice in succession.
The top seed and defending champion went on to win 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 6-3.
The Scot overtakes the likes of John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Roy Emerson with five Aegon Championships titles.
McEnroe was courtside for the final in his role as coach to Raonic, with the Americans old adversary Ivan Lendl in the opposite corner after rejoining the Murray camp this week.
It was nice of him to stick around for the presentation, Murray joked after seeing that Lendl had quickly left the court.
It was obviously a good first week back together.
Burst of brilliance gives Murray victory
Murray, 29, had said beforehand that the final would come down to fleeting chances, and it was Raonic who was the more clinical early on.
Neither man could fashion a break point in an opening 12 games of high-class grass-court tennis.
Raonic, 25, took charge of the tie-break with three sharp volleys that suggested McEnroe is already having an influence, and despite Murray getting back to 5-5, the Canadian edged it with a forehand winner on his first set point.
It was a blow to Murray having played a good first set and Raonic appeared to land the killer blow with a break at the start of the second.
But just as McEnroe was on his feet to celebrate, Lendl remained as predictably motionless over the next hour or so as his man turned the match around in spectacular style.
Raonic looked to have a 4-1 lead in the second set, only for Hawk-Eye to overrule a volley on game point, and Murray took charge from then on.
A brilliant backhand return winner by the Scot finally ended Raonics run of service games, and two games later the Canadian was run ragged as Murray broke again with a forehand deep into the corner.
The Queens Club crowd was now roaring on the champion, and with Raonic offering up more second serves to attack, Murray broke again at the start of the third with a magnificent drop shot in a 24-stroke rally.
As he had done all week, Murray grew stronger with the finish line in sight, serving superbly and breaking for a fourth time when Raonic dumped a volley in the net on the third match point.
Coming out here to try and win for the fifth time I was really motivated, said Murray. AFP

Jones hails Englands victory over Australia
Melbourne, Australia, Sunday: Englands rearguard victory over Australia showed the tactical flexibility they need to conquer world rugby, coach Eddie Jones says.
Jones side made nearly four times as many tackles as the Wallabies and had less than a third of both territory and possession, but secured a series-clinching 23-7 win in Melbourne.
We had to play rope-a-dope, said Jones.
We have to be tactically flexible in Test rugby. Thats why Im so pleased.
He added: Other sides will have 60% possession and we have to be able to score points with that possession - then well be a really, really good team.
Rope-a-dope was a term coined by boxing great Muhammad Ali after he absorbed a barrage of blows from George Foreman during their 1974 Rumble in the Jungle fight before knocking out his exhausted opponent.
England have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series before next weekends final Test in Sydney. It is the first time England have won a series in Australia. But Jones says that his side must focus on whitewashing the Wallabies - just as he believes world champions New Zealand would. The boys started talking about it on the field and were committed to doing that. We want to be the best team in the world, added Jones.
If the All Blacks were in this situation now, what would they be thinking Theyd be thinking 3-0. If we want to be the best team in the world, we have to think 3-0.
Captain Dylan Hartley backed up his coachs words when asked about the possibility of a 3-0 series win. Why not Were a team who want to improve and be number one in the world, said the Northampton hooker. AFP

Spain booked the final mens team place at the Olympic Games by winning the repechage tournament in Monaco on Sunday, shocking favourites Samoa in the final.
Only last month, Samoa won the Paris leg of the World Sevens Series, beating the mighty Fiji -- who would later secure the overall crown -- in the final. But Spain scored a last-gasp try through Ignacio Martin to beat the Pacific Islanders 22-19 and book their ticket for Rio in August.
I am still trying to take it in, said Angel Lopez, one of Spains players.
This is a dream for us. We are going to be Olympians. We believed that we are good enough, but wow, this is pretty special.
We now have a month to prepare for Rio 2016. We will be very motivated and determined to do our nation, our family and Spanish rugby proud.
Spain had led 12-0 through tries from Carron Llorens and Hernandez Jimenez before Samoa hit back to lead 14-12 at the break. Samoa extended that to 19-12 before Pol Plas score gave Spain a chance and Martin did the rest.
Spain take the 12th and final spot and will compete in Rio alongside Fiji, South Africa, New Zealand, Great Britain, Australia, USA, Argentina, France, Kenya, Japan and hosts Brazil. AFP

Gayle and Jayawardene star for Somerset
LoNdon, Sunday: Chris Gayle and Mahela Jayawardene were both in the runs as Somerset beat Hampshire by six wickets in the South Division of English county crickets Twenty20 Blast at Taunton on Sunday.
West Indies batsman Gayle struck three typically huge sixes and four fours on his way to 52 before the left-hander was bowled by Will Smith.
Jayawardene, who retired from Sri Lanka duty after last years World Cup, then saw Somerset to their modest target of 134 with an unbeaten 45 off 32 balls, including a six and six fours.
Somersets Jamie Overton and Max Waller had earlier taken four wickets each as Hampshire were dismissed for a modest 133.
Overton, a pace bowler, took the wickets of Hampshire opener Michael Carberry (17), skipper James Vince (10), West Indies all-rounder Darren Sammy (nought) and Gareth Berg (four) at a cost of just 22 runs, while leg-spinner Waller took four for 33.
Elsewhere New Zealand wicket-keeper Luke Ronchis 53 helped Warwickshire beat Lancashire by 18 runs under the Duckworth/Lewis method at Edgbaston.
Yorkshire claimed their first Blast win of the season, by the narrowest margin as they defeated Derbyshire by one run in a rain-marred match at Headingley.
Chasing Derbyshires total of 153 for nine, Yorkshire, faced only nine overs but reached 67 for three, which was the precise score they needed to secure a win under the Duckworth/Lewis method.
Former England opener Adam Lyth hit two sixes and three fours in a 16-ball 30 and New Zealands Kane Williamson made 21 off 20 deliveries faced.

Losing to Morocco was a shocker  chief selector Jayasekara
Michael Jayasekara, chairman of Sri Lanka rugby selection committee said that losing to Morocco was a shocker following Sri Lankas disappointing performance at the mens Olympic sevens rugby competition of the repechage event in Monaco.
Chief rugby selector Michael Jayasekara
The losing margins were huge and losing to Germany and Canada is acceptable because they are ranked in the top five but the loss against Morocco was a shocker as well as against South Korea. We have beaten the Koreans many times in the Asian Sevens circuit, Jayasekera told the Daily News.
I think Muthuthantri did all what he could as captain and I believe we are still not ready and up to the mark to face this kind of an opposition. Especially the European sides, which are really big in physique where we are really small.
In the Monaco tournament the size was a huge factor. We need to wait till the team and the coaching staff returns to the island to see what really happened. We also need to check who had performed and who had not.
When it comes to an Olympic sport event everybody wants to compete with each other to book a place to take part because its the most prestigious event happening in the whole world. Winning a medal at this event is the hallmark of any living sportsmans dream, Jayasekara said.
Meanwhile the dejected Sri Lankan side that lost all their matches on the first day dished out a much improved performance yesterday to beat Mexico 22-19 with tries coming from Kanchan Ramanayaka- two, Srinath Sooriyabandara and Jason Dissanayaka one try each with Sooriyabandara making one conversion.
In their final match against South Korea the Lankans gave a superb fight back and after scores were deadlocked at 24 all, lost in the final minute by 31-24 due to a last ditch try scored by Kim and Oh slotting down the conversion. With this win South Korea finished in 13th place.
For the Sri Lankans Jason Dissanayaka scored two breath taking tries and Danushka Ranjan and Richard Dharmapala scored a try apiece. Sooriyabandara put over two conversions. - (WAI)
