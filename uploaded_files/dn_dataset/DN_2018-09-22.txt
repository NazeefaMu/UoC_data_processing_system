Construction field booms despite material shortages
The construction field has developed immensely even though its stakeholders lack raw materials and bear prices increases in the field, Geological Survey & Mines Bureau (GSMB) Technological Services Institute Chief Executive Officer S.T. Kalubandara said.
The demand for river sand is increasing. When supply is inadequate to address the demand, illegal suppliers come to fore to meet their targets. They cause irreparable damage to environment and water sources by excavating sands and felling trees. We have a pilot project that introduces, Manampitiya sand packed in 10,25 and 50 kilogram bags at a reasonable price.
A number of selected hardware dealers in the Western Province sell them. Now we transport the Manampitiya sand to Colombo in bulk and in cubes. We are now looking for suitable land to start the business properly,Kalubandara said.
Kalubandara said the country has sufficient sand deposits and around 28-30 million cubic meters of sand the field needs annually.
He said Trincomalee has a number of large sand deposits along the Mahaweli River at the Sittharu bridge area, and Uppathu River mouth area. We have got another project to process sea sand for construction. Our geologists. and excavating engineers expect to get technical and technological assistance from Japan, China, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Singapore among others to process sea sand. Once we succeed in this venture, it will be a turning point in the construction field and a boon to the economy, Kalubandara said.
GSMB geologist A.S. Jayakody said the public believe that no construction is possible without sand and metal.
He said that in developed countries highways are constructed on concrete beams. This system is more expensive but it saves building materials and carry long term benefits including easy maintenance, he said.
Some countries use timber for partition. They plant trees unabated to obtain timber. They use less building materials such as cement and sand, he said.

NE under representation caused ethnic issue
Governments that came to power since 1947 used peoples representatives in the North and East to secure their power and did not take action to create an environment for appropriate political representation that could have solved economic and development issues, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
President Sirisena was addressing the gathering after vesting with the people development projects completed under the Sirisara Pivisuma district development project, on Thursday.
The project is implemented under the guidance of President Sirisena to carry out a sustainable development in the Trincomalee district.
The President said under past governments, limited attention was paid to developmental needs of the people in the North and East. He said under representation in those provinces is among the main causes of the ethnic issue.
The President said for a certain district to achieve development targets, at least one Cabinet Minister should represent that district and through this, devolution of power would not divide the country.
The President, referring to the comprehensive programme implemented to renovate tanks across the country, said the development initiative of the government aims to uplift the economic standard of the rural community.
The President added that the people elected him as the President on January 8, 2015, to fulfill post-war obligations. The government committed to this within the past three and half years, the President said. He added that numerous tasks have been completed by the government to build national and religious reconciliation while eliminating anxiety and mistrust among the people in the war-affected areas.
President Sirisena said whatever the challenges faced by him, he would commit to the betterment of the country.
President Sirisena vested the Gomarankadawala Bakmeegama tank renovated under the Sirisara Pivisuma project with the public. He opened the 30 km-long electric fence to keep off elephants constructed as a pilot project in Gomarankadawala to provide a solution for the human-elephant conflict.
Renovation of tanks, constructing electric fences and renovating roads will be carried out under the Sirisara Pivisuma project implemented with the guidance of the President.
The project is implemented with the assistance of Sri Lanka Army.
The Presidents Office allocated Rs. 5,000 million for this project. By using the funds, 40 tanks were renovated in the district.
Unveiling the commemoration plaque and vesting the reconstructed reservoir with the public took place under the patronage of the President.
Later at a ceremony, the President presented medical equipment worth Rs. 30 million to the Base Hospital in Kantale.
They were presented to the Chief Medical Superintendent of the hospital Dr. D. G. M. Kostha.
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said Sri Lanka has obtained a leadership for people to live in prosperity, enjoying the benefits of peace and development.
He added that with such leadership, the nation would march forward as an advanced country.
Such a development process on behalf of the poverty-stricken people was non-existent in the country, said the Opposition Leader, adding that all should equally contribute to the development programme.
The elephant fence worth Rs. 21.2 million built at Gomarankadawala as a pilot project was opened by the President.
This would enable to reduce the damage caused by the human-elephant conflict in rural areas.
This is the first time when concrete beams are used replacing tree trunks for the fence. The beams are made by the Armed Forces.

Almanac case :Transfer application fixed for argument
The Transfer Application filed by former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa seeking an order staying any further proceedings into the almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was yesterday fixed for argument by Court of Appeal.
Meanwhile, Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench comprising Justice Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Justice Janak de Silva yesterday further extended its Interim Order staying any further proceeding into the controversial almanac case filed against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa before High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, until December 14.

Appreciations
K. L. Ariyananda of Mahaweli:Harnessed nature to serve mankind
Growing up in the shelter of a great human being who harnessed nature to serve mankind, my sibling and I had the mighty Mahaweli and the most optimistic era of post-independent Sri Lanka as a backdrop to measure us by.
In the shelter of the giant shade cast by my father, we grew to love this birth land of ours. Bowatenna, Ukuwela, Kotmale, Randenigala, Rantambe and Polgolla were childhood playgrounds. School vacations were spent in circuit Bungalows all over the island, which are nostalgic memories. Norton Bridge, Luxapana, Castlereigh and Maoussakele were our infant stamping grounds.
My father was a top technocrat who never misappropriated a cent of the millions that passed through his hands. He was a loving guru to a generation of young engineers at the CEB, CECB and Katubedda University. He was a man who moved with intellectuals but retained the common touch and had the most uninhabited sense of humour and camaraderie. Loyal to friends, he epitomized all that was good in the educational system set in place by epochal giants such as Sir Ivor Jennings and C. W. W. Kannangara.
The sobriquet of the Mahaweli is a much-vaunted one, but as many of his colleagues of that period would affirm, this honorific appellation uniquely fitted my father well.
A southern gentleman to his bootstraps or rather to the sandal straps, he favoured his ancestors who hailed from the deep Sothern village of Kamburugamuwa mentioned in the Kulavansa chronicles.
My father was Kamburugamuwa Lokuruge Ariyananda. Hereafter, referred to as KLA, with all due respect. He was born in Galle on May 22, 1932. His father K.L. Paulus, a government surveyor from Elliot Road was married to Yahathugoda Badalge Lasin Nanda from Millidduwa.
As a student of Mahinda College, he excelled in studies and sports such as cricket and boxing as well as cadetting. Having lost his father to an illness at 14 years, he moved to Ananda College, Colombo for higher studies. Entering the University of Colombo to study medicine, KLA soon realized that this was not his future and switched to a BSc Hons degree in engineering and was transferred to the new University of Peradeniya as part of the first batch of engineering students there.
Upon passing out in 1957 as an engineer, he further qualified himself as a Charted Engineer in Civil and Electrical fields and furthermore as a diplomat of the IEE (London).
Thereafter, KLA was appointed to the Laxapana Power Station, then under the Department of Electrical undertakings, the predecessor to the CEB. In 1961, he married my mother Kamala Indatissa from Dehiwala who studied at Kundasale Agriculture School and at USK in Wales, UK under a Commonwealth Scholarship and upon her return was teaching at Buddhist Ladies College.
Soon after marriage, my parent flew to UK, since KLA had received a Colombo Plan Scholarship as a graduate trainee. He received his training in Hydro Electric Machinery at North of Scotland HE Board and at Edinborough, Huddersfield and Festinog in North Wales. He returned with his pregnant wife, to have their eldest son (the writer).
KLA was appointed as an engineer at Wimalasurendra Power Station at Norton Bridge. In fact, my earliest memories are lush lawn and rose-filled gardens of the electrical engineers' bungalow at Norton Bridge surrounded by the misty mountains of the Sevensisters range. While at Norton, KLA was also involved in the Kelanitissa 50 MW oil-fired steam power station in Colombo. During this time, a daughter - Tanuja - and son - Jagath - joined the family.
From 1970-75, KLA was appointed the Chief Engineer (Mechanical and Electrical) at Mahaweli Development Board at Jawatta Colombo, where he was responsible for the conceptual design of a barrage across the Mahaweli River at Polgolla in Kandy. Also, he was involved in the supervision and installation of all equipment at the Bowantenna Diversionary project including the spillway and bulkhead gates tec. Designing of an operation room with a remote indication communication network to control the discharge of water to the irrigation system of the North Central Province still provide sustenance to the Raja Rata farmers. Preparation of a technical report for Samanalawawe 120 MW Hydropower stations and 100m high dam were other projects undertaken by KLA and his colleagues at MDB at this period in time.
The supervision of building the radial gates at Kalawewa and Dambulu Oya reservoirs was also undertaken for MDB and CECB by KLA. Supervisory Consultancy for installation of turbines at Canyon Power Station was done by KLA as Deputy General Manager (Mechanical and Electrical) at MDB.
In 1977, KLA decided to move to UK with his growing family of teenagers and baby daughter Tanju, as Senior Project Engineer with Kennedy and Donkin (K&D) Power System of Working Surrey. While at K&D, KLA undertook service as Senior Resident Engineer and Senior Design Engineer to a number of projects around the world, in countries as diverse as Spain, Turkey, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Malawi etc. During this period, he was seconded to Sri Lanka under special Cabinet approval as an expatriate Engineering Consultant to work at Kotmale, Randenigala, Rantambe, Victoria and Kukule Ganga projects. Setting up of Mahaweli Complex to coordinate and control all Mahaweli reservoirs and power stations was carried out by KLA as manager of the Mahaweli complex at Digana in Kandy.
Again back in UK during 1989-90, KLA was responsible for work undertaken in Malawi Southern Africa, Syria, Sudan, Spain and Ethiopia as well as the London underground rail system and at Enfield Power Centre.
In 1996, KLA was recalled to Sri Lanka and appointed by the then government to replace Dr. A.N.S. Kulasinghe who was retiring as the Chairman of the CECB. During his tenure at CECB, KLA was responsible for making the CECB one of the few profit-making government bodies. He initiated the Architect Unit at CECB where his youngest daughter Tanju, a Chartered Architect qualified both in UK and Sri Lanka now works.
Later, KLA was appointed as Vice Chairman and later Chairman of the CEB upon the request of the Engineers Union of the CEB to the then Minister of Power and Energy. In 2002, KLA retired from the CEB and founded his own company Power Consult Ltd. to develop mini-hydro projects. The first of which was commissioned at Kumburutenlawela in Belihuloya.
After a period of illness, KLA passed away under the loving care of his wife and children on September 22, 2017. Left behind hereafter, a shadow of this giant who harnessed nature to serve mankind is wife Kamala, sons Kapila and Jagath, and daughters Tanuja and Tanju, daughter-in-laws Sanji and Chamila and son-in-law Manu and five grandchildren.
May my father attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana that he so earnestly wished for by virtue of the development work he did to dispel darkness in his own land of birth and many other lands.
Son Kapila

CEJ calls for elephant management policy
The Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) has filed a writ application in the Court of Appeal calling for an effective elephant management policy in the country to minimize the human-elephant conflict in existence for decades causing around 50 - 80 human casualties each year and bringing down the elephant population from around 20,000 a century ago to 4,000 today.
CEJ Executive Director Hemantha Withanage said currently, there is no elephant management policy in the country which is the primary reason for the aggravation of the human-elephant conflict.
Surveys reveal that since 1950, a minimum of 4,200 elephants have perished in the wild due to the direct impact of the human-elephant conflict and in the past 12 years, 1,467 elephants were killed along with 670 humans.
The CEJ said on average, around 150 - 200 elephants die each year due to clearing of forests resulting in the loss of habitat, encroachment of villages, use of gunfire, hakkapatas, poisoning, electrocution and railway accidents along elephant corridors.
The highest number of human and elephant deaths due to the conflict was reported in 2016 with 89 human and 279 elephant deaths during the year, according to the Department of Wildlife. The death toll from the human-elephant conflict reached record highs with 375 human deaths and around 1,100 elephant deaths in the past five year.
The recent tragedy was the death of two calves and a pregnant mother hit by a train transporting oil at Habarana, the second jumbo tragedy in a month.
Wildlife experts said the construction of electric fences across reserves is no longer a deterrent for jumbos from entering villages as elephants get through these barriers by destroying the pillars.
Elephants have always held great cultural and religious significance in Sri Lanka and it is protected by law.
However, the giant is tortured being paraded at religious festivals and used as a tourist attraction for safaris.
Elephants are tied onto trees and iron pillars for long hours and are being used for logging and to hoist logs onto trucks which are crimes committed against animals, Withanage said.

Eight SLFP electoral organisers appointed
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday appointed eight new Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) electoral organisers by removing the electoral organisers who failed to support the partys reorganisation drive, SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said.
Prof. Piyadasa added that eight SLFP organisers representing the SLFP 15 Group, lost their organisership as they had failed to support the partys reorganising drive by establishing electoral organisations in their respective areas.
He said that new organisers were appointed to five districts including Ratnapura, Kurunegala and Colombo.
They received their appointment letters from the President last evening.
Piyadasa added that electoral organisers should actively get involved in the Partys reorganising process. Establishing electoral organisations (Pradeshiya Balamandala) at electoral level is a part of this reorganising process and all electoral organisers should extend their fullest cooperation to the party reorganisation drive to achieve success. Eight Parliamentarians representing the 15 Group were expelled from the post of organisers for failing to form Pradeshiya Balamandalaya (Electoral Organisations) as part of the reorganisation drive.
Therefore, Parliamentarians Susil Premajayantha, W.D.J Seneviratne, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Laksman Yapa Abeywardana, Chandima Weerakkodi and three others lost their electoral organisorships. So far, more than 150 SLFP Pradeshiya Balamandala have been established countrywide. Establishing Pradeshiya Balamandala is important so as to strengthen the party and to go to the next elections he added.
When asked whether the SLFP hopes to go to the next elections by forming a broad alliance with the United National Party (UNP),Piyadasa said that such a decision has not been taken as yet.
The party is being strengthened to face the forthcoming elections, including the Provincial Council Elections to be held in January.

The Education Ministry is planning to hold both the Advanced Level Examination and the Ordinary Level Examination in December aiming at increasing the number of school days, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The Ministry with the assistance of the Examination Department is engaging in forming a mechanism which would minimise the number of days deprived due to the holding of examinations separately, he added.
As a general practise, the Advanced Level Examination is held in August while the Ordinary Level Examination is held in December. After holding both examinations, certain schools are closed for some days for paper marking. This has had an impact on the normal school education, Minister Kariyawasam said.
With the new system, both examinations will be held in December with paper marking also done in December itself, he said.
He added that attention has been drawn on minimising the time taken to release results after holding examinations. By reducing the time for the release of exam results, they hope to pave the way for students to obtain a General Degree in their early twenties and a postgraduate or a doctorate by the time the student is around 25.

House suspends Wimal and Ranaweera
Joint Opposition MPs Prasanna Ranaweera and Wimal Weerawansa were suspended from Parliament for four weeks and two weeks respectively following a disciplinary inquiry on their misconduct in the House.
The two motions pertaining to the suspension were moved by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
Disciplinary action against the two MPs were based on the recommendations of the Parliament Privileges and Ethics Committee which probed into the tense situation that erupted in the House on July 3 due to continuous arguments on the controversial statement by former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran.
Committee Chairman Thilak Marapone presented the report of the inquiry to the House on September 5. The Committee perused the CCTV footage of the incident and summoned both the MPs before the Committee to show cause.
The Joint Opposition called for divisions for both motions. The motion on the suspension of MP Ranaweera received 41 votes for and 21 votes against. A total of 162 MPs were absent at the time of the vote including the JVP MPs. The JO and SLFP Group of 16 MPs voted against. TNA MPs Dharmalingam Sidarthan and S. Addeikkalanathan were the only TNA MPs present in the Chamber at the time of the vote and they voted for the motion along with the Government MPs. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were also present.
MP Ranaweera, who was present for the vote of his motion, tried to raise a Point of Order, but Speaker Karu Jayasuriya pointed out that no MP can speak when the quorum bell was ringing. Following the passage of the motion, MP Ranaweera was ordered to leave the Chamber before the next vote on MP Weerawansa. JO frontline MP Weerawansa was not seen in the Chamber yesterday. The motion against Weerawansa was passed with 39 votes for and 21 against.
The Speaker said the suspensions of Parliamentary service of the two MPs are effective from yesterday.
A formal complaint into the incident on July 3 was made in the House by Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera on July 4. Deputy Minister Perera brought to the attention of the House that the two JO MPs with their foul language and aggressive behaviour even threatened the Chair.
MP Ranaweera tried to grab the Mace.
The New Standing Orders of Parliament that came into effect from April 15 have provisions to impose four weeks suspension on any MP who touches the Mace during the sittings.

JANABALA COLOMBATA IN RETROSPECT
Looking back after the dust had settled on the Janabala Colombata attempted mass protest earlier this month, in the overall context of the SLPP / Joint Opposition politics, several factors become clear. Firstly, with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa throwing his hat into the ring as it were to be the political heir apparent of term limit barred Mahinda Rajapaksa, this was the reminder by the eldest offspring, that there is age limit barred sons also waiting in the wings. For young Namal Rajapaksa, this was his first foray into an attempted mass mobilization, he seemingly being more familiar with the more youthful forums of social media. Accordingly, in retrospect, the most charitable conclusion we can come to is that he just about made a simple pass, or a C, if one uses the American grading system.
Despite the grandiose claims of bringing about a hundred thousand supporters to Colombo and toppling the government, in some Sri Lankan version of the Arab Spring, ultimately the real count was five hundred and fifty hired buses, which even at an average of about eighty persons per bus, would put the headcount at around forty-five thousand people. Many buses did not come very full either. Not bad, but quite a bit less than what a major political party and even the SLPP would muster at its May Day rally. The multi-ethnic, multi-religious residents of the greater Colombo area, no particular fans of the Rajapaksas, did not join the Janabala event. Protestors were bussed into the city and bussed out. Further, it was clear, that there was no cohesively articulated political message of protest and mercifully no widespread anger or hostility at the government either. The protestors seemed more to have come for a day outing as it were, with liquor and entertainment if not food provided freely. The organisers seemed more versed in organising big match style revelry than mass agitation.
The more glaring weakness of the Janabala event was clearly young Namals inability to have sufficiently coalesced the entire Joint Opposition (JO) behind the move, let alone himself. Uncle Basil was in his dual nationality, the second home of the United States, rather indifferent to the whole exercise and while Uncle Gotabhaya made his mandatory appearance, it was both less than the full-blooded support that could have been expected. The elitist organisations backing Gotabhaya, in particular, played no part in the protest, no doubt more at home in their newer environments of five-star hotels than among the constituency whose interests they claim to want to represent and lead. Various JO stalwarts and front benches were critical of the exercise and the rather open drunkenness of the crowd and other logistical and organisational weaknesses couldnt allow them to be otherwise.
Mahinda Rajapaksas ndia visit and Hindu interview
From mass agitation to international relations, former President Rajapaksa found himself in New Delhi, ostensibly to deliver a lecture and secured a high-profile meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The most interesting feature of the visit to India was who the former President choose to accompany him, not his brother but rather eldest offspring Namal. Now, Namal was associated in the discussions with the Indian Premier and featured prominently in the photo ops. Reportedly the Premier was his genial self, telling the young Rajapaksa to consider India his second home.
The high profile Rajapaksa visit to India, though referred to as surprising by some political commentators in Colombo, is on the contrary unsurprising and necessary for the Rajapaksas as they focus on the elections due in 2020. Post-war, the Rajapaksa Administration in its second term, seemingly completely ignored Indias permeant geo-strategic interests in Sri Lanka and also forgot about Indias support for the war effort including the significant Indian intelligence and even operational assistance provided to sink the LTTE arms resupply vessels, which effectively brought about the end of the war. Instead, the Rajapaksas in the second term, swung Sri Lankas foreign policy from its decades-long, post-independence delicate balance between the two giants of India and China, firmly in Chinas direction. The reverberations of those policy decisions are still being felt in both Sri Lankas polity and especially the economy, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe having to deny, persistent reports that Sri Lanka was in a high-interest Chinese debt trap. It is unsurprising, therefore, that Mahinda Rajapaksa was to claim in 2015, that Indian state actors had played a role in his defeat. If that was the case, rebuilding bridges in the relationship is clearly in his political interest. However, the substantive issues for the Rajapaksa camp would be more problematic. They cannot undertake for instance to do what Mahathir Mohamad recently did in Malaysia and put a stop to a couple of billion dollars of Chinese projects and related high-interest debt.
The obvious counterweight to Chinas belt and road initiative in the Indian Ocean would be naval and maritime security cooperation with India as well as the Western nations. The obvious interlocutor for such a dialogue from the Rajapaksa camp would be former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa, but he was not included in the Rajapaksa family delegation to India.
Kumara Welgama opposes family bandyism
The other highlight of former President Rajapaksas visit to Delhi was the interview he gave to the prestigious Indian newspaper The Hindu. In that interview, asked about the SLPP / JO nominee for the next presidential election, in the context of himself being barred by term limits, the former president conceded that his brother is a contender and that his son Namal would still be constitutionally underage in 2020, the Sri Lankan constitution mandating that a presidential candidate be at least thirty-five years of age at the time of nomination.
Interestingly Mahinda did not mention the name of the brother who is a contender and seemingly considers the fact of being a Rajapaksa family member the pre-eminent requisite for securing the SLPP nomination. This was to result in a very public rebuke, via a radio interview by JO senior frontbencher and himself a distant contender for a top post, Kalutara District MP Kumara Welgama. Parliamentarian and former minister Welgama was scathing in his comments, that family bandyism led to Rajapaksas defeat in 2015. This was also not the first time that Welgama has taken such a stance and is seemingly opposed to a Gotabhaya candidacy.
Analysts also focus on the former presidents contention that a future SLPP candidate should be broadly acceptable to the people. It is generally recognized that while Gotabhaya is perhaps popular with the majority community, he is anathema to Muslims and Tamils. A few photo ops with minority non-entities is unlikely to eliminate that dynamic. Either way, September witnessed heightened Rajapaksa political activities, which nonetheless did not really patch up the cracks, fissures and differences within its camp.

Kataragama trishaw drivers to protest on Sept 26
Twelve three wheeler drivers associations in Kataragama will stage a protest against the Kataragama Police in front of the Kataragama YMBA on September 26.
They said that around 300 three wheeler owners will participate in the protest against the ban imposed by police preventing them from transporting pilgrims from Kataragama to Kirivehera.
Kirivehera Chief Incumbent Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera was shot at a couple of months ago and police banned the three wheeler drivers entering the Kirivehera since then.
Three wheeler drivers said the Thera did not oppose their transport of pilgrims to Kirivehera but Kataragama police banned them which is unjust.

Lankan solved math problem for Amazon founder
Yasantha Rajakarunanayake was the toast of the internet this week after the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos called the Sri Lankan smarter than him.
Yasantha Rajakarunanayake is surprised Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the worlds richest man, remembers him three decades after they lost touch.
The Sri Lankan scientist, now based in the US, was Bezos classmate at Princeton University in the 1980s.
Speaking at The Economic Club of Washington, a non-profit that holds discussions on important issues of the day, Bezos described Yasantha as the smartest guy at Princeton.
It was Yasanthas mastery of math, Bezos added in the 13 September talk, that convinced him to abandon his dream of becoming a theoretical physicist.
Soon afterwards, the part of his speech about Yasantha went viral, and set the internet on the trail of the islander who, inadvertently, helped change the way the world shops.
Talking to ThePrint, the scientist said the surge of emails that followed Bezos speech first gave him the impression that he had been hacked.
I think Jeff had done the interview on 13 September, and by 15th, I was getting spam in my LinkedIn inbox, said Yasantha.
Several people were asking me, Are you Jeff Bezos Yoshanta. I thought someone had hacked my Linkedin, and was quite worried. They had misspelled my name as well.
By 18 September, Yasantha, 55, had seen the video, and acknowledged it in a tweet.
To hear him mention me by name, and include anecdotes about me on national (US) television as his Sri Lankan friend, he told ThePrint, It was a pleasant surprise.
It is not every day that the worlds richest guy calls you the smartest person he ever met in Princeton. I am thankful, he added.
According to Yasantha, he and Bezos were at Princeton together between 1982 and 1985, and shared some academic interests.
In the video, Bezos animatedly described an anecdote from their days at the university, when he and a roommate failed to solve a math problem despite wracking their heads over it for hours. He was then an aspiring theoretical physicist.
When they couldnt, Bezos, both he and his roommate screamed in unison Yasantha, because they knew the Sri Lankan would help them out. When they went to his room, according to Bezos, Yasantha stared at the problem for a while and then gave them the answer.
Taken aback by the promptness, Bezos asked him, Did you just do that in your head
No, that would be impossible, Yasantha said, adding that he only knew the answer because he had solved a very similar problem three years ago.
I was able to map this problem on to that problem, and the answer was immediately obvious he added.
That was an important moment for me, the Amazon founder said, because that was the very moment I realised I was never going to be a great theoretical physicist.
Yasantha said he didnt remember the incident as clearly as Bezos did, but added that it happened around 1984.
I think it was in 1984, that he asked me for the solution to the math problem he mentioned in his video, he told ThePrint. It was a pivotal moment for him to decide to give up his initial dream of becoming a theoretical physicist. I dont recall the incidents as vividly as he does, but it is quite true.
The two havent kept in touch since 1985, but clearly share a mutual admiration.
Jeff was an excellent student, and a very persistent, tenacious one, said Yasantha, That is unique to him.
Yasantha described how students once dared each other to complete a computer science assignment in a single line of coding. Finally, I gave up and did this in 10 or so lines of code, he added, But I remember Jeff working through all night, in pursuit of the most compact solution, and turned in a two-line solution that was probably the shortest anyone could do
It goes to prove that Jeff is tenacious, and will not give up like most of us would when presented with a challenge, he said.
He sets his goals and sticks to them. I think thats a quality that has made him who he is, Yasantha added.
In the years since Princeton, Yasantha, who hails from a middle-class Sri Lankan family, has done a PhD at Caltech and received 54 patents in the US, while the applications for 40 others remain pending. Currently, he is based in California and serves as a senior director for MediaTek, a Taiwanese semiconductor firm.
The journey of Bezos, meanwhile, hardly needs to be retold. Barely a decade after Princeton, Bezos, 54, set up Amazon. He is today the worlds richest man with a net worth of $150 billion, and heads the largest e-commerce firm, which recently became only the second US company to hit a trillion-dollar market capitalisation.
By Bezos own admission, Yasantha is smarter than him, so does he feel bad he is not richer than the Amazon CEO too No, said the scientist.
Yasantha added that it was perhaps a credit to his middle-class upbringing that he did not prioritise wealth.
I think I grew up in the subcontinent culture, in the middle class, which put a high value on education and knowledge, he said. In the end, no one will remember the rich in 100-200 years unless they do philanthropy as well, he added.

Maldives Presidential poll tomorrow
THE MALDIVES: Maldives President Abdulla Yameen seeks a second term as President tomorrow in a tourist paradise that has become a battleground for influence and a source of global alarm over political oppression and a muzzling of the media.
The EU has said it is ready to slap travel bans and asset freezes on individuals if the situation does not improve, while the US has warned it would consider appropriate measures against people undermining democracy and rule of law.
Battered by years of violent intimidation, spurious arrests and enforced exile, the opposition has united behind a joint candidate -- the little-known Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. But voters would be hard-pressed to notice, with heavy-handed decrees and reporting restrictions stifling a media already fearful of doing anything to offend the President of the Muslim nation of 340,000 people.
The government has used vaguely worded laws to silence dissent and to intimidate and imprison critics, some of whom have been assaulted and even murdered, according to Human Rights Watch.
A few foreign journalists seeking to cover the election have been granted visas, and in many cases only at the last minute, anecdotal information suggests.- AFP

FAO releases Gender Assessment of Agriculture and Rural Sector:
Many women engaged in food, agriculture sector are unskilled, unpaid, unrecognised:FAO
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), released their Country Gender Assessment of the Agriculture and Rural sector in Sri Lanka on Thursday. The report detailed the manner in which women are insidiously discriminated against in the sector and offers recommendations to improve treatment and remuneration of women.
Despite making up a large portion of the workforce and facing what Nina Brandstrup, FAO Representation for Sri Lanka and Maldives, calls an excessive work burden, much of the labour that women in Sri Lankas food and agriculture sector engage in is unskilled, unpaid and unrecognised. As a result, women work, but they do not reap the rewards of their labour.
Of employed women in Sri Lanka, 29.7% work in the agriculture sector, but the majority practice subsistence agriculture in what is called the small economy and few reach higher paying jobs in the sector. One study done by FAO found that only 20% of the top three positions in mixed rural development societies are held by women.
As a result of what FAO describes as a combination of stereotypes, longstanding patriarchal culture and lack of skills, women in agriculture are relegated to informal tasks - such as gardening, housework, etc., and are not protected by labour laws.
Their work is lower on the value chain and upward mobility hindered by the very fact that their low incomes and lack of land inhibit access to loans. It is a perpetual cycle of inequality.
Pulled up by high scores on education and health, but brought down by low scores on female empowerment, Sri Lanka is ranked in the middle on global womens rights indices.
And when it comes to education, one representative from FAO explained, it is worth noting that women in the agriculture sector only have access to training for micro-enterprises.
Such training does not provide women the chance to gain familiarity with modern agricultural practices and move into more commercial (and thus higher paying) roles.
FAOs recommendations include immersive gender sensitization training for decision makers in the private and public sector, training programmes related to technical skills and increased collection of gender segregated data. FAO Representatives also commented that adequate budgetary provisions and allocations are essential.
But for some, this is not enough, to truly reach equality, actions must be taken beyond policy and training. In a panel discussion, Kamani Jinadasa, an Advocate for Womens Rights, said sustainable actions will be gender transformational not just gender responsive.
And gender specialist, Siriyani Perera, noted that there is no womens movement in rural communities and stressed the importance of bringing rural women together.
As Vishaka Tillekeratne, a Consultant for the FAO report, put it, If we count the money spent on gender training, we should have revolutionized society by now.

Most NPC recommendations not implemented
The National Police Commission (NPC) said that most of the recommendations made by it had not been implemented. The NPC said that around 50 of the recommendations made by it had been implemented by last Thursday with regard to those subjected to political victimisation.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Media Coordinator of the Police Commission said that a meeting had taken place last Thursday between the Inspector General of Police and members of the National Police Commission.
But, he denied any knowledge of what had been discussed at this meeting.
However, it was said that the two parties had come to an agreement on several matters, adding that the IGP had explained to the National Police Commission certain difficulties pertaining to the implementation of some of the recommendations.
However, when contacted, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said that so far, no decision had been taken with regard to the promotion of Kilinochchi SSP Palitha Siriwardena. Last week, Constitutional Council Chairman Karu Jayasuriya, had summoned the NPC and the IGP in a bid to resolve the issues between them, due to the IGP continuously failing to implement several recommendations made by the NPC.
The NPC had recommended the promotions of 129 officers subjected to political victimisation, removal of OIC Narammala from his post, investigations into educational qualifications of DIG Nalaka de Silva and the suspension of the OIC of the Statistics Division.

The only Test cricketer to be hanged till date
There are a lot of cricket facts and realities that are not known by the most.
One of such mind-blowing facts is regarding a Test cricketer who was hanged to death, as a result of committing a serious crime.
He is none other than Leslie Hylton, the Jamaican right-arm bowler, who played just 6 Test matches for West Indies. However, he had played 40 first-class matches, picking up 120 wickets at a fine average of 25.62 and strike rate of 56.7.
On 17 May 1955, he was executed for murdering his wife, Lurline, in 1954 for being in a relationship with another guy named Roy Francis who lived in New York.
Hylton fired 6 bullets on the body of Lurline in rage, thus being the only cricketer to be executed for any reasons.
When Mrs Hylton disclosed everything regarding her relationship with Roy, Leslie shockingly asked her, Are you crazy
His wife replied, You brute! After all these years, I have wasted my life with you, and now that I have found the man I love; you cannot stand in my way.
He has given me joy what I have never known with you. I want to bear his children. Yes, I have slept with him. I never felt like that before. My body belongs to him.
I am Roys, Roys, Roys!
Again, Leslie replied, I am your husband; you can never get rid of me. I promise you that.
Lurlines said, You stand in my way, I will show you!
As per the explanation was given by Leslie, his wife took a revolver and tried to shoot him.
However, he took the revolver from her and was completely brainwashed and had no remembrance of shooting his wife. After that incident, he tried to commit suicide but was unsuccessful.
However, the judge was not impressed by Hyltons explanation and gave the order to hang him for his serious crime.
Lurline shooted Leslie with her mouth and words, whereas Leslie replied by shooting her with a gun. May such incident never happen again.

The Parents Union of the State Medical Students had sent a letter to Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on the possible closure of state medical faculties of Rajarata and Eastern Universities, the media spokesman of the union Wasantha Alwis said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday. He said the state medical faculties of Rajarata and Eastern Universities would stop studies soon due to the lack of lecturers. The special payment promised to lecturers had not been made, he said.
According to Alwis, there is a severe shortage of lecturers in both faculties and as a solution, it was proposed to make an extra payment for lecturers. However, the Cabinet approval had not been granted for the proposal yet. Therefore, the payment had stopped and the lecturers are in crisis.
The attention of both Minister Rajapakshe and President Maithripala Sirisena should be paid to this issue and be solved as soon as possible because the studies of medical faculties had delayed for a long period due to the SAITM issue too, he said.

Archaeological sites had not been demolished:Grero
Allegations that an Archaeological monument had been demolished by officials of the Local Authorities in the Karachchi Pradeshiya Sabha in the Kilinochchi district, is a erroneous report, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs State Minister Mohan Lal Grero yesterday, revealed to the House.
In reply to a question by MP Dinesh Gunawardena, State Minister Grero said that no such archeological monument had been destroyed in the said area. Instead, a certain short wall which had been built using bricks used by the reconstruction project of the Abhayagiriya Stupa, Grero further revealed. According to the Minister, these bricks are stamped with the logo of the Cultural Triangle, an identification code of the manufacturer and the manufacturing date.
The location in concern is Depot Junction, Karachchi Pradeshiya Sabha of Kilinochchi district. When this allegation was leveled against us, we appointed a team of 05 officers attached to the Archeological Department to study the site. They had found out that the bricks used to build the wall belonged to a project launched by the Central Cultural Fund to reconstruct the Abhayagiriya Stupa in few years back. These bricks had been manufactured to look exactly as the bricks used in building the Abhayagiriya. In order to differentiate between the real ones and the fake, bricks are stamped with the logo of the Cultural Triangle, an identification code of the manufacturer and the manufacturing date. According to these information, the manufacture date had been in 2000. Jayantha Rathnayake, the Assistant Director of the Central Cultural Fund, Northern Province, confirmed us the specifics of these bricks, he said.
According to Rathnayake, a truck load of these bricks which were not up to the expected standard, were left unattended at the Abhayagiri Stupa site. Later on, the Sri Lanka Army had requested for the use these bricks to build the Kilinochchi War Heros Monument at a location which is very close to the site at question. As the facts suggest, this short wall which was also created using the same bricks, were used to build the War Heroes Monument. Grero explained.
State Minister Grero made these observations in reply to a question directed by MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
The State Minister also said that the government has started identifying sites with archaeologicalvalue in the Northern Province, in order to conserve them. He pointed out that 387 sites have been identified at present in this region of which 215 locations are already gazetted. The rest have been sent to be gazetted, he added.
The State Minister also pointed out that Anuradhpura, Kurunegala and Tangalle are the areas that have reported the largest number of damages caused to archaeological sites. In 2016, there had been 203 such destructions, of which 12 are from Northern Province. In 2017, there has been 290 demolitions island wide, whereas only 10 are reported from North. In 2018, 184 archaeological sites have been destroyed and only 8 of them are from the North, he pointed out.
The government is taking necessary steps to recruit security personal to safeguard these archaeological site, Grero also said.
Govt. to cultivate grasslands for elephant feed:Fonseka
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Ministry is planning to cultivate 15,000 acres of grass land for the feeding purposes of elephants, Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said. Funds for this purpose would be granted by the United Nations, the Minister further said.
The proposed land would be able to provide the much needed food sources for nearly 1,500 elephants who would be roaming in this particular land area, he pointed out. The Minister observed that one of the main reasons as to why the elephants are invading villages, is due the the shortage of food and water.
Minister Fonseka also said that Cabinet approval had been given to complete the national electric fence to curb the Human-Elephant conflict. The fence which would be 370 km in length, would soon be erected, he said.
The Minister also said that more maintenance officers and assistant maintenance officers would be deployed to manage the electric fence.
He said that they are hoping to appoint one officer per kilometer, who would maintain that particular area.
The Minister also said that the Wildlife Ministry is looking into the possibility of increasing the compensation provided to the people who lose their properties due to the human-elephant conflict.
Before 2015, for each death due to the human-elephant conflict, the government paid only Rs. 100,000, but at present, we pay Rs. 500,000. Similarly, prior to 2015, the government paid only Rs. 50,000 for property damage. At the moment we are attempting to raise increase it up to Rs. 200,000, Minister Fonseka said. He made these observations when MP Rohini Kumari Wijeratne questioned the Minister on the vision and course of action the Wildlife Ministry had for the safety of the people and the elephants who are located in regions where the human-elephant conflict takes place.
Attempt to handover Trincomalee oil tanks to IOC: Anura
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, raised fresh objections against the handing over of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm to the Indian Oil Company.
The MP alleged that the Government was attempting to indirectly hand over the oil tanks in the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm to the IOC. The entire lower tank farm comprising 15 tanks, is to be handed over to the IOC, while the upper tank farm comprising 85 tanks, is to be handed over to a joint venture company of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and IOC. As per the Joint Venture, the CPC would only get 16 tanks, MP Dissanayake said.
The MP said the above plan had reportedly received Cabinet approval on August 7. The MP questioned as to why this national asset could not be handed over to the CPC. He raised concerns that Sri Lanka could lose control of petroleum, due to the move to hand over the majority shares of the oil tank farm to the IOC.
He pointed out that the Committee on Public Enterprises and CPC Unions, had on previous occasions, had requested for the utilization of the hitherto unused oil tanks in Trincomalee, after repair. When the CPC was to begin repairs, it had been revealed that an invisible hand had stalled it.
Subject Minister Arjuna Ranatunga and Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage have dodged Parliamentary sittings today, so that they could avoid responding to questions, he charged.
New regulations pertaining to SL Cricket Board: Elections for sports bodies to be gazetted
A set of new regulations under the Sports Law to conduct elections of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board and other sports bodies in a more transparent manner, was ordered to be gazetted yesterday, Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha told Parliament.
He said the Cricket Board election would be expedited under these new regulations. He pointed out that the powers of the Sports Minister had been reduced under the new regulations made.
Changes have been made to make it compulsory to have two judges of the High Court or Appeal Court in Election Committees of Sports Associations which have over a Rs 50 million turnover. As per the previous law, once an election committee gives a determination with regard to the eligibility of a candidate, you can appeal to the Sports Minister. Through the new regulations, I have vested that power to a panel of three Appeal Court Judges, he explained.
He said more changes to the Sports Law in addition to those made yesterday, would be brought in the near future. All other ministers have to go through their Secretaries concerning their work in their ministries, but the Sports Law had an exception, where the Minister could use his powers directly. He could also arbitrarily decide on the spending of sports funds. I appointed a Board comprising three Presidents Counsels to recommend changes to the Sports Law. I also spoke to the ICC and they gave time me till February, to make necessary changes to the Sports Law and hold Cricket Board elections, the Minister said.
Sports laws in our country is highly politicized.
The cricket team, the coach and each tour must be approved by the minister. I pointed out these issues to the ICC and the Olympic Committee as well, he added.
The minister was responding to an Adjournment Motion moved by Joint Opposition MP Kanchana Wijesekara over the under performance of the Sri Lanka Cricket team. MP Wijesekara charged that heavy politicization, weaknesses and corruption of the Cricket administration were reasons behind the recent defeats in cricket matches.
The minister however pointed out that it was unfair to judge the performance of a cricket team by only two games. Please do not insult our cricketers. Their mentality had been affected due to insulting posts in the Facebook. This should not happen. We should all stand by our team, he urged. Participating in the Adjournment Debate, former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara criticized Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, stating that his brothers too should be responsible for the downfall of cricket. Ranatunga always criticize cricket because of his feud with Thilanga Sumathipala. His complaints would not stop until we make him either the Sports Minister or the President of the Cricket Board, he went on. MP Sumathipala, taking part in the debate, said he was proud that he could rebuild Sri Lanka Cricket which was a debt-ridden institution when he assumed duties. Observing that the financial downfall of Sri Lanka Cricket was mainly due to the construction of the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium, he also expressed his displeasure for not conducting a proper inquiry into its construction. He expressed his full confidence that the Sri Lanka Cricket team possessed the strength to win the 2019 ICC World Cup.

Roads to success
Roads bring people together and markets closer. Ever since the Romans first built the roads, they have helped humanity to connect distant places with each other. The main impetus for the development of roads in the 20th century was the rapid rise of the motor car in the 1930s. In Sri Lanka, most of the roads were built by the British to facilitate trade in tea and other commodities. Sri Lanka has around 12,500 Km of paved roads, counting the new expressways but not counting rural motorable gravel roads. This compares favourably with the road networks of many developing countries of similar size.
Not all roads are equal, though. There are many rural and even urban roads riddled with potholes and other obstructions, which are badly in need of repair. Some roads clearly have to be widened given the increased flow of vehicles (there are more than seven million in circulation) and also the economic importance of the respective areas. Not a day goes by without a news item on a TV channel about a village that has no proper access roads or bridges and the schoolchildren have to wade in the river to go to school. These villages deserve priority in road building and expansion plans.
Now the USA has come forward to assist Sri Lanka to upgrade some of its roads. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact would improve road networks and the bus system in the Colombo Metropolitan Region, and improve road connectivity between the central region and ports and markets in the Western Province. The compact would upgrade more than 300 kilometres of urban and interprovincial roads.
A delegation from the U.S. Governments MCC, led by Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Nash, visited Sri Lanka this week to continue progress on the proposed MCC compact  a large-scale five-year grant programme. MCC is developing the compact in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka. The proposed MCC Sri Lanka Compact is in the final stage of development and is expected to be negotiated with the Government of Sri Lanka in the coming weeks. MCC will fund the compact entirely through grants which do not need to be repaid rather than loans that have to be paid back, sometimes with a high interest. This is a welcome development in the backdrop of debt trap accusations floating around.
Based on an analysis of Sri Lankas economy and the constraints that are holding back private investment and growth, MCC expects to invest in more projects proposed by the Government of Sri Lanka in transport and land sectors. The MCC established in 2004 has signed compacts with 29 countries around the world. In December 2016, MCCs Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact and two years later, the road system has been selected for improvement.
Colombo does have many good and even excellent roads, but if you go into deeper parts of the City, the roads are not in a very good condition. These have not been repaired or re-surfaced in years. The MCC and local officials should indentify these roads for inclusion in the programme. The use of very narrow roads by heavy vehicles has exacerbated the problem as they damage the road surface and create traffic congestion. The latter is a problem experienced all over Colombo, even outside rush hours on some roads. Some roads in heavily residential areas, however, cannot be widened any further to accommodate more vehicles. Several alternatives have been proposed to reduce traffic congestion  including a congestion charge for vehicles entering Colombo and alternative highways built on concrete pillars. The latter will be a common sight in 5-6 years as plans are underway to link Colombo with Malabe and Piliyandala through such roads.
The ideal alternative is encouraging public transport. The Malabe-Colombo Light Rail Transit (LRT) will be a reality soon and by 2035 or so we will be able to see seven LRT lines in operation. LRT trains are generally comfortable, spacious, clean, punctual and efficient, five attributes which are not found at all in our chaotic public transport (bus, rail, tuk tuk) system. The LRT must be heavily promoted as an alternative to the car, at least in terms of heading to work. It should ideally be able to take at least 1,000 cars of the road during morning and evening rush hours.
While not as efficient or comfortable as a future LRT, buses are far easier and less costly to deploy. The Sri Lanka Transport Board is already looking for low-floor AC electric buses to increase the appeal of buses to those who prefer the car. This too should ideally result in fewer cars on our congested roads. In this context, the MCCs inclusion of grants for improving bus services in Colombo is a laudable initiative. A bus map of Colombo should also be developed for the convenience of tourists. It is also vital to coordinate the running of private and Government-owned buses under a single timetable. Our public transport system needs a long-term fix and we hope the MCC Compact will rise to the occasion.

Significant drop in CKD patients - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said the number of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients have recorded a significant decrease annually as a result of the comprehensive programmes implemented by the government to prevent kidney disease spreading in the country.
President Sirisena said the government executed extensive programmes during the last three and half years to control and prevent kidney disease and to look into the welfare of kidney patients and their families. The President was speaking at a ceremony to offer pure drinking water to the Sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi yesterday.
The water was collected from 500 water purification systems established at a cost of Rs.800 million. The 500 water purification systems were also vested with the public by the President. President Sirisena further said the number of new kidney disease patients reported in 2016 was 3,372 which declined 2478 in 2017 and 1,500 cases in 2018.
The President said that the Kidney Fund, which he established utilising the money he received and which would have been spent on banners & cutouts during the Presidential Election when he was contesting as the Common Candidate has now become a strong and reputed National Fund. The President also said that through this fund, many programmes have been implemented for the welfare of kidney patients, extended his gratitude to the state and private sectors,the business community and the international community for joining hands with this initiative.
At present, 500 water purification systems have been established with the financial assistance of the Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease and with the labour support offered by the Sri Lanka Navy to provide pure drinking water to the people in areas vulnerable to disease.
The 500th water purification system under this project was established at the Mihindu Aranya Senasanaya in Mihintale, Kurundankulama, Anuradhapura. The President, using remote satellite technology, vested that water purification system with the public. The President who participated in religious observances at the historic Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura also called on the Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera, and obtained his blessings.
Later, the President engaged in religious observances at the historic Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi. After this the President offered pure drinking water collected from the 500 water purification systems, to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi.

SLMC ORDERED TO REGISTER SAITM DOC
The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 regarding a legal issue pertaining to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM).
Court ordered the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to pay Rs.100,000 as legal cost to petitioner Dhilmi Kasunda Suriyarachchi, a student of SAITM in Malabe for unnecessarily delaying and refusing to register her as a medical practitioner.
On January 31, 2017, the Court of Appeal ruled that the petitioner has a legal right to provisionally register as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance since she has fulfilled the necessary requirements.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena unanimously decided to dismiss the appeal filed by the SLMC challenging the Court of Appeal order dated January 31, 2017.
While handing out a few paragraphs of the 55-page judgment, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena observed that the SLMC has unnecessarily delayed the petitioner obtaining provisional registration as a medical practitioner and would have, thereby, caused her to bear considerable expenses in addition to causing grave prejudice to the petitioner. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered the SLMC to pay the Petitioner a sum of Rs.100,000 by way of costs.
It hardly needs to be said that the claims made by the SLMC with regard to its role and responsibility, do not exempt the SLMC from obeying the statutory provisions of the Medical Ordinance and the Universities Act. The SLMC is a creation of the Medical Ordinance and must confine itself to the powers vested in it by the Medical Ordinance.
It has no powers outside those expressly conferred on it by the provisions of the Medical Ordinance. Under and in terms of and by operation of the provisions of the Medical Ordinance and the Universities Act, the petitioner is entitled to provisional registration as a medical practitioner under Section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance and the SLMC is required, by the law, to forthwith grant that provisional registration to the petitioner. It follows that, thereafter, the SLMC is obliged to accord to the petitioner, without restriction or delay, all the rights which ordinarily flow from provisional registration as a medical practitioner under Section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance, the Supreme Court observed.
On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to intervene into the Appeal filed by the SLMC. Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgment dated January 31, 2017 by Court of Appeal.
The SLMC further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgment made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 187/2016 by Court of Appeal. Delivering its judgment on the writ petition filed by a MBBS graduate of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe, the Court of Appeal on January 31 held that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and further held that the petitioner has legal rights to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal had observed that the petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM has no obstacle to register at SLMC as a medical practitioner in terms of the section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance. The Court of Appeal observed that on or around August 30, 2011, the former Higher Education Minister recognised SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of Section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.
The Court of Appeal further observed that the Higher Education Minister has not taken any steps to revoke the concerned decision in terms of the Section 27 of the said Act. SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degree, the Court of Appeal observed.
In its judgment, the Court of Appeal observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister and further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of Section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM. The Court further held that the SLMC had acted in violation of the Medical Ordinance without having any power to do so.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the SLMC. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Sugath Caldera appeared for the respondent.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam PC appeared on behalf of the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Faisz Musthapha appeared for SAITM. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana and Ravindranath Dabare appeared on behalf of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).

Towards a peaceful society
There is a proposal to break free from and reorganise the commitments made by the government to the international community with regard to issues of war time accountability for serious human rights violations. It was in October 2015 the newly elected government eased tensions that had been growing between the previous government and sections of the international community. This dispute had contributed to the imposition of economic sanctions.
The European Union had withdrawn the GSP Plus tariff concession and there were indications of further sanctions to come. But by co-sponsoring UN Resolution 30/1 at the UN Human Rights Council, the government pledged to embark on a wide ranging series of actions that would deal with the past and pave the way for national reconciliation.
However, the issue of accountability for war crimes and human rights violations, claimed as a result of international pressure, has been condemned by the racist fascist Mahinda clan supported by a section of Sri Lankan Security Forces and some groups within Sinhala majority nationality. Recently there were suggestions from the government side stating that it could amicably propose alternatives to the commitments that the Mahinda government made in Geneva.
International community
The most controversial of those has been to have the participation of the international community in the establishment of a special judicial mechanism to look into questions of accountability. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have clarified that this international participation does not amount to the setting up of hybrid courts in which international judges sit in judgment alongside national judges.
There is a suggestion for yahapalana leaders to go before the UN General Assembly to urge, in an amicable manner that the resolution on Sri Lanka co-sponsored by the government should be amended, as it had led to the perception that the Sri Lankan Security Forces were being unfairly targeted for punitive action. Government will submit these proposals to the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres as well as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bache let. It is expected that the proposals aim at solving issues and providing relief without causing harm to the pride of the security forces or endangering Lankas independence while providing autonomy of expression to minority nationalities.
The yahapalana is today under criticism for many reasons. Many dissatisfied due to social and economic reasons clamour for relief. Trade unions who expected yahapalana to give immediate relief to their injustice issues go for trade union action.
In rural areas there is pressure to boost the economy and ensure adequate trickle down to the masses. But for fascistic opposition the major criticism is for having respected, the co-sponsored UNHRC resolution 30/1 of October 2015 which set out ambitious targets to be achieved within a two year framework. The delay and nature of the governments approach in implementing this Geneva Resolution becomes clear in the absence of support from some section within the ranks of government for its implementation. Though implementation moved forward every reform has been contested, including the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons. It was therefore no surprise that in March 2017, the Sri Lankan government requested a further two years to implement the transitional justice agenda set out in UNHRC resolution 30/1.
UNHRC resolution
Last week, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, who commanded the army in the concluding phase of the war, and is a Cabinet minister, claimed that some Cabinet of ministers were unaware of the contents of UNHRC resolution 30/1, at the time it was signed by the government. Even today it would not be too surprising if knowledge of what that resolution contains is a haze to these members of the government. In these circumstances, it is to the credit of President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and ministers such as Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera (who signed UNHRC resolution 30/1 on behalf of the government as Foreign Minister) that the transitional justice process is moving forward at all. They have accepted the need to reach international standard. The question is how to accommodate those standards to national political realities.
The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) is the first of the transitional justice mechanisms to be established in keeping with the pledges of UNHRC resolution 30/1. Last week it issued its interim report. This is a comprehensive document with strong recommendations. The question is how much can and will be implemented. The OMP recommended the publication of a full list of all detention centres as well as detainees and ensure that persons are not detained in any unauthorized detention centres. However, there is a fundamental problem that the OMP will need to deal with. The racists in and out of military establishment are against, looking back and search for what happened. How can this be a process, with every effort to dig into the past, an insidious attempt to find evidence that will one day incriminate those who won the war, in a court of law No; truth will only bring peace and justice. These are the words of the Buddha.
Despite these contrary pressures, the government is still pushing ahead, even if slowly. The second transitional justice mechanism, the Office for Reparations, has recently been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and is now to be placed before Parliament to be passed into law. The third mechanism, the Truth seeking Commission is on the drawing board. In the context of Sri Lankas divided polity and opinion on the issue of transitional justice there will be a need for more time, more wisdom and more political will to find the way forward. In other parts of the world, these processes have taken decades to unfold. However, it will be important for the yahapalana government to be mindful that UN institutions such as the UN Human Rights Council have their own mandates and autonomy.
Human rights
In the globalized capitalism HR campaigns shows the power of the international working class. We must remember that men such as Beanie Saunders and Jeremy Corbin stand for HR in the world political arena.
The UN Human Rights Council, which co-sponsored UNHRC Resolution 30/1 is not under the direct control of the UN General Assembly.
This explains why even the United States, under Donald Trump, though arguably the most powerful country in the world was unable to influence the UNHRC and has withdrawn from that institution while denouncing it. Therefore, it is not reasonable to believe that the international community, especially those whose mandate is to protect human rights, will be prepared to negotiate and water down the need for accountability as measured by international standards as against Sri Lankan standards.
Any independent actions are also likely to come at a political cost to the government as they will not be acceptable to the Tamil people and to their elected representatives.
Recent interventions in regard to a case involving military officials who are wanted by the Criminal Investigation became a discussion subjected to international judicial establishments. Jaffna District MP and TNA spokesman M A Sumanthiran has told media that interference by highest authorities in the country could be interpreted as that the victims could not expect justice through domestic judicial process. There is a need there for more and more leaders within the government to understand the complex elements of transitional justice that need to be followed for Sri Lankas transition to a reconciled society.
