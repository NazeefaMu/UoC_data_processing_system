Ven. Batuwanhena Sri Buddharakkhita Thera
Bhikku with Bodhisatva qualities
I was deeply grieved to hear of the demise of Ven. Batuwanhena Sri Buddharakkhita Thera, Chief Sanghanayake Thera of Bentara Walallavita Korale and Viharadipathi of Aluthgama Kande Viharaya who was a great Bhikkhu with Bodhisatva qualities.
The late Nayake Thera headed the Kande Viharaya during its golden era and the efforts he made to develop it to its present status were astounding.
Kande Viharaya is situated in a hilly terrain and Ven. Buddharakkitha Thera built the massive four-storeyed building in line with its gradient to enable devotees to access it with ease.
He rendered a great religious and social service by housing a vocational training centre, a dana salawa and an assembly hall in it. He was also instrumental in getting a 107cubit-tall standing posture Buddha statue installed in the viharaya which is the tallest Buddha statue in South Asia.
The late Thera also maintained a Pirivena in the temple premises to produce disciplined young Bhikkhus.
The late Buddharakkhita Thera initiated a scholarship fund to award monthly scholarships to a group of 250 children. He helped the sick and infirm who came to him seeking assistance.
*extend my deepest sympathies to the student Bhikkhus of the late Ven. Buddharakkhita Thera and the members of the Dayaka Sabha of the Kande Viharaya.
* wish the Ven. Batuwanhena Sri Buddharakkhita Thera, Chief Sanghanayaka Thera, the eternal bliss of Nibbana.

Aitken Spence Travels brings  24 charters from UK
Aitken Spence Travels is attracting the only charter flight operation from the UK to Sri Lanka this season, with 24 flights scheduled from early November 2018 to April 30, 2019.
The charter operated by TUI UK will see a Thomson Airways 300-seat Dreamliner bringing in tourists from the UK over the course of six months.
Holidaymakers will be accommodated in beach resorts from Waikkala to Hikkaduwa and the round tour clients will be accommodated in several hotels in the Cultural Triangle, Kandy and Nuwara-Eliya.
The charter operation is expected to generate more than 50,000 room nights to hotels in Sri Lanka during the season, giving a significant boost to the industrys demand from the UK. As the official ground handler, Aitken Spence Travels will be organizing logistics, transport, accommodation and tours of all the travellers. 
The first flight which landed on November 7 was warmly welcomed by Aitken Spence Travels at the Bandaranaike International Airport with traditional dancers and lotus flower welcome.
This is the third consecutive year that Aitken Spence Travels has attracted the large charter operation from the UK. Previous to last year, the last charter from the UK market was in 2010. Since then it has taken much effort and dedication to convince the charter operators to resume their flights back to Sri Lanka considering the aggressive competition posed by competing destinations.
Tourist arrivals from the UK has shown steady growth over the last few years, growing by 41 per cent in 2018 the country recorded a total of 205,377 visitors from UK against 166,489 visitors in 2017 by end October.
Aitken Spence Travels is the only destination management company in Sri Lanka to handle a charter from the UK. This is due to our longstanding partnership with TUI, a global giant in the tourism industry. A great amount of effort was made over the year to secure the charter for the third consecutive year despite tremendous competition from other destinations. Our commitment, consistency in service and agility displayed during the charter operation last year helped us secure the charter for Sri Lanka this year. Sri Lanka as a tourist destination needs to be promoted more aggressively among the UK public in order to capitalize on the efforts made by industry players, said Prasanjit Perera, Vice President, Aitken Spence Travels.

Point of view 
Markets remained mixed this week with the benchmark ASPI hitting a one-week low as international credit rating agencies S&P and Fitch Ratings downgraded Sri Lankas sovereign rating citing the countrys protracted political stalemate.
This weeks downgrade came on the heels of a similar credit downgrade on Nov 20th when Moodys downgraded Sri Lanka for the 1st time since it started rating the country in 2010. The benchmark ASPI lost ~28 points following the downgrades early in the week, pushing the Index below the key 6000-mark to hit a low of 5997.23 points.
The Index however gained in the subsequent days, gaining ~72 points as the resumption of Supreme Court hearings regarding the dissolution of Parliament continued over the week.
Turnover levels too remained in broadly in line with that of last week, averaging Rs. 3.1Bn over the week relative to last week (Rs.3.8Bn) as Local Institutional and HNI investors continued to pick up undervalued stocks.
Local institutions and HNIs accounted for ~36% of total market activity (cf. ~48% in the last two weeks) with buying interest mainly focused on heavy-weight JKH (~40% of the total crossings) and banking sector stocks (~47% of total crossings in Sampath Bank, HNB and Seylan Bank).
Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to remain net sellers this week as well, with the sell-off on domestic equities amounting to Rs. 929Mn relative to last weeks net selling of Rs. 796Mn.
The foreign equity sell-off on Sri Lanka equities has heightened drastically since the political upheaval on Oct 26th, with net selling in the 7 weeks between Oct26-to date totaling Rs.10Bn, in line with the net sell-off of Rs.9Bn recorded in the 91/2 months to Oct26.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain influenced by domestic political developments, especially the pending Supreme Court decisions.
S&P and Fitch Ratings downgrade Sri Lanka
Ratings agencies S&P and Fitch Ratings downgraded Sri Lankas sovereign rating this week (from B+ (Stable) to B (Stable)) citing heightened external financing risks on the back of the political crisis stemming from the sudden dismissal of the countrys Prime Minister on Oct26.
The credit rating agencies added that the risk of a slowdown/delay in fiscal and economic reforms also underlies its rationale for the downgrade.
Both agencies noted though that its outlook for the sovereign is stable, with S&P adding that the cyclical recovery in the economy is likely to continue (as weather-related disruptions dissipate) while the GoSL is able to meet its 2019 debt repayments and with Fitch estimating a recovery in growth supported by remittances, a recovery in the Agriculture sector and, construction activity from commercial, real-estate and infrastructure projects.
The CBSL meanwhile countered the international credit rating agency downgrades, adding a rating downgrade based only on the premise of heightened political uncertainty is unwarranted, especially since there is no evidence of slippages in macroeconomic policies or fundamentals.
The CBSL added that the soundness of the countrys underlying macroeconomic conditions is reinforced by the fact that a staff-level agreement (at the 5th review of the IMFs EFF program) was reached in principle on Oct26th just prior to the sudden political upheaval.
The CBSL added that it expects to more than cover all ISB payments due in 2019 both due to the space provided under the Active Liability Management initiative and from proceeds from the divestment of non-strategic assets, syndicated loans, FX Swap facilities with SAARC, enhanced credit lines with the Middle East and disbursements from bilateral and multilateral agencies.

ATG Group Promotes Multi-religious Harmony in Workplace
Sri Lankas leader in high-tech industrial glove manufacturing ATG Group of companies recently successfully completed the second installment of their multi-religious dialogue to promote ethnic harmony at ATG Occupational (Pvt) Ltd in Katunayake.
Following the successful conclusion of the first session at ATG Ceylon in mid-September, the second session was organized to cater to the overwhelming demand from workers and executive staff alike.
This programme which serves to use religion as a platform to promote harmony in the workplace is the brainchild of companys Director General, Upali Karunathilake who was also the curator of the panel.
The eminent panelists of the evening included Ven. Amandoluwe Dhammarathana Thero, Rev. Fr. Linon Joseph, Ash Sheikh Mahir T.D. Ramdeen (Noori) and M. Somaskanda Kurukkal representing the four main religions. All participants were seen clad in white symbolizing fellowship and oneness.
The objective of the programme was to spark an intellectually stimulating conversation about how persons of different faiths can work in harmony by keeping an open mind to other perspectives.
ATG Group has a dynamic and diverse workforce representing all religions and ethnicities and therefore, since inception, the company has nurtured a culture of affording the same degree of recognition and respect to all faiths in order to maintain a pleasant work environment.
The companys calendar features an assortment of religious celebrations throughout the year to promote inter-faith relations and spiritual enrichment of workers.
ATG Group in Sri Lanka has offices and factories based in Katunayake, Wathupitiwala and Koggala export promotion zones and have now expanded their operations with 5 factories under their name while offering over 5000 job opportunities to locals.
They have become a strong global player exporting their products to over 35 countries.

Attempts to incorporate global climate talks have failed
Attempts to incorporate a key scientific study into global climate talks in Poland have failed.
Scientists and many delegates in Poland were shocked as the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait objected to this meeting "welcoming" the report.
It was the 2015 climate conference that had commissioned the landmark study.
The report said that the world is now completely off track, heading more towards 3C this century rather than 1.5C.
Keeping to the preferred target would need "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society". If warming was to be kept to 1.5C this century, then emissions of carbon dioxide would have to be reduced by 45% by 2030.
But negotiators here ran into serious trouble when Saudi Arabia, the US, Russia and Kuwait objected to the conference "welcoming" the document.
Instead they wanted to support a much more lukewarm phrase, that the conference would "take note" of the report.
Saudi Arabia had fought until the last minute in Korea to limit the conclusions of the document. Eventually they gave in. But it now seems that they have brought their objections to Poland.
The dispute dragged on as huddles of negotiators met in corners of the plenary session here, trying to agree a compromise wording. With no consensus, under UN rules the passage of text had to be dropped. Many countries expressed frustration and disappointment at the outcome. - BBC News

Australia lose four wickets, face defeat  in record India run chase
ADELAIDE: Australia were staring at defeat in the first Test Sunday after losing four wickets in their record run chase at the Adelaide Oval after being set a target 323 to win by India.
At stumps Australia were 104 for 4, needing another 219 for an unlikely victory with their fate resting on the shoulders of Shaun Marsh, who was not out 31, and local boy Travis Head who remained unbeaten on 11.
India amassed 307 in their second innings with vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane smashing 70 and first innings century-maker Cheteshwar Pujara a composed 71.
A late collapse got the crowd on their feet and gave Australia a flicker of hope, with Indias last four wickets falling for just four runs.
Spinner Nathan Lyon was the pick of the bowlers, taking six wickets for 122 runs off 42 overs. It was his 13th five-wicket haul in Tests. Mitchell Starc snared 3 for 40.
Australia need to make history to win. The only successful fourth innings Test run chase of more than 300 at Adelaide came in 1902, when the hosts made 315 to beat England, with the biggest in modern times the 239 West Indies managed in 1982.
The home side can take some comfort, though, by Western Australia in a domestic match last month scoring 313 to beat South Australia here when Marsh scored 163 not out.
Opener Aaron Finch -- who survived being given out lbw second ball when a review showed Ishant Sharma had overstepped the crease -- made just 11 in his second failure of the match.
He was caught behind off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin when the ball whistled past his glove. He chose not to review the decision, which was a mistake. Replays showed the third umpire would have overturned it.
Debutant Marcus Harris matched his first innings score of 26, hitting three crunching boundaries before he was caught by Rishabh Pant off Mohammed Shami, getting an edge on an attempted cut shot.
Australia desperately needed the experienced Usman Khawaja to stick around but he decided to run down the pitch to an Ashwin delivery on nine and sliced it to Rohit Sharma, who took a difficult catch.
And when Handscomb miscued a pull shot off Shami on 14 to Pujara, they were in deep trouble.
Play had started 30 minutes early to make up for rain disruptions on Saturday, with Australia desperate for an early breakthrough to build on the momentum after Virat Kohli fell to Lyon near the close on day three.
But two fours from Pujara off Josh Hazlewood in the second over of the day set the tone.
The right-hander brought up 50 -- his 20th in Tests -- with a three off Lyon and hardly looked troubled until the off-spinner fooled him half an hour before lunch and Finch caught him off bat and pad.
It was a crucial 87-run partnership with Rahane, who survived a bat-pad catch decision off Lyon on review. The vice-captain rubbed salt in the wound by smacking the next ball for four and brought up his 16th half-century with another boundary. AFP

Australian players wear black armbands on the fourth day
The highly-anticipated Test series between Australia and India has lived up to its billing so far with some intriguing action in the middle.
The pendulum has swung with every session and finally, it seems that the visitors are on the ascendancy at the moment defending 322. However, the fourth day started with the game in balance even as the Australian players stepped out on the field by wearing the black armbands.
The reason for the same is the passing away of the former Australian cricketer Colin Guest on Saturday. The 81-year-old played only a solitary Test match for his country scoring 59 runs in two outings with the bat.
The hosts gave him a tribute by wearing black armbands in his memory and in a way, thanked Colin for his contribution, predominantly, to the Australian domestic cricket.
Colin made a significant contribution to our domestic game, both as a player and a coach. His patience was rewarded after debuting for Australia in the Ashes in 1963. On behalf of the Board and staff at Cricket Australia, we sincerely acknowledge Colin for his contribution to Australias favourite sport.
He will be sadly missed, and our thoughts are with his family, friends and all those who crossed paths with him in the cricketing community at this time, Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts said.

Beautify  your  garden
If you want to stamp your signature on your garden there is no better way than designing soft landscaping features. Today, continuing from last weeks article on Soft Landscaping features we touch on landscaping features like Hedges, Lawns and Vines and Creepers. Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K. N. K. Jayathilake on these features that really bring out ones individuality.
Hedges 
Hedges are actually a collection of plants diverse in colors creating a contrast in the garden. Hedges serve as organic walls, living and natural walls. Seeing a plant can subconsciously make you feel calm and relaxed and plants can remove the carbon dioxide in the air. Plants with flowers have an immediate impact upon ones overall feeling of wellbeing. There is sufficient evidence to point out that, plants have therapeutic benefits and that plants contribute to good health. So when growing hedges you are able to create your kind of environment and an atmosphere that is very positive. Rather than creating cement walls that separates your garden from the neighbors, living walls are more friendly, and create the good neighbour feeling, but at the same time maintain that firmness that will deter intruders.
Soft Landscaping features like hedges enable one to bring out ones individuality. It also gives one protection, as it acts as living walls and the placement of hedges allows you greater control in your garden. By dividing your plot of land into different sections while concealing undesirable features you are protected from intense sunlight and animals threats. It also brings out that all important naturalness in the garden as cement walls can be stifling, said Jayathilake.
Different shapes of hedges contribute to the beauty in a garden. Examples for hedges are Croton, Acalypha and bamboos. However, maintaining these hedges require a lot of time and energy. They need to be pruned and cared for properly. Otherwise if they are allowed to grow without pruning then your garden will not look very nice. There is evidence to point out that the practice of growing hedges dates back to the Neolithic Age (40006000 years ago), where they were used to enclose land for crops.
Borders 
Another feature of Soft Landscaping is borders. They are used to define what is within the garden while hedges are around the garden. Borders are used to create that sense of discipline in the garden while protecting garden features. If you take the lawns, borders create barriers within the lawns and also are grown around flower beds, bushes, ponds and shrubs. It is also used on either side of pathways. Borders vary in size and place. Borders on either side of the pathways are usually 1  1  feet in size. If the pathways and hedges are big then the borders should be around 2  - 3 feet. Around flower beds they should be around 6  8 inches, explained Jayathilake.
Flower beds (sub head) 
Flower beds are indispensable to a garden. Blooming flowers are like the rainbow and are wonderful to look at. Flower beds of different shapes create an effect backed up by stunning colors. For this you need to remember that annual flower plants must be used. Otherwise it will be harrowing growing and replanting all the time. Flower beds can be created on either side of the pathways making your garden, like a garden in a fairytale. The sizes of the flower beds need to be structured according to the size of the pathways. If the pathway is small, the flower beds need to be small in size and short in height. According to your sense of individuality you can decide whether the flowers need to be of the same color or different colors. Small flower beds can be used around the lawns. They can even be placed in the center of the lawn.
Lawns
Lawns are another feature of soft landscaping that covers a large percentage of the garden. It is pleasing to the eye and gives an effect of coolness. It gives you a feeling of rest and relaxation. It also gives you mental satisfaction when you look at a beautiful lawn. It is a play area for children, decreasing soil erosion and contributes to greenery. Types of lawns are luxurious lawns and normal lawns. Luxurious lawns are for special purposes. Normal lawns are for normal needs, stated Jayathilake.
Now a good example for luxurious lawns is the White House Lawn. It is created to give that sense of power. That sense of imperiousness. Some of the trees on the South Lawn include the earliest remaining trees on the grounds planted by United States President Andrew Jackson. Types of lawns are Bord Leaf Carpet Grass, Bermuda Grass and Narrow Leaf Carpet Grass.
In maintaining lawns there need to be some essential conditions. There has to be good drainage, and the ground needs to be level ground and the grass needs to be cut regularly, added Jayathilake.
Vines and Creepers 
Vines and Creepers are features that really beautifies the garden. They are used for Arches and Pergolas. This garden feature adds charm to any garden. Garden arches are ideal for marking the entrance to a path or area of your garden, or as a beautiful support for your climbing plants. When the vines are flowering vines the effect is very beautiful. One example is when the vines hang down like a curtain. When choosing vines you need to select the right color which could be a combination of different flowering vines or vines of one color. Some good examples are Thunbergia Alata, Garlic Vine and White Jasmine.

Building a mentally healthy future
There are many different mental disorders, with different presentations. They are generally characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviour and relationships with others.
Mental disorders include: depression, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders including autism.
There are effective strategies for preventing mental disorders such as depression.
There are effective treatments for mental disorders and ways to alleviate the suffering caused by them.
Access to health care and social services capable of providing treatment and social support is key.
The burden of mental disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on health and major social, human rights and economic consequences in all countries of the world.
Depression
Depression is a common mental disorder and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Globally, an estimated 300 million people are affected by depression. More women are affected than men.
Depression is characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, tiredness, and poor concentration. People with depression may also have multiple physical complaints with no apparent physical cause. Depression can be long-lasting or recurrent, substantially impairing peoples ability to function at work or school and to cope with daily life. At its most severe, depression can lead to suicide.
Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression, both for children (e.g. through protection and psychological support following physical and sexual abuse) and adults (e.g. through psychosocial assistance after disasters and conflicts).
There are also effective treatments. Mild to moderate depression can be effectively treated with talking therapies, such as cognitive behaviour therapy or psychotherapy. Antidepressants can be an effective form of treatment for moderate to severe depression but are not the first line of treatment for cases of mild depression. They should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with caution.
Management of depression should include psychosocial aspects, including identifying stress factors, such as financial problems, difficulties at work or physical or mental abuse, and sources of support, such as family members and friends. The maintenance or reactivation of social networks and social activities is important.
Bipolar affective disorder
This disorder affects about 60 million people worldwide. It typically consists of both manic and depressive episodes separated by periods of normal mood. Manic episodes involve elevated or irritable mood, over-activity, pressure of speech, inflated self-esteem and a decreased need for sleep. People who have manic attacks but do not experience depressive episodes are also classified as having bipolar disorder.
Effective treatments are available for the treatment of the acute phase of bipolar disorder and the prevention of relapse. These are medicines that stabilize mood. Psychosocial support is an important component of treatment.
Schizophrenia and other psychoses
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder, affecting about 23 million people worldwide. Psychoses, including schizophrenia, are characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self and behaviour. Common psychotic experiences include hallucinations (hearing, seeing or feeling things that are not there) and delusions (fixed false beliefs or suspicions that are firmly held even when there is evidence to the contrary). The disorder can make it difficult for people affected to work or study normally.
Stigma and discrimination can result in a lack of access to health and social services. Furthermore, people with psychosis are at high risk of exposure to human rights violations, such as long-term confinement in institutions.
Schizophrenia typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood. Treatment with medicines and psychosocial support is effective. With appropriate treatment and social support, affected people can lead a productive life, be integrated in society. Facilitation of assisted living, supported housing and supported employment can act as a base from which people with severe mental disorders, including Schizophrenia, can achieve numerous recovery goals as they often face difficulty in obtaining or retaining normal employment or housing opportunities.
Dementia
Worldwide, approximately 50 million people have dementia. Dementia is usually of a chronic or progressive nature in which there is deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgement. The impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behaviour, or motivation.
Dementia is caused by a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease or stroke.
Though there is no treatment currently available to cure dementia or to alter its progressive course, many treatments are in various stages of clinical trials. Much can be done, however, to support and improve the lives of people with dementia and their carers and families.
Developmental disorders, including autism
Developmental disorder is an umbrella term covering intellectual disability and pervasive developmental disorders including autism. Developmental disorders usually have a childhood onset but tend to persist into adulthood, causing impairment or delay in functions related to the central nervous system maturation. They generally follow a steady course rather than the periods of remissions and relapses that characterize many other mental disorders.
Intellectual disability is characterized by impairment of skills across multiple developmental area such as cognitive functioning and adaptive behaviour. Lower intelligence diminishes the ability to adapt to the daily demands of life.
Symptoms of pervasive developmental disorders, such as autism, include impaired social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and are carried out repetitively. Developmental disorders often originate in infancy or early childhood. People with these disorders occasionally display some degree of intellectual disability.
Family involvement in care of people with developmental disorders is very important. Knowing what causes affected people both distress and wellbeing is an important element of care, as is finding out what environments are most conductive to better learning. Structure to daily routines help prevent unnecessary stress, with regular times for eating, playing, learning, being with others, and sleeping. Regular follow up by health services of both children and adults with developmental disorders, and their carers, needs to be in place.
The community at large has a role to play in respecting the rights and needs of people with disabilities.
Risk groups
Determinants of mental health and mental disorders include not only individual attributes such as the ability to manage one's thoughts, emotions, behaviours and interactions with others, but also social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors such as national policies, social protection, standards of living, working conditions, and community support.
Stress, genetics, nutrition, perinatal infections and exposure to environmental hazards are also contributing factors to mental disorders.
Health and support
Health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental disorders. As a consequence, the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is wide all over the world. In low- and middle-income countries, between 76% and 85% of people with mental disorders receive no treatment for their disorder. In high-income countries, between 35% and 50% of people with mental disorders are in the same situation. A further compounding problem is the poor quality of care for many of those who do receive treatment.
In addition to support from health-care services, people with mental illness require social support and care. They often need help in accessing educational programmes which fit their needs, and in finding employment and housing which enable them to live and be active in their local communities.
WHO response
WHOs Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2013, recognizes the essential role of mental health in achieving health for all people. The plan includes 4 major objectives:
more effective leadership and governance for mental health; the provision of comprehensive, integrated mental health and social care services in community-based settings; the implementation of strategies for promotion and prevention; and strengthened information systems, evidence and research.
WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), launched in 2008, uses evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to expand service in countries, especially in resource-poor settings. It focuses on a prioritized set of conditions, directing capacity building towards non-specialized health-care providers in an integrated approach that promotes mental health at all levels of care. - WHO

Candidates can now take  their IELTS on computer
The British Council in Sri Lanka has announced that IELTS candidates in the country, registered through the British Council, can take the globally recognised English proficiency test on a computer.
At an event held at the British Council Colombo recently, guests and members of the press were introduced to the operations and benefits of this novel test-taking experience, one that is certain to bring greater ease and flexibility to test-takers in the country.
The computer based alternative offers more test sessions a week, allowing candidates greater flexibility in scheduling their assessment dates in comparison to the fixed calendar schedule of the paper-based format. Candidates will also be able to receive their test results sooner -in 5 days as opposed to the 13-day waiting period of the alternative system.
We are consistently dedicated to improving the IELTS test-taking system and experience, said Gill Caldicott, Country Director of the British Council in Sri Lanka, commenting at the event on this new step forward. IELTS on a computer is significantly beneficial in more ways than one, offering candidates greater flexibility and convenience.
The new computer delivered format, allows candidates to take the Listening, Reading, and Writing sections of the examination on a computer, while the Speaking test will remain face-to-face. While the first three sections have to be completed on the same day, the latter can be taken up to a week either before or after the other sections have been completed. It is important to note however, that the test content, scoring, timing, and level of difficulty, will remain the same irrespective of the mode in which they are taken.
IELTS on computer is not intended to replace the paper-based system, but will serve only to provide more options to candidates, added British Council Sri Lanka Country Examinations Director, Rob Low. Rest assured, candidates choosing this new computer delivered alternative will be taking the same trusted English language test, with the same security arrangements as with the paper delivered option.
IELTS is one of the worlds most popular English language tests for higher education and migration, with over three million tests taken in the past year alone. Recognised by over 10,000 educational institutions, employers, and immigration bodies worldwide, in Sri Lanka it is more popularly taken by those who wishing to pursue migration, education, and employment options abroad.

Chinas trade surplus with U.S. hits record level
Chinas trade surplus with the US rose to a new high of US$35.5 billion last month as businesses raced to prepare for a threatened increase in tariffs over the new year.
Chinas exports to the US rose by 9.7 per cent year on year to US$46.2 billion in November, while imports dropped 25 per cent to US$10.6 billion, according to data published by the General Administration of Customs in China on Saturday.
But Chinas overall trade last month was worse than expected, with export growth slowing to 5.4 per cent and import growth slowing to 3 per cent.
This marked a big fallback from the double-digit expansions recorded in recent months as Chinas economy continued to slow down with many small private exporters cutting back their operations and laying off staff.
However, due to the Chinese currencys depreciation against the dollar, in yuan terms exports rose by 10.2 per cent and imports by 7.8 per cent.
Exports to the US are likely to have been bolstered by American businesses front-loading their stock by buying more goods from China before the threatened increase in tariffs kicked in.
However, the pace of export growth to the US slowed from 13 per cent in October, which suggested that the impact of front-loading was fading as many American buyers had stockpiled goods well in advance.
The US had been threatening to raise tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on January 1  but this has since been deferred following last weekends meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in Argentina.

Chinese rover aims for dark side of the moon
CHINA: China launched a rover early Saturday destined to land on the far side of the moon, a global first that would boost Beijing's ambitions to become a space superpower, state media said.
The Chang'e-4 lunar probe mission -- named after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology -- launched on a Long March 3B rocket from the southwestern Xichang launch centre at 2:23 am (1823 GMT), according to the official Xinhua news agency.
The blast-off marked the start of a long journey to the far side of the moon for the Chang'e-4 mission, expected to land around the New Year to carry out experiments and survey the untrodden terrain.
Chang'e-4 is humanity's first probe to land on and explore the far side of the moon, said the mission's chief commander He Rongwei of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the main state-owned space contractor.
This mission is also the most meaningful deep space exploration research project in the world in 2018, He said, according to state-run Global Times.
Unlike the near side of the moon that is tidally locked and always faces the earth, and offers many flat areas to touch down on, the far side is mountainous and rugged.
It was not until 1959 that the Soviet Union captured the first images of the heavily cratered surface, uncloaking some of the mystery of the moon's dark side.
No lander or rover has ever touched the surface there, positioning China as the first nation to explore the area.
China over the past 10 or 20 years has been systematically ticking off the various firsts that America and the Soviet Union did in the 1960s and 1970s in space exploration, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
This is one of the first times they've done something that no one else has done before.
It is no easy technological feat -- China has been preparing for this moment for years.
A major challenge for such a mission is communicating with the robotic lander: as the far side of the moon always points away from earth, there is no direct line of sight for signals.
As a solution, China in May blasted the Queqiao ( Magpie Bridge ) satellite into the moon's orbit, positioning it so that it can relay data and commands between the lander and earth.
Adding to the difficulties, Chang'e-4 is being sent to the Aitken Basin in the lunar south pole region -- known for its craggy and complex terrain -- state media has said.
The probe is carrying six experiments from China and four from abroad.
They include low-frequency radio astronomical studies -- aiming to take advantage of the lack of interference on the far side -- as well as mineral and radiation tests, Xinhua cited the China National Space Administration as saying.
The experiments also involve planting potato and other seeds, according to Chinese media reports.
Beijing is pouring billions into its military-run space programme, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022, and of eventually sending humans to the moon.
The Chang'e 4 mission is a step in that direction, significant for the engineering expertise needed to explore and settle the moon, McDowell said.
The main thing about this mission is not science, this is a technology mission, he said.
Chang'e-4 will be the second Chinese probe to land on the moon, following the Yutu ( Jade Rabbit ) rover mission in 2013.
Once on the moon's surface, the rover faces an array of extreme challenges.
During the lunar night -- which lasts 14 earth days -- temperatures will drop as low as minus 173 degrees Celsius (minus 279 Fahrenheit). During the lunar day, also lasting 14 earth days, temperatures soar as high as 127 C (261 F). The rover's instruments must withstand those fluctuations and it must generate enough energy to sustain it during the long night.
Yutu conquered those challenges and, after initial setbacks, ultimately surveyed the moon's surface for 31 months. Its success provided a major boost to China's space programme.
Beijing is planning to send another lunar lander, Chang'e-5, next year to collect samples and bring them back to earth. It is among a slew of ambitious Chinese targets, which include a reusable launcher by 2021, a super-powerful rocket capable of delivering payloads heavier than those NASA and private rocket firm SpaceX can handle, a moon base, a permanently crewed space station, and a Mars rover. Our country's successful lunar exploration project not only vaults us to the top of the world's space power ranks, it also allows the exploration of the far side of the moon, said Niu Min, an expert on China's space programme.
The project, he said in an interview with local website Netease, greatly inspires everyone's national pride and self-confidence.

Clashes outside  Canadas Parliament over immigration
CANADA: Right-wing protesters opposed to Canada joining a UN pact for better regulating worldwide migration clashed Saturday with pro-immigration groups in the biting cold outside parliament.
An estimated 200 members of far-right groups and 100 counter-protesters lobbed expletive-laced insults at each other on the snow-covered lawn, resulting in one arrest.
Scuffles erupted just as the event got underway, but riot police quickly separated the two sides.
The crowd then began chanting Reject immigration pact, but was drowned out by shouts of Shame and Refugees welcome, racists go home. Sylvain Brouillette, spokesman for the protesters, said the United Nations pact risks eroding sovereign immigration policies -- a view echoed by opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, and conservative politicians in other countries, but roundly dismissed by its proponents.
Canada was built on immigration. We have learned to live together and we have found a way to do it well, so we dont need a UN migration pact to tell us what to do and change a system that works, Brouillette said.
Passerby Aditya Rao stopped to listen to the arguments but concluded that the protesters were misguided.
It boggles the mind, he told AFP. These people are grumbling about all the chaotic migration, but at the same time are complaining about an effort to make it orderly and safe. Its atrocious. The non-binding pact is due to be formally adopted at a December 10-11 conference in Marrakesh, Morocco.
It lays down 23 objectives to open up legal migration and better manage migratory flows, as the number of people on the move worldwide has increased to 250 million, or three percent of the world population.

That (Con)fidence vote
Plans are afoot by the UNP to pass a Confidence Motion on behalf of deposed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament on Wednesday. According to reports, the motion has already been submitted to the Secretary General of Parliament with Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa reportedly in the forefront of sponsoring the motion. It is not clear what is intended by the Greens in bringing a Confidence Motion except to express solidarity with him. Because that is not going to change the prevailing status quo nor will this automatically make Wickremesinghe the Prime Minister. Come to that, it is doubtful if the former Prime Minister can muster the support of 113 Members in Parliament for the motion. This is because the JVP is already on record having stated that at no point will it support any move to make Ranil the Prime Minister (It (JVP) has already found fault with Wickremensinghe for occupying Temple Trees). The stand of the rathu sahodarayas has been that the ouster of Wickremesinghe was unconstitutional and it is towards this end that it was supporting moves in Parliament to redress the alleged wrong. Rishad Bathiudeen who has six Members in Parliament who are part of the 106 UNF component has also unequivocally stated that his party was in no way supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe individually and all their efforts have been to promote democracy and protect the Constitution. There is no relationship between the ACMC and the UNP either, he clarified in a statement.
It is difficult to assess the stand of the TNA on this score given that in their several meetings with President Maithripala Sirisena they had insisted on reverting to the pre-October 26 position. However some of its MPs have openly criticized the leadership for seeing to be promoting the cause of the UNP and its leader which they claim was bound to incur the wrath of the public in the North who does not want any truck with political parties in the South. If they (TNA) vote for the Confidence Vote expressing solidarity with Wickremesinghe this is bound to cost the party dearly politically, what with former Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran already gaining ascendancy in the Northern political landscape (in fact Viggy was one of those who opposed TNA's dalliance with the UNP following the outbreak of the crisis). Whether the TNA will take this risk and vote for Wickremesinghe will be known on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the nation will be heartened at the news that President Sirisena will stick to his pledge to end the political impasse within this week. Speaking at the SLFP convention last Tuesday the President promised that he would resolve the crisis within the next seven days without keeping the public in suspense. According to our weekly publication the Sunday Observer, in spite of the possible Supreme Court decision on the dissolution Gazette, the President will make a decision this week to end the current political gridlock in the country. The Supreme Court on Friday put off judgement indefinitely, placing the public in further suspense. However, given the welter of arguments placed before it by all contending parties the court no doubt will have to take its time to unravel all the knotty submissions before arriving at a clear verdict.
The report further stated that if the Supreme Court determines the Gazette issued by the President is valid, a temporary caretaker Government led by MP Mahinda Rajapaksa would be formed until the next General Election. However if the SC decides to the contrary, the report quoting sources said that the possibility of forming a multi-party Government aimed at ruling for another one and half years (the remaining duration of the present Parliament) is being widely discussed by the relevant parties.
It is not clear what form the proposed multi-party Government would take in the event of an adverse Supreme Court ruling. If it will be a combine of all the warring parties, this would be something that would be welcomed by the entire nation who, no doubt, has had enough of the violent politics that were on display in the recent days. Even if it is for a brief period, this is bound to bring a breath of fresh air to an otherwise malodorous political culture that has been the nation's lot to endure for a long period of time. Perhaps it is towards this end that the President had, in recent days, been having discussions with all parties. Crucial discussions were held with Mahinda Rajapaksa and Government stalwarts as well as the UNP and Opposition parties in Parliament. For his part, Rajapaksa too had been holding discussions with a number of Opposition party representatives during the last few days.
In case we are to see a multi-party Government, will the JVP consent to being a partner in such an arrangement One should not forget that the rathu sahodarayas have been in Government for brief periods, first under the parivasa aanduwa (probationary Government) of CBK and later as fully fledged members of the Chandrika Government, sharing Cabinet portfolios. It will also be the first time since 1965 that a Northern political party will be in Government, if the TNA too opts in.

Country sovereign,  no need of UN - Gota
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa rejected the need for United Nations security for the North as the local Forces are strong and capable to protect the country.
Rajapaksa was speaking to the media at the Abhayarama temple in Narahenpita last evening. He was questioned by journalists on the Global Tamil Diasporas purported request from the United Nations for security to the North, considering the prevailing political instability. We can deal with such matters with our militaries, he said.
He said international powers cannot influence Sri Lanka on political matters as a sovereign country.
The prevailing political crisis came up as a result of international involvement during some regimes, he said.
The former Defence Secretary also criticised the UNF government for not having enough understanding regarding national security.
Incidents like the recent murdering of two policemen in Batticoloa would not have taken place if they were aware of national security, he said.
Commenting on the current political situation, Rajapaksa said as the issue is with Parliament, people should be given the opportunity to elect a stable government in Parliament first. Going to the people for a General Election should not be a difficulty for anyone, he added.
The countrys Constitution should not be amended according to personal interests. It is clear that there is a problem with the 19th Amendment, he said.

Detect Breast Cancer with latest 3D Mammogram
A mammogram is one of the best ways to detect breast cancer but many women are known to avoid it due to associated pain and discomfort while undergoingthe said examination. The 3D Digital (Hologic) mammogram at Durdans Hospital ensures minimal pain resulting from less compression, which in no way compromises its accuracy. Durdans Hospitals Hologic Selenia Dimensions 6000 3D MAMMOGRAPHY systemcan detect even the smallest breast cancers and further provides unique advantages of Tomo guided Biopsy and Synthesised 2D.
Durdans Hospitals Hologic Selenia Dimensions 6000 3D MAMMOGRAPHY system is the only digital mammogram (3D) capable of performing tomoguided biopsy or 3D biopsy in Sri Lanka. Tomo guided Biopsy is the process of using image slice(s) to localise and sample a suspected lesion detected on a mammogram. Tomo guided biopsy is therefore superior to other machines that can only perform stereotactic biopsy (biopsy using 2D images) which is less accurate and is also 100% accurate for when biopsy is done we can look at the needle tip in the lesion. This is not possible in 2D.
The advantage of 3D mammogram with tomosynthesis is that being a digital mammogram the radiation dose is already low and with 2D Synthesise it can be lowered further.
The lower radiation dose is highly beneficial for younger patients who may need to undergo mammogram exam. Being a 3D structure, one is able to view the breast, layer by layer with Tomosynthesis technology to reveal any hidden lesions,enabling better detection.
Another unique feature of the mammography system available at Durdans is Synthesised 2D where a 2D image can be reconstructed from a 3D image, to avoid double radiation exposure. In breast examination by mammogram, a 2D image is provided to the specialist toreview.
Durdans Hospital offers a comprehensive breast screening programme where women over 40 years undergo mammogram while women below 40 years undergo ultrasound scan.
Durdans Radiology Department facilitates screening and biopsies for diagnosis of breast cancer.

CEYLON TEA: JAN - OCT 2018 VS 2017
FOB PRICE GAINS: EXPORTS, CROP, DIP
Sri Lankas tea exports for the first ten months, January to October 2018 reported an increase in the FOB (export) price of Rs. 1100 per kilo.
This was despite a marginal decrease in the production and the exports reported in the first ten months of 2018 vis a vis the corresponding period, a year ago.
Sri Lankas tea production in the month of October 2018 reached 23.8 million kgs, compared to 25.7 million kgs in the same month in 2017 reflecting a decline of 1.9 million kilos or by 7.4%, Sri Lanka Tea Board statistics revealed.
The declining trend in tea production was reflected in the cumulative tea production figures from the period January to October periods between the two years 2018 and 2017 as well.
Sri Lanka Tea Board data showed that the nation tea production was 247.1 million kilos of tea in the first ten months of this year Vis a vis the 258.8 million kilos of tea in the corresponding period of 2017. This reflects a decline of 117 million kilos or a marginal 4.5% dip in the total tea production in the first ten months of this year Vis a Vis the corresponding period of a year ago. It is estimated that the year end tea crop would be in the region of 300-310 million kilos, the Sri Lanka Tea Board said.
The decline in the tea crop has been reported in all three elevations and also in orthodox and green tea categories as well.
Only the production of CTC teas has seen an increase in the period under review which is 13 million kilos or by 7.4 %
Elevation wise, the high grown teas have produced 48,993 tonnes, Medium Growns 37,448 tonnes, Low Growns, 158,517 tonnes, Green Teas 2,153 tonnes in a total of 247,111 tonnes, statistics showed.
Of the exports, in the month of October 2018, was 23.3 million kilos, which was a marginal decrease from the 25.5 million kilos for the corresponding period last year. The cumulative tea exports for the ten month period between January and October 2018 was 235.6 million kilos marginally less than the 241.3 million kilos in the corresponding period last year.
The decrease in the tea crop in this country and the unfavourable conditions prevailing in the export markets has led to this situation.
The declining trend has been observed and reflected in the bulk teas, packeted teas and tea bag- categories while there have been increases in exports reported in the instant teas and the black teas.
The export revenues have also come down with the decline in export quantities. The total revenue realized during the first ten months of this year was Rs. 192.4 billion vis a vis the Rs. 194.3 billion, a marginal drop of 1.9 billion, over the corresponding period a year ago. However, the FOB price of Rs. 816.43 per kilo, realized during the first ten months of 2018 showed a gain of Rs. 11 per kilo.

## Title: Global  Climate  Risk Index

Global  Climate  Risk Index
Scaling-up public resources for adaptation, loss and damage as well as tackling the imbalance between financial support provided for mitigation and adaptation is yet another important task for COP24. A good opportunity for looking into the possibilities for new and additional finance for loss and damage would be the technical paper on sources of financial support for loss and damage. The paper is planned to be published in 2019 and received input from the Suva Expert Dialogue that was held at the last session of Subsidiary Bodies (SB48) in May 2018 in Bonn
The Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index is an analysis based on one of the most reliable data sets available on the impacts of extreme weather events and associated socio-economic data. The Germanwatch Climate Risk Index 2019 is the 14th edition of the annual analysis. Its aim is to contextualize ongoing climate policy debates  especially the international climate negotiations  with real-world impacts during the last year and the last 20 years.
People all over the world have to face the reality of climate change  in many parts of the world manifesting as increased volatility of extreme weather events. Between 1998 and 2017, more than 526,000 people died worldwide and losses of US$ 3.47 trillion (in PPP) were incurred as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events.
Whats on the agenda for resilience at COP24 in Katowice
Key messages 
* Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017.* Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the countries most affected by extreme weather events.
* Altogether, more than 526,000 people died as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around US$ 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities).
* Storms and their direct implications  precipitation, floods and landslides  were one major cause of damage in 2017. Of the ten most affected countries in 2017, four were hit by tropical cyclones. Recent science has found a clear link between climate change and record-breaking precipitation of 2017s hurricanes. It also suggests that the number of severe tropical cyclones will increase with every tenth of a degree in global average temperature rise.
* In many cases, single exceptional disasters have such a strong impact that the countries and territories concerned are also ranked high in the long-term index. Over the last few years another category of countries has been gaining relevance: Countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year.
* Of the ten most affected countries and territories (19982017), eight were developing countries in the low income or lower-middle income country group, one was classified as an upper-middle income country (Dominica) and one an advanced economy generating high income (Puerto Rico).
* The Climate Summit in Katowice should adopt the rulebook needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidelines. Furthermore, COP24 must increase efforts to properly address loss and damage, which appears as a cross-cutting issue referenced throughout various negotiation streams, with significant risk of being omitted from final negotiation text. The risks of future climate-related losses and damages are far too severe to simply function as a negotiation chip. 
In Katowice, the three-year period to develop the rulebook for the Paris Agreement comes to an end. As stipulated in the Paris Agreement, states should regularly communicate their priorities, support needs, plans and activities in the field of adaptation (Article 7, para 10,11). These reports (adaptation communications) shall also inform the global stocktake of countries climate outputs. Based on the previous negotiations, it will be up to the reporting countries to decide in which document the information will be provided. They may be, for example, part of the National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) or the National Climate Plans (NDCs). Parties still debate whether the guidelines should be identical in both cases, or whether guidelines should be vehicle-specific, i.e. separate guidelines for NAPs and NDCs. Regardless of the document the information is produced for, it should be publicly accessible in an adaptation register (Article 7 12). The issue here is whether climate protection measures and climate adaptation measures should be made accessible separately or jointly. Apart from that, in Katowice it will be important that the issue of loss and damage finds its way into the rulebook, especially under the global stocktake.
On the basis of a COP21 decision, the Least Developed Country Expert Group, in collaboration with the Adaptation Committee, prepared a report on progress in the process of developing and implementing NAPs. The recommendations of the report will be submitted to COP24.
Scaling-up public resources for adaptation, loss and damage as well as tackling the imbalance between financial support provided for mitigation and adaptation is yet another important task for COP24. A good opportunity for looking into the possibilities for new and additional finance for loss and damage would be the technical paper on sources of financial support for loss and damage. The paper is planned to be published in 2019 and received input from the Suva Expert Dialogue that was held at the last session of Subsidiary Bodies (SB48) in May 2018 in Bonn. The current terms of reference and outline for the report, unfortunately though, foresee only looking into existing sources of finance.
Furthermore, the decision for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement needs to be finalised in Katowice. As a multilateral climate fund focussing especially on concrete small-scale adaptation projects to address the needs of the most vulnerable people and communities in developing countries, the Fund covers an important niche in the adaptation finance landscape.
Adopting these central decisions at COP24 would be a great opportunity to address and respond in a timely way to the devastating impacts of climate change, such as those caused by tropical cyclones. It will therefore be crucial that loss and damage be significantly represented in the rulebook. The risks of future climate-related loss and damage are far too severe to simply use them as a negotiation chip. Forward looking adaptation communications and the continuous exchange of knowledge on adaptation to climate change that is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals is another aspect of utmost importance.

## Title: Grenfell Tower

## Section: T&C
## Date: Monday, December 10, 2018 - 01:00
Grenfell Tower
It was like a burnt matchbox in the sky.
It was black and long and burnt in the sky.
You saw it through the flowering stumps of trees. You
saw it beyond the ochre spire of the church. You saw
it in the tears of those who survived.
You saw it through the rage of those who survived.
You saw it past the posters of those who had burnt to ashes. You saw
it past the posters of those who jumped to their deaths. You saw it
through the TV images of flames through windows Running up the
aluminium cladding.
You saw it in print images of flames bursting out from the roof. You
heard it in the voices loud in the streets.
You heard it in the cries in the air howling for justice.
You heard it in the pubs the streets the basements the digs. You
heard it in the wailing of women and the silent scream Of orphans
wandering the streets.
You saw it in your baby who couldnt sleep at night Spooked
by the ghosts that wander the area still trying To escape the
fires that came at them black and choking. You saw it in your
dreams of the dead asking if living Had no meaning being
poor in a land
Where the poor die in flames without warning.
But when you saw it with your eyes it seemed what the eyes Saw did
not make sense cannot make sense will not make sense. You saw it
there in the sky, tall and black and burnt.
You counted the windows and counted the floors
And saw the sickly yellow of the half-burnt cladding And
what you saw could only be seen in nightmare.
Like a war zone come to the depths of a fashionable borough. Like a
war zone planted here in the city.
To see with the eyes that which one only sees
In nightmares turns the day to night, turns the world upside down.
Those who were living now are dead
Those who were breathing are from the living earth fled.
If you want to see how the poor die, come see Grenfell Tower. See the
tower, and let a world-changing dream flower.
Residents of the area call it the crematorium. It has
revealed the undercurrents of our age.
The poor who thought voting for the rich would save them. The
poor who believed all that the papers said.
The poor who listened with their fears.
The poor who live in their rooms and dream for their kids. The poor
are you and I, you in your garden of flowers,
In your house of books, who gaze from afar
At a destiny that draws near with another name.
Sometimes it takes an image to wake up a nation
From its secret shame. And here it is every name
Of someone burnt to death, on the stairs or in their room,
Who had no idea what they died for, or how they were betrayed. They
did not die when they died; their deaths happened long Before.
Happened in the minds of people who never saw
Them. Happened in the profit margins. Happened
In the laws. They died because money could be saved and made.
Those who are living now are dead
Those who were breathing are from the living earth fled.
If you want to see how the poor die, come see Grenfell Tower See
the tower, and let a world-changing dream flower.
They called the tower ugly; they named it an eyesore. All
around the beautiful people in their beautiful houses Didnt
want the ugly tower to ruin their house prices.
Ten million was spent to encase the tower in cladding. Had
it ever been tested before except on this eyesore, Had it
ever been tested for fire, been tried in a blaze
But it made the tower look pretty, yes it made the tower look pretty. But in
twenty-four storeys, not a single sprinkler.
In twenty-four storeys not a single alarm that worked. In
twenty-four storeys not a single fire escape,
Only a single stairwell designed in hell, waiting For an
inferno. Thats the story of our times.
Make it pretty on the outside, but a death trap On the
inside. Make the hollow sound nice, make The empty
look nice. Thats all they will see,
How it looks, how it sounds, not how it really is, unseen. But if
you really look you can see it, if you really listen You can hear
it. Youve got to look beneath the cladding. Theres cladding
everywhere. Political cladding,
Economic cladding, intellectual claddingthings that look good But
have no centre, have no heart, only moral padding.
They say the words but the words are hollow.
They make the gestures and the gestures are shallow.
Their bodies come to the burnt tower but their souls dont follow.
Those who were living are now dead
Those who were breathing are from the living earth fled.
If you want to see how the poor die, come see Grenfell Tower. See the
tower, and let a world-changing deed flower.
The voices here must speak for the dead. Speak
for the dead. Speak for the dead.
See their pictures line the walls. Poverty is its own Colour, its
own race. They were Muslim and Christian, Black and white
and colours in between. They were young And old and beautiful
and middle-aged. There were girls In their best dresses with
hearts open to the future.
There was an old man with his grandchildren; There
was Amaya Tuccu-Ahmedin, three years old,
Burnt to ashes before she could see the lies of the world. There
are names who were living beings who dreamt
Of fame or contentment or education or love
Who are now ashes in a burnt-out shell of cynicism. There
were two Italians, lovely and young,
Who in the inferno were on their mobile phone to friends While the
smoke of profits suffocated their voices.
There was the baby thrown from many storeys high By a
mother who knew otherwise he would die.
There were those who jumped from their windows And
those who died because they were told to stay
In their burning rooms. There was the little girl on fire Seen
diving out from the twentieth floor. Need I say more.
Those who are living are now dead
Those who were breathing are from the living earth fled.
If you want to see how the poor die, come see Grenfell Tower. See
the tower, and let a world-changing deed flower.
Always theres that discrepancy
Between what happens and what we are told. The
official figures were stuck at thirty.
Truth in the world is rarer than gold.
Bodies brought out in the dark Bodies
still in the dark.
Dark the smoke and dark the head. Those
who were living are now dead.
And while the tower flamed they were tripping Over
bodies at the stairs
Because it was pitch-black. And
those that survived
Sleep like refugees on the floor Of a
sports centre.
And like a creature scared of the dark, A
figure from on high flits by,
Speaking to the police and brave firefighters, But
avoiding the victims,
Whose hearts must be brimming with dread.
Those who were breathing are from the living earth fled.
But if you go to Grenfell Tower, if you can pull
Yourselves from your tennis games and your perfect dinners If
you go there while the black skeleton of that living tower
Still stands unreal in the air, a warning for similar towers to fear, You
will breathe the air thick with grief
With women spontaneously weeping And
children wandering around stunned
And men secretly wiping a tear from the eye
And people unbelieving staring at this sinister form in the sky. You
will see the trees with their leaves green and clean
And will inhale the incense meant To
cleanse the air of unhappiness You
will see banks of flowers
And white paper walls sobbing with words
And candles burning for the blessing of the dead You
will see the true meaning of community
Food shared and stories told and volunteers everywhere You
will breathe the air of incinerators
Mixed with the essence of flower.
If you want to see how the poor die, come see Grenfell Tower.
Make sense of these figures if you will
For the spirit lives where truth cannot kill. Ten
million spent on the falsely clad
In a fire where hundreds lost all they had. Five
million offered in relief
Ought to make a nation alter its belief. An
image gives life and an image kills.
The heart reveals itself beyond political skills. In
this age of austerity
The poor die for others prosperity. Nurseries
and libraries fade from the land. A strange time
is shaping on the strand.
A sword of fate hangs over the deafness of power.
See the tower, and let a new world-changing thought flower.

Gunathilaka stakes claim for Test openers berth
NAPIER, Sunday: Danushka Gunathilaka staked an early claim for the Test openers spot with an aggressive knock of 83 off 77 balls to give the touring Sri Lankan side an overall lead of 100 at the end of the second day of their 3-day warm-up match against New Zealand XI here on Sunday.
Gunathilaka who reached his half-century off 59 balls struck 12 fours and one six in his innings and featured in a century (116) opening partnership with Lahiru Thirmanne who made a solid 45 off 83 balls (6 fours) as Sri Lanka ended the day at 160 for two wickets. 
Earlier New Zealand XI recovered from their overnight score of 67-4 to take a 60-run first innings lead by scoring 270-8 before declaring their innings.
Twenty-year-old Sandeep Patel from Auckland hit an impressive 69 off 106 balls (7 fours).
The Lankan bowlers failed to finish off the tail after reducing the home side to 191-7 with 19-year-old Katene Clarke (46), captain Peter Younghusband (31 n.o.) and 18-year-old Max Chu (33 n.o.) putting up stern resistance.

Hambantota International Port Responds to Fire in Tsunami Village
The occupants of a home located in a Tsunami Village in Hambantota escaped a tragedy last week, due to the timely intervention of the Hambantota International Ports Emergency Response Team (ERT).
The ERT responded to a distress call for assistance in dousing a fire that had erupted in the home which had occurred while the occupants of the house were in residence. Since the house was one of a row of similar homes constructed in the Tsunami Village, the fire if it had not been contained could have caused severe damage to the village and the several families living there, especially since there were women, children and even pregnant mothers around at the time the accident had occurred.
On arrival at the scene the Response Team had immediately identified the need to isolate the fire without allowing it to spread. A spokesman for the Hambantota International Port said, The risk of the fire spreading fast was high as the houses are lined up very close to each other in the Tsunami Village. The rescue team was able to isolate the fire and then methodically extinguish it while the rest of the team evacuated the residents.
The spokesman added that the brave action taken by the ERT prevented a serious incident which could have resulted in massive damage and loss of life, especially since the incident took place on a holiday when most of the families were in their homes. It is fortunate that the services of the Hambantota International Ports ERT was so readily available to assist the residents of the area in their moment of distress.
The successful containment of the fire is proof of the ports firefighting expertise and capacity for operating under pressure. The fact that the Hambantota International Port is fully equipped to handle any fire that may break out, as part of the services it makes available, is very important.
The Tsunami Village has expressed their deep gratitude to the Hambantota International Port for the expeditious assistance and firefighting services which were completed with zero casualties.

I WILL ABIDE BY SC RULING - PRESIDENT
President Maithripala Sirisena said that he will honourably accept whatever ruling given by the Supreme Court on the petitions filed against the Gazette notification issued by him to dissolve Parliament and take future political actions according to it.
He said he is not happy about the administrative process vested in the President as a single individual under the Constitution as it should not be so in a country, with strong democratic traditions. He expressed confidence that this situation would soon change enabling him to work with a Prime Minister and a Cabinet of Ministers.
He said that he acted in a very responsible and patient manner in a country without a functioning Prime Minister and a Cabinet of Ministers within the last few days.
The President expressed these sentiments addressing the gathering at a programme held in Polonnaruwa on December 9.
The President who described the current political crisis as a problem among political parties added that certain people are attempting to interpret it as a problem between him and Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The President however described this as a clash between an indigenous and foreign philosophy and added that when one implemented the philosophy of rising up independently through self-reliance without succumbing to foreign pressures, foreign forces would naturally become a challenge.
This was a matter which should be understood by the people, the President added.
The President said he was certain that all the people who loved the country would take decisions favourable to the motherland.
The programme was held at the Polonnaruwa Royal College hall to mark the distribution of livelihood development equipment for 2018 under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa District Development Programme Equipment valued at Rs. 294 million were distributed among 4,500 beneficiaries at this event. former NCP Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne and Polonnaruwa UC Chairman Chanaka Sidath Ranasinghe were also present on the occasion.

ICRA Lanka reaffirms [SL] A+ rating  with a stable outlook for JAT Holdings
ICRA Lanka Limited, a subsidiary of ICRA Limited, group company of Moodys Investors Service, has reaffirmed the issuer rating of [SL] A+ with a stable outlook for JAT Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. JAT Holdings, one of Sri Lankas most successful and diversified conglomerates, celebrates 25 years of being a pioneer and innovator in the paints, furnishing, property, agri and technology sectors. Several factors including the companys financial performance, brand strength and future prospects were taken in to consideration for the affirmation of the rating.
The companys strong brand name and dominant market position in the Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi wood coating industry, especially in the water based, PU and UV wood coating segments played a key role. In 2017, JAT became the largest global distributor for the Sayerlack brand of wood coatings, which is owned by Sherwin Williams USA, the largest coating company in the world. JAT Holdings has distribution rights for Sayerlack for the entire South Asian region.
JAT also recently tied up with world-renowned brands such as SEA Bauformat Kitchens from Germany and Armstrong Ceilings from USA while recently acquiring the Harris brushes and roller brand; the market leader in the Sri Lankan paint brush segment. Diversifying into the premium interior design segment the company provides furnishing solutions in the premium real estate sector in Sri Lanka and has noticeably gained a leading market share.
ICRA Lanka also took note of JATs diversification into fast growing export markets (such as India, Bangladesh and Maldives). JAT has become the leading player in the Bangladesh wood coating segment by distributing Sayerlack products through its strong distribution network and effective marketing initiatives for over 15 years. The management has recognized India, Maldives and Pakistan as more promising growth opportunities and has continued its significant brand building efforts to penetrate into these markets.
Over the past few years, the companys operating profit margins have moderated noticeably due to cost increases (including sustained SL Rupee depreciation), increased competition with higher price discounts, and higher revenue contribution from the projects segment, which has relatively lower profit margins. During FY2018, the impact on the operating profit margins were relatively high due to the compound effect of the above mentioned factors amidst the weaker macro-economic outlook that prevailed during this period. JATs strong brand equity and the market leadership however, have enabled the company to pass on partly any additional cost increases despite the growing competition.
The rating also considers positively the companys recent diversification into innovative new product categories such as ceiling products, sand paper, Brush Master paint brushes, fire resistant paints etc., which have been posting volume growth over the past few years.
JAT envisages itself as a leading player in the broader interior and living spaces market and has continued with its tie-ups with premium international brands such as Herman Miller, Armstrong etc.

Inter tidal art gallery
British sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor has once again left his mark on the environment with a stunning new installation. Created for the Fairmont Maldives Sirru Fen Fushi, Coralarium is a semi-submerged art gallery filled with nearly 30 sculptures that will act as a habitat for coral and other marine species.
After nine months of work, the installation has come to life and will live as an evolving monument in the sea. The frame, made from pH-neutral marine steel, is punctuated with cutouts mimicking the organic forms found in the water, making it a solid yet transparent structure. Best of all, marine life is free to explore the new environment.
Its almost like an inverse zoo, says deCaires Taylor in a short film documenting the project. In cities, we go into space and look at caged animals. Whereas this is almost like were the tourists, but were in the cage and the marine life can come and go and look at us. Its almost a reversal of how we interact with wildlife. The sculptures are scattered across three levels to demonstrate the interconnectedness of the planets elements. At the top, black silhouetted figures sit on the roof, reaching for the sky. Some figures stand inside the gallery and are alternately submerged and revealed according to the tides. The last level is a submerged layer living underwater, in constant contact with marine life. And while marine life begins to place its imprint on the sculptures, the entire structure also evolves according to the light. DeCaires Taylor specifically chose stainless steel for its ability to reflect the surroundings. This allows Colararium to blend into the waters and reflect back the mood and feeling of each day. The sculptures, which are often hybrid forms, were based on casts of real people, about half of whom are from the Maldives. Other organic elements are based on native species to the island and its reefs, including banyan trees, screw pines, and staghorn corals. And to jumpstart the reef, coral propagation was used to encourage growth near the sculptures.
Most of the works also feature root systems, symbolic of the dependence of humans on the natural environment, a connection to place, the artist shares. White fragments of dead calcium coral washed up by the sea form the shapes of bones, ingrained into the surfaces, aiming to show how the coral reefs are part of the Maldivian DNA.
The Coralarium experience begins while still on land, as deCaires Taylor has made full use of the environment for this installation. A long pool transecting the island denotes the starting point of the experience. Visitors are then led along a pathway marked by underwater poplar trees and native planted coral to a submerged staircase and platform which gives access to the gallery. Visitors will be able to tour the Coralarium with an expert guide from the Fairmont Maldives, who will explain the sculptures and marine life.

IPL 2019  auction: Will Lasith  Malinga  find any takers
Sri Lankas fast bowler Lasith Malinga has listed himself in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) auction to be held in Jaipur on December 18.
The veteran pacer is the highest-wicket taker in IPL history and had enjoyed tremendous success earlier. After being unsold in IPL 2018 auction, Malinga is back. But will the celebrated bowler find any takers

MALINGA HAS A BASE PRICE OF RS. 2 CRORE 
Malinga has listed himself among nine other players with the maximum base price of Rs. 2 crore.
This comes as a surprise for many as the Lankan ace had joined Mumbai Indians as a mentor for the IPL 11 season.
But now he has once again flirted with the possibility of being called up by a team.

MALINGA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS 
Malinga has been one of the most high-profile players in the IPL since its inception in 2008.
He has won three titles with MI to script his name in the record books.
Malinga has been always known for his slinging action and dearth of pace to trouble batsmen.
From toe-crushing yorkers to sublime slower deliveries, Malinga was in the thick of action.

MALINGA TROUBLED BY INJURIES IN RECENT PAST 
The 35-year-old pacer has been troubled by injuries in the recent past.
He did make a successful comeback to international cricket this year in limited-overs.
But he has lost the pace and fear factor that governed his success.
Malinga is wanting to represent Sri Lanka at the ICC World Cup 2019, but the IPL is altogether a different prospect.

WHY CHAMPION MALINGA IS LIKELY TO BE IGNORED 
Malinga has an impressive 154 wickets in just 110 matches in IPL.
His contributions will never be forgotten.
But at the moment, Malinga will find it difficult to make a comeback to the IPL.
Firstly, its his base price of Rs. 2 crore, which is seen as a massive sum.
Secondly, teams would want to go for younger options.

Kandy SC continue unbeaten  run with win over CH
Kandy Sports Club cashed on home advantage to post another win in the first round of the Dialog league rugby match by beating CH & FC by 38 points to 22 at Nittawela grounds yesterday.
Kandy SC came from deep, with stand-off Arshad Jamaldeen breaking out of defence on many occasions to set up counter attacks before sending his team mates for two tries to keep his side in contention.
Physically the intensity for Kandy was there from start to finish, they were technically good, CH & FC didnt help themselves kicking away possession when they didnt really need to. They needed to make Kandy tackle and they didnt do that often enough.
After the turn over possession in the game was more for the winners, they expended a lot of energy tackling.
Kandy made CH & FC to work for everything it got, but the gap between a rugby powerhouse Kandy and CH was quite evident.
Kandy put pressure on them in all departments, at set phase, breakdown and in defence  mid way of the game, even with the kicking there was hardly a contest. Kandys attacking master-class helped them to score six tries.
They weathered a strong beginning by handling the ball well and began to feast on CH & FCs errors to find holes in a porous defense.
All hopes of CH & FC had to upset the table leaders was buried due to some good thinking coming from the fly half and the lineout jumpers of Kandy.
The scorers for Kandy SC were tries from Danush Dayan, Richard Dharmapala, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Danushka Ranjan, Arshad Jamaldeen and Sashik Jayawardene. The goal kicking was done by Thilina Wijesinghe.
For CH & FC the tries came from Prasad Madushanka two, Sudam Sooriyarchchi one and the goal kicking from Samuel Maduwantha.

Lanka signs agreement to boost fruit production
Sri Lanka signed a China South-South Cooperation Tripartite Agreement with Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and China last week at FAO headquarters. The aim of this South-South Cooperation project is to help Sri Lanka boost the production and commercialization of fruit crops among the value chain actors in the country.
FAOs South-South Cooperation initiatives help developing countries share and transfer agricultural knowledge and expertise among themselves, so that innovation and good practices that have been tested elsewhere in the global South can benefit other countries facing similar challenges.
Sri Lanka is the second country in Asia (after Mongolia) to be funded through the FAO-China South-South Cooperation Programme. The new project, valued over USD 1.1 million, will mainly focus on the increase of fruit production and trade in and out of the country, contributing to FAOs Strategic Objectives and to the Country Programming Framework for Sri Lanka.
China has been an active participant, strong supporter and major contributor of FAOs South-South Cooperation, granting USD 80 million to the FAO-China South-South Cooperation Programme in support of knowledge sharing and technology transfer among southern countries.
Sri Lanka has had strong economic growth since the end of its 30-year civil war, but the challenges remain critical. Poor cultivation and high post-harvest losses lead to low yield and inadequate adherence to international food safety standards.
The project will include practical field-based capacity building through various implementation approaches. During the two years of the project, eight experts and six technicians will be fielded to offer technical guidance to local communities, transfer practical and advanced technologies and organize training courses.
Priority areas will also include rising up the value chain of target fruit crops and helping develop domestic and export market to increase farmers income.
Widely regarded as a successful practice, South-South Cooperation between FAO, China and Sri Lanka will enable the effective exchange of expertise while boosting national food security and small-scale farmer livelihoods in South Asia.
Daniel Gustafson, Deputy Director-General (Programmes) of FAO, highly commended the notable contribution of China to the success of global South-South Cooperation since 1996.
He recognized the achievement of this collaboration now expanding to Sri Lanka under the umbrella of the FAO-China South-South Cooperation Programme.

LAUGFS Power to invest Rs 3.5 bn to produce  20 MV solar power
LAUGFS Power Ltd a subsidiary of LAUGFS Gas PLC, will invest a further Rs. 3.5 billion until 2020 to add 20 MV of solar power to the national Grid.
LAUGFS Power engaged in renewable energy solutions with mini hydro power (since 2014) and solar power generation projects currently owns and operates Sri Lankas largest solar power project in Hambantota and plans tore-invest in two stages to add 20 MW of Solar.
Managing Director LAUGFS, Thilak De Silva told Daily News Business that the first 10 MW project in Hambantota is a Joint venter solar project with Sustainable Energy Authority on a profit sharing basis.
This would be Sri Lankas first solar battery storage capacity to provide stable power to the national grid. We plan to commence operations early next year. In addition we will reinvest to increase capacity in our Hambantota Solar facility in latter part of 2019,he said.
In addition LAUGFS Power would also build a 1MW solar Power projects in Embilipitiya, under the Soorya Bala Sangramaya Phase II launched by the Ministry of Power & Renewable Energy. We have obtained all approvals and will commence project works by January.
He see that they see great potential and high demand for Solar in the future and would invest in more projects. On the advice of Group -Chairman. W. K. H. Wegapitiya, we are currently looking at investing in Kenya on several hydro power projects.
LAUGFS Power set up Sri Lankas largest solar power project in 2017with an investment of around Rs.5 billion. The 20MW facility at Hambantota was constructed by international experts deploying European technology. LAUGFS expects to contribute 40 GWh annually to the national grid.
These solar power projects will be an important contributor to reduce the countrys dependence on traditional fossil fuel for electricity generation, significantly driving down foreign currency outflow. As per the Central Bank Report 2017, around 69.2% of the electricity demand in the country is at present met through fossil fuel based power generation.
The new plant is expected to eliminate the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHG) by about 28,000 tons annually from the air that would otherwise have been emitted with the use of fossil fuel.
As a brand with deep Sri Lankan roots, LAUGFS in a bid to minimise the environmental footprint across the group, LAUGFS Power launched an ambitious project to install solar PV systems on the rooftops of all possible premises of LAUGFS businesses.
As the first phase of this initiative, 324 kW and 47.5 kW rooftop solar PV systems were installed with an investment of Rs. 49 million at the LAUGFS rubber factory in Horana and LAUGFS Holdings head office in Colombo respectively.

Life Lessons
Little would Louisa May Alcott have dreamed when she lifted her pen after writing the last line of her autobiographical novel in 1868 hundred and fifty years later a nine-year-old girl in Sri Lanka would be reading it with the same rapture she reads contemporary work like Harry Potter and the Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Alcott might also have been surprised to know that the girl had picked the book from her mothers bookshelf, having seen how her mother reads and rereads the book and often heard that if her mother would be stuck on a desert island  with only one book to bring with her  it would be this one: Little Women.
I suppose you already know by now that the above is true because the girl happens to be my daughter and the tattered copy she is reading, the covers pasted together with tape, once belonged to my grandmother. I am sure like so many others belonging to many generations before me, those of us who love this book return to it again and again, called to it by some mysterious yearning for a life we never had, memories we never experienced, and yet driven by a wish to identify ourselves with one or the other of the main characters - which needless to say, often happens to be that of Joe March.
It is amazing, however, to read in a book written about a book, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of Little Women and Why it Still Matters by Anne Boyd Rioux, Alcott wasnt happy when her publisher asked her to write a book about girls. She told a friend, I could not write a girls story, knowing little about any but my own sisters and always preferring boys. But she persevered, and when Little Women was published 150 years ago, in September 1868, 2,000 copies were sold in two weeks. The book has never gone out of print since then, and has appeared in hundreds of editions and dozens of foreign translations.
Through the adventures of the March children and their mother, living in somewhat impoverished circumstances in a small Massachusetts town while their father is away during the Civil War Alcott brings to life four different girls endowing each with assets and flaws. Beautiful Meg is vain and dreams of riches; stubborn-but-talented Jo is prone to fits of temper; sweet, timid Beth wants to spend adulthood at home; and often-selfish Amy yearns to be an artist.
It is no secret that Jo mirrored its author, while her real-life sistersAnna, Lizzie, and Mayare models for the March sisters. What readers had not known at the time the book was published was that unlike Jo, Alcott experienced an unstable family life. Her father Bronson was a Transcendentalist who rubbed shoulders with Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Although he encouraged his daughters writing, he believed working for money would violate his philosophy. Consequently, his wife and daughters labored to feed the family, which moved often. This may explain Mr. Marchs small-but-exalted role in Little Women.
For most of us, the most important question in the book was: Would Jo marry her charming neighbor, Laurie Sadly, no. For Alcott had hoped to make Jo a literary spinster, like herself but when fans demanded that Jo marry, Alcott bowed to pressure. She marries Joe off, but makes sure she doesnt give her readers everything they wanted. She makes Jo reject Lauries marriage proposal and wed a less appealing older man. Faced with readers eagerness for a wedding, Alcott later said that she didnt dare to refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her (Joe). If Joes choice of partner had disappointed the 19th century readers, it equally disappointed 21st century feminists, because the marriage caused Jo to abandon her writing career.
Through her book written to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Little Women, Anne Boyd Rioux, a professor at the University of New Orleans and a scholar of 19th century womens literature shows how well she understands the love so many of us have for Alcotts classic. Rioux says despite the fact that schools barely teach Alcotts work today, with educators believing that requiring a boy to read a book with women in the title will forever turn him against reading, the book really does still matter.
Tracing literary works that owe a debt to Alcott, she writes, Just as Hemingway claimed that all of American literature (by men) came from Huck Finn, we can also say that much of American womens literature has come from Little Women.Little Women has been called the mother of all girls books. It is also, arguably, the most beloved book of American women writers (and near the top for women writers around the globe) and has exerted more influence on women writers as a group than any other single book.
Rioux also argues thatLittle Women is not strictly for girls. Theodore Roosevelt, who was the very model of a manly man, admitted that at the risk of being deemed effeminate, he worshipped Little Women and its sequel, Little Men. At the end of the 19th century, Little Women appeared on a list of the 20 best books for boys, but in 2015, Charles McGrath of the New York Times confessed that as a child, he read Little Women in a brown paper wrapper to avoid taunts from other boys. Rioux says she understands that reading the novel and feeling like outsiders can be unsettling for boys, but she believes thats a great experience for them to have. She also adds, for good measure, that the novel also shows how men are educated into their gender, as Laurie must give up his music and prepare to take over his grandfathers business.
In her book, Rioux shows Little Women as a love letter filled with life lessons. She argues for the positive influence exerted by the book and in particular by the character of Jo, who chooses the life of the mind over the lure of privilege, pretty clothes and boys. Furthermore, she explains, its a book that has had real world impacts on peoples lives and their perception of themselves and perception of each other.
Alcotts decision to throw the spotlight on four different girls demonstrated to readers that womanhood isnt something youre born with; its something that you learn and grow into, Rioux says. And you have the ability to pick and choose which parts of it you want. These words bring to mind Alcotts portrayal of the girls overworked mother, Mamee, who concedes, I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it.
One sleepy afternoon in September when the girls and Laurie sit in a quiet nook and chat about their future Joe says, If we are all alive ten years hence, lets meet, and see how many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now. They might not have achieved their wishes ten years later, but hundred and fifty years into the future the sisterly bond of the March girls continue to be held as a paragon of female friendship, so often belittled by women in modern fiction by being cruel to one another in order to fit into a male space.
Theres no doubt hundred and fifty years hence Little Women will continue to be read and reread because, like how Louisa May Alcott said, Some books are so familiar that reading them is like being home again.

Lose weight before pregnancy
Helping women lose weight before they conceive is the only way to curb hereditary obesity and the life-threatening complications that come with it, a new study urges. A child's risks of obesity are closely tied to their mother's weights, and following healthy habits can reduce the risks associated with obesity during pregnancy by up to 75 per cent.
The type 2 diabetes management drug, metformin, may be enticing to patients and doctors alike, but a new study from the University of Adelaide suggests that while it may help curb pregnancy weight-gain, it does not reduce risks of complications.
And those complications, in turn, continue to raise risks of maternal mortality, as well as a child's obesity.
The new study reaffirms that the best interventions are to lifestyle and diet and argues that they should really be made before pregnancy - though one expert says that it's never too late to lose weight. In the US about other high-income countries like the UK and Australia, about half of women are already overweight or even obese by the time they become pregnant.
As a fetus develops, a mother's weight gain is inevitable and important to supporting its growth and the changes to the woman's body. But unhealthy weights dramatically raise risks of complications that can threaten the lives of both mothers and babies. Among these complications is gestational diabetes, for which the risks are higher for overweight or obese women. Insulin is the most common treatment for diabetes but can cause weight-gain. The drug is safe and effective for treating diabetes in non-pregnant people, and has also shown promise for managing cholesterol and general weight loss. The University of Adelaide researchers recruited 500 pregnant women who were obese or overweight for their study of the potential benefits of metformin and diet and exercise.
All of the women were advised on healthy diet and exercise habits and half of them were prescribed metformin. The metformin worked to limit how much weight the women on it gained during each month of their pregnancies, it did nothing substantial to cut their risks of developing gestational diabetes, needing C-sections or giving birth to babies over 4kg (just under 9lbs).
Despite being offered diet and lifestyle advice during pregnancy, the women involved in the study made few changes, so their risks and outcomes remained largely the same, too.
Dr Raul Artal, chair emeritus of Saint Louis University's OBGYN and women's health department, agrees that making lifestyle changes to lose weight before pregnancy is certainly preferable, it's not too late if a woman is already expecting.
He advises that pregnant women get at least half an hour of physical activity ('walking and increasing the pace, joining a prenatal exercise class') a day, and urges expectant mothers to make time for this, even if it means climbing the stairs at work.
And diets, he says, are little different from what's best for non-pregnant patients: low on carbs and fats, stressing instead 'balance' and lots of vegetables.

Mahinda appeals for patience
The political instability that we now experience can easily be resolved, but as this matter is before Courts, we have to act with patience, former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking to the press after participating in religious observances at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Kandy.
With the Court interim order, I am unable to carry out my work on behalf of the masses, Rajapaksa added.
Making reference to the appeal the Sri Lamka Podujana Peramuna has made before courts, Rajapaksa said, nowhere in the world has a judiciary acted in a way, where the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are accountable to court on this issue.
The steps I took no sooner I assumed duties as Prime Minister are being called Sandarshana by some sections of the media, but they should understand that I took these measures to provide relief to the masses who were facing trying times under three years of Yaha Palanaya, MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
The former government had all the facilities to provide relief to the masses,but they did not do so, he said.
We held discussions at Cabinet level to provide relief to the masses by bringing down the prices of some essential commodities, but the Court order has prevented us from moving any further, he added.
Right now, Parliament is dissolved and I see no point in attending Parliament.
He went on to say the country was waiting to see whether the JVP would cast their vote make Ranil Wickremesinghe the Prime Minister. He said the fact is Ranil does not command the majority. Rajapaksa said we can go before the people and see whether the masses would cast their vote the make Ranil the Prime Minister.

Maldives applies to rejoin Commonwealth
The Maldives has applied to rejoin the Commonwealth, reversing a policy of isolation under autocratic leader Abdulla Yameen who suffered a shock defeat in September.
His successor, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, wrote to the 53-member bloc on Friday seeking readmission two years after Yameen pulled the atoll nation out of it, the president's office said Sunday.
Yameen withdrew the Maldives, an archipelago of 340,000 Sunni Muslims, from the Commonwealth after it mounted pressure on him to protect human rights and ensure the rule of law amid a ferocious crackdown on dissent.
Solih's office said the new president's administration believed in the values of the bloc, which consists mainly of former territories and colonies of the British empire. - AFP

Mexican  volunteer crowned  Miss World
CHINA: A Mexican model and volunteer was crowned Miss World at a glitzy event on the tropical Chinese island of Hainan on Saturday.
Miss Mexico Vanessa Ponce de Leon, 26, has a degree in international business, volunteers for Migrantes en el Camino and is on the board of directors of a rehab centre for girls, according to the Miss World website.
She was crowned as the 68th Miss World by last years winner, Manushi Chhillar of India, in the coastal city of Sanya.
The colourful ceremony included US group Sister Sledge performing their 1979 disco anthem We Are Family.
First runner up was Thailands Nicolene Pichapa Limsnukan, a 20-year-old studying business administration. Miss Belarus Maria Vasilevich, Miss Jamaica Kadijah Robinson and Miss Uganda Quiin Abenakyo were also among the final five.
It is the eighth time the Miss World final has been held in Sanya, which first hosted the pageant in 2003.
At the finals three years ago controversy erupted as officials in Hong Kong stopped Miss Canada, Anastasia Lin, from boarding a plane bound for Sanya, telling her she would not receive a visa.
The 25-year old actress claimed the decision was due to her stance on Chinas human rights record, including its persecution of Falun Gong, a Chinese spiritual group of which she is a practitioner.

Ministry Secretaries to be summoned - Patali
Steps would be taken to summon several leading public servants before the Finance Committee and the Public Accounts Committee shortly, Parliamentarian Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Speaking a press conference held at Temple Trees yesterday, he said the public servants to be questioned are S. Amarasekara who functioned as Secretary to Mahinda Rajapaksa, S.R. Attygalle who functioned as Secretary to the Finance Ministry, Vasantha Perera who functioned as Secretary to the Commerce, Trade and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry, Upali Marasinghe who functioned as Secretary, Housing and Social Welfare Ministry and Kodikara who functioned as Secretary to the International Trade and Investment Ministry.
He said a motion would be tabled in this connection in Parliament signed by him together with Parliamentarians Lakshman Kiriella, Ravi Karunanayake, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Arjuna Ranatunga.
Ranawaka said they properly tabled a no-confidence motion in Parliament against the pseudo government on November 14. Thereafter on November 15, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the no-confidence motion had been duly passed.
Various views were expressed on this issue. Some argued that the no-confidence motion was not properly submitted and approved in Parliament and it was not mentioned in the Hansard, he said.
But the Speaker said the Hansard reported that the no-confidence motion was passed properly according to Standing Orders.
Thereafter, this issue went to court and the Court of Appeal accepted the Hansard report as an official document and issued an interim injunction on the purported Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, Ranawaka said .
On November 29 and 30, they passed a resolution to cut off the office expenses of all Ministers according to powers vested in Parliament under Section 148 of the Constitution.
If the aforesaid Ministers had acted in violation of the resolution passed on November 30, they would take action against them. They hoped to inculcate some discipline by such action, Ranawaka said.

MRs suspension placed country in peril - Bandula
A great obstruction has been caused to the countrys economy and community life due to the sudden abolition of powers of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, former Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as former Finance Minister announced a great amount of relief measures for the benefit of farmers, agriculture, small and medium scale industries and several other sectors, but these relief measures had been denied to them due to the prohibition of the Cabinet by court in response to a Writ of Quo Warranto sought by the UNP.
Addressing a press conference at the Vajirasharamaya, Borella on December 9, Guanwardena said their party boycotted parliament because they opposed the so-called No Confidence Motion tabled in Parliament recently. They would not boycott Parliament if a proper No-Confidence Motion was presented in Parliament in keeping with Standing Orders and provisions of the Construction.
Gunawardena said according to the Constitution, the President had the sole right to appoint a Prime Minister and a Cabinet of Ministers. Accordingly, the President appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and others as members of the Cabinet. Even the UNP did not the Prime Minister and the Cabinet then and it did not go before the court against it. Suddenly, the UNP had made an appeal to the Court Appeal against the dissolution of Parliament. The court after considering had temporarily suspended the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. This had caused immense economic social political problems and adversely affected community life.
Gunawardana said after being appointed as Investment Promotion and International Trade Minister he obtained Cabinet approval to appoint a Committee to draw up a National Trade Policy.
He also obtained Cabinet approval to appoint a committee formulate an Investment Promotion Tax Free Package. He also appointed a Committee to set up 5,000 export processing villages in the country within one month. He hoped to strengthen the rupee by implementing these programmes. Although he had no powers to abrogate the Singapore Free Trade Agreement which was an agreement between two countries, he held discussions with unions which supposed this agreement. In keeping with the requests made by these unions, they had begin printing the agreement in all three languages.
The proposal made to the Cabinet to temporarily halt the implementation of the agreement is awaiting the Supreme Court order on it and the report of the Prof. W.D.Lakshman Committee. But, all these had been stalled due to the temporary abolition of the Cabinet of Ministers.
Parliamentarian Sisira Jayakody said during the 30-year-war, the LTTE bombed the Central Bank and the Bandaranaile International Airport, Katunayake aimed at destroying the countrys economy.
Certain LTTE political representatives in the TNA were also implementing a programme to destroy the countrys economy by covert means through the UNP, he alleged.

Mushfiqur steers Bangladesh  to easy win against Windies
Dhaka, Sunday: Mushfiqur Rahim top scored with an unbeaten 55 as Bangladesh defeated West Indies by five wickets in the first one-day international in Dhaka on Sunday.
Set a modest target after three wickets each from Mashrafe Mortaza and Mustafizur Rahman helped Bangladesh restrict West Indies to 195-9, the hosts sailed to 196-5 in 35.1 overs for a comprehensive win to kick off the three-match series.
Mushfiqur shared 57 runs with Shakib Al Hasan for the fourth wicket to steady Bangladeshs innings after West Indies had reduced the home side to 89-3 on a slow pitch at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
Rovman Powell dismissed Shakib for 30 to break the stand but Soumya Sarkar killed off the visitors hopes with a brief cameo of 19 from 13 balls, which included two fours and a six.
Mushfiqur, who hit five boundaries in his patient knock, pushed Roston Chase for a single to complete his 31st fifty in ODIs before an outside edge to leg spinner Devendra flew to third man for two runs to wrap up the victory.
Earlier, opener Liton Das scored 41 off 57 balls with five fours for the home side, but not before he was reprieved on five off a no-ball by Kemar Roach.
West Indies owed their total to 43 off 59 balls by opener Shai Hope and contributions from lower order batsmen Roston Chase and Keemo Paul, who made 32 and 36 runs respectively.
The visitors, who opted to bat first, had been restricted to 127-6 after 40 overs despite Hopes effort, but Chase and Paul put on 51 runs for the seventh wicket to give their bowlers something to fight for.
Paul hit two sixes and a four in his 28-ball innings before he was dismissed by Mustafizur in the final over.
Left-arm pacer Mustafizur finished with 3-35 after fellow fast bowler Mashrafe grabbed 3-30 playing his 200th ODI -- the first Bangladeshi to do so.
Mashrafe was named man of the match for his effort.
The West Indies are very dangerous in this format but our bowlers were brilliant, Mashrafe said after the match.
West Indies Powell blamed his sides batting for their defeat. AFP

Natures many health benefits
We all know that getting away from our everyday tasks and stress can be enjoyable. However, even if its just for a short period of time, getting out in nature can have several health benefits.
Vitamin D
The sun is the best source of vitamin D for our bodies. Vitamin D is actually a hormone that helps to maintain a healthy immune system. Lacking vitamin D can put you at an increased risk for cancer, Alzheimers disease, and osteoporosis. Heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and multiple sclerosis have all been linked with vitamin D deficiency as well. Getting vitamin D from natural sources is always best as supplements can be ineffective and unsafe.
Eye Health
Getting outside can improve your eye health in two different ways. First, it can help prevent computer vision syndrome which is caused by looking at a screen too close for long periods of time. When you are outside, you naturally focus on objects that are farther away which gives your eyes a much-needed break. Secondly, new research shows that being exposed to artificial light can increase nearsightedness.
Better Sleep
As humans, our sleep patterns follow our internal body clock or our circadian rhythm. This schedule naturally follows the suns schedule. If you spend too much time away from natural sunlight, it can alter your circadian rhythm and disrupt your sleep pattern. A few consecutive days in nature can really help boost natural sleep patterns for most people.
Clean Air
It is common knowledge that outdoor air pollution is harmful; however, indoor air pollution is even worse. In fact, indoor air pollution can be between twice and 100 times more concentrated than outdoor air pollution. Indoor air pollution can put you at risk for heart disease, lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and asthma. Breathing fresh air outside is much better for your overall health.
Exercise
Getting outside provides an almost automatic opportunity for exercise. Whether its a simple brisk walk or a kayaking trip, the exercise possibilities are almost endless when you are outside. Exercise has a multitude of health benefits such as increased fat burning capacity, as well as the potential for prevention of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and high blood pressure.
Psychological Benefits
Getting outside in the sunshine and fresh air also helps clear your mind. It has been linked with better mental well-being, improved attention spans, stress relief, increase serotonin (also known as the feel-good hormone), as well as better emotional stability and more empathy for others. Meditating outdoors can stretch these benefits even further.
Grounding
Finally, and maybe not quite as scientific, is the benefit of grounding. Sometimes referred to as earthing, grounding refers to bare skin contact with a natural surface such as dirt or sand.
The theory holds that because the earth is negatively charged we absorb the earths electrons when we are barefoot. A study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine reports that grounding can provide an energizing effect on the body as well as anti-inflammatory actions.

The Nobel  Prize for climate catastrophe
Many people were thrilled when they heard that the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics this year went to William Nordhaus of Yale University, a man known for his work on climate change. Finally, the economics profession is giving climate the attention it deserves, just as the world is waking up to the severity of our ecological emergency. Media outlets have taken this positive narrative and run with it.
But while Nordhaus may be revered among economists, climate scientists and ecologists have a very different opinion of his legacy. In fact, many believe that the failure of the worlds governments to pursue aggressive climate action over the past few decades is in large part due to arguments that Nordhaus has advanced.
Its a blazing controversy that hinges on the single most consequential issue in climate economics: the question of growth. The stakes couldnt be higher. After all, this isnt just a matter of abstract academic debate; the future of human civilisation hangs in the balance.
The economist William Nordhaus will receive his professions highest honour for research on global warming thats been hugely influential  and entirely misguided.Nordhaus career has been devoted to finding what he calls a balance between climate mitigation and GDP growth.Using this logic, Nordhaus long claimed that from the standpoint of economic rationality it is optimal to keep warming the planet to about 3.5 degrees Celsius overpreindustrial levels  vastly in excess of the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold that the IPCC insists on.
In the 1990s, Nordhaus invented the first integrated assessment models to explore how economic growth affects carbon emissions, and how climate change in turn affects economic growth. The basic mechanisms that Nordhaus described continue to inform the models that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses today. No one disputes that this qualifies as a significant contribution to the field. The question, rather, has to do with how Nordhaus has used his models to argue for a particular policy agenda.
The models showed that if we were to rapidly reduce carbon emissions in line with what scientists say is necessary to avoid climate breakdown  by putting a high tax on carbon, for instance  it would significantly slow down the rate of economic growth. As far as scientists are concerned, thats not a problem; we should obviously do whatever it takes to avoid climate catastrophe. But for economists like Nordhaus, this is not acceptable. After all, the whole point of neoclassical economics is to do whatever it takes to grow economic output.
So, Nordhauss career has been devoted to finding what he calls a balance between climate mitigation and GDP growth. In a famous 1991 paper titled To slow or not to slow, he argued firmly for the latter option: Lets not be too eager to slow down global warming, because we dont want to jeopardise growth.
To justify this conclusion, Nordhaus manipulates what is known as the discount rate, which is how economists value the costs of climate breakdown in the present as compared to the future. It might sound arcane, but its really quite straightforward. A discount rate of zero means that future generations are valued equally to the present; a high discount rate means that future generations are valued less, or discounted, compared with nearer generations.

Nordhaus s argument 
Nordhaus prefers a high discount rate  very high. Discounting the future allows him to argue that we shouldnt reduce emissions too quickly, because the economic cost to people today will be higher than the benefit of protecting people in the future. Instead, we should do the opposite: Focus on GDP growth now even if it means locking in future climate catastrophe. This is justifiable, he says, because future generations will then be much richer than we are and therefore better able to manage the problem.
Using this logic, Nordhaus long claimed that from the standpoint of economic rationality it is optimal to keep warming the planet to about 3.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels  vastly in excess of the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold that the IPCC insists on.
It sounds morally problematic and flies in the face of scientists warnings, but economists and policymakers have lined up behind Nordhauss argument. They like it because it gives them licence to carry on with the status quo and delay difficult decisions. President Trump, for instance, has been aggressive in his preference for growth over climate action. This is in large part what explains the fact that nearly 30 years after the first IPCC report was published, global emissions are still going up. It also helps explain why even with the Paris climate agreement in place, and with all of the plans promised by the worlds governments, were still headed for about 3.3 degrees Celsius of warming. Its all eerily similar to the Nordhaus trajectory.
So how do economists get away with believing that these extreme temperatures are somehow okay Because the Nordhaus model tells us that even the worst catastrophes will not really hurt the global economy all that much. Maybe a percentage point or two at the most, by the end of the century  much less than the cost of immediate action.
How do they figure this Because if climate breakdown ends up starving and displacing a few hundred million impoverished Africans and Asians, that will register as only a tiny blip in GDP. After all, poor people dont add much value to the global economy. The same goes for things like insects and birds and wildlife, so it doesnt matter if global warming continues to accelerate mass extinction. From the perspective of capital, what most of us see as tremendous ethical and even existential problems literally dont count.
What is more, Nordhaus reasons that the sectors most vulnerable to global warming agricultural, forestry, and fishing  contribute relatively little to global GDP, only about four percent. So even if the entire global agricultural system were to collapse in the future, the costs, in terms of world GDP, would be minimal.
These arguments obviously offend common sense. And indeed, scientists have been quick to critique them. Its absurd to believe that the global economy would just keep chugging along despite a collapse in the worlds food supply. And mass extinction of species poses a very real threat to the web of life itself, on which all of human civilisation depends. Plus, Nordhaus doesnt factor in the possibility of feedback loops that could kick in  Arctic methane release, ice-albedo feedback, and others we cant yet predict  pushing us way beyond 3.5 degrees. No amount of wealth would be enough to help future generations navigate such a total system collapse.
So, what if Nordhaus turns out to be wrong What if extreme global warming destabilises our civilisation and collapses the economy The Stern Review, for instance, predicts annual GDP losses could be up to 20 percent per year. If this happens, then well get the worst of both worlds: Future generations will be poorer, and theyll end up locked in a hothouse Earth. Its a dangerous gamble with the future of humanity  and the risks are so deadly as to be beyond the power of imagination.

IPCC report 
Strangely, in what seems a bizarre coincidence, Nordhaus was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize on the very same October day that the IPCC published its latest report on climate change. The report is the United Nations most urgent yet: It calls for the world to cut emissions in half by 2030, and get to net zero by the middle of the century. While Nordhaus has spent most of the past four decades calling for gradualism to preserve the conditions for economic growth, the IPCC calls for radical and immediate action in order to preserve the conditions for life. Growth versus life. The conflict between economics and science has never been clearer.
In recent years Nordhaus has softened his views somewhat, arguing for a higher carbon tax than he has in the past, even if still much lower than what the IPCC calls for. But his overall position in this debate remains clear. When news of his prize was announced, he admonished his students: Dont let anyone distract you from the work at hand, which is economic growth.
Cant we have it both ways Cant we have economic growth and stay under 1.5 degrees Celsius Well, that might have been possible a few decades ago, but its too late now  we put off the energy transition for far too long, thanks to Nordhaus and the prophets of postponement. The IPCC is clear that we need to completely decarbonise the global economy by the middle of the century. If we continue growing on our present trajectory, the economy will nearly triple in size during that same period. It will be difficult enough to decarbonise the existing global economy so quickly  its virtually impossible to imagine doing it three times over.
We need to throw everything we have at the problem. We need massive mobilisation, reminiscent of the wholesale industrial retooling that took place during World War II, to churn out solar panels and wind turbines at an unprecedented rate. Right now, the United States installs about 16 gigawatts of clean power each year. That rate needs to increase more than twelvefold, and it needs to happen immediately. Other countries face a similar challenge.
It is certainly possible. But were nowhere near on track  not even close. So why would we make this challenge three times harder for ourselves Why would we choose to fight this battle facing uphill
All of this leads us back to a more fundamental question. Economists such as Nordhaus insist that perpetual GDP growth is necessary for human welfare. Three decades of delaying climate action have been justified on this principle. But is it even true Is GDP growth really our only option
Remarkably, Nordhaus  like most orthodox economists  has never bothered to consider this question. The growth-is-good mantra is so baked into our consciousness that to question it seems almost crazy. Indeed, growthism is hegemonic to the point of transcending ideology. Politicians on the left and right alike hold it up as the single most important policy objective; they may quarrel about how to make growth happen, and how to distribute its yields, but on the question of growth itself theres no daylight between them.

Truth about GDP growth 
This is starting to change. In recent years, ecological economists have been staking out an alternative vision. We will have a much better chance of accomplishing our climate goals, they say, if rich countries abandon their pursuit of GDP growth. And if we do it right, we can not only protect human well-being but even improve it. Liberating ourselves from the growth imperative may be our best shot at flourishing through the 21st century.
Its a staggering idea  and could be a complete game-changer. But what would a post-growth economy look like
The first step is to realise that high levels of GDP are in fact not necessary for high levels of human well-being. True, social indicators are generally correlated with GDP per capita, but its a saturation curve: Past a certain point, more GDP adds little to human well-being. Take the United States, for example. In 1975, Americas GDP per capita was only half its present levels, in real terms. And yet wages were higher, happiness levels were higher, and the poverty rate was lower.
Even more interestingly, some countries have high levels of human development with relatively low GDP per capita  and we the United States can learn a lot from them. Europes GDP per capita is 40 percent less than that of the United States, and yet it has better social indicators in virtually every category. Costa Rica has higher life expectancy than the United States and happiness levels that rival Scandinavia, with one-fifth of Americas GDP per capita.
How is this possible It all comes down to distribution. In 1975, America gave a greater share of national income to workers than it does today. And Europe invests more in social goods like public health care and education than the United States does. This raises the question: If Europe can outperform the United States with significantly less income, then does the American economy really need to keep growing
If human welfare is what were after, growth certainly isnt the most efficient way to get there. Rich countries already have more than enough  the problem is that its all locked up at the top, where it contributes almost nothing to peoples well-being. There is another way. We can improve peoples lives right now, without any additional growth at all, simply by distributing existing income more fairly. In fact, theres no a priori reason why the United States couldnt scale down particularly destructive output (beef, McMansions, SUVs), reducing total energy demand and making the energy transition significantly easier, while at the same time outperforming Europe on social indicators.
If we think about the growth conundrum from this angle, then it comes down to a much more obvious choice: between living in a more equitable society, on the one hand, and risking climate catastrophe on the other. I imagine that most people would have little difficulty choosing between the two.
Of course, one might change tacks and argue that growth is the only way to mobilise the financial resources necessary for the energy transition, and the only way to get the technological innovation we need to make our economies more efficient. Indeed, this is a key part of Nordhauss argument.
But it doesnt make sense to grow the GDP and just blindly hope that it will end up invested in solar panel factories. If thats how the Allies had approached the need for tanks and aircraft during World War II, the Nazis would be in charge of Europe right now. On the contrary, this kind of mobilisation requires government policy to guide and direct existing financial resources.
And if the objective is to achieve specific kinds of technological innovation, it makes more sense to invest in those directly, or incentivise innovation with targeted policy measures, rather than to grow the whole economy indiscriminately and pray for a specific outcome. Think about it: Is it really reasonable to grow the plastics industry, the timber industry, and the advertising industry in order to get more efficient solar panels Does it really make sense to grow dirty things in order to get clean things We have to be smarter than that.
Over and over again, it turns out that economists insistence on the necessity of growth is strikingly under-justified. People like Nordhaus are ready to risk everything  literally  for the sake of something that we dont really even need.
Would there be political support for a post-growth agenda Most politicians assume the answer is no. They assume that people want growth, which is why thats virtually all they ever talk about. But they havent looked at the data. A striking new poll from Yales Program on Climate Change Communication shows that 70 percent of Americans believe that environmental protection is more important than growth  and this is true even in deeply Republican states. Another poll has found that 70 percent of people in middle- and high-income nations believe that overconsumption is putting our planet and society at risk. Similar majorities also believe that we should strive to buy and own less, and that doing so would not compromise our well-being.
These are remarkable results. And they confirm what decades of research in anthropology and psychology has been telling us: that to most people what matters is having good health, intimate relationships, meaningful work, access to nature, time to spend doing what they love, and  increasingly  an ecology that is stable and safe for themselves and their children. The good news is that, at least in high-income countries, we dont need growth to deliver these things.
We are at a crossroads. Nordhaus, and many world leaders, remain wedded to the obsolete dogmas of the last century. But scientists are clear that this is no longer good enough  and the rest of the world is ready for something better.

Panadura UC to discipline tuition masters,  trishaw drivers
Panadura Urban Council (UC) Chairman Nandana Gunathilaka said tuition masters cover walls and bus halts in the town with huge posters but police is silent.
The Chairman was addressing UC members on the issue at the recently held UC meeting.
He said Police could file action against the tuition masters for their reckless poster pasting but so far they have not taken any action.
The UC must allocate places to paste posters and deploy UC employees to remove unauthorised posters, he said.
UC member Anura Wijepala said action must be taken immediately against tuition masters who paste posters everywhere in the town.
The Chairman said he would consult the relevant authorities and take action.
The councillors suggested that the UC must tax tuition masters.
A tuition master earns over Rs. 5 lakhs monthly and about 40 students attend a class, they said.
Panadura is a hub for foreign universities and thousands of students attend them day and night, the UC members said.
The members said the UC must adopt a procedure to streamline the operation of three wheelers as well since many drivers transport illicit liquor and engage in other criminal activities.
Panadura has 450 three wheelers and the owners of them have a union. The UC must discuss the issues with their union and employ a procedure that benefit both three wheeler drivers and the public.
SLFP Councillor Rajive Weeraman, J V P Councillors Chadana Hettiarchchi and Waduge Piyasena, UNP Councillors Sumanadasa Janakade Soyza and Kumudu Fernando spoke.

PARLIAMENTARY AND  MAJORITY SUPREMACY
Present text was penned under the Article 14(1  a) of the constitution of Sri Lanka. It neither concerns any particular country nor any political team. However, its writer respectfully invites the wise and the intelligent, to carefully peruse the contents and if required to intellectually relate them with an open mind, to the happening political occurrences in the country of each reader. The scrutinization by itself is not enough, consecutively and with no delay, the needed and appropriate conclusions must be drawn and the minds should be galvanized into action.
It is stated that the present political situation in Sri Lanka, comprised in and confused by the pragmatic behaviour of some or rather the majority of politicians, has ensnared island in a terrific political crisis. The Speaker is being blamed. UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe is said to be involved. The presidential Prime Minister (Improvisation by GI) Mahinda Rajapaksa is charged to be the chief protagonist of the whole drama. And finally President Maithripala Sirisena is declared to be the betrayer of the UNP, by the so called votes of which, he could become the president of the island.
Is the Parliament supreme Is its supremeness absolute Can the Parliamentary supremacy be questionable and debatable Can it be challenged Are there circumstances, wherein, the Judiciary can be relatively more supreme than the Parliament If yes, what are those occasions Can the Parliament and the Judiciary and the constitution be supreme in isolation, in varied situations What is the legal basis and moral foundation of the supremacy of the Parliament What is the ground of the institutional subordination of the constitution and the Judiciary to the Parliament Questions are endless 
Each party makes the other responsible for the whole crisis. Besides, the so called international community, comprised mainly by couple of European countries, too has been galvanized in to action by the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and the group, creating a dangerous space for them to interfere in to internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
The main slogan of the Ranil Wickremesinghe group is democracy and the majority MP number in the Parliament. The crux of the Rajapaksa group polemics is Constitution of Sri Lanka and the powers of the President enshrined in the fundamental legal document of the island.
In such a concatenation of circumstances, in a country wherein, the supremacy of the Parliament is nestled over the judiciary, particularly by former Speaker Anura Bandaranaike, it is felt not only extremely expedient, but also very timely, to dig and digest rightly, the co-relation and spaces of interaction between these two powerful departments of administration.
Questions to be posed
Is the Parliament supreme Is its supremeness absolute Can the Parliamentary supremacy be questionable and debatable Can it be challenged Are there circumstances, wherein, the Judiciary can be relatively more supreme than the Parliament If yes, what are those occasions Can the Parliament and the Judiciary and the constitution be supreme in isolation, in varied situations What is the legal basis and moral foundation of the supremacy of the Parliament What is the ground of the institutional subordination of the constitution and the Judiciary to the Parliament Questions are endless.
Reason, logics and commonsense
Any institution by itself is an illusion. There is no reality behind it. The institution is like the concept of forest. There is nothing called forest as such. There is the word Forest, coined by man. What is really available in the forest is Tree. In the absence of trees, the forest is just a pronounceable word, comprising no reality at all. Now, the Parliament in this wise is not an exception. There is no existential reality behind the word Parliament. The maximum, discoverable within the concept of Parliament is a building, built with bricks, cement, sand and concrete. The Parliament becomes a reality with members-representatives, elected for it, by the people in a democratic general election, to serve in the best interest of the general public, to launch the country along the developmental pad and to maintain and retain the rule of law and order in the country, assuring common progress and reassuring general welfare of all the people, with no regard to race, religion, caste, colour and particularly, with no consideration whatsoever for political affiliations, in the total absence of the mental contamination of social, religious and racial discrimination. This can be construed as a holy affair, relatively more holy than many religious affairs.
The supremacy of the Parliament was, is and will be closely associated and inseparably linked with this noble task. If the Parliament fails in attaining to this God-designed target, its supremacy becomes not only debatable, but also questionable and disgraceful. The real foundation of Parliamentary supremacy is not a dead document, howsoever fundamental it may be, with rules and norms, formulated by the majority of greedy men for power, in Asian countries, many a time by the uneducated and the thuggerish too, but, the hundred percent honest service for the men and women, who pay tax for everything, including the huge expenses and luxuries, being well enjoyed by parliamentarians.
Judiciary supremacy
Therefore, in a way, the Judiciary is logically seemed and empirically felt to be more supreme, than the Parliament. Why The power of the Judiciary is specific, precise and granted by the constitution of the country. The competence of it, is not limited to a particular period, like of parliamentarians. By virtue of it, in the member of the Judiciary, the ceaseless greed for power is absent. Until his retirement, the powers, delegated by the constitution are enjoyed by its members. Their salaries are high. The recognition of their dignity is historical and continues from today to tomorrow. They are well educated. Their erudition maintains the power of the rule of law in the country and they grant justice to many, ensnared in to injustice. The court is the only venue, when the legislature and the executive violate the rights of the subjects of the society, the people can go to. No uneducated thugs, no drug barons, no thieves can occupy the beautiful space, the Judiciary enjoys and entertains.
The Judiciary formulates legal precedents, the subsequent administrators of justice could be guided by. Notwithstanding the fact that the Judiciary is appointed by the executive and the laws are enacted by the legislature, the constitution of a country, administered by the West Minister System, grants the Judiciary the freedom of independence to be free and independent in the affairs of the administration of justice. By reason of these and many other pragmatic factors, the Judiciary can be construed and felt to be more supreme than the Parliament and its majority. Hence, it can play the role of final juridical resort and the role of the most practical jurisprudential source, when there is a country-gripped crisis, germinated in the Parliament as a result of the bifurcation-confusion of the government and opposition.
Parliament majority confusion
Majority minority are outdated concepts. In the international legal terminology they have lost their existential depth. Their worth has been questioned by many international legal experts. International legal luminaries pose the question, Democracy for whom For the majority, for the minority Or for both The democracy is,. not guarding majority rights to the brutal violation of the rights of the minority.
The defense of the majority rights is no more recognized, as an unquestionable foundation, to trespass the rights of the minority. In fact, the misinterpreting of this false democracy, rooted in the contaminated concept of majority, has been well used and is still being abused by many elements of vested interest, to transgress the rights of the minorities in many corners of the globe. The democracy, in the contemporaneous globe, is not expounded as the democracy for the majority. Democracy is meant for all. It is determined by the final result of granting development, progress, peace and justice to all.
Now, when it falls within the precinct of the Parliament and within the orbit of the right of the country-rule, the contents, inked above, under the rubric Reason, Logics and Commonsense would flex its muscle so powerfully to inject a right comprehension of the crisis.
It alludes to the authentic ground that painfully burns. It points the finger to the weed, which does not allow the seed to crack, sprout and grow in to a beautiful flowering tree. The periods of torture suffered by many countries vary.
The political and economic devastation, Sri Lanka underwent and terribly suffered is the best example of this. In such countries, no parliamentarian majority has made any commendable and positive contribution, to cause the seed to crack, sprout and grow in to a flowering tree.
In the name of democracy and the norms of constitution, the people of such countries were waiting for five years or more, to elect another set of majority, the members of which, they anticipated to cause to crack the seed, so that it could become a gigantic tree with blossoming flowers.

PMB asked to raise paddy purchasing prices
The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) was informed to raise prices of paddy that the Board purchases from the farmers and to provide rice to the public at reasonable prices, MP Mahinda Amaraweera said at a recently held meeting in Hambantota.
The MP said the PMB released a consignment of rice to the consumsers for the first time. About 25 years ago, 29 per cent of export revenue of the country earned by sending rice abroad but now it has dropped to 8 per cent.
He said he has taken steps to minimise goods being imported that could be grown in the country to save foreign exchange.
He said benefits will be given to farmers to encourage them in paddy farming.
Now the public sector of the country is nearly free of corruption and frauds and new investments will be channeled into the agriculture sector.

Agri resurgence to empower farmers store grain
Rs 313 mn grain protection centre for Medirigiriya
President Maithripala Sirisena said measures to establish grain protecting centres countrywide aiming to uplift the agriculture production of the country will be initiated.
The President made these remarks while commissioning the first grain protection centre at Medirigiriya in Polonnaruwa yesterday.
Addressing the gathering the President said it has been aimed to increase the volume of agriculture production to ensure a sound economy, while empowering farmers economically. Moreover, farmers can get rid of loan burdens. The project has been given top priority among other national development plans, he added.

As there is no proper place to store agricultural productions of farmers, they have to sell their productions as soon as they reap the harvest probably for low prices to the private sector. On the other hand, middlemen tend to get a lions share. If the farmers are provided a suitable place to store their agriculture production for some period until they receive a better price, it is inevitable that farmers will receive a comparatively better price, he said.
As a long lasting solution to this, the project to establish grain protecting centre came into affect. It has been planned to establish grain protecting centres countrywide, especially covering the areas, where agri production is abundant.
Paddy farmers will be allowed to store their produce in these grain protecting centres in future, the President said.
Establishing these agricultural production protecting centres will be an ideal solution for food security. As a another fruitful outcome, rice prices will drop and also increase food security, he noted.
The grain protecting centre, established at a cost of Rs 313 million at Medirigiriya facilitates to store 10,000 metric tonnes of paddy. The centre will be managed under the Regional Development Bank.
Apart from storing grains, the centre will facilitate to protect the quality of stored grains, dehydration of grains, protecting from pests etc are among the other services. Besides, farmers will receive guarantee for gains that stored in the centre.
It is significant that farmers can obtain a 70 per cent money advance for the grains they store in the centre. The centre is run by a 100 Kw solar power plant established at the centre itself.
After commissioning the centre, the President handed over compensation to 3,634 farmers, whose cultivations were affected for various reasons. Rs 750 million was paid as compensation to the farmers.

SHOULD WE NOT LOOK FOR A  SOLUTION
Since October 26, 2018, following the political changes effected, the country has been witnessing a series of developments emerging, culminating into a crisis situation. The removal of the Prime Minister, appointment of a new Prime Minister and a Cabinet of Ministers, Prorogation of the Parliament and the Notice of dissolution of the Parliament have been at the bottom of the incitation to this state of affairs.
When we look back at the events in retrospect it becomes evident that the associated developments are the direct result of a vilified campaign to create a fracas leading to pandemonium. The episode first appeared as a pressure tactic towards an exhortation of a settlement favourable to the affected party. But unfortunately the modus operandi adopted by the former Prime Ministers party far exceeded the warranted democratic norms. Therefore this vituperative campaign has caused irreparable damage to the countrys image as well as to the economy. Whatever is the posthumous outcome we are all entangled in a serious debacle that requires to be addressed as a matter of National Urgency to end an internal political strife fast spreading across in a cancerous profusion
Last General election of the country failed to produce a government with a clear majority for any single party. Parties that secured larger number of seats in their warm up to form a stable government were compelled to overcome the possibilities of being outvoted with the passage of time due to instability. The authors of 19th Amendment having foreseen this eventuality had taken a constitutional precaution by bringing in a new concept into the amended version by the creation of a National Government accommodating two or more parties to get the parliamentary majority to form a safe and stable Cabinet.
Political and policy disagreements
The UNFGG which secured the highest number of seats as an alliance accordingly entered into an agreement with the SLFP a constituent of the Alliance called UPFA, which secured the second highest number of seats as an Alliance to form this national Government. It appears that there was no constitutional barrier for an Alliance to form a NG with one constituent party of another Alliance.
However the marriage did not last long as a vivacious blending due to several political and policy disagreements that kept on surfacing after a short time. The inevitable eruption came about immediately after the decision of the UPFA to withdraw from the National Government. The instantaneous consequence was the automatic termination of the Jumbo Cabinet that existed by virtue of the constitutional provision to accommodate a number exceeding the 30 stipulated for a single party government. Resulting from this the Cabinet stood dissolved, triggering the steps taken by the President in the immediate aftermath.
Now the Quagmire the country is placed is that there is not a single group that holds a majority power in the Parliament. We have an ad-hoc grouping that has come together to put forward an opposition to the decisions taken by the President to appoint a New Prime Minister on the grounds that he does not have the majority support of the Parliament. Nevertheless the procedure they are engaged in to establish their claim is totally un-parliamentary and the ostensible demonstration of the strength of this grouping is misleading all. Instead of disproving the fact that the new Cabinet and the PM does not command the confidence of the Parliament in the proper manner by bringing forward a NCM in accordance with the parliamentary practice and Standing Orders they have been trying to make out that there is a violation of the constitution and thereby has caused some aberration.
The central focus of the agitators has been to keep their party supporters from being demoralized on the one hand and to proliferate a wrongful picture in the international scenario. It is a pity that they have resorted to this niggardly action unmindful of the serious damaging effect it has in consequence to the whole country. This cause of action taken by them cannot be upheld as justified by any means unless they were desperate without any feasible alternatives to air their grievances and to establish their stand and presumptions about the Presidents opinion regarding the confidence of the parliament. It appears that they were more interested in creating a mayhem than finding a solution.
Now we are not only embroiled in a huge controversy internally but also to certain undue influences to our economic freedom from external sources.
Therefore as citizens of the country who have the interest of the country as the prime concern beyond the parochial interests to remain in power as displayed by most of our politicians, we have to look for achievable alternate solutions to this crisis. When we see the actual composition of the political parties comprising the 225 parliamentary seats today, a Cabinet of a parliamentary government in which all political parties are represented would be the best option in the event the country

damage to the countrys image as well as to the economy 
cannot go for fresh elections immediately. When no single party on its own cannot have a majority in Parliament this would be the best option to have a government with a high degree of political legitimacy and collective identity it desires and also playing a role in diminishing internal political strife.
Global political history
During times of crisis all parties get together to form Coalition governments, all party coalitions or national unity governments sinking all other minor differences. We have seen such polarizations in the high echelons of democracy elsewhere. Global political history is full of such examples and precedents for us to follow. To quote a few examples of coalitions we have the case records of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, Denmark, India, Ireland, Japan, Newzealand and Israel among several others. Great Britain which we often quote as the Godfather of Westminster system to emulate is full of examples of national and coalition governments formed during highly critical periods in their political history.
It is generally accepted that coalition governments secured by groups of political parties shedding their king maker inclinations lead to more consensus  based politics agreeing to compromise on broad government policy. Internationally too other than the parties with vested interests and ulterior motives such a government would reflect a better outlook for exhibiting the prevalence of the rule of law and democracy.
Now let us take a realistic view of our own situation. The 2015 August election was held in a completely different new environment immediately after the dissolution of a coalition government and a contest between the constituents of that same polarization.
UNFGG - United national Front for Good Governance was the Alliance that secured the largest number of seats in that Parliament with a total of 106 seats.
The UPFA came as the runners-up Alliance securing a total of 95 seats. The Tamil party alliance obtained 16 parliamentary seats. JVP got 6 sets while EPDP and SLMC obtained 1 seat each.
As the political parties have not changed their individual identity in continuing under the respective alliances, each party can be taken as a separate entity for the coalition purposes and brought into the broad national coalition. According to the proportional representation of parties all parties could be allocated Ministerial portfolios in the Cabinet, as Deputies and State Ministers while considering the Parliamentary seniority for the Cabinet and other ministerial posts.
As such a government can fit into the constitutionally provided National Government concept the number of Cabinet and other ministerial portfolios could be determined by the parliament.
If they love the country and if the Parliamentarians are desirous of shedding their petty differences for power this would be the best solution for the country which cannot be disputed by either internally or externally. If some party or group is more influenced by foreign or other unseen interests they may not fit into this combination. In such an event they may be dropped and continued with the others who consent in national interest.

## Title: Solzhenitsyn as he saw himself

## Section: T&C
## Date: Monday, December 10, 2018 - 01:00
Solzhenitsyn as he saw himself
One hundred years ago this month, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born in Kislovodsk (acidic waters), a curative town in the North Caucasian foothills of Russia, which was then wracked by civil war. Earlier that year, 300 miles north at Novocherkassk, the capital of the Don Cossacks, former tsarist officers had proclaimed the formation of a Volunteer Army to reverse the Bolshevik coup of 1917. The force, labelled Whites, would go down in defeat, its survivors compelled to disperse into emigration. But Solzhenitsyn  even though he, too, would be forced from his homeland  subsequently won the White movements fight with his pen. His novels One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, In the First Circle and Cancer Ward, as well as his nonpareil three-volume literary investigation The Gulag Archipelago, persuasively blackened the Soviet regime at its roots.
According to an estimate by Publishers Weekly, by 1976 Solzhenitsyn had sold 30 million copies of his books in some thirty languages, with sales of the first volume of The Gulag Archipelago accounting for up to a third of that total. Long after Soviet communism came crashing down in 1991, his evocative works based on a multitude of first-hand experiences of the forced labour camp system retain their potency and urgency. If, as the scholar John B. Dunlop has written, it is as an artist that Solzhenitsyn will be remembered or forgotten, then he is destined to endure.
Literary cycle
Having earned global acclaim  including the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970, awarded for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature  Solzhenitsyn dedicated himself to a literary cycle, The Red Wheel, on Russias Revolution. Published in Russian between 1971 and 1991, the series derives its name from a detached carriage wheel that revolves in flames in August 1914, the first of four nodes through which the author organized these novels of real and invented personages. That intial instalment appeared in English translation in 1972; November 1916, originally in two volumes, followed in 1985, along with a reworked two-volume version of its predecessor. March 1917, in four books, is only now beginning to appear in English, courtesy of University of Notre Dame Press. (April 1917, in two books, awaits.) In the first volume of March 1917, well translated by Marian Schwartz, many haunting passages can be found, such as Nicholas IIs confrontation with the icon of Christ following his tormented abdication. Still, the overall four-node roman-fleuve runs to nearly 6,000 pages, in ten volumes, deluging readers.
Solzhenitsyns history in March 1917, like The Red Wheel as a whole, is refreshingly contingent and a product mostly of human not impersonal forces: the opposite of Tolstoys War and Peace, to say nothing of the Marxist structuralism with which Solzhenitsyn originally conceived the work as a youth in the 1930s. True, he does seem to yield to a kind of Tocquevillean resignation at a relentless progression of democracy in the world. But he suggests that Russia would have been best served by elected local self-government, if combined with election-less central rule in the service of the nation, which in his view was (and remained) possible. Instead, The Red Wheel depicts Russia as having been betrayed twice, by an indolent and corrupt homegrown elite, and by a hyperactive and destructive intelligentsia obsessed with implanting foreign ideas, which the author portrays as a liberal-socialist continuum. The Revolution becomes something alien. Concepts of foreign or alien, it must be said, present insurmountable difficulties for anyone who would write the history of Imperial Russia and the Revolution. Solzhenitsyn, donning the mantle of Russian nationalist, was a part ethnic Ukrainian who spoke Russian with a Ukrainian accent. His lodestar, tsarist prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, broke his political neck against the stubborn realities of Russias heterodoxy even before a terrorist killed off his yeoman efforts at modernization and regime stabilization in 1911.
Gulag Archipelago
The Red Wheel has attracted nothing like the readership of The Gulag Archipelago, the greatest book about, but also of, the Soviet Union. To attempt the work was a crime. Solzhenitsyn wrote it conspiratorially, in fragments, hiding his completed sections in the homes of trusted allies so as not to risk confiscation in one fell swoop by the KGB. He marvelled that he never had the whole work on the same desk at the same time! The accumulated pieces, numbering more than 1,800 book pages, twice as long as the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, share a common sensibility, but most stand on their own, like a short story collection. In September 1973, after he had the full manuscript smuggled out to the West on microfilm for translation and publication abroad, the KGB obtained a copy of the whole from his clandestine secretary (Elizaveta Voronyanskaya, who then took her own life).
The police operatives prepared an excellent summary for high officials, capturing most of the authors central points: the mass arrests and vast prisons camps were the systems essence, not an aberration; the Gulag gave birth to a distinctive nation of prisoners with their own psychological traits, mentality and language; the secret police (NKVD bluecaps), too, constituted a recognizable social type. But the works crowning theme of suffering as a path to redemption, purification and triumph eluded the KGB analysts  and not them alone  unfolding as it does within Solzhenitsyns summons to national repentance and renewed spiritualism. The abridged Gulag Archipelago 191856: An experiment in literary investigation, now reissued by Vintage Classics in Thomas P. Whitney and Harry Willettss functional translation, might not satisfy devotees of the three-volume monument, but it does attain its aim of readability. - Times Literary Supplement

The Agriculture Ministry plans to cultivate sweet oranges as there is a huge demand for this fruit internationally, said Kurunegala District senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake.
He was speaking at a meeting he had with vegetables and fruit farmers of the Kurunegala District at the Bingiriya Agrarian Services Centre in Kurunegala, yesterday.
The Government spent Rs. 2,760 million to import oranges last year. Therefore, President Maithripala Sirisena instructed the Agriculture Ministry to take steps to grow all possible varieties in the country in order to lower the importation of vegetables, fruits, grams and other food products.
We have allocated 2,200 acres of land in the Moneragala District to set up an orange-growing zone where 85,000 saplings will be planted before the year ends.
It is expected to harvest around 15,000 million kilogrammes of sweet oranges through this project, he added.

The number of vehicle accidents in these areas has gone up since drivers and pedestrians attempt to save the cattle on roads and pavements.
Cattle owners should unleash their cattle at grazing lands allocated for them. But they release their animals on roads, the residents say.
They said the Road Development Authority and the Local Government Bodies must take action against the cattle owners and set up a procedure to prevent cattle from wandering along roads and pavements.

Take up gardening as your new hobby
Many people think of gardening as boring, time-consuming, complicated, or, a retirement hobby for old people who don't play golf. In reality, gardening is an enjoyable pastime that benefits not only the gardener but also the space around him or her. The following are seven reasons why you should consider gardening as a hobby for yourself.
*It is basically free therapy
Think about it -- soaking up the vitamin D, getting out your anger by breaking up the soil, and resting in the peaceful presence of your plant babies. Is there anything better It's the perfect activity for people who need to lift their spirits or just want to create their own natural sanctuary.
* It is good for your health
While gardening's not an intense activity, it does give you the opportunity to get out there and sweat a bit, not to mention all the fresh, nutritious vegetables you'll have readily available!
* It is a great way to beautify any space
The best kind of beauty is always natural beauty. I mean, have you seen plants Nothing can match the charm of a flower, or the uplifting green of a thriving leaf. And, since gardening can be done anywhere, it's perfect for drab, unused spaces that need sprucing up.
* It is a great way to save money
For the same price of a couple of tomatoes, you can buy a packet of seeds and grow dozens of tomatoes per plant. It's crazy how many fruits or veggies a single plant can produce. In fact, it's the best return on investment I can think of.
* It makes a difference for the environment
Of course, the more plants we propagate, the more greenhouse gas we can eliminate from the atmosphere, but beyond that, the less we rely on out-of-state and foreign produce, the fewer fossil fuels we consume. It takes a staggering amount of energy -- much of it unsustainable -- to industrially sow, propagate, harvest, preserve, and transport fresh produce on the massive scale we do today. Compare that to the near-invisible carbon footprint of a backyard garden, and it's clear that the world would be better off if more people relied on their own gardens for produce.
* You'll never get bored
There's always something new to do in a garden. Each season brings its own tasks and opportunities: Starting seeds in late winter and early spring, sowing in late spring and early summer, weeding, watering, and fertilizing in summer, harvesting in late summer and fall, and starting all over again by planning over the winter. You can even branch out into activities such as plant breeding or competition.
* It is surprisingly creative
Sure, the care of plants is rooted in science, but there are endless ways to make it an art. Create a decorative fairy garden, or grow a canopy from sunflowers and morning glory. Play with an infinite combination of shapes and colors for stunning beds, beautiful bouquets, and culinary creations.

Tall hand-crocheted tree
Brazilian conceptual artist Ernesto Neto is renowned for filling public spaces with large-scale, immersive installations that blur the boundaries between the artwork and viewer. For his latest work - created in collaboration with the Fondation Beyeler - Neto created GaiaMotherTree, a giant, 65-foot tree-like crochet structure inside Zurichs Central Station.
The walk-in textile sculpture invites the public to enter via the base, through a myriad of brightly colored, hand-knotted cotton strips to find a relaxing space within.
The contemporary structure, constructed using a traditional finger-crocheting technique, took a team of 27 people several weeks to complete. From the outside, the interwoven, orange and green tree stretches from the floor up to the ceiling, creating a giant fabric canopy. The core trunk is counterbalanced by the surrounding crocheted branches that have been looped around the stations ceiling beams. These branches are then weighted with bags containing various aromatic spices such as turmeric, cloves, cumin, and black pepper. The 1,300 pounds of spices scent the exhibition space, enhancing the sensory experience.
Inside, visitors can enjoy a quiet space for meetings and meditation.
Neto explains, The idea is to slow down our time, for us to have time to breathe and feel life inside of us. The concept for the GaiaMotherTree was inspired by the artists time spent working with the Huni Kuin, an indigenous community in the Amazon region of Brazil. Their unique worldview, spiritual connection with nature, sense of community, and knowledge in craft have become integral values in Netos recent artistic practice. He reveals, This work is all about intimacy.

THASL CHIEF PROJECTS 2.8 MN ARRIVALS TARGET FOR 2019
An upbeat Chairman of the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) Sanath Ukwatte yesterday projected the arrivals target of 2.8 Million for 2019.
Buoyed by the achievement of the unprecedented tourist arrivals target of 2.5 million for 2018, which he said, would be a reality, he told Daily News Business yesterday.
He said that the industry was projecting a 15% increase for 2019. He said that it was fortunate that the industry was not inhibited by the recent political impasse barring a few MICE sector postponements at the last moment.
He stressed that 2019 would be the best year for Sri Lankas tourism with the Global Promotion Campaign which will start with the International Tourism Bourse (ITB) Confab in Berlin in March 2019 for which there will be a budget of US$ 15 million. Also buttressing this would be the leverage that Sri Lanka would be getting from Lonely Planet declaring that Sri Lanka was the best destination in the world, Ukwatte remarked.
He also said that foreign exchange brought in by tourists, would also help to counter the devaluation of the rupee to some extent.

Time to exorcise the devil of corruption
Yesterday, Sunday December 9 was International Anti-Corruption Day. The United Nations General Assembly designated it in 2003 as the day to raise awareness about this insidious crime and ways of combating it.
Corruption is a complex social, political and economic phenomenon that affects all countries. It undermines democratic institutions, slows economic development and contributes to governmental instability. In addition, it attacks the foundation of democratic institutions by distorting electoral processes, perverting the rule of law and creating bureaucratic quagmires whose only reason for existing is the soliciting of bribes. Economic development is stunted because foreign direct investment is discouraged and small businesses within the country often find it impossible to overcome the start-up costs required because of corruption.
Governments, the private sector, non-governmental organisations, the media and citizens around the world are joining forces to fight this crime.
The world has allowed the ugly and sinister head of corruption to creep into our daily lives. Stories of scandals, kickbacks, greed and moral laxity have been capturing media attention of late, proving that it is becoming part of our national heritage.
Corruption is deemed one of the biggest tragedies of mankind for the simple reason that it is ongoing and extremely difficult to combat, forcing the poor into ever more hopeless conditions while the select few in power get ever richer and more powerful. Bribes prevent chosen criminals from ever having to take responsibility for what they have done. The fact is that the line between right and wrong has become so blurred today that many people wonder if there is a difference anymore. I believe it is time we examine the moral and ethical problems facing society.
Everyone, even the most dishonest among us, it seems, agrees that honesty is an ideal to live by. Every major religion preaches honesty. Civil laws exist to enforce it.
Individuals and governments claim to want to practice it. But is this only mealy-mouthed lip-service we are paying And how many people are really committed to dealing honestly as an ongoing, constant way of life Lamentably, the corrupt are getting bolder and their operations border on the reckless. This is because graft and kickbacks have become an accepted norm in our society.
Intelligent people who thoughtfully look at the long-term effects of honesty and dishonesty must come to the logical conclusion that honesty is the only way that ultimately pays off in success. But trapped in the rat race for material success we all too often tend to forget that such crime expands because of our willingness to put up with it. There was a time when Sri Lankans reserved their greatest admiration for people of integrity and moral rectitude.
But sadly, this does not seem the attitude anymore. Most will argue that nobody is perfect. Everyone has their faults. So why should one get worked up about good and evil They argue that they are not big-time swindlers, drug barons, mass murderers or genocidal dictators. We claim to be petty sinners compared to these ruthless individuals. We see ourselves as not all that bad when compared with the big-timers. Therefore there is really nothing to worry about.
Various measures have been suggested to exorcise the devil of corruption such as transparency in public life, stringent laws to deal with the corruption cases, electoral reforms to check the misuse of money and muscle powers, reform in the judiciary system, to quicken the disposal of cases of corruption among others. Let us face it. We all want success and the sense of satisfaction that comes from achievement. But is it honest achievement
Our religion endorses education, diligence and the value of making sound investments. No one denies those who work hard and honestly the fruits of their labours. But this is an era when material prosperity becomes a measure of ones success. Conversely, we see the absence of material prosperity as evidence of moral failure. I repeat that no one should condemn worldly success, brought about by solid, down-to-earth honest principles.
But the corruption syndrome is having an effect on our community and our nation. It will ultimately pose the chilling danger of trickling down to our children who no doubt are perceptive enough to observe our moral laxity. Which poses the relevant question: Are we as responsible adults teaching our children about the importance of good practices in a practical way Most children who are entering prestigious schools know in practice that they got this opportunity by their parents giving bribes to the school authorities.
Overwhelming evidence has surfaced of widespread and deeply ingrained practice of accepting bribes and corruption as part of everyday life. Politicians, bureaucrats and clerks unethically and shamefully use taxpayers money without any hesitation. These unacceptable practices seep into the minds of our children, who will grow up to do the same in the future.
Certainly, tougher anti-corruption laws and stricter law enforcement are necessary to prevent people of upper ranks from helping themselves to public funds. However, we must place greater focus on instilling civic ethics, values and sense of duty and responsibility in our childrens minds.
Unless we strengthen values and teach our children why bribery and abusing power are unacceptable personally and socially, the insidious cancer of corruption and exploiting public wealth for personal benefit will continue, being reproduced generation after generation.
It would certainly be a great lesson to our children to note that deterrent punishment is meted out to offenders whoever they are. For as long as we fail to address the disease where it takes root - in the youngest members of our society - we will be condemning ourselves to a future in which our collective wealth will continue to be plundered and related social problems helped to flourish.
Through all this the entire nation seems to be running away from what had once been its conventionally honest shadow. Our peoples hopelessness becomes even greater when such issues and blatant injustices are ignored, conveniently misinterpreted or totally blown out of proportion.
In a larger sense some of the blame has to be apportioned to us by encouraging such a virulent malaise by our very acquiescence.
Today we must be more sensitive to moral issues and must regard bribery and dishonesty in its varied forms as crimes against society. It can be done with your help.

Trump denies collusion after probe revelations
US: US President Donald Trump on Saturday again denied that his presidential campaign colluded with Russian operatives, but made no comment on claims that he directly organized hush payments to ward off a possible sex scandal during his White House run.
Trump took to Twitter, his favourite means of communication, to address the multiple court filings that dropped on Friday in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller's sweeping investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION! the president said.
While the filings indeed did not appear to reveal evidence of collusion, they did offer a wealth of new information about what Mueller's team is looking into, along with other federal prosecutors in New York.
Prosecutors directly implicated Trump in efforts to buy the silence of two women who claimed they had had affairs with him, saying he directed his then-attorney Michael Cohen to offer them hush money.
With respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election, the New York prosecutors said.
In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1, they added, referring to Trump.
The payments are technically unrelated to the Russia probe, but prosecutors painted a damning picture of the extensive, deliberate, and serious criminal conduct of Cohen -- once a member of Trump's inner circle of trusted aides.
In August, the 52-year-old Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law in connection with the payments.
Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election, prosecutors said.
In a separate sentencing memo, Mueller said that Cohen was in contact with a Russian national as far back as November 2015 -- months before Trump formally won the presidential nomination and well before previously reported contacts -- who offered synergy on a government level. That Russian national claimed to have ties to the Kremlin and repeatedly proposed a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Two iconic tales of love and laughter
Following the immense success of The Sound of Music, Cinnamon Life is set, to bring yet another iconic West End Production to Colombo  Mamma Mia! A tale of love and laughter and a daughters trip down the aisle with three possible fathers, Mamma Mia! is one of the worlds best-loved musicals of all time and will be performed for the first time in South Asia at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre from December the 22 - 30. Filled with smash hits by Swedish pop group ABBA, and produced by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaes, Mamma Mia! is the ultimate feel good show, that will brighten up the holiday season for the entire family. A worldwide phenomenon, Mamma Mia! is a vibrant, modern production, whilst The Sound of Music told a more traditional tale and was equally iconic in its own right.
Both productions are masterpieces that have had incredible influencing power and have impacted people across generations. Having touched audiences regardless of their nationalities or backgrounds, these stories are both filled with important life themes that resonate with people from all walks of life. However, both productions are also unique and different in their own way; in their tonality, storytelling and thematic overtones. The Sound of Music (TSOM) is centred around a traditional family structure, aspirations of settling down and self expression. The characters in TSOM focus on finding their place in society, whilst in Mamma Mai! the characters dont conform to the traditional expectations of society, and the play is all about discovering inner strength and forging ones own path in the world.
Both musicals seem to feature a missing part of a puzzle  a person that completes the story. In the Sound of Music, Maria emerges as the mother and wife figure who fills an important void for the Von Trapp family, whilst in Mamma Mia!, the story calls for a partner for Sophie and a partner for her mother Donna. Both plays focus on the importance of having meaningful and fulfilling relationships with the people who are dear to you and bring out the best in you.
Commenting on the play Vice President John Keells Holdings, CEO of Cinnamon Life Mall and Head of Brand Markeing Team, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Dileep Mudadeniya said From a traditional classic like The Sound of Music to a production fused with modern thinking and a contemporary storyline like Mamma Mia!, Cinnamon Life is proud to offer residents of Colombo yet another world-class West End production. Ideal for the festive season, Mamma Mia! is a feel-good entertainment option that is well suited for the entire family. A city within a city, Cinnamon Life will serve as an entertainment hub in the region, that will transform Colombo and offer residents countless lifestyle enhancing opportunities. This is the second West End production that we have brought to South Asia for the first time, and it provides a glimpse into the inspiring and vibrant moments and experiences that Cinnamon Life has to offer.

US journalist apologises to Chopra, Jonas
INDIA: Newlyweds Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have received an apology from writer Mariah Smith, who penned an article for The Cut in which she labelled the Indian star as a modern-day scam artist. The article claimed that Nick shares a fraudulent relationship against his will and was full of racist and sexist undertones.
I want to sincerely apologise to Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, and to the readers I offended and hurt with my words. I do not condone racism, xenophobia, or sexism. I take full responsibility for what I wrote, and I was wrong. I am truly sorry, Smith posted on Twitter.
The article was slammed online by many people, including Nicks brother Joe Jonas and his fiancee, Game of Thrones star, Sophie Turner. The duo attended the wedding in Jodhpur along with the rest of the family members.
One of the portions of the article read, All Nick wanted was a possible fling with Hollywoods latest It Woman, but instead he wound up staring straight at a life sentence with a global scam artist. Even more upsetting, shes a scam artist who never even took the time to make sure he was comfortable riding a horse before arranging for him to enter their wedding ceremony on horseback, Smith had written.
Sonam Kapoor took to her official Twitter handle to express her rage over the article, and wrote, For a publication that shows womens what they are made of @TheCut has a lot to answer for . The article on @priyankachopra was sexist , racist and disgusting. Also its written by a woman which is so sad. It reeks of envy and bitterness. @mRiah shame on you!
Swara Bhasker too slammed the absurdly offensive article, writing, Depressed with the state of the world & current affairs Heres some good ol fashioned puerile filth published by @TheCut 2 add some pointless venom 2 ur day. Also someone invite @mRiah to an Indian wedding Might assuage some of her misguided angst! #yellowjournalism .
After the furore, the website issued an apology and said it has deleted the objectionable article.

Worlds biggest animals
Lolong the crocodile
Lolong the saltwater crocodile, who died a few years ago, is thought to be the biggest of its kind ever in captivity, measuring 21ft in the Philippines.
The beast was blamed for several deadly attacks before his capture in 2011.
His body was preserved so villagers could still see the reptile, as he was adored by the locals.
Knickers the cow
Knickers the cow shocked the world recently after pictures of the enormous animal went viral.
The cow is too big to be killed, weighing 220 stone and standing at 6ft 4inches tall, so instead gets to live out his days roaming the fields in Western Australia.
But Knickers isn't alone in the over-sized animal club.
Check out some of these giant creatures who are breaking records for their stature....
Mystery chicken
A video of an enormous chicken went viral last year when it was filmed poking its head through a relatively small hole in an elevated hutch.
As the clip continues, the chicken begins to step into the yard and reveals its incredible enormity and plumage.
With masses of feathers and standing far taller than most dogs, the bird wanders around the yard marking its territory.
Samson the mighty Maine Coon
Weighing 28 pounds and measuring an incredible four-foot in length is this hulking feline. He spends his down time playing fetch and has now reached celebrity status due to his impressive stature, including more than 180,000 followers on Instagram.
Darius the rabbit
Darius the rabbit measured a total of 4 feet 4 inches long. It costs his owner a whopping 5,000 a year to feed her giant bunnies, who munch their way through 2,000 carrots and 700 apples every 12 months.
Every day each of them also chows down on a huge dog bowl full of specialist rabbit food, and a bale of hay a week.
Squirrel
The enormous grey squirrel has ballooned to twice its size after being repeatedly fed nuts by tourists visting the park where she lives.
Photographer Marina van der Linden captured the chubby creature on film in the Morro Rock State Preserve in California. Software engineer Marina, 46, was stunned when the obese California ground squirrel appeared after she pulled out a bag of nuts.
She said, "I had been in the park taking photos but couldn't get any clear pictures because it was so foggy.
"I got out a bag of peanuts and suddenly I saw a family of squirrels. It was hilarious because they were all quite big, but there was one that was enormous."
Sting ray
In 2015, TV host Jeff Corwin and veterinarian Nantarika Chansue examined a huge freshwater stingray in Thailand's Mae Klong River.
The ray was a record-breaker, and the catch and release was filmed for an episode of the ABC show Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin.
The ray measured 7.9ft across and 14ft long, weighing an estimated 800lbs.
Bopper the dog
Bopper - nicknamed Bopper the Whopper - was taken in by the RSPCA when his owners became too unwell to look after him.
Now the poor pooch finds breathing and standing difficult because of his huge size. He tips the scales at 49.6kg when he should weigh around 27kg.
Gables Farm Dogs and Cats Home, in Plymouth, took Bopper in from the RSPCA but say he is too large to fit in any of their kennels.

On Writerly Jealousy
Recently, while reading a new book of poetry, I noticed a certain signature of influence: a poem with a macabre playfulness that reminded me of Daddy. Plath-y!, I wrote in the margin beside it. I pulled my copy of Plaths Collected Poems off the shelf (inscribed Merry Christmas, 1994, Mom & Dad; I would have just turned fifteen) and reread Daddy for the whatever-eth time.
For most of my life I read Daddy quite literally, as a renunciation of Plaths father: Daddy, daddy, you bastard, Im through. She all but calls him Hitler, with his neat mustache and Aryan eye. As Janet Malcolm points out in The Silent Woman, the poem has had a mixed reception. She quotes Leon Wieseltier in The New York Review of Books, 1976: Whatever her father did to her, it could not have been what the Germans did to the Jews. Irving Howe, writing in 1973, found something monstrous, utterly disproportionate in the metaphor. I think of the Sharon Olds poem The Takers, which begins, Hitler entered Paris the way my / sister entered my room at night. (My friend Chris, in grad school, read these lines and said, simply, No.)
Pro-German allegiance
However, in 2012, newly released FBI files on the German-born Otto Plath suggested that he may have been a Nazi sympathizer. As the Guardian reported at the time, the files reveal that he was detained over suspected pro-German allegiance. Unlike her critics in the twentieth century, Sylvia may have had the inside scoop on those allegiances. She may have meant to literally call him a Nazi. That doesnt close the case on Daddy, though. Nazi sympathies notwithstanding, there is little evidence that Sylvia harbored hateful feelings toward her father. As noted in a short, rather wonderful article about Plath and her series of bee poems, which I found on the website of a Dublin beekeeping association: His death when Sylvia was only eight years old deeply affected her feelings and thoughts for the rest of her life. Her mother writes that, when she was told of her fathers death, she said: Ill never speak to God again!<U+2009> (Otto Plath, an entomologist, authored an influential book called Bumblebees and Their Ways.)
Plath does not betray conscious resentment of her father in her journals; the opposite, in fact: I rail and rage against the taking of my father, whom I have never known; even his mind, his heart; his face, as a boy of 17 I love terribly. I would have loved him; and he is gone. A few years later, she visits his grave: I found the flat stone  right beside the path, where it would be walked over. Felt cheated. My temptation to dig him up. To prove he existed and really was dead. Her journals make it clear it was her mother she hated instead. In 1958 she wrote:
Misplaced blame
I never knew the love of a father, the love of a steady blood-related man after the age of eight. My mother killed the only man whod love me steady through life  I hate her for that  I hate her because he wasnt loved by her  It was her fault. Damn her eyes.
Its misplaced blameOtto died of diabetesbut evidently how she felt. So why the big switch, in 1962 I dont think there was one. She wrote the poem shortly after she discovered her poet-husband was having an affair with a mutual friend (the striking Assia WevillI feel compelled to tell you that the beekeeping site misspells her name as Weevil) and shortly before she, at last successfully, committed suicide. Given the timing, I now presume Daddy is mostly a veiled address to Ted Hughes: Hughes is the bastard she is through with.
