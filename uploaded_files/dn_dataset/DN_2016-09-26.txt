Korean Film Festival from October 14 to 17
The Korean Embassy and the Korea Foundation will co-host the Korean Film Festival 2016 from October 14 to 17 at the National Film Corporation (NFC) Theatre, Colombo 7, in partnership with the National Film Corporation. The opening ceremony will take place at 7 pm on the first day of the festival (October 14), and Born to Sing, a comedy drama, is scheduled to be screened as the opening film.
The festival hopes to provide Sri Lankan people with an opportunity to better understand Koreas culture and society through the medium of contemporary films. In total, four contemporary Korean films will be featured during the festival for the public on a first-come first-served basis. All movies will have English subtitles. The films to be screened are Born to Sing (Comedy Drama 2013), How to Steal a Dog (Family Drama 2014), No Breathing (Romance 2013), and My Love, My Bride (Comedy 2014).
Korean films have enjoyed soaring popularity over the last few years. Korean movies are both character- and plot-driven, and incredibly diverse and complex with a healthy mix of blockbusters, documentaries, indie films and film festival movies, while offering an alternative to the usual Western scripts. The new Korean films of the 21st century, a regular feature at international film festivals, are playing a crucial trend-shaping role in Asian culture in particular. The high calibre Korean films today are largely the result of the artistic passion of Korean movie makers and their ability to match the production skills of other advanced nations as well as Korean moviegoers undying support for Korean films.

Maliyadeva hand brittle Dharmapala a big thrashing
Dharmapala, Pannipitiya continuing their poor form this season succumbed to yet another big defeat, this time at the hands of Maliyadewa when they were crushed by 134 runs in an away first-round traditional-match of Singer U19 D1 tournament concluded on Thursday at Maliyadewa ground.
In a match bowlers showed more promise, Dharmapala bowlers spearheaded by Mahima Weerakoon who had an amazing match-bag of 12 wickets restricted Maliyadewas both innings to scores under 200, but Dharmapala batsmen failing yet again very pathetically managed just 82 and 102 in their two innings to loss the batch by a wide margin of 134 runs in the end. Manelka Dharmadasa, Dananjaya Premarathne and Vishwa Dissanayake bowled well for the winners.
Maliyadeva: 143 in 36.3 overs ( Sanjeewa Priyadarshana 27, Supun Sumanarathne 25, Dilshan Kollure 23, Mahima Weerakoon 6/38, Chamith Samarsinghe 2/23) & 176 in 51.4 overs (Kaveen Bandara 44, Supun Sumanarathne 39, Dulaj Ranatunga 28, Dulaj Silva 25, Mahima Weerakoon 6/73)

Two fifties from Dilshan Sigera and Malaka de Silva helped Presidents post a competitive 265 after they were asked to take the first lease on losing the toss. Lumbini in reply amassed 320 thanks to a gritty century by Kevin Pieris. However, match dribbled to a lame conclusion on Tuesday at Colts ground when Presidents in their second innings had scored 50 for three.
Presidents , Rajagiriya: 265 in 78.2 overs (Dilshan Sigera 59, Sachitha Liyanage 48, Malaka De Silva 52, Kanishka Maduwantha 3/64) & 50/3 in 11 overs (Dilshan Sigera 31*, Thanuka Dabare 2/20)

Lyceum on their way to this championship beat Kekirawa MV and Galahitiyawa Central and finally St.Benedict in the final round.
A combined batting-effort, after Lyceum won the toss and took the first lease, with a well-made 55 from Shabik Ifthary followed by three more decent knocks by Shaleem Usama (43), Chandima Gayan (32*) and Pasal Eshan (37) put Lyceum on a strong footing with an imposing score of 270 though they were bowled out inside fifty overs. Irushan Saranga (4/43) and Buddhima Wijesundara (2/38) bowled well for St.Benedict. Lyceums final total would have been an enormous one had they batted out full fifty overs.

After Deshan Vimukthi (68) and Nisalka Fernando (56) provided the initiative in a sensible approach Chandima Gayan batted-out the full fifty overs to remain unbeaten on a solid late flourish of 29, but eventually they fell short by a mere 14-run to loss the final by 13 runs.

Pakistan beat West Indies for T20 series win
DUBAI, Saturday  Pakistan played good all-round cricket to beat world champions West Indies by 16 runs in the second Twenty20 in Dubai on Saturday, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
Skipper Sarfraz Ahmed hit a rapid 32-ball 46 not out to guide Pakistan to 160-4 before pacemen Sohail Tanvir (3-13) and Hasan Ali (3-49) restricted the West Indies to 144-9 at Dubai Stadium.
Pakistan had won the first match -- also in Dubai -- by nine wickets on Friday.
The victory over the world champions gave Pakistan reasons to smile in their campaign to build a new team after they thumped England, also by nine wickets, in Manchester earlier this month.
Pakistan were ousted in the first round of the World Twenty20 held in India in April this year, forcing Shahid Afridi to step down as captain.
Pakistans unassailable lead leaves the third and final match in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday of academic interest.
Tanvir rocked the West Indies top order with the wickets of Evin Lewis (three) and Marlon Samuels (one) before he later dismissed Nicholas Pooran (four).
He also completed 50 wickets in the shortest format and now has 52 victims in 53 matches.
Afridi is the highest wicket-taker in Twenty20 cricket with 97 while two other Pakistanis, fast bowler Umar Gul and spinner Saeed Ajmal, have 85 each.
Sunil Narine top-scored with 30 while Andre Fletcher made 29 but the West Indies for the second day failed to find the batting skills which earned them two World Twenty20 titles, the first in 2012.
Ali dismissed Fletcher, Kieron Pollard (18) and Carlos Brathwaite (eight) in a daring spell of bowling. Narine hit four boundaries and a six during his 17-ball knock but 74 runs in the last five overs proved too much for the champions. Earlier Pakistan scored at a fast pace after they were put into bat.
Skipper Ahmed hit a rapid 46 not out and added 69 runs for the third wicket with Shoaib Malik (37 off 28 balls) to lift Pakistan.
Ahmeds knock featured five boundaries while Malik smashed a six and three fours as Pakistan kept the same tempo which earned them a win in the first match.
Opener Khalid Latif made a 36-ball 40 with three boundaries and a towering six. Babar Azam made 19 and Sharjeel Khan two.
Scores:
Pakistan 160-4 in 20 overs (Khalid Latif 40, Shoaib Malik 37, Sarfraz Ahymed 46 n.o.)
West Indies 144-9 in 20 overs (A Fletcher 29, S Narine 30, Sohail Tanvir 3/13, Hasan Ali 3/49)  AFP
