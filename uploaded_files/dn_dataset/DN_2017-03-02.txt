Charles Henry De Soysa  philanthropist beyond calculation
March 3 is the birth anniversary of the late Charles Henry de Soysa, commemorated annually by his descendants, others connected in one way or another with the schools he built, Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges, Moratuwa, the De Soysa Hospital for Women, the hospitals of Lunawa, Marawilla, and Panadura, and by the thousands who have benefitted in a myriad ways, through a visionary who was far ahead of his time.
It has been said of him that he had a golden touch and that everything he began became a goldmine. But what is most admirable about his success, was that he shared what he had with others. This was as rare then, as it is now. He did all this, not as a surefire passport to popularity, but by showing amazing vision, in the fields he chose; education, health and land, for his largesse to one and all, which showed that he thought far beyond the time and age he lived in.
In the era in which he lived, prejudice and bias were blatantly believed in and widely practised. But, although he donated generously to the development of his hometown Moratuwa, in education, religion and health, his generosity to other are totally unconnected with him, either by ties of blood or business interests; are a living testament to his thinking, which was far beyond the peripheries of those existing divisions, strictly adhered to in every sphere of work or activity at that time.
Better deal in life
Again, this was an era of gracious living, gentility, peace and contentment, in which he could have lived a life of ease, in an ivory tower, far removed from reality, with the wealth he inherited. But he worked hard to increase his wealth, not only for his family, but shared it with the less fortunate, improved their lifestyles and gave them opportunities, opening doors and windows to them which enhanced and gave them a better deal in life.
He strove hard all his life, to release people from poverty, which is another kind of enclosure. He was among the Founders of The Ceylon National Congress, from which emerged The United National Party and was the first Ceylonese to start a Bank.
Today, we live in a world of much publicized philanthropy, where corruption reigns supreme. We live in constant fear of violence, danger, plunder and rape. We seem to thrive on conquest and it is only now that we see some hope in achieving conflict resolution. Efforts towards permanent peace are only being set in place now, after years of nothing being done to get this. This turbulent scene we lived in until recently, was ruled by greed and cruelty to man by man, while the rule of law was blown away, out of sight.
As a man, the late Charles Henry, was one who set incredibly high standards of integrity, punctuality and dedication, and expected his family and those who worked for him, to follow his example in these virtues, which are rare today. Many legends about him are related time and time again, within the family, among past and present students of Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges, doctors and patients who have been at the various hospitals and institutions, donated by him to the nation. Among them are, that at the precise time he was born, a cock had crowed which was rare and said to denote that it was a singularly fortunate person who was born at this time.
His donation of The De Soysa Hospital for Women, is said to have been inspired, by his seeing a women in labour, crying out for help on the roadside, while he was out riding his horse. He organised swift medical help for her and the idea of this hospital and the many others he donated later, in various parts of the country stemmed from this episode.
Alfred House which was built specially by him for the banquet in honour of the visit to Ceylon, by Prince Alfred, the then Prince of Wales is yet another fascinating legend, almost akin to a fairytale. It is sad that neither Alfred House or the special cutlery and crockery of gold and precious stones made for the banquet, no longer belong to the family.
Apart from the hospitals, schools, churches, temples and kovils, he donated 10,000 Sterling Pounds and 87 acres in Kanatte, to the state for a model farm. A hundred poverty stricken farmers in Walapane, were gifted paddy fields and houses. His generosity was not confined to our shores but reached far beyond them.
The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, where a plaque mentions his contribution, The Brompton Hospital, Royal Free Hospital, Victoria Chest Hospital, The Hospital for accidents to Dock Labourers, all benefitted from his largesse, which is not equalled up to date.
An inspiration
It was just recently, I heard another tale about him. The late Isaac de Silva, who was a relative of Lady Catherine de Soysa, wife of the late Charles Henry, had been a close advisor and friend of his. When the late Charles Henry built Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges, the late Isaac who was a devout Methodist, got the Methodist schools in the area closed down and saw that the pupils there went to Prince and Princess of Wales Colleges.
The late Isaac was a scholar and wrote the first Sinhala novel in 1888, which was published by the Wesley Press. It was later translated into English by him titled The Happy and Miserable Families. A copy of this is in the British Museum and in our museum here in Colombo.
As the great granddaughter of the late Charles Henry, I am filled with a great sense of pride, combined with deep humility, that the blood of a man such as this, flows in my veins and in those of my children. It is no wonder that some who are not his descendants, but only connected to him through his wife claim that they are his descendants. An awareness that our family history, is prized and beyond value, has made me a repository from the past.
The late CHs life is an inspiration and an example, not only to us, as his descendants, but to each and every citizen of our country.
From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.----Karl Marx

Chasing the dream beyond conventional expectations
History will record the long drawn out Dialog rugby season 2017 all done and dusted bar the shouting or our incredibly busy, fat lady singing
The drama that unfolded during the season carrying on regardless of reputation and petitions to the gods on Olympus.
I have always encouraged players never to seek divine favours if they are unable to rely on their given skills and temperament.
Theories and various references to history are yet to confirm any divine fan support for the XV format or for individual clubs around the world.
Kandy proved their distinct power and professionalism in the league, to come from behind and less points by week 10and clinically defend their 2016 title at Havelock Park, despite massive home support for the Havies and some scintillating rugby all the way down to the wire.
The win couldnt have been sweeter when Danushka finisher Ranjan, ran in a signature try from 50metres out, powering his way past desperate tackles with a hand off that has Fijian class stamped all over it.
But that was not the end of it ...Nishon Perera scored a cracker to thrill the park ...bouncing off and slipping through 3 tacklers who thought they had him ..the pendulum swung again ...could Havies somehow shape an impossible win in the last 10 minutes of regulation time The question was asked and with 5mins left, an answer by super sub Sooriyabandara showing such fast feet and genuine pace from his 22metre line... simply blew the Havelocks out of the park.
Soori B left the Havies line defence in shredded bits to score the scorcher that clinched the league and total euphoria for the diehard Nittawelians - the job well done and team pride for persistence and belief that shouted class and professionalism.
Rugby in Sri Lanka assumes new dimension and stature as the Singer schools season dramatically kicked off last weekend ...with absolutely all sorts going on....shocking the public and throwing the league into a tail spin. What next ...was popular thinking islandwide
If the SLSRFA in the now familiar manner announced a lunar shuttle service to Mars starting in March ...schools would ask how much the flight costs .. All plans changed with 48hrs to launching the 2017 season 12 confirmed contenders were informed that a 13 was added and D S Senanayake is in group 1- A. The joy down Gregorys Road would have been short and sharp as the teams were read out..defending champions Isipathana, Royal, St. Peters, St Josephs, Dharmaraja, St Anthonys + D S Senanayake make this the toughest by miles and each game a cauldron of pressure and adrenaline.
History is being rewritten as we speak and much will unfold as the fixtures line up ...Peters survived against Anthonys, Patana were pushed all the way by Dharmaraja and Royal found out how much the new look Joes can step up this season.
What happened with the Wesley-Trinity opener is exactly what we dread most and prompt action vital to everybody that loves and believes in the code.
We need to pressure the stake holders to establish a CCTV systems at all venues, so that authorities and police have solid evidence on film, plus there needs to be plain clothes officers deployed at matches to deter and note potential trouble makers.
The consensus is incident free rugby for school kids and families to enjoy ...and the threat level down to zero...this is a game and we simply cannot accept anyone being at risk.
Chances are too risky to contemplate and I rather think there must be intervention and assurances that are legally binding ...its outrageous to imagine a 100million rupee tournament unable to keep safety of players and spectators as their no 1 priority, apart from the game in the middle.
I think they should be proactive and cure this ailment in the shortest possible time, assure the public its sorted and insist that players follow the rules or risk bans and prosecution - as I am sure you all agree, what we saw with that Trinity-Wesley match was the last of its kind.
We need to enjoy the skills and strategy on show in the middle and be enthralled by the performance levels of our young warriors, and not have to consider anything else beyond the game in the middle ...fair
Further across the open seas, the RBS 6 Nations presented another huge weekender and much to contemplate about the quality of northern hemisphere rugby ...plus mesmerizing prospects for the British Lions summer of pain down under.
England has now stepped up to a league of their own...currently on a 17 game winning streak that will challenge the All Blacks18 game record that seemed untouchable and almost unreachable....
Ireland, England and Scotland showing excellent team form from the outset and much more to look forward to, given the hype and pre publicity about the quality of this years RBS tournament as the flagship for European rugby.
Sri Lanka is now looking at the Asian nations regional opener in 2 months with selections already making waves especially with the Asian 7s series for wider delivery on the world stage.
We are listed to play as part of the Hong Kong 7s and gain much needed experience to be real contenders in Asia this season and improve our rankings to top 2 ...the women need to seriously upgrade skill and power to grade up from 6th to top 3 at least.
7s rugby is our future and I am hopeful that sanity will prevail with protecting our 7s specialists for the duration and not risk impact injuries in the XVs competition this year.
I imagine the thinking to be considerate of risk and fatigue that will take the edge from these specialists ...its time to structure a full time system for the 7s and aim for a high performance future with Sri Lanka rugby.
The writing is on the wall..lets hope and anticipate its top priority for us as we look to be a dominant force in Asia at 7s.
Cheers islanders.

Live and let live SAITM
It seems that the GMOA is unable to accept the verdict of the Appeal Court and want to descend to the law of the jungle to obtain their own way on the SAITM matter.
This a clear example as Lord Kipling said many years ago of Power without responsibility, the privilege of harlots throughout the ages. Nobody denies their right to protest but to seek extra judicial means and blackmail is simply not permissible. To align with JVP shows an amnesia of deplorable events leading to the closure of universities for several years. Is this the agenda of the GMOA
One is compelled to comment on the eight Deans of Medical Facilities, making a thoroughly impractical proposal to suspend student enrolment for six months. Which means closure of the place and firing of staff and suspending all teaching. On the other hand if these wise Deans were from prestigious universities we might take note, but Lo and Behold all our Universities rank below 2000 in the level of worldwide ranking. What is said is that even in Asia we don't make even the first 200! Is the pot calling the kettle black Set your own house in order before trying to correct others.
The SLMC complains about the lack of clinical training. Now this is interesting. I don't know about this training, but we seem to put out rapid fire doctors used to treat a hundred patients in a morning. The ritual of bedside diagnosis is dead, and practiced by a very few physicians. There is an increase in diagnostic testing and a steep decline in bedside diagnosis.
It is not time we have faith and trust in our own people. We accept doctors trained in faraway places like Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Belarus etc, but cannot allow a nascent institution trying to get off the ground at home. Give SAITM fair chance, and I am sure in 25 years it could become shining example of medical education.
There is a cowardly attempt to cruelly thwart hundreds of students aspiring to join a noble profession on some flimsy grounds which can be resolved.

Constitutional changes requiring referendum not mandated by the people: Chandima
The people did not give a mandate on January 8 to make changes to the Constitution that requires a referendum, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said. The Minister also said, according to the peoples mandate,the only change that could be made to the Constitution is only an amendment to the Constitution that does not require a referendum.
The election Manifesto of President Maithripala Sirisena clearly states that no amendments would be made to the Constitution that requires a referendum, Minister Weerakkody said. So, what we have to do is to stick to what was promised at the election, he said. Minister Weerakkody made this observation at a press conference at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation auditorium head office in Dematagoda yesterday.
He also said that there were several features in the Executive Presidency that should be upheld for the security and the defence of the country. He also said that the Executive Presidency today is not the same it was and its power had been curtailed through setting up the independent commissions by way of the 19th amendment to the constitution. He added that the President could not act arbitrarily due to these independent commissions. That is what the people needed, he added. The SLFP is committed to introducing changes to the Constitution within the existing frame work, Minister Weerakkody said. The changes will be made without causing any threat to the countrys security. The Constitutional Committees had been set up to get views of people and different political parties on the changes that should be made to the Constitution, he said.

CWE to import 20,000 MTs of rice
The Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) is to import 20,000 MT of rice to meet the present rice shortage and control the ever increasing price of rice.
Another 100,000 MT of raw and Nadu rice is to be imported by the CWE as a buffer stock through a government to government basis to meet the future shortages as the drought is expected to persist into the foreseeable future.
Earlier this year, the import duty of Rs. 51 was removed and a Special Commodity Levy (SCL) of Rs 15 was imposed for imported rice. By 25 January 22,000 MT of rice had been imported under the new scheme but importers had complained to the government that the SCL was too high and that made the landing cost of rice to be Rs 75 per kilo. Hence, it was further reduced to Rs 5 to bring costs between Rs 65-66 per kilo.
Rice price hikes have been one of the main concerns of the government as poor harvests last year and this has led to a major rice shortage in the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena earlier also imposed two separate control prices to keep in check the prices of imported and domestic rice.
According to the new controlled prices; Samba is Rs 90/kilo except for local Keeri samba and Suuduru Samba.
Imported Samba is at Rs 80/kg, local Nadu is Rs 80/kg, imported Nadu is Rs 72/kg, local Kekulu rice is at Rs 78/kg and imported Kekulu is at Rs 70 per kilo.
As of February 26 113,000 MT has been imported with a slight decrease in price but the government noted that there was still a shortage of rice stocks in the market.
The Treasury has been directed to issue a Treasury Gurantee of Rs 1.4 billion for importation of 20,000 MT every month and another for Rs 7 billion for the import of the buffer stock.
The imported rice will be sold through Lanka Sathosa outlets and the open market.

Drink it straight! : Eternal elegance, contemporary touch
When the young rays of the sun seeps through the cypress leaves to flirt with the dew dappled marigolds, a new day dawns on Abbotsford division, Dessford Estate, Nanu Oya. The lithe, able feet of Lechumi, Mariamma, Laxshmi and Indira fall on the well-worn paths as they begin work on Abbotsford Division, situated a few meters away in the hills beside the Nuwara Eliya Hatton road. As the mist rises from the ground the newly plucked leaves undergo a unique manufacturing process which culminates into a new brand of tea described as a golden brew, a gourmet-special, guaranteed to give you a taste of the rich heritage of the pioneer planters, taking you back to the peace and serenity of beautiful landscapes, horse-drawn carriages, and raindrops on English roses.
The innovator of this unique tea, Nishantha Abeysinghe and his team on Dessford Estate, of Talawakelle Tea Estates Limited are the winners of the Hayleys Chairmans Award, - Plantation Sector, 2017. Aiming to transform the conventional process of manufacturing Ceylon tea - and then remake the existing tea culture of not only Sri Lanka but the whole world, one cup at a time, Nishantha Abeysinghe hopes to herald the beginning of a new era in this challenging times in the tea industry of Sri Lanka through his invention. Daily News joined the inventor in his office in the hills of Nanu Oya to discuss innovation, his hopes for the future and his favorite cup of tea.
Q: Most inventions are eureka moments. Even the very first cup of tea came about accidentally when some leaves fell into a pot of boiling water in ancient China. How did the discovery of Abbotsford Special happen
A: Actually it wasnt something that happened in a flash or accidentally. It wasnt like the apple falling on Newtons head. It was pure curiosity at first that led me to explore the possibilities of making a brand of tea that is different to what is available in the market. It all started in the kitchen of the planters bungalow I live in, where most of the trials were done using clay pots and pans and the oven hitherto used only for baking cakes. My intention was to try and make a sweeter tea than the world famous Darjeeling or Chinese Keemun.
Q: How long did it take to create the premium brew you were looking for
A: I experimented for over three years. There was this old seedling tea plot close to my bungalow which apparently was planted by A. Ferguson in the 1870s. I selected this field because these tea bushes are about 140 years old and they produce some of the most flavoured buds ever known. Whenever I had some free time along with my wife and daughter we used to go to this field with a basket and pick the tiny buds. Then back home in our bungalows kitchen we carefully steam rolled the leaves and sun dried them. It took many trials and errors however, before we could come up with something that satisfied me. From the kitchen we progressed to the factory with a few miniature tea processing machines.
Q: What is unique about this new brand of tea
A: What is amazing is the liqueur characteristics that developed from these ancient leaves subjected to a unique and modern manufacturing process. This tea is a marvelous blend of the 19th century and the present. It has a very smooth delicate floral taste that is different to any of the other brands of tea we have known till now.
Q: Can you explain the innovative method used in manufacturing this special brand
A: The initial trials motivated me to explore the idea of producing tea that is different to black and green tea commonly available in the market. Black tea that all of us are familiar with, is fully fermented during the manufacturing process. When the tea is fully fermented the brew is reddish in color and strong in liqueur characteristics. Green tea which is fast becoming popular here in Sri Lanka is produced without any fermentation light in the cup. The tea I have called Abbotsford Special falls in between these two extremes.
Q: What is the motivation behind this invention and what are the challenges you see in the future
A: This year we celebrate 150 years of Ceylon tea. But the industry has not changed much in terms of value creation. We have not moved beyond the traditional manufacturing processes. It is time to think beyond traditions and create tea products that appeal to the modern consumers who are ready for a new experience in tea.
Q: Who were the guiding force behind your new endeavor
A: All this would not have been possible without the assistance of the Managing Director of Talawakelle tea estates Roshan Rajadurai, CEO, Dilantha Senevirantne and DCEO Lalith Munasinghe for taking the leadership in creating a culture of innovation at Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC. They have always encouraged, financed and recognized new ventures all in the name of preserving this cherished drink for generations to come. I must also thank my team on Dessford Estate, Dilory Manohar, Asaba Kodagoda, Mohamed Fawzer, Madhawa Wickramaratne and all the rest of my staff and workers who supported me in various ways.
Q: What advice would you give to other innovators, especially those in the tea sector
A: If you truly want to make a contribution as a planter, you cant sit on the sidelines waiting till the weather or the market prices change. It is still not too late to look beyond traditions in managing tea estates. There are plenty of opportunities on estates to be exploited. Believe in your dreams, believe in your ability to make them come true. If at first you fail, keep on trying. Success is always within your reach.
Q: Finally, what is the best way to get the most out of a cup of premium Ceylon tea
A: Drink it straight. No sugar, no milk.

Emma Watson explains why she won't talk about her love life

Being a celebrity must be hard. Fame and fortune aside, the constant intrusion into your life cant be much fun.
We live in a world where break-up stories are splashed across the front pages and the public are always hungry for juicy details of a stars personal life.
But there are some celebrities who are noticeably coy when it comes to aspects of their lives outside of work, specifically their love lives.
One such person is actor and feminist campaigner Emma Watson.
Do you know who shes currently dating We thought not.
And Watson has just explained why she never talks about her romantic life, and it makes a lot of sense.
In an interview withVanity Fair, Watson revealed that bykeeping her private and work spheres separate, shes able to lead a more normal life away from the cameras.
She has a boyfriend, but no one knows who he is - according to rumours on the internet, hes a guy called Mack who works in Silicon Valley.
I want to be consistent: I cant talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You cant have it both ways, she explains.
However this silence is not just for her own benefit, but for that of whoever shes in a relationship with.
Ive noticed, in Hollywood, who youre dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.
Being in the spotlight clearly does not come naturally to Watson. She has revealed that when she enrolled at Brown University in 2009, she was seriously considering giving up acting altogether.
I was finding this fame thing was getting to a point of no return, she remembers. I sensed if this was something I was ever going to step away from it was now or never.
Dont ever bother asking Watson for a selfie either, because shell say no: If someone takes a photograph of me and posts it, within two seconds theyve created a marker of exactly where I am within 10 meters.
They can see what Im wearing and who Im with. I just cant give that tracking data.
Shes not rude or mean to her fans though, and will happily take the time to chat to people or sign an autograph: I'll say, 'I will sit here and answer every single Harry Potter fandom question you have but I just cant do a picture.
Its a refreshing and rare approach

Fast bowler Nipuna Ransika gets a flat in Colombo
Sri Lanka's emerging under-19 fast bowler Nipuna Ransika from Ambalangoda P. de S. Kularatna Vidyalaya who excelled on the under 19 tours to South Africa and England was presented a flat at the 'Sayurupura' housing scheme in Angulana by Housing and Construction Minister Sajth Pramadasa.
Seventeen-year-old Ransika who has recorded bowling speeds of 140 kmph is training under former Sri Lanka fast bowler Chaminda Vaas at Sri Lanka Cricket. He has to travel from Ambalangoda to Colombo for practices regularly and financially he found it difficult.
Ransika's family lives in a small house in Polwatta and the house has been mortgaged. Minister Premadasa instructed National Housing Development Authority Chairman S. Palansooriya to construct a new house for Nipuna's family and assured to grant Rs. 500,000 to get the mortgage released.
The Minister said that Nipuna can stay in Colombo and focus on his practices and make the country proud by becoming a great bowler of international fame in the future.
Minister Premadasa handed over the deed and the key of Nipuna's Angula flat at the ministry auditorium in Battaramulla on February 21 in the presence of Nipuna's family members, MP Bandula Lal Bandarigoda, Ministry Secretary W.K.K.

Fitch affirms Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund at B+f/S5
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ceylon Dollar Bond Funds International Fund Credit Quality Rating at B+f and Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating at S5. The fund is managed by Ceylon Asset Management (CAM).
The affirmation of the B+f International Fund Credit Quality Rating is driven by the weighted-average rating factor (WARF), the funds rating distribution and its investment guidelines.
The fund has a limited investment space, as it only invests in US dollar bonds issued by the government of Sri Lanka (B+/Stable), licensed banks in Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan corporates that are rated by an international rating agency.
This restricts potential investments to 15 listed issuances totalling around USD 10 bn as well as Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) of around US$ 4 bn. SLDBs are unlisted, unrated US dollar bonds issued by the government domestically.
The affirmation of the Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating is driven by the market risk factor as well as Fitchs consideration of qualitative factors, such as the fund managers ability to extend duration above current levels if it sees fit. The rating also reflects Fitchs conservative assumptions about potential volatility in emerging market debt.

Grand Talk, Grand Win  competition from Hyundai
Under the initiatives of Hyundais global branding strategy beneath the concept modern premium Hyundai Lanka launched their latest marketing movement, be the Hyundai Star with Grand Talk, Grand Win contest.
Hyundai as a global renowned automobile brand whose name meaning is modern in Korean, was long known as an economy brand that chip away at rivals on sticker prices.
But now the company wants to foster an image that matches its rapidly increasing reputation for top-notch quality.
The brand has been doing quite well in building good functional quality, and in the past 10 years, Hyundai has been very successful in building an image for quality for a fair-haired sticker price. But Hyundai still have some room to improve our emotional quality and that is related to our brand strategy.
That's why we set modern premium as the brand direction and to increase the brand awareness among Sri Lankan consumers. With the help of these new initiatives we expect improved customer service, more innovative marketing and a better look and feel for the vehicles themselves.
Brand recognition for Hyundai in Sri Lanka is not at the predictable level compared to the other markets in the developing world, perhaps due to the lack of unawareness about the genuine growth of the brand over the years in the globe. Our goal is to improve the customer engagement level with our brand in Sri Lanka.
Loyalty is something that Hyundai is serious about. Thats why the company is focused on earning the loyalty of our customers by delivering convincing customer schemes like this.
Just as Hyundai fans show their loyalty by buying another Hyundai after another, Sri Lankan fans that go to any extent to express their loyalty, passion and dedication towards the brand and talk about the most awarded compact car in the world Grand i10 will have more chances of winning a car free.
Thus the company consider the person who wins the car as a hero/Star.

Historic Gazette Notification proclaiming 82 freedom fighters as national heroes: They will be remembered forever with honour and respect: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said that yesterday was a historic day since a historic error was corrected by rewriting the names of 82 national heroes, who participated in the countrys first ever liberation struggle 199 years ago, on the name list of national heroes.
The President was speaking after the signing the of the historic Gazette Notification at the Magul Maduwa of the Sri Dalada Maligawa premises proclaiming 82 freedom fighters as national heroes.
These 82 national heroes who participated in the countrys first ever liberation struggle had been declared as traitors by the British. The event was held under the theme Uththamabiwandana.
President Sirisena addressing the huge gathering including hundreds of memebers of the Maha Sangha opposite the Sri Dalada Maligawa said that these national heroes, who bravely stood against foreign invaders and made the ultimate sacrifice were will be always remembered with honour and respect by the masses of the country.
Eventhough, the Colonial rulers branded these national heroes as traitors and even after several decades after the country gaining independence, no measures were taken to rectify this historic error, the President said.
Realizing this long felt need, President Sirisena revoked the 190-year-old British colonial order, clearing the names of the national heroes issuing a fresh gazette notification after cancelling a colonial rulers old gazette notification through which the 82 heroes were branded as traitors.
The order had been issued by then-British Governor Robert Brownrigg in January 1818 listing the names of these patriots, including Monarawila Keppetipola Disawe, who was a high-ranking official of the countrys last kingdom before it was defeated by the British.
President Sirisena said that we Sri Lankan are inherited for a proud history. It has been revealed that steel had been used 5,000 years ago.
He added that thousands of valiant patriotic heroes sacrificed their lives for the freedom struggles from 1505 until 1948.
Besides, a significant number of heroes sacrificed their lives for protecting the territorial integrity of the country during the three decade LTTE terrorist war.
The President while responding to the Maha Sangha said that measures will be taken to re-implement the Upcountry Rural Rehabilitation Commission (Udarata Gami Punaruththapana Commission) again aiming to streamline the development of the activities of upcountry.
The President added that the Cabinet approval has been granted for the implementation of the commission again.
When the members of the Maha Sangha brought to the Presidents attention that there are certain issues relating to lands belonging to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, President Sirisena promised to take immediate measures to rectify those issues.
The President further said that he will give necessary instructions to the relevant authorities to protect the historic value and architecture of the former Bogambara Prison when carrying out renovation and development activities.
The 82 national heroes being elevated to the status of patriotic heroes by President Sirisena include Keppetipola Disawe, Godagedara Rate Adikaram, Ketakala Mohottaale, Kataragama Maha, Bethma Raterala, Kataragama Kuda Bethma Raterala, Polgolla Mohottaale, Watte Kale Mohottaale, Polgahagedara Rehenaraale, Posrewatta Vidane, Kiwlegedara Mohottale, Kalugamuwe Mohottaale, Udumadure Mohottaale, Kohukumbure Rateraale, Kohukumbure Walawwe Rateraale, Butuwe Rateraale, Baginigahawela Rateraala, Mahabadulle Gammane Rateraale, Bulupitiye Mohottaale and Palle Melheyaye Gamethiraale and a few more.

ICBT HND comparable with UK Diploma
ICBT Campus Higher National Diplomas moderated by Cardi Metropolitan University UK is widely recognized by higher education institutions and employers around the world as evidence of academic achievement.
The National Recognition Information Centre for the United Kingdom (UK NARIC), the national agency in the UK for the recognition and comparison of international qualifications and skills, has carried out an independent benchmarking study of ICBT Campus Higher National Diplomas in Business Management, Information Technology, Psychology, Construction and Engineering.
The study found the ICBT HNDs to be comparable to the Diploma of Higher Education standard, UK Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) Level 5. It provides an independent benchmark, supporting wider understanding of ICBT HND qualifications and recognition of their comparable educational level by universities, higher education institutions worldwide.
The UK NARIC benchmarking process is based on a well-established method for credential evaluation, including consideration of entry requirements, duration, content and structure, learning outcomes, modes of learning and assessment, and associated outcomes.
Each of these core qualification components was reviewed in comparison with recognized standards for UK higher education qualifications. Consideration is also given to the associated quality assurance processes and procedures in place for development, delivery and assessment of the awards.
The overall aim and purpose of the ICBT HND programmes correspond broadly with that of Diplomas of Higher Education, in that ICBT intends to develop a mixture of academic and practical skills combined with transferable employability skills to enable transition to the workplace.
As with the UK Diplomas of Higher Education, the ICBT HND programmes allow access to the third year of Bachelor programmes at leading British universities in similarly related subjects.

Images of heartfelt desires Speculo 2017
An Art Exhibition is always something of an enigma. Because it comes from ones spirit. It cannot be measured or compared in terms of quality or quantity. It is special because it is an image of a persons mental faculties. An image of his emotions. The tiniest exhibition has some meaning, after all didnt David kill Goliath
Recently the Sri Lankan Airlines held their exhibition Speculo 2017 and event that drew a significant crowd being an art exhibition. Though in no means superior to any other exhibition, it was one that knocked on the door of ones heart, asking to be allowed in, to be dissected and analyzed by a probing mind.
The theme of this exhibition centers around, how people view Sri Lankan Airlines. We wanted to see their views expressed in the form of Art - in the form of imagery. This was a challenge. We did not force the participants in anyway, so what you see is completely original. There have been exhibits displayed by almost 80 seasoned and senior artists which shows the fervor and enthusiasm that this exhibition has generated. Also there has been a great response from students, said Sri Lankan Airlines General Manager Marketing Saminda Perera
Perera pointed out that in terms of quantity and quality the exhibition certainly has significance. In terms of audience participation there really were a lot of attendees!
The creations that came out of this endeavor are numerous and it has been very encouraging. Indeed the gallery is not large enough to display all these pictures numbering almost a 1000. This exhibition has received the fullest corporation from Sri Lankan Airlines, at the highest level. The credit must go to my team and my boss. Without their support I dont think such a huge exhibition could have been held. Also the artists here have not had it easy, facing many difficulties. I too have benefited from this exhibition as it has broadened my horizons, explained Perera.
Perera made special mention that it is heartening to know that some of the exhibits are that of prisoners. This makes the exhibition something special. It shows that prisoners are humans with minds of their own with feelings and ideas.
We at Sri Lankan airlines love to do something new and something novel. So this exhibition comes from our heartfelt desire to do something out of the box. It has been a lot of hard work and effort, added Perera.
* Speculo 2017, a national painting and visual arts exhibition featuring the work of the countrys top professional artists as well as youth from all corners of the island.
* The competition featured a total of 80 professional artists, 350 displays and diverse pieces that were showcased under a cross section of categories.

The exhibition was organized with the aim of inspiring artists from across the country from various districts to showcase their work, by creatively elaborating their perspective on the National Carrier.

Its done, at last
The long overdue action against corrupt medical practitioners in the Prisons Department has now been taken. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered the transfer of all doctors attached to the Prison Hospital. It was also revealed that one of the Prison doctors had already been transferred after having been found to have colluded in the admission of politicians to the Merchant Ward. But this worthy, it is has been revealed, was still staying put, which is an indication how the going had been good for this particular medico in particular and the doctors in the Prisons Hospital in general.
The public, for too, long have been taken for suckers by the doctors in the Prison Hospital who have maintained double standards, one for politicians and the well heeled, and another for the ordinary folk. Just transferring will not suffice. A full probe should be conducted on how certain VIP politicians of the former regime got themselves admitted to the Merchant Ward no sooner they entered prison.
There was the stand out case of Basil Rajapaksa, who, after scooting out of the country on election night, arriving to a rousing welcome at the BIA. Those who witnessed the younger brother of the former President waving lustily and gesticulating wildly to his supporters outside the airport would not, for a moment have thought, that he would need any medical care - not by a long shot. But lo and behold, no sooner was he arrested at the scene and deposited in the prison Rajapaksa gets himself admitted to the Merchant Ward. What was his ailment and who sanctioned his transfer from the Prison Hospital to the Merchant Ward is still shrouded in secrecy. Rajapaksa in an interview with a TV channel, when asked, why he sought admission to hospital no sooner he was thrown behind bars gave the tongue in cheek reply that those who enter prison are liable to have, whatever ailment they are afflicted with, compounded.
Not just Basil R. We have had a whole host of politicians making a beeline to the Merchant Ward, hardly after their cell doors have clanged shut behind them. On what basis is this done
The public have had their intelligence insulted for too long. Not just this. Recently we have had imprisoned politicians getting themselves medically condemned in order to avoid appearing before a courts of law. The Prison Hospital, like the Prisons Department itself, needs an overhaul. Doctors with proven integrity should be recruited to man the scandal ridden Prison hospitals. It is only then that the public can expect evenhanded treatment.
Geetha got it wrong
Actress turned politician Geetha Kumarasinghe has taken a dig at the Yahapalanaya government, for the rising crime rate in the country. Addressing Joint Opposition women representatives, the Galle District MP says that people were being killed in broad daylight by underworld figures, a thing not seen even in America. Her Joint Opposition colleague Udaya Gammanpila, meanwhile, states that underworld activities that were brought under control by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who handled the underworld in a politically unbiased manner, had resurfaced. He said, under GR, most of the underworld figures fled the country but have returned, curtsey a powerful government Minister.
Both Geetha and Gammanpila are obviously peddling their political views without making a genuine assessment of the situation. The underworld was not the creation of the present government but a carry forward from the past. The Vambottas and the Julam Pitiye Amares were not the creation of the Yahapalanaya government just like the Soththi Upalis and Kalu Luckies were not the creation of the Chandrika government. All governments lent their patronage to underworld figures, which sadly has culminated in the type of situation that we witnessed the other day in Kalutara.
Geetha, who hints at a growth of crime under the present government, should cast her mind back a few years when the criminals in fact were dressed in political garb. Has she forgotten how the Superintendent of the Noori Estate was brutally done to death by a gang led by a Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman no less Has she forgotten the episode, where, another PS Chairman was found guilty for the murder of a British national and the rape of his fiance in a hotel down south Only, pressure from the British government brought in a prosecution. It was yet another PS Chairman who threw a party on reaching the milestone of raping his 100th victim.
Gammanpila who offers a bouquet to Gota for eliminating the underworld in the city cannot be unaware that the targets were carefully chosen, so that, only those supportive of an Opposition political party were in the crosshairs of the executioners.

JAT pioneers building specifiers conference 2017
JAT was one of the Title Sponsors of the Building Specifiers Conference 2017 held recently at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel in Colombo.
The conference gave construction professionals and policy makers a platform for valuable discussion on the importance of specifications and their implementation.
The objective behind this event was to bring forth the points of view of all experts including specifiers with respect to the need for the right specifications to ensure quality buildings in Sri Lanka.
The Building Specifiers Conference was inaugurated by the eminent personalities of the construction industry such as Dr. Michael E. Joachim, Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA); Deshabandu Archt. / Plnr Dr. Surath Wickramasinghe, President, Chamber of Construction Industry; Vidyajyothi Prof. Damian Norbert Lakshman Alwis, Founder Chairman, Design Consortium; Past President Archt. Prof Chitra Weddikkara, Dean Colombo School of Construction Technology; Ranjith Gunathilake, Managing Director, Sanken Construction (Pvt) Ltd; Architect Bernard Gomez, Principal Architect, Bernard Gomez Architects; Architect Channa Daswatte, MICD Associates; S.S.P. Rathnayake, Director General, UDA; Mahinda Jinasena, Chairman (IDB).
We, at JAT were honoured to be the title sponsor of this well-timed initiative to elevate the Sri Lankan construction industry to world class standards.
I was personally pleased that when I discussed the necessity of this project with Prof. Chithra Weddikara and Prem Anveshi, they agreed and took this idea and made it a reality. Correct specifications can make or break a project.
This is especially so in an environment like in Sri Lanka where the industry is flooded with many inferior alternatives.
The availability of good and accurate specifications will act as a powerful tool to architects, designers and clients to ensure a superior and timely project delivery, said Aelian Gunawardane, Managing Director, JAT Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.
The conference concluded on a successful note having provided a much-needed impetus for those involved in the mainstream work of ensuring the development and futuristic growth of Sri Lanka.

Gunewardne said the joint opposition had told the Central Bank Governor during the recent meeting that one cannot be satisfied with the measures taken to probe the Bond issue.
He noted that there was an impending economic crisis due to the imprudent management of the economy and questioned what the government has done to avert the crisis.
The government should come up with answers to these issues.
The people deserves to know the truth and Parliament is the best forum to discuss them, he added.
He said the JO will call for the removal of the Finance Minister as his conduct and performance so far has not been satisfactory.

## Title: Kalutara tragedy due to security lapse

Kalutara tragedy due to security lapse
The Kalutara tragedy that cost the lives of several suspects and two prison officers posed several questions which should gain the attention of relevant authorities.
It posed the question as to whether proper procedure was adopted in transporting suspects who had threats to their lives, adequate security was provided for their protection and the vehicle and officers had proper safety measures, stated a group of aggrieved prison officers in an open letter issued yesterday.
Following is the letter:
Although we never had an intention to write a letter of this nature relating to our institution or matters connected to it, we were compelled to write this with the motive of creating awareness among the people about the actions of groups who failed to prevent a tragedy of this nature due to negligence, without causing any prejudice to the investigations or disrespect to the law.
Earlier too there were two failed murder attempts on this suspect. There was a shooting incident targeting this suspect in the Kaduwela Magistrate Courts complex and another opposite the Welikada Prison which injured a woman.
When the superintendent of the Kalutara Prison and the Chief Jailer were aware of these previous incidents, it is questionable as to why they disregarded it and failed to take necessary steps to obtain police protection which was required, knowing that there was no police protection deployed for their officers on duty with the impending danger and proper advise and whether proper action was taken by the armed officers in keeping with the advise given to them.
The action taken by the previous Chief Jailer in transporting suspects of this nature was to transport them to the express-way with security provided by two groups, armed police in uniform and in civilian dress (mufti). Why wasnt this practice adopted in this instance
The other question is whether instructions were obtained regarding the transport of this suspect on the day pprior to the incident from the Commissioner of Prisons or the Commissioner General of Prisons either on telephone or in writing.
The next question in why the Special Court situated within the prison itself is not used for legal action regarding these suspects, when noted persons of this nature and those with death threats are transported the procedure to be adopted was to inform the Court, Prison Headquarters and the Ministry and seek necessary advice and obtain adequate police protection. If police protection is not supplied the Court should be informed and necessary advice obtained.
Earlier when security was provided to suspects of this nature or prisoners, the prison administration used to transport them during times unexpected by people or at random. The transport of the underworld character known as Wambotta from the Colombo Remand prison to the Tangalle Court could be cited as one such example. Similarly the underworld member nicknamed Prince Column was provided security in this manner.
Although decisions regarding the protection of these type of persons should be taken after directly consulting higher officers in the police and Judges of Courts of Justice, certain higher officers are reluctant do so due to their lack of fluency in English.
Due to these reasons the people who ultimately have to pay with their lives are the innocent officers who had to look after their families and children. Although the void created in the families by their demise cannot be erased by paying compensation, steps can be taken to prevent incidents of this nature in future.
In order to prevent incidents of this nature in future
1. Our officers in the Prisons Department engage in prisoner transport service without wearing body armour or bullet proof helmets. These equipment can be used for along periods according to the manner they are maintained and used. The question is why these equipment were not provided to the officers who engage in duty, leaving their lives at stake.
2. Leyland buses with wire mesh netting are provided for the transport of prisoners. The so called safety of these buses need not be described to the public who travel in them daily. Therefore the government should take steps to provide armoured vehicles which are the world accepted vehicles used for prisoner transport moving away from the protection of the four plates of the Leyland buses equipped with wire mesh. Urgent steps should be taken to obtain armoured vehicles with bullet proof shutters. This was not only a right of the officers on duty but detainees as well.
3. Finally killing of prisoners or suspects cannot be considered as trivial for several reasons. That is because it amounts to illegal homicide, obstructs administration of evidence and gives an opportunity for another group of criminals to escape from the law. This may be the target of these escaping criminals.

Keep the greeen
Architecture benefits mental and physical health. The ingenious creation of spaces to kindle the mind and energize the body is the responsibility of the architect and in todays world not only does he have a duty to provide the best to his client but also he must be mindful of the city as a whole such as the creation of vertical gardens. Arch World features Archt. Pradeep Fernando to discuss the environmental sustainability.
It is a challenge to the architect creating different moods through his skill -not making stereotypical designs, but giving it a sense of place. On a gloomy or sunny day you have a sense of equanimity. You enjoy life, your feelings are awakened. You are comfortable at all times of the day perceiving nature and its facets, said Fernando.
The value of preserving trees cannot be over emphasized. Good architecture ensures that you are visually connected to nature through the change of colors in the sky and the movements of the birds. You get to enjoy the changes in the weather. That is the composition of the volumes, materials, textures and indoor atmosphere, because the outdoor directly influences the indoor. It creates a perception of space.
Trees give a lot of visual pleasure and a lot of comfort. Sometimes we live in a polluted environment. Fumes coming from vehicles. Between the road and the front garden why not grow some big trees The trees are able to absorb the toxic air. The trees also provide shade. If you take Wellawatte, it has developed in a very ad hoc manner. Too many unplanned buildings. In the day time it is difficult to walk because of the heat. There is no vegetation. It has become a concrete jungle unlike the time when we were kids, it was a very residential area. Now it is not properly designed and it is like vertical slums. It is not very conducive for human living, explained Fernando
So foliage and gardens make a big difference. In the past you get these sparrows that visited your garden but now they are not to be seen. Their music and sounds made living a pleasure.
Trees cut down your heat, purifying the air and creating a canopy. Even if you are in a small garden you can select the right tree, mentioned before in the previous article - Karapincha. How about even a citrus tree This can retard the ambient temperature. It helps enhance the environmental quality and the atmosphere. It also gives you visual pleasure, pointed out Fernando
In his designs Fernando tries to preserve trees as much as possible and orient the building in such a way.
My theory is that if you cut down one tree you should grow another five trees. To cut off a tree it only takes a few hours or minutes, but to grow one, it takes years. We as architects should be very responsive to global warming. Environmental pollution is a very serious issue. In some small way everybody can contribute. In your little garden space you can grow things that will enhance the environmental quality, added Fernando
Sometimes in a little space you can have vertical gardens. Not only does it enhance your living space, it contributes to the well- being of the city. The development must go hand in hand with the environmental quality. In fact many cities are now looking to go vertical and grow gardens atop buildings.

Lanka can pass through GSP + test in EU - Ambassador
Sri Lanka can pass through to get the General System of Preferences Plus (GSP) concession once again, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tung Lai-Margue said.
Speaking at the seminar titled EU Trade Policy  Opportunities for Sri Lanka organised by the European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL) in partnership with the Delegation of the European Union (EU), and the Shippers Academy he said that he is confident that Sri Lanka would regain the GSP Plus again.
Lankas export sector benefitted as a result, until the concession was withdrawn in August 2010, amid allegations of rights abuses during the end of the LTTE war.
The Unity Government in June 2016 formally applied for GSP+ after months of discussions and action on the ground. In 2000, Sri Lanka exported 34% of its GDP, but by 2014 end, exports had fallen to 14%.
He said since the application was made, tangible results are being seen.
The proposal form forwarded to the European Commission has now reached a critical and final stage. Its now up to the European Parliament to uphold this request, he said.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said Sri Lanka is on course to receive this concession as the Unity government has won the confidence of the EU once again. Things are
positive and moving forward.
We hope that European Council and parliament will not object to the recommendations made by European Commission in order to reinstate this facility.
He said there had never been any unreasonable conditions whatsoever. He also said that whatever the opposition said that they have delivered and kept their promises made to Parliament.
We are paying back heavy debt incurred by the previous government and we are paying for their sins.
The Minister said they have to rebalance the incentive structure to boost the tradable sector.
This will see people who have capital putting the money where it brings return on their investment.We have completely ignored the tradable sector in this country. We have to incentivise the capital flowing into the tradable sector.
The seminar also focused on the EUs ongoing and planned FTAs with other countries in the region.
The seminar coincided with a visit by over 50 EU officials from Brussels and the Asian region that will be in Sri Lanka to attend an internal trade coordination meeting.

Medical Faculty Graduating batch of 1967: Celebrating 50 years as Medical Doctors
Batch reunion is from March 3 - 5 at the Jetwing Blue Hotel, Negombo
On June 4, 1962, a total of 158 young men and women, who secured admission to the University of Ceylon to pursue a career in medicine, entered the portals of the great institute of learning  the Faculty of Medicine, Colombo.
We gained entry purely on merit, on the performance at the Advanced Level Examination. There were students from across the island from Chilaw to Batticaloa, from Point Pedro, Chunnakam, Tellipalai to Galle, from Pannipitiya to Matale.
We had to face a Vive Voce Examination conducted by the Faculty in Colombo. Students were allocated to Medicine, Dental Surgery or Veterinary Science depending on the overall performance. I remember being questioned on subjects ranging from space travel to Beri Beri!
Of the many distinguished teachers we had, only Prof. Priyani Soysa and Prof. Carlo Fonseka are still with us. We were the first batch that Prof. Carlo Fonseka taught on his return to Sri Lanka after obtaining his Doctorate.
Multi- talented batch
It is noteworthy that our batch was mutli- talented. There were several outstanding sportsmen. Ace Spin Bowler Thomian Lareef Idroos and Benedictine Cyril Ernest, played for the National Cricket Team. Royalists Harsha Samarajiva and Kiththa Wimalaratne were well-known school boy cricketers. They were all members of the University of Ceylon Cricket Team that won the P Saravanmuttu Trophy in 1962-1963 V Kunasingham played in the University Hockey team and represented Sri Lanka in Hockey as Goal Keeper. Royalist J. C. Fernando a champion Public School Athlete, Ranjan Wattegedara a National Tennis Champion and Sidath Jayanetti an outstanding Rugby player in the University Team. Virginia de Vos a champion swimmer.
There were those who excelled in the field of Fine Arts. Sushila Thiyagarajah an exponent of Bharathanatyam who had presented her Aragentram, Sujatha Lena a member of the famous Heen Baba Troupe. Rohini Anandarajah a graceful North Indian Manipuri dancer and Primrose Wijewardane a Sinhala Radio Artiste with several recordings to her credit.
We were unique in that we were the first batch with a parallel batch in Peradeniya, there being only one Faculty of Medicine, in Colombo up to 1962. Our batch increased in numbers with passing years, reaching a total of 168 by 1964 due to 10 students joining the batch from the Peradeniya Faculty.
Having a parallel in Peradeniya resulted in our batch being cautioned that post-intern employment in the Health Department could not be guaranteed. This caused an exodus of many of our batchmates to seek employment abroad.

NDB Wealth focuses on  International Women's Day
With International Women's Day only a few days away, the time to 'Be Bold For Change'. What better way to take that big leap towards ultimate financial freedom and parity than finally taking charge of your own financial future.
"Since 2017's theme for International Women's Day is Be Bold For a Change the boldest step you can take as a woman is undoubtedly securing your own financial future. So, empower yourself by actively taking control of your financial planning", advised Christina Wesley, a financial adviser with NDB Wealth.
In fact, the need for smart financial planning is even more relevant today despite woman now enjoying a greater degree of hard-won independence. This is because of the lack of corresponding parity in terms of earnings, savings, which means that true financial freedom is still an elusive ideal.
However, one way to circumvent the many obstacles faced by women, such as lack of equal pay, or having to spend fewer hours at work because of taking care of children or having to take maternity leave, is to effectively utilize financial planning tools to not just accumulate savings but actually use them to generate a greater degree of sustainable wealth over the short and long term.
Wesley, "Sri Lankan women also have to confront the troubling reality that, while they typically have longer lifespans than men, with an average life expectancy of 77 years, they are often paid a lower wage than men.

New Constitution along with referendum : Rajitha
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, said the government would proceed with a new Constitution along with a referendum, keeping to its mandate.
The government has not changed its policy. We want a Constitution which would abolish the Executive Presidency and introduce a new electoral system, Minister Senaratne said, addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department.
He insisted that the Constitutional making process had not stalled, but was going ahead as planned. Various political parties are studying various reports. We will then submit a draft to Parliament, he said.
The SLFP in the meantime, has said that it would not support a referendum and that it would be better to go for an amended Constitution rather than a new one.
Despite these contradictions within the two main parties in the government, Senaratne stressed that the government would go ahead with the referendum, Only certain people in the SLFP did not want it and they were not with the President when he came to power. We have given certain promises in our manifesto and we will keep to it, he said.

## Title: Next chapter with Weerawansa

Next chapter with Weerawansa
Wimal Weerawansa, the indefatigable leader of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) is back in the limelight even though he is languishing in remand prison, announcing that his party is leaving the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the coalition from which it contested the August 2015 general election.
The announcement is seen as a strategic ploy by Weerawansa to test the political waters as well as to garner some publicity for his party. It is in no way to be interpreted as a parting of ways between the JNP and the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the UPFA. In fact, it is aimed at strengthening the JO.
Difficult to keep out of the headlines
Whatever his faults, even his harshest critics would concede that Wimal Weerawansa is difficult to keep out of the headlines for long. On that score, he operates on much the same principle as former Minister and maverick extraordinaire, Mervyn Silva: that any publicity is good publicity. Skilled at producing racy rhetoric at will, Weerawansa has revelled in controversy even when he was reviled as a result of it.
Hailing from Kalutara, Weerasangilige Wimal Weerawansa began his political journey in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). He first attracted attention as a journalist, writing under the pen name of Wimalasiri Gamlath.
Weerawansas initial forays into politics met with only limited success. As a 29 -year-old young man he contested the general elections in 1994 from the Colombo district but was defeated, polling a paltry 300 votes. He was first elected to public office three years later, being elected to the Colombo Municipal Council from the JVP. Then, though unsuccessful at the provincial council elections in 1999, he was chosen by his party as an appointed member to the Western Provincial Council.
Weerawansas big break came in 2000. He was elected as a Member of Parliament on the strength of the nearly eight per cent of the vote polled by the JVP in the Colombo district. The number of preference votes polled by Weerawansa was an unimpressive 13,000 in an electorate of more than one million people. Since then, Weerawansa has been in Parliament for the past seventeen years and has maintained an increasingly high profile.
In 2004, then President Chandrika Kumaratunga formed a probationary government with the JVP. Four JVP parliamentarians - Anura Kumara Dissanayake, K.D. Lalkantha, Vijitha Herath and Chandradasa Wijesinghe - were offered ministerial portfolios and four others-Bimal Ratnayake, Samantha Vidyaratna, Sunil Handunetti and Nihal Galappathi- were appointed deputy ministers but Weerawansa was not among them.
Perhaps it was the realisation that, despite Weerawansas undisputed value as a much sought after public speaker, he was low in the pecking order within the JVP that prompted him to chart his own political course. Shortly afterwards, in 2005, Weerawansa launched the Patriotic National Movement. As its general secretary, he shrewdly projected himself as a champion of the majority community at a time when the war against the Liberation Tigers of Eelam (LTTE) was raging in its full intensity.
It was in the same year that Mahinda Rajapaksa launched his bid for the Presidency and Weerawansas pro-Sinhala nationalist ideology had a close resonance to Rajapaksas own campaign slogans. The JVP had endorsed Rajapaksas candidacy and Weerawansa emerged as one of Rajapaksas main platform orators. It was a partnership that was to be quite productive for Weerawansa in the years that followed.
By 2008, the mainstream JVP was having serious differences of opinion and disagreements with Rajapaksas style of government although they still supported his war effort against the LTTE in principle. Weerawansa meanwhile was increasingly aligning himself closely with Rajapaksa.
Hunger strike
Their inevitable separation led to the birth of the JNP in 2008, with Weerawansa as its leader. The JNP joined the UPFA government in December 2008. Weerawansa was re-elected to Parliament at the 2010 general election and was appointed Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities by Rajapaksa.
Never shy of being in the limelight, Weerawansa gained international notoriety as a maverick in July 2010 when he staged a hunger strike outside the United Nations office in Colombo to protest against the appointment of the Panel of Experts for alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka by the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki Moon.
Despite promising to fast unto death Weerawansas hunger strike lasted less than three days. He tamely ended the protest after Rajapaksa visited him and requested him to call off the fast, offering him a glass of water. Many saw this as a publicity stunt by Weerawansa to cultivate his image as a patriot.
Weerawansa held his ministerial portfolio until Rajapaksas defeat in January 2015. Since then, he has had mixed fortunes. He was returned to Parliament at the August 2015 general elections, heading the UPFA preference list with over 300,000 votes, over 100,000 more than the second placed Udaya Gammanpila. However, he was also slapped with several charges and is now in remand prison.
Among the accusations levelled against Weerawansa are that he misused government vehicles and that he abused his position as Housing Minister to distribute houses to close associates at prices well below their market value. He has also been investigated regarding discrepancies in his passport.
It is on the charge that he misused over 40 government vehicles that Weerawansa is being held in remand prison. At the last court hearing, he was re-remanded until March 6. Weerawansas wife, Shashi, is also currently under investigation.
As Wimal Weerawansa struggles to survive in this political maelstrom, the JNP and the JO are strategising together to recalibrate the balance of power in Parliament to try and create a breakthrough for Mahinda Rajapaksa to regain control of the SLFP.
When the JO initially identified itself as a distinct entity in Parliament in February last year, it requested recognition as the main opposition party. They even demanded the position of Leader of the Opposition. After giving due consideration to these requests, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya declined such recognition.
This was on the basis that, even though the JO numerically constituted the largest political group opposed to the government, they were elected on the UPFA ticket and the UPFA was part and parcel of the National Unity government. As such, Speaker Jayasuriya reasoned, UPFA parliamentarians couldnt be afforded the luxury of having one of their own as Leader of the Opposition, while some of them were enjoying the privileges of government as Cabinet ministers.
Smaller parties
The Speakers ruling made sense of a challenging situation. Had he granted the JOs request, all of the smaller parties within political alliances would have requested to be identified as separate entities, opening the floodgates for a plethora of party leaders in Parliament demanding their attendant privileges in terms of allocation of time during debates. This would have made normal business in Parliament very difficult.
Apart from the motive of annexing more parliamentary privileges, Weerawansas decision to withdraw the JNP from the UPFA is also aimed at emasculating the latter. This could well be the first step in a grand scheme where other constituent parties such as the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, the Communist Party and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party all withdraw from the UPFA, leaving the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) remaining in the Alliance. Whether this is a politically astute move is a moot point. It is no secret that while the UPFA projects itself as a broad coalition of parties with like-minded ideologies, the vast majority of its support base is derived from the SLFP. Even if the UPFA is shorn of its allies, as long as it retains the support base of the SLFP, it will be a force to reckon with.
The other conceivable reason for the JNP leaving the UPFA is to enable it to formally join ranks with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the fledgling party now headed by Rajapaksa loyalist G. L. Peiris, the former minister who has held many a portfolio.
The strategy appears to be to recreate a mirror UPFA within the SLPP, sans the encumbrances of the original UPFA, the legal office-bearers of which are still loyalists of President Maithripala Sirisena. The SLPP is of course a front political party for Rajapaksa to launch his bid to return to power.
Wimal Weerawansa might be in prison and the JNP may have left the UPFA but it is certain that this isnt the last we hear of this move. It is but a first step in a different direction, a path which is a political gamble both for Weerawansa as well as the Joint Opposition- a gamble on which it is very difficult to place a bet on.

Doctors attached to state hospitals in the Northern Province will launch a strike today from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon to protest against the SAITM `medical faculty', Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said in a statement.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the strike will be extended if the doctors of the branches of the GMOA decide to do so. This is the seventh phase of the series of strikes launched by the GMOA in all nine provinces.
Dr. Zoysa said several protests in the forms of rallies, conferences and hand-out distribution will take place on the same day with the participation of all anti SAITM movements. No step has been taken by the authorities to solve the SAITM issue and prevent people from undergoing various difficulties.
Dr. Zoysa said the GMOA is doing this to safeguard people's lives and not for the benefit of doctors.

OMP sans any interference: Amendments introduced to the Act
The government will set up the Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) without any international interference, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday, as Cabinet approved amendments to the OMP Act to delete paragraph (a) of Section 11 of the Act.
The minister was addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Department of Government Information.
The section authorised the Office to enter into agreements with an individual or an organisation in performing its tasks.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sought Cabinet approval to have the Legal Draftsman and Attorney General have a look at preparing amendments which would do away with the troublesome section.
The Prime Minister in his proposal this week also pointed out that JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake had also proposed that paragraph (a) of Section 11 which allows it to enter into agreements with any person or organisation be removed.
The amendments are expected to be submitted to Parliament soon for approval. The international community and the Tamil National Alliance in the meantime has called for international involvement in the process in order to ensure its credibility and effectiveness.

Oracle, Mastercard to deliver seamless payments
Mastercard announced a global partnership with Oracle that is designed to deliver a streamlined digital payment experience to the retail and hospitality industries at the Mobile World Congress.
The partnership will initially focus on three needs for restaurants, hotels and retail stores:
* In-Store Experience  Oracle and Mastercard will partner to develop and scale enhanced in-store payment experiences including Qkr! with Masterpass. This is a mobile app that enables consumers to seamlessly order and pay for goods and services via their smart phone without having to wait in line or for a restaurant server. This integration will make transactions simple, convenient and secure and remove friction for the customer.

* Operational Efficiencies  Rather than develop and implement separate payments solutions for their in-store and online operations, retailers can benefit from a fully-integrated digital payment and fraud prevention offering through Mastercard Payment Gateway Services.

* Cross-Channel Consistency  The integration of Masterpass, the digital payment service from Mastercard, into Oracle products allows retailers to provide a seamless check-out experience across different channels.
Mastercard and Oracle are already working with joint partners such as wagamama, Carluccios, Young and Co.s Brewery and Geronimo Pubs.They are using Qkr to let their customers order additional items during meals, pay at the table when they are ready and split the bill with others.
In 2017, Mastercard will expand the Qkr platform to six additional markets  Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and the United States  to seamlessly pay for fees, supplies and excursions at schools, and make payments at gas stations, parking, sports arenas, and unattended retail such as vending machines.
Commenting on the announcement, Chris Fendley, SVP Merchant Development, Mastercard, said, With close to 80 percent of consumers using technology at some point along their shopping journey, Mastercard is committed to unlocking omni-channel commerce for every device and delivering convenient experiences to users at-home, in-stores and on-the-go. Building on the success of our joint initiatives with Oracle in the UK, we can help retailers and hospitality providers connect with their customers in more engaging ways while enabling them to grow their businesses with scale, speed and security.

Palaniswamis statement draws heavy flak from SLFP Youth Front
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) yesterday condemned Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswamis statement that he would support for a separate independent state for Tamils in Sri Lanka, SLFPYF President Shantha Bandara said yesterday.
We urge him not to interfere in the affairs of other countries, but to uplift the poor people in Tamil Nadu, Bandara said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said that new the Chief Minister should at least solve the toilet problem of those people. We condemn his statement which has been made at a time when all communities in Sri Lanka are moving towards reconciliation.
Both Chief Ministers in Tamil Nadu and the Northern Province are engaged in promoting separatism without solving the problems of the innocent Tamil people. The Northern Chief Minister is also retuning moneys granted by the Treasury without using them for the benefit of the people in the North. Today, the Tamil Diaspora is unable to raise funds with reconciliation efforts underway. This has led them to create unnecessary problem in the country, the SLFPYF President said.
We have invited all Joint Opposition (JO) members including its patron former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to participate in the SLFP Executive Committee and the SLFP All Island Working Committee under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena to be held today. Only those qualified can participate in these Committee meetings and We invite JO members to come and discuss their problems, he said.
We remember the damage caused by various factions to the party after the 1977 defeat of SLFP. That is why our President always invites all factions to join with the SLFP and strengthen the party. Even if they are against the national unity government, they can still work towards the strengthening of the party.We also appeal that the youth representation be increased up to 50 percent for the next Local Government election, he said.

Pilot project to enhance oversight and financial discipline of 5 SOEs
The government has introduced a pilot project to make its State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) more self-sufficient in preparation for the IMF chiefs visit to the island later this month.
Statements of Corporate Intent (SCI) are to be introduced to five State Owned Business Enterprises (SOEs) in a bid to enhancing oversight and financial discipline of SOEs, according to a proposal approved by Cabinet this week.
The five chosen for this pilot project are the Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Airport and Aviation Services and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Effective SOEs have been a major concern of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when it granted the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD 1.5 billion to Sri Lanka in June 2016. This will be disbursed in half-yearly tranches of USD 162 million over three years depending on evidence of the governments economic performance.

Public platform on input data: Pucsl calls for public comments
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, seeks public comments on the input data parameters and assumptions of the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037 submitted by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). LCLTGEP of CEB is prepared based on the input data.
This is the first time that we are opening the platform for public comments on the input data which will be used to develop the long term generation expansion plan. The comments on the fuel prices, social damage cost, cost and other parameters used to model renewable energy technologies and other conventional generation plants will be taken very seriously in our approval process of the plan, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe, said.
We hope to increase the transparency of the approval process through this measure and increase the public participation in the decision making process of Sri Lankas most important energy generation plan, he said.
Sri Lanka plans to generate 15,160 Gwh of electricity in 2017 with a peak demand of 2,585 MW, the base case forecast data shows. The electricity generation forecast for 2042 is shown as 49,121 Gwh with a peak demand of 7,784 MW. The generation demand is expected to grow 5.9 percent per annum during 2018-2022 while in addition the peak demand is expected to grow at 5.1 percent per annum.
The input data specifies the demand forecast, reliability criteria, economic parameters, fuel prices, cost and other parameters that use to model new generation technologies, to identify and develop the least cost generation plant mix in accordance with the government policy and Least Cost Generation Expansion Planing Code by PUCSL.
The input data will be fed to the generation planning software, a model that permits the user to find an optimal expansion plan for a power generating system over a long period and within the constraints defined by the planner.
The Loss of Load Probability, the parameter which identifies the percentage that may leave a power system with insufficient capacity to meet demand, is considered as maximum 1.5 percent during the planning period.
Reserve margin, (capacity minus demand) /demand), the parameter which shows the ratio
between the excess capacity availability and the demand, is considered within the maximum of 20 percent and a minimum of 2.5 percent for the 2018-37 LCLTGEP.
The input data said that the Social Damage Cost, the environmental impact and the impact to society by the generation of electricity, will be determined using a break-even analysis with comparison to latest available studies.
Under Economic Parameters, An economic discount rate of 10 percent will be used as a base rate for discounted cash flow analysis related to all analyses and for calculating the net present value of all alternatives to the Base Case.
The value of un-served energy, the economic cost to the country by not delivering energy expectation, is considered in the economic analysis to develop the Plan and the value of un-served energy for the first submission of the Plan (in 2011) stood at 0.50 USD/kWh is now at 0.663 USD/kWh.
Sri Lanka has 08 thermal power plants owned by the CEB with the capacity of 1,506.7 MW, operated using auto diesel, residual oil, furnace oil, naphtha and coal and input data shows that three committed thermal power plants with the capacity of 505 MW, which use natural gas, furnace oil and auto diesel for operation will be added.
The existing independent power producers generate 652 MW of electricity in Sri Lanka, the data shows. 16 hydro power plants are existing in Sri Lanka with the capacity of 1388 MW and the data shows 03 hydro power plants with the capacity of 182.2 MW are committed to be operated during the period of 2019-2022

Ragging in the university system: A collective mental disorder
Fifteen university students were arrested last week (Feb. 20) for ragging 8 juniors. A torture chamber was discovered in an abandoned house: But the problem of ragging is by no means a new one, and neither are these isolated incidents.
Many parties over the past several decades, including the university authorities, have grappled with the problem of ragging, in numerous ways: But even while there is a common acceptance that ragging is wrong, none have been able to formulate a lasting solution to this recurring problem.
As a result, thousands of new entrants to state universities are harassed, bullied and abused by their seniors. Some of them sustained physical injuries, some ended up with severe depression, some bid adieu to their tertiary education, and some, even lost their lives:
Rupa Rathnaseeli was a young fresher at the Peradeniya Universitys Faculty of Agriculture in 1975, when she jumped off the second floor of the Ramanathan Building and sustained severe physical injuries. It was later revealed that Rupa jumped to escape ragging that entailed inserting an object into her vagina.
Rathnaseeli was critically injured in the escape attempt and spent the rest of days in a wheelchair. Rupa, a young girl in perfectly normal mental health until then, committed suicide in 1997, marking the existence of serious and unresolved dark side to Sri Lankas university system.
Ovitigala Vithanage Samantha was a third-year student at the University of Sri Jayewardenepuras Management Faculty, who pioneered the anti-ragging campaign at the university. O. V. Samantha was brutally killed on 7 November 2002 by a mob of around 200 JVP supporters.
The JVP supporters, armed with clubs and stones had stormed into a room in which a discussion on the practice of ragging was being held, and viciously attacked Vithanage and others in the room. Pro-ragging students had also blocked the vehicle carrying the injured to the hospital, delaying proper medical treatment.
O. V. Samantha Vithanage who had sustained heavy injuries to his head, died two days later. His death is a landmark incident in the anti-ragging movement of Sri Lankan universities that provoked many students and academic staff of universities to act against ragging.
These incidents are but only the tip of the iceberg, but they were a clear manifestation of the brutality involved in the raging issue. Unlike Rathnaseeli and Samantha, many students underwent the trauma silently, as they didnt have the gumption to resist those who engaged in ragging.
Political ties
Ragging is linked to politicized student bodies  such as the Inter University Students Federation  that operate within the tertiary education sector. It is used as a device to sift through and absorb tough members into a highly politicized university culture that perpetuates the ideologues espoused by these bodies.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna held sway over the Inter-University Students Federation for many years. Some prominent JVP parliamentarians including its current leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, parliamentarians Sunil Handunetti and Bimal Ratnayake were stalwarts of the Inter University Students Federation in the early 90s.
They are well aware of the inner workings of the organisation and the unacceptable methods used to absorb new members into the membership. After the JVPs split in 2012, the breakaway party  The Frontline Socialist Party  consolidated their position in the IUSF.
Former IUSF seniors, Chameera Koswatte and Duminda Nagamuwa, became leading figures of the FLSP and the student body began toeing the breakaway partys agenda: But the same methods they used to attract new members continued despite these internal changes in the students organisation.
It is for this reason that the political parties both overtly and covertly back these student bodies cannot be excused from culpability in this crime. It is precisely because of political involvement that this barbaric tradition perpetuates from generation to generation, despite resistance from the public at large, and many other parties pushing for reforms.
Sadistic tendencies
While it is clear that political agendas contribute to ragging at state universities, it is also manifestly clear that unequal power structures create an environment in which a psychological illness  sadism  the desire to inflict pain, or humiliation on another, is manifest.
Freshers or first year students at the various universities are relatively young, disoriented and unprepared for the social aspects of higher studies and the power, or perceived power held over the first-year students by their seniors lead to a sadistic abuse of power.
The oft-quoted Stanford Prison Experiment, by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo in 1971, found that both situational and dispositional attributes led to an abuse of power.
His experiment, an investigation into the psychological effects of perceived power was centered on the struggle between prisoners and prison guards. Zimbardo and his team handpicked 24 males  12 of whom were assigned the role of prisoner, while the 12 others were assigned the role of guards.
The experiment was designed to induce disorientation, depersonalization, and de-individuation in the participants  a reflection of the situation many of the freshers or juniors find themselves in as new entrants to the state university system.
The guards in Zimbardos experiment were asked to inflict punishment on the prisoners  with the exception of bodily harm and withholding of food and drink. Zimbardo notes that with time, the roles were internalized by both the prisoners and the guards, with the prisoners becoming increasingly submissive and the guards, increasingly cruel.
Zimbardo notes that approximately one-third of the guards exhibited genuine sadistic tendencies and that most of the guards were upset when the experiment concluded after only six days. His experiment has been used and re-used, to illustrate the power of authority.
Zimbardos experiment, which was planned for two weeks, was discontinued after an independent observer objected to the morality of the experiment and the conditions within which the prisoners were being held, which Zimbardo himself noted as having deteriorated rapidly.
While ragging is clearly a criminal offence, there has been no authority willing or able to wade in and object to the manner in which seniors in the university system exercise and exert their authority over juniors.
While juniors have every right to complaint against the abuse and lodge police complaints against the perpetrators who subject them to this verbal, emotional and physical abuse, fear forces new entrants into silent submission.
Students ad infinitum endure the abuse for fear they will lose their chance at higher education, and so the system perpetuates infinitely, spurred on by a combination of disorientation, fear, political meddling, sadism and a lack of authority at the highest levels to curb this crime.
Top-level intervention
It is clear that the time is ripe for top-level intervention to eradicate the scourge of ragging and restore sanity to state universities: It is with this in mind that President Sirisena has instructed Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara to adopt a comprehensive framework to eliminate ragging from state universities.
However, bringing the culture of ragging to an end through Police intervention will not be an easy task: Not only have previous efforts failed, but even attempts to set up temporary Police posts in certain universities to prevent clashes was vehemently opposed by university students, heady on independence.
This is why the government must enter into a dialogue with university heads and the law enforcement bodies on sustainable ways of addressing this problem: A comprehensive programme to enlighten new university entrants on their basic rights and to encourage them to seek the assistance in an event of ragging must be organized and implemented.
The University Grants Commission, last week launched a new service on its website in an attempt to curb ragging. The online form encourages students being bullied, harassed or ragged to report the incident and promises recompense.
The UGC said complaints lodged on its website will be investigated by university authorities, who will also offer counseling and support.
It said Vice-Chancellors, Senior Student Counselors, Deans, Heads of Department, and the staff of the Gender Equity Centre would be responsible for responding to complaints, and warned against false complaints  saying those students would face disciplinary action.
While these attempts must be lauded  and indeed they are, sporadic responses to isolated incidence will not achieve favorable outcomes: Instead university officials, with the state intervention at the highest level, must clamp down on ragging within the university system and apply sustained pressure to ending the cycle of abuse.
Miscreants must be punished: Ejection from the university system ought to serve as a strong deterrent. Students must be told that any student engaging in physical, verbal, emotional or any other form of abuse, or outright ragging, will be punished with dismissal from the university.
Although the road will be long and arduous, if university authorities, with the backing of the state, enforce ejection from the university system as punishment for ragging, the cyclic rote of abuse can be stamped out and put to a final end.

Cabinet this week allocated Rs.10.1 million to compensate 16 out of the 27 deceased prisoners and 20 injured prison officials in the shooting which took place within Welikada prison in 2012.
The riot within the prison occurred when around 300 commandos from the Special Task Force entered the Welikada Prison to assist Prison officials in searching for illegal weapons, drugs and mobile phones stored within prison.
Ensuing clashes between the officials and the prisoners thereafter led to many being brutally killed or injured.
Cabinet this week approved the compensation based on recommendations made by a committee appointed to look into the shooting which occurred in November 2012. The report was submitted to the Minister of Justice, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on June 9, 2015.
The remaining 11 were not recommended to be compensated as they died while trying to escape prison.
The Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (Rehabilitation Authority) is to implement the compensation process, according to Minister of Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms, D.M. Swaminathan who submitted the cabinet paper for approval.
Under current regulations; deceased persons receive a maximum of Rs 100,000 while an injured person is given a maximum amount of Rs 50,000 but the committee has recommended that each deceased persons be allocated Rs 500,000 and injured Rs 100,000 given the gravity of the incident.This brings compensation to a total of Rs.10.1 million.

## Title: Sahabandu -the royal Royalist

Sahabandu -the royal Royalist
There is a secret he knew about Gram! He marked it a point to buy a packet of gram (kadalagottuwa) and instead of munching it, twirls, spins, cuts and seams the gram in his left hand which was his bowling arm walking home after cricket practice every day. Thats how he mastered his three-in-one bowling class. This is a story as recounted by one of his team mates, RajivaWijetunge the former Royal speed merchant and Nomads player.
That was DAYA SAHABANDU, the former Royal College, Sinhalese Sports Club, Nomads and Ceylons three way purpose bowler. He spun, seamed and swung many an opposing batsman to his demise with high class left arm bowling. He was the envy of many a bowler of his kind.
Showcasing his magic wares
Sahabandu was a simple and unassuming cricketer. But when he had the ball in his hand he was a destroyer. Sadly he was a bowler who like many brilliant cricketers shone in the pre Test era. He did not have many opportunities like the fortunate cricketers of today to play a surfeit of cricket now that the country is playing in the big leagues.
Before going on to say more about this genial gentleman just read his figures in Sara cricket which was the country's premier game. Played in this league for nearly 20 years - Matches 253 - Overs 6,552 - Maidens 1919 - Runs 14,787 - Wickets 1,048 - Avg 14.11 - 'GUINNESS BOOK' or 'WISDEN' could take.
He was indispensable and was a must in the Ceylon teams of that era. He had only six opportunities -playing in six unofficial Tests and showcasing his magic wares with the new and old ball with his stinging and biting deliveries. Although not having headline making figures which amazed many international visiting batsmen he was as big as life in his day. Captains such as Englands Colin Cowdrey, Tony Lewis, Mike Denness, Australias Bill Lawry and one of his ilk Bishen Singh Bedi and AjitWadekar of India spoke highly of Bandu as he was popularly known and compared him to that West Indian and England three way purpose bowling greats Garfield Sobers and Derek Underwood.
It is no exaggeration to say that had Sahabandu the fortune to showcase his bowling that he was fortunate to be born with and had the opportunity of paying a lot of international cricket he would have been an "International" of repute. I had the opportunity of facing him playing school cricket - he for Royal College and me for St.Benedicts College; and later when he donned Nomads colours and the writer for Saracens. I can vouch for his many varieties of deliveries that were more often than not wicket taking ones bemusing and baffling opposing batsmen, including myself.
He was a "three- in -one bowler" in the manner born. A must any captain will yearn to have in his lineup. He was no extrovert or had the pride of a Peacock, but was inexplicably an introvert who spoke little and let the ball in his hands do the wicket taking talking. We would yearn for the likes of a bowler of Sahabanduscaliber and class in modern day cricket. In today's cricketing scene he would have been in great demand in every form of cricket locally and internationally and pocketed millions in rupees and dollars.
'Last man' or 'night watchman'
Playing in the local scene and the Sara tournament, that was first class cricket for nearly two decades, he captured believe it or not over 1000 wickets. He would have to done a helluva lot of bowling to achieve this success and there is or will not emerge another bowler of his class, perseverance and dedication who could even have a sniff at the record. He had 10 wicket haul in a Gopalan Trophy game and five wickets against England.
Playing first class cricket for the SSC he did not meet with much success. Nomads turned his fortunes and it proved to be his happy hunting ground. He is greatly indebted to that former Ceylon batsman and Nomads captain marvel D.H.De Silva who spotted the uncut gem in Sahabandu. He polished it and with DHS guidance as captain instilled in him that it is sweat and toil that brings success. So he practiced and practiced and then luring batsmen to their demise came naturally for Sahabandu.
Sahabandu also says a very big thank you to former NCC, Leicestershire professional, Ceylon and Nomads all rounder Stanley Jayasinghe who taught him the tricks of the bowling trade. Be it bowling on the mat or turf, Sahabandu was unplayable. Oh for a Sahabandu in modern day cricket.
Meeting Sahabandu on his way to the public library where he goes everyday to scan the newspapers for news, the topic of conversation that emerged was cricket. He spoke in glowing terms of the countrys success in the World Cup and the Twenty20 World Cup.
Sahabandu in addition to his excellent bowling, had it in him to come in as 'last man' or 'nightwatchman' and stay put at the wicket. One such incident he remembers most is the unbroken last wicket stand that he was involved in with former Royal speed gun RajivaWijetunge in 1982 in a 'Sara' Trophy game for Nomads against Colts which deprived Colts of entering the final.
The pair stayed put at the wicket facing 36.5 overs with Wijetunge making 39 and Sahabandu 14. Nomads was captained by Patrick Van Dort. Patrick's son the tall left hander Michael has the honour of scoring a century at Lord's.
Not out
When asked what was the most exciting inter-school cricket match he played he promptly said it was the Royal-St.Benedicts game at Reid Avenue in 1960.That game saw controversial umpiring. The match was won by Royal and the crowd resorted to manhandling umpire Lappen!
Royal was captained by Michael Dias and SBC by the writer. A former Bens cricketer and keen Bens supporter Ben Antony who was involved in the fracas and the games that followed when an appeal was made against a Bens batsman Antony would shout what happened to Lappen will happen to you too much amusement and the umpire would promptly say not out.
The Sara Trophy game he remembers is the one between Nomads and Saracens at the ViharaMaha Devi Park. Nomads fielded a side studded with stars while Saracens had cricketers who could upset any side and upset the Nomads they did. That was a peculiar game because a rare incident occurred. With Saracens chasing victory and with Percy Perera and the writer at the wicket, Perera skied a ball off Sahabandu and AmreshRajaratnam who went for the catch had it in his hand but grassed it and kept clutching the ball suffering probably a black out.
We sought permission from umpire Allan Felsinger and ran about 7 singles till the ball was retrieved and in the penultimate over I hit Polonowita for 10 runs to achieve a famous victory and being chaired off the ground by the Saracens supporters. SomasunderamSkandakumar the present High Commissioner in Australia also played in that exciting game.
The teams and scores in that game for posterity: NOMAD - Dr.Sivanathan (C), A.C.M.Lafir, D.P.de Silva, Lionel Fernando, D.S.de Silva, RanjitDorenagama, T.B.Kehelgamuwa, AmreshRajaratnam, SomasunderamSkandakumar, AnuraPolonowita, and DayaSahabandu. SARACENS - H.M.M. Ally (C), Shanti Pieris, T.K.Palitha, Nihal Silva, B.N.Mahmood, Aubrey Kuruppu, Ralston Burke, Elmo Rodrigopulle, M.Naseem, Percy Perera and NihalSeneviratne.
Chief Scores of that unique game: NOMADS 167 (A.C>M Lafir 17,Sivanathan 33, Kehelgamuwa 16, R.Burke 4 for 53) and 168: SARACENS 233 ( T.K.Palitha 21, Nihalsilva 25, A. Kuruppu 11, R. Burke 46, E.Rodrigopulle 60, H.Ali 12, P.Perea 11, N.Senevirane 12) and 103 for 7).

Sancharaka Udawa begins on May 5
The seventh edition of Sancharaka Udawa will be held at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Center at BMICH on May 5 - 6, 2017.
This exhibition was first organized on a small scale seven years ago, by the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), with the intention of providing a platform to showcase products and services offered by the smaller stake holders in the tourism industry.
Though it has grown significantly over the years, the focus still remains the same and is still the only platform available to the small and medium service providers, from all regions, to exhibit and meet their buyers under one roof.
The success of the exhibition is amply displayed by the demand for stalls which currently stands at around 190 and growing. Last year Sancharaka Udawa had over 160 companies / individuals participating, with over 230 stalls at the exhibition grounds.
Exhibitors range from Boutique Hotels to Guest Houses to Camping Operators on the accommodation offerings, as well as adventure and activity service providers such as Safari Jeep Operators, rafting, canoeing and surfing operators from around the Island.
Due to the success of the seminars that were held last year during the exhibition on various topics related to the tourism industry, the organizers are planning to add several seminars to this years exhibition too.
These seminars will be open to all visitors free of charge. The primary focus of the seminars this year will be to give young school leavers and others interested in the field, an opportunity to learn more about the industry and explore the variety of career opportunities available to them within the industry. In 2016, Sancharaka Udawa had over 6000 visitors and the organizers believe that this year, the numbers will grow further.

Senior cadets arrested for taking nude pictures of juniors
Three senior students of a school in Pilawala attached to the school cadet troop were arrested by the Wattegama Police for allegedly stripping six members of the Cadet Contingent naked and taking video pictures of them on their mobile phones during training.
They attended a Cadet Training Camp at the Rantembe Cadet Training Centre recently. The arrest was made following a complaint made by the school principal on the Police hotline that the students were caught watching the nude pictures in school recently.
Since the filming had been allegedly done at the Rantembe Camp the suspect students have been handed over to the Hasalaka Police as the camp area comes under its area of authority. The suspect students were produced before the Mahiyangana Magistrate and released on Rs 100,000 personal bail each and ordered to appear in Court on July 3.

Sex and relationships education to be made compulsory in England
<U+200E><U+200E>
The UK government yesterday (1) tabled amendments to theChildren and Social Work Billwhich will make it a requirement that all secondary schools in England teach relationships and sex education (RSE).
The amendments also allow the UK government to make regulations requiring personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) to be taught in all schools in England - primary and secondary, maintained and academy - in future.
Relationships education,RSE, andPSHEare designed to ensure pupils are taught the knowledge and life skills they will need to stay safe and develop healthy and supportive relationships, particularly dealing with the challenges of growing up in an online world.
Currently only pupils attending local-authority run secondary schools - which represent around a third of secondary schools - are guaranteed to be offered current sex and relationships education, andPSHEis only mandatory at independent schools. Neither are currently required to be taught in academies.
The government is proposing the introduction of the new subject of relationships education in primary school and renaming the secondary school subject relationships and sex education, to emphasise the central importance of healthy relationships. The focus in primary school will be on building healthy relationships and staying safe. As children get older, it is important that they start to develop their understanding of healthy adult relationships in more depth, with sex education delivered in that context.
The statutory guidance forRSEwas introduced in 2000 and is becoming increasingly outdated. It fails to address risks to children which have grown in prevalence in recent years, including online pornography, sexting and staying safe online. As a result now is the right time to address these issues.
The government is already taking action to address this with the introduction of a new internet safety green paper later this year, which will set out a series of steps to make the internet a safer place for young people.
This will be complemented by a comprehensive programme of engagement by the Department for Education (DfE) with stakeholders to set out suitable, age-appropriate content onRSEwhich focuses on mental wellbeing, consent, resilience, age-appropriate relationships and sex education, and keeping safe online. Regulations and statutory guidance will then be subject to full public consultation later this year, and we expect to see children and young people being taught this new curriculum in schools as soon as September 2019.
Schools will have flexibility over how they deliver these subjects, so they can develop an integrated approach that is sensitive to the needs of the local community; and, in the case of faith schools, in accordance with their faith.

Sil Redhi distribution case: Court directs AG to consider amending indictments
The Colombo High Court hearing the controversial Sil Redhi distribution (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) case yesterday, directed the Attorney General to consider the possibility of amending the indictments filed against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita, in connection with criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign. While making his dock statements, former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga informed Court that it is unfair to frame charges against him under Public Property Act since he had not benefited from the Sil Redhi distribution programme.
Lalith Weeratunga further told Court that he had to follow the orders issued by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the executive of the country.
Taking into consideration the facts, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga directed the Attorney General to consider the possibility of amending the indictments.
Further trial was fixed for March 6. The Attorney General had filed indictments against the two accused on three counts of committing a criminal misappropriation of funds amounting to Rs.600 million at TRC while spending for a Sil Redhi distribution program in contravention of theTelecommunication Act, No. 25 of 1991 Act during the period of October 30, 2014 to January 5, 2015.
The prosecutors alleged that the funds referred to had been remitted to a bank account maintained by Secretary to the President.
The charges had been filed under the Public Property Act while listing 21 persons as the prosecution witnesses. Former Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, former Presidents coordinating Secretary (Religious Affairs) Ven. Vatinapaha Somananda Thera are among the persons who had been named as the witnesses.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the prosecution.

Suzuki Stingray Automatic  debuts at Ceylon Motor Show
The evergreen Suzuki Wagon R which was recently reincarnated as the Stingray is a popular mode of transport among individuals who are hooked on the spaciousness and the tallboy silhouette offered by this sporty vehicle.
Associated Motorways (Private) Limited (AMW) being the sole agent and the authorized distributor in Sri Lanka for brand new Suzuki motor vehicles introduced the Suzuki Wagon R for the first time to the local market during 2002 and has since made this carand it's younger sibling, the Stingray, the first choice of many a family in the market for a brand new all-rounder vehicle.
AMW chose Sri Lanka's premier motor show, the Ceylon Motor Show, staged at the Bandaranaike Memorial International ConferenceHall (BMICH) recently as the venue for the launch of the Suzuki Stingray2017 with automatic transmission. Samantha Rajapaksa, AMW's Group Managing Director and Yohann de Zoysa,Director-Passenger Vehicles unveiled the 2017 Suzuki Stingray automatic to a packed audience at the Ceylon Motor Show.
The 2017 Stingray automatic promises a hassle-free drive during rush hour transits with it's 5 speed Auto Gear Shift(AGS) which also offers a manual shift mode for sportier moods. The Suzuki K-Next series 1000cc engine married to this outstanding transmission system produces phenomenal levels of performance and fuel efficiency. Comparatively, these achievements far exceed the figures offered by the reconditioned Stingray vehicles found in the open market. The ground clearance of 165mm in the brand new 2017 Suzuki Stingray AGS dwarfs the 155mm found in it's reconditioned counterpart.
In light of passenger safety, the 2017 Stingray AGS is loaded with many safety features which include driver and front passengerairbags complemented by the anti-lock braking system, all of which come as standard equipment. Many niceties are also found in abundance in the 2017 Suzuki Stingray AGS. Among these, the factory installed premium sound systemwith steering wheel mounted controls, factory fitted original Suzuki alloy wheels, rear wiper/washer and de-fogger, leather wrapped and tilt adjustable steering wheel along with the projector headlamps and the distinctive front reflector grill, take center stage.
The manufacturer's warranty of 2 years or 50,000Kms (whichever occurs first) offered in the 2017 Suzuki Stingray AGS is able to extend up to 4 years or 80,000Kms (whichever occurs first) with a nominal additional payment, at the time of vehicle purchase.
Being the pioneer and the market leader in the local automotive sector, AMW offers many an after-sales facility to their loyal customers via the network of modern service facilities spanning throughout the island. The trade-in concept, an industry first by AMW, makes it a breeze of upgrading from the current vehicle to a brand new Suzuki.

Trump promises RENEWAL OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT
US: President Donald Trump pledged a renewal of the American spirit Tuesday, as he tempered his most inflammatory rhetoric while fleshing out his nationalist agenda during a landmark speech to Congress.
Transposing hardline campaign promises into a Presidential key, Trump offered the most restrained and detailed explanation yet of his America-first world view.
He criticized threats against Jewish community centers and condemned the seemingly racially-motivated killing of an Indian immigrant, answering calls for him to speak out.
And although the 70-year-old president again promised a hard line on illegal immigration, he couched those policies in economic rather than xenophobic terms, winning sustained applause from the Republican dominated Congress.
By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone, he said.
Putting some policy meat on the bones, he proposed introducing an Australian-style merit-based system to reduce the flow of unskilled workers -- and held out the prospect of a bipartisan compromise with Democrats on root-and-branch immigration reform.
Trump arrived to deliver his maiden address before a chamber filled with lawmakers, Supreme Court Justices, ambassadors and generals, facing historically low approval ratings and embroiled in multiple crises. Hailing what he called a new national pride sweeping the country, he sought to use the pomp of the occasion and the presidential pulpit to reclaim authority and course correct after 40 difficult days.
Discussing trade, Trump even enlisted the help of American icon Abraham Lincoln, echoing what the first Republican President described as protective policy.
Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words, Trump said. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.
Looking abroad, Trump softened his criticism of NATO partners and vowed to work with allies in the Muslim world.
But he offered no apologies for emphasizing a world order centered on the nation state.
My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America, he said.
But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more, he said, promising to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.
In Trumps longest speech to date as president he remained largely on message, reading his planned address almost verbatim.
Some women Democratic lawmakers had dressed in white for the occasion, a nod to the suffragette movement and an echo of the substantial opposition the presidents policies face.
But Trump struck a compassionate tone at times, embracing family-friendly policies like paid parental leave, and even won cautious praise from Democrats for his attempt at a more optimistic vision for America and his call for unity.
This was far less dark than the inaugural speech. And he has made an attempt to reach out, said Democrat John Larson of Connecticut. But the devil is in the details.
According to a CNN instant poll, 57 percent of Americans who tuned in saying they had a very positive reaction to the speech.
Pressing his domestic agenda -- and pleasing mainstream Republicans who reluctantly embraced him -- Trump promised to provide massive tax relief for the American middle class and to repeal his predecessors landmark Obamacare health reform.
When you get into a job and you do it for a while you become better at it, and I think hes improving every single day, said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
The billionaires populist economic message was crucial in his November victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton -- helping him sway voters in crucial Rust Belt states Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Now his challenge is translating that into tangible policy steps and legislative achievements.
He outlined plans for rebuilding Americas creaking infrastructure and for high-stakes tax and healthcare reform.
But on all three issues, Trump faces a difficult balancing act with fellow Republicans, who control both the Senate and House of Representatives.
To succeed, Trump -- the consummate political outsider -- may have to embrace Washington deal-making.
Conservatives are desperate to pull Obamacare out by its roots, but party pragmatists are wary of dismantling a system that helped some 20 million Americans obtain health insurance.
Tensions between the executive branch and the Republican-led Congress are also simmering over Trumps 2018 budget proposal.
Trump wants to hike defense spending by $54 billion, offsetting with cuts in foreign assistance and other non-military spending. On all these issues Trump offered little detail about how to meet his promises worsening the countrys nearly $20 trillion national debt.
This plan doesnt add up. A third-grade math student can see that youre going to blow a huge hole in the deficit if you do the things the President is talking about, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen told AFP.- AFP

UNHRC sessions: US takes note of Sri Lanka
When it comes to human rights no country should be free from scrutiny, but neither should any democratic country be purely be subjected to unfair unbalanced and unfounded bias, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Erin Barclay told the UNHRC session yesterday.
Speaking on behalf of the Trump administration, she also took note of the UNHRC action on Sri Lanka stating that, action by the Council catalyzed progress for reform and provided technical assistance to improve accountability for past violations in Sri Lanka.
When the Council functions properly it has the ability to remind of their commitments and obligations. It can hold countries accountable for the same. When the Council works as it should, its successes are victories for human rights she said.
However, she was critical of the UNHRC over the manner in which it deals with some countries such as Israel.
We must always bear in mind that Human rights are universal and every state has duty to promote respect and accountability for its universal rights. The US commitment to fundamental human rights is stronger than ever. Regrettably too many of the actions of this council do not support those universal principles. Indeed they contradict them she said.
The United States also remains deeply troubled by the Councils consistently unfair and unbalanced focus on democratic country, Israel. The obsession with Israel is a largest threat to this councils credibility.
The US is opposed to this.
Not just in Israel, but where ever it occurs she commented.
As we consider our future engagements, my government will be considering the Councils actions with an eye toward reform to more fully achieve the Councils mission to protect and promote human rights. Building greater credibility of the HRC will increase our ability to help create a better world for individuals in all countries. Together, by turning our attention consistently to the most critical human rights situations, we can make progress and help this body fulfill its mandate to make the world a better, safer place, she added.

Why this much ado about SAITM
Sometime back the former Minister of Education Bandula Gunawardena showed the importance of mustering the support of the private sector for university education. Then Minister Bandula Gunawardena said that the private universities are a must for the development of the country. He went further to mention that political hypocrisy of some parties and politicians had hindered the setting up of private universities in Sri Lanka.
Luxman Kirielle, the present Minister of Higher Education and the then Kandy District UNP MP, too expressed the cooperation of their party for the Government to establish private universities in Sri Lanka. Both of them highlighted the colossal expenditure the parents have to bear to send their children abroad for university education. It is common knowledge that over billions of rupees of foreign exchange are going out of the country.
There are some sections opposing the setting up of private universities, it would be important to see what is behind their thinking. The power base of some of these political parties is the state universities. It is no secret that the leftist political parties attempt to make state universities their power stations to build up political empires. They manipulate these institutions of higher learning by making use of university students and even try to destabilize the administrative structures. A lot of publicity was given in the papers recently regarding this phenomenon.
Private universities
The hue and cry of some who oppose private universities is Dont privatize universities and Dont sell out higher education. I suppose that they have not understood the difference between privatization of universities and establishment of private universities. Most of the countries in the world including China have opted for the establishment of private universities. As Bandula Gunawardena said, Every sound mind agrees that a country needs private universities for its development. Establishment of private universities does not mean privatization of state universities.
When we look at the socio-economic situation in our country, the establishment of private universities is a must. We know the percentage of students who qualify to enter the universities and out of that a very small percentage gets the chance to enter these institutions. Some continue to vie for university education by repeating the examinations over and over again. Those who can afford, they go abroad. We can easily find out the thousands of students going out of the country after GCE O/L and A/L examination to universities in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and even countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Russia and China. We see how foreign universities come and fish around to get students from Sri Lanka to their Universities. Some open up institutions here and make money. How many of us object to this phenomenon
Foreign exchange
Many parents make a lot of sacrifices. Some sell their properties to send their children abroad for studies. Having sent them they are anxious and worried because they are far away from their children. All these could be avoided if private universities are established making it possible for those who can afford to frequent them. Foreign exchange will remain in the country.
The concern of some of the leftist politicians and even medical doctors is that it would destroy the chances of some students obtaining higher education. On the contrary, it will enhance the opportunities to enter state universities as the run and the rush to state universities will be reduced significantly with the intake by private universities. This too will avoid students already qualified and not admitted to state universities to embark immediately on a higher education programme without wasting their time and energy in repeating these examinations. The batches that follow will have better chances to enter university education.
Parents, who can afford small amounts, will invest money in their own country saving foreign exchange that would flow out otherwise. The healthy competition created between the private and the public sectors will act as a catalyst to improve the standards of both public and private universities. Therefore establishment of private universities will help indirectly the poor students and also the creation of institutions of quality and excellence. The Government can intervene and get these private institutions to give scholarships to deserving students. Some of the private institutions are already giving scholarships to deserving poor students.
The Government should monitor the facilities, the content of curricula and the structure of fees in the private universities so as to persuade and encourage them to maintain standards, let the unscrupulous entrepreneurs will exploit the students and parents to make money at the expense of quality and standards. However, the markets will decide the quality of their products and the state universities too will have to compete thus ensuring a better quality of education in the state sector.
The development of a country depends on education but what kind of education It should be a quality education relevant to the modern day needs and not numbers of graduates produced that will help the development of the country. We see that over 40,000 graduates from the state universities are unemployed or under employed. This is the result of filling the universities without proper planning and market study.
The employers say that many of them are unemployable and lack necessary skills for their requirements. This is proved when the World Bank came forward to re-train graduates investing a lot of money again. Let us be realistic and sincere so that we may not hinder the progress of the county for our personal interest, jeopardizing the education system and draining out our meagre financial resources.
Malabe Private Medical College
The Private Medical College at Malabe is an attempt by the private sector to stop students going abroad for medical studies. It will be interesting to see the quality of education in some of these foreign universities and also the facilities for students for board and lodging. Nobody dares to analyze and evaluate the quality of education in our own country. Some medical faculties in Sri Lanka, too should come under scrutiny, so as to find out whether they are up to standards. Is it true that the lecturers in some of the medical faculties fall far below the required cadre and the facilities too have to be enhanced
I visited the Medical College at Malabe and had a chat with some of the professors and students and they have good facilities but there is a lot of room for improvement. What I realized is that they are ready to make good whatever shortcomings they have and they have the power to do so. So it is important to see how we can help them to improve the quality of education if the Medical Association finds that they are not up to the standards. It is not a solution to discourage or drive away the private sector investors in the medical field. These investors can get their children educated in any part of the world but who is going to lose It will be our own children who cannot afford to go to other countries. Let us not throw the baby with the bath-water because of our own self-interests.
Private sector
Let us see how we can make use of the resources we have to get our children educated and encourage and work with the private sector to get the best services from them to provide a quality education in medicine.
I was happy to hear that our Prime Minister has already taken the right steps to see how we can bring both the public and the private sectors together to educate our youth. I appreciate the political will of the Government to work together with all sectors for the development of not only education but the whole country. The then Minister of Higher Education, S B Dissanayake, boldly stand with the decision he made to recognize the Medical College SAITM when he was the Minister of Higher Education.
The declaration of the Appeal Court too will enhance the desire of the private sector to invest in projects that would serve the country without any fear of nationalization at the protests of the vociferous so-called patriots. It is questionable why some people are against SAITM while they are quite silent when similar institutions do exist in our own country and even with lesser facilities. It would have been fair if they were allowed to sit a qualifying examination as they do for foreign qualified students, so as to practise as doctors if the GMOA is really keen to help these students and parents. Can we not question their goodwill
We appreciate the critical approach of the opposed sectors which I think is important for any development as Hegelian philosophy teaches us. However when we reach a synthesis for the good of the country we too should have open minds to accept truth with humility and generosity.
May I appeal to people of goodwill to help the private sector to invest in our own country and work for the development of our motherland without sabotaging the attempts of the private sector! The state can always lay down terms and conditions and consult the General Medical Association so as to improve and enhance the services of the private sector in the field of medicine. Let right reason prevail.
Is SAITM the problem or our own mindset

The government accepts that underworld activities in the country has seen a dramatic increase, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said yesterday.
He said that the matter was discussed at the Cabinet meeting too. He added that the Cabinet was of the view that underworld crimes should be brought to an end.
Minister Weerakkody was responding to a question raised by a journalist at a press conference at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation head office auditorium in Dematagoda.
He said that if there are politicians behind these activities as the opposition members allege, they too should be dealt with by the law.
But, we have to think twice on the statement made by opposition member Alahapperuma, Minister Weerakkody said.
The minister further said the Police has to handle such activities as the Police is independent now. There was a period when certain politicians sat on the Police OICs chair and tried to handle Police matters, Minister Weerakkody said.
But, that situation has changed now. The Police is independent.
He added that earlier, politicians were given STF backup. But today, I saw a prison bus transporting inmates with a STF backup, Minister Weerakkody said. Its a real change.

Increasing interest rates luring investments away from SL capital market
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Tilak Karunaratne says increasing interest rates are luring investments away from Sri Lankas capital market.
Noting that liquid, efficient stock markets are the foundation for achieving sustained economic growth, Karunaratne stressed that for these reasons, countries which have been overly dependent on traditional bank credit for many years are now gradually turning their attention to capital markets.
Unfortunately in Sri Lanka the situation is different.
He made these views speaking at the South Asian Federation of Exchanges (SAFE), conference held in Colombo this week.
He also spoke on the importance of regional integration of capital markets and working towards developing a regulatory environment which encourages Stock Exchanges to embrace integration.
According to Karunaratne, more recently, capital market integration has continued to accelerate, as new investing opportunities emerge.
Unfortunately, South Asia is the most mal integrated region in the world as a result of highly restrictive national policies governing financial markets.
Removal of controls on capital transactions within the region, harmonisation of capital market infrastructure including regulations, taxation, accounting, trading systems and cross-listings of securities are necessary steps to move towards regional financial integration.
If markets are not operated in a transparent, efficient and fair manner investors are quick to flee environments that are unstable or unpredictable, he said adding that therefore, securities regulators are expected to detect market malpractices that distort price discovery and erode public confidence in the market and act promptly to deter such aberrations and protect the investing public.

St. Sylvesters College Kandy should have the edge over Vidyartha College in their 59th Battle of the Babes Big Match to be played at the Pallekele Stadium on March 3 and 4 with play commencing at 9.45 a.m. each day.
The talk in Kandy is can Vidyartha break the 50-year-old hoodoo They last won in 1967 under R.M. Lafir, the famous cricketer who played for Government Services. Vidyartha College started cricket in 1952 and St.Sylvesters College in 1955. The two teams first met in 1955, and that was the first cricket match of St. Sylvesters. Of the 58 games played so far the Sylvestrians have won 13 and Vidyartha 3.
This season Vidyatha is led by Ravishka Upananda, a fine stroke maker under whose captaincy they beat St .Anthonys College Kandy for the first time. They are coached by Jaliya Weerasinghe.
St. Sylvesters College who are led by Manjula Perera have not fared that well in their 13 games. They are coached by Sanjay de Silva. The match is played for a trophy in memory of Rev. Fr. Don George, who gave a big hand to start cricket at St. Sylvesters. The trophy was first awarded in 1982.
The first match between these two schools played in 1955 at the Police Barracks matting wicket turned out to be a thrilling encounter.
Vidyartha batting first totalled 106 with Vernon Nanayakkara and Upasena de Silva taking three wickets each for 25 and 13 respectively. In reply the Sylvestrians were dismissed for 79 with S. Iddamalgoda making 33. Vidyartha in their second turn were bundled out for 83 with skipper Tony Direckze taking 4 for 32 and V. Croos 3 for 7. The Sylvestrians had to score 110 runs for victory in an hour. At the end of the match they were short by five runs with three wickets in hand,
The following year Vidyartha led by T.B. Wijesinghe (a top class ruggerite) secured the first win of the series beating St. Sylvesters by an innings. St. Sylvesters made 124 with Wijesinghe bowling pace taking 4 wickets for 37 and K. Bowatte 4 for 38. S.D.Rajapakse made 28 and H.S. de Croos 23. Vidyartha in their turn went on to score 255 with some superb batting coming from Wijesinghe 55, N. Navaratne 53, F.M. Farook 61, L.B. Aluwihare 23 and M. Keppitipola 21. Ferry Alexander Hidallarachchi, S. Stephen, I.M. Anwer and D.J. Suwaris took two wickets each. Sylvestrians in their second innings were bundled out for 90. Once again it was Wijesinghe and Bowatte who did the damage taking two wickets each with G.B. Diyawa also chipping in with two.

83rd Battle of the Saints: Joes go out as underdogs
St. Josephs College Maradana will have to battle hard to regain the Rev.Fr Maurice Legoc trophy in the 83rd Battle of the Saints cricket encounter against St Peters College which will take place on March 3 and 4 at the P. Sara Oval.
This Battle of the Saints encounter started way back in 1933 with St. Josephs College winning the inaugural clash. Robert Fernando led St. Josephs College in the first encounter.
The Joes last win was achieved in 2008 under the leadership of Ruwantha Fernandopulle.
Of the 82 matches played between the two schools so far the Josephians lead the series with 12 wins.
The Joes led by bowler Harin Cooray this season have won three matches outright against St. Patricks College Jaffna, Maris Stella College Negombo and Bandaranaike MV Gampaha while remaining unbeaten.
Big match is a totally a different game to other matches. We are hoping to play positive cricket and bring the trophy which has eluded us for the past eight years back to the college, said Harin Cooray the skipper of St. Josephs. Their batting has not been very consistent as only one batsman Nipun Sumanasinghe has been able to make a score of over 100 and is their top scorer for the season with over 1000 runs. He will have the burden of steering the batting for the Josephians along with wicket-keeper cum Sri Lanka youth player Revan Kelley. Apart from the duo Dineth Madurawela and Shevon Fonseka will be expected to bolster the middle order batting.
Much is also expected from Jehan Daniel the Sri Lanka youth player and Pahan Perera who have also scored over 500 runs.
To curtail the strong Peters batting line up the bowling will be in the hands of Harin Cooray who together with Jehan Daniel have taken over 120 wickets between them. Support for them will be expected from Havin Perera, Ruchira Ekanayake and Dineth Jayakody.
This year the Josephians are coached by veteran Sri Lanka cricketer and coach Roger Wijesuriya. Both sides are very strong and have done well this season. Frankly speaking I was new to St. Joesephs but I am very happy with the ongoing progress. Batting is our strength as we have an advantage of playing most of the matches on our home grounds at Darley Road.
We will try our best to see the match finishes on a good note and we will set the bench mark in this game, said Wijesuriya.

Ban violence not big matches
It is Big Match season and despite the controversy and the chaos it brought about earlier this month, the games have gone ahead as planned. The barrage of allegations and questions raised as a result of a clash between student groups of Ananda College and Nalanda College earlier this month, however, have mostly been unanswered.
Eight students on either side were left hospitalised and this led to a group of Buddhist monks, headed by Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera, the Founder of the Sri Bodhiraja Foundation calling for the ban of big matches in the name of morality- a call which was swiftly shut down by the Minister of Education, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, a fan of the Big match himself. Between games and morality however we find that there is a problem which needs to be addressed and that is of violence that is ever pervading our society.
From our homes to our schools, it is our first resort and not the last. It does not take much for an argument to turn into fisticuffs and as Nalanda College Principal, Ranjith Jayasundera said to Daily News, The school is just a section of society after all and what happens outside spills inside. We can only minimise such incidents, we cannot stop them.
The Principal whose school was the centre of it all has resigned himself to such incidents.
The big match was not the reason for this fight though it occurred close to that season. This was a personal issue between boys of the two schools which escalated. Not all are like this, it is just a small group with their own agendas who have used the student groups for their own advantage. Such things happen at the end of exams too, he said.
To him the problem is more of a law and order issue rather than enforcement of school discipline. If the law enforcement agencies are strong and enforce the law, it will be fine. The police should freely punish them under civil law, said Jayasundera.
The students of Ananda College in the meantime are equally passive about the fight. Chaminda Sangeeth, 18, in all his exuberance puts the fight down to simply them retaliating when Nalandians hit their bus thrice.
It was a small problem and not because of the Big Match. We have spoken about it and we even had a march together with the two schools. The problem has been solved, he said more than happy to forget the whole thing ever happened.
His classmates are equally matter of fact about the fight. Fights between schools during Big Matches are a normal thing. People cannot blame big matches for the recent fight as that was due to a different reason. It was the media that exaggerated the incident. They even said it was because of some love affair, but even that is wrong. Fights are normal and we usually resolve it among ourselves, said an Anandian.
The monk who said that the matches should be banned did so because he was sensitive to the fact that these were Buddhist schools and thus, we should maintain better discipline. But, fights are common between boys schools, he added.
Banning Big matches is not the solution
To Human Rights Lawyer, Aritha Wickramasinghe, it has been frustrating when the solution people propose to a problem is always to ban it all.
Sport teaches unity, team work and is enjoyable to watch and play. If violence is occurring during or after a Big Match, then this is not the problem of the Big Match. This is the problem of violent individuals and a social mindset that violence is an acceptable solution to problems, he said and observed that, Sri Lanka is an increasingly violent society. This is because violent behaviour on its own is encouraged and being fostered. From our schools, to homes, to politicians and especially religious leaders, we are shown that to inflict violence on someone or something is an acceptable solution to a problem.
Violence in a society recovering from 30 years of conflict is to be expected but the question is what are we doing about it
Each time a parent or teacher canes or slaps a child, you are teaching that young child that violent is a solution. Each time Buddhist monks go on protest campaigns damaging public property, threatening individuals and using vile language, you are teaching the youth that violence is a solution.
Each time politicians instigate racial or religious or any form of intolerance and ridicules others, you are teaching that violence is a solution. When everyone in the establishment in this country is teaching and showing that violence is the solution to their problems, should we be surprised that violence is increasing
How do we curtail violence You start teaching children and society values, emphasized Wickramasinghe.
The need to start teaching values at a young age is not a new proposal, it has been advocated from all quarters and leading up to the President himself, what we lack is implementation.
Aruna Keerthi, 46 waits to pick his son up from Royal College. As he waits, scores of boys get on motorcycles and cabs, whizzing passed him, exuberant of their upcoming match. The proposal to ban the Big Match, he finds to be extremely ridiculous.
The matches need not be banned just because of a fight. If so can we abolish the Parliament because they are also fighting and speaking in filth What can I tell my son when he asks me why the big match is banned because of a fight but those in Parliament continue to fight regardless of any consequences he asked.
Compared to their conduct, this is a small issue. Children do fight and we cannot avoid it. They will fight today and become friends tomorrow, he added.
To him, the answer is simple, I have told my son to remain calm if someone hit him the first time and be thus even a second time, but if someone hits him a third time, I have asked him to hit them back.
Vihanga Perera- Writer
Big Match-related "violence" seems to be predominantly an issue limited to a few schools, and that too, closer to Colombo. I would say that if a more meaningful and honest involvement is done by individual schools, these situations can be lessened.
In the late 90s and early 2000s, when I was schooling, there used to be a meeting on the week of the Big Match, where the Principal would speak. Sometimes a senior officer from the Police would come and have a chat. Not that the school I attended has ever been known to be dramatic during Big Matches - but, still, as a matter of procedure.
I would say that many "modern day school admins" don't want to get involved beyond a certain official line of duty. The business of "discipline" is not taken seriously enough by some school admins. The root of the issue is there.
Avinda Perera works at a private company
Schools need to enforce discipline. If they get out of hand and destroy public property then they must face the consequences. Certain groups trespass properties of other schools and vandalize walls in the name of tradition. They know the risks and must face the consequences, rather than hide behind the banner of the big match.
The big match, in principle should foster harmony and respect between two institutions that despite rivalry, admire the skills and courage displayed on the field and ideally off. Ban the match No! Government intervention to uphold civil laws during revelry Yes, but through proper police work and not by action to ban the match. There have been instances where schools have taken decisions to ban encounters altogether due to disciplinary issues, sans sentiment. School administration should be strong to do this.
During my Dads time, the cycle parade was a pretty harmless affair, lads on bikes cycling through Colombo with school flags and trying to look cool in front of girls schools. Now they have helicopters, and schools try to out-do each other but they say it is tradition and that even ragging is tradition too but they forget what they should stand for the values of the school. St. Thomas has a huge love affair with being Thomian that they have all got their wires crossed, it is the same with Royal. Can it be called fraternal egoism Character, Conduct and discipline are three qualities that ever conscientious students should be taught as a member of society and as an ambassador for his/her school.
R. Madhushan, A medical university student
You cannot ban it. It is the school culture. I have been to many big matches. I have also seen students drinking and using weed and I think fights take place as result of it. The fights erupt after the matches not before the matches. The school administration and the relevant authorities should take necessary action. These incidents are not new, it is like a part of our culture and its been happening for years.
Niresh Eliatamby
There is no Big Match Problem. This is simply a law and order problem - tell the police to do their jobs. Lawbreakers shouldnt be classified as undergrads, students of leading schools or sons of politicians. Anyone who breaks the law should be dealt with according to the process given in the law.
Teelaka,14, Royal College student
Big matches should not be banned. We enjoy it a lot and support and cheer our school players. Thats the unity of the school. We just dont fight with each other. It is a good opportunity for the students to get to know each other and have a good time.
Tisura Gamage- works at a private company
Personally I have never been a big fan of the big matches. But banning them seems far too extreme and not practical to say the least. May be alcohol is the centre of the problem during matches. If the schools could impose proper controls for alcohol and over consumption that could go a long way I think.
Ishan Jalill- Human Rights Activist
"banning big matches" That's simply ridiculous! People go for big matches, they eat, drink, be crazy etc.. But quarrelling and violence of course must be curtailed through school administration. This is just like "banning Facebook because some people happen to commit suicide due to online misadventures."
Isura Jayaratne, 17, Royal College student
The school administration has asked the students to not to get involved in any of the fights. Big matches have been the tradition of the school and so is fighting for ones school. But now they have said that even if it is tradition, if it does not gel well with our society, we need to change it. I would not agree with the fact that it has to be banned. The fights occur not because of the big match but people connect it as its the big match season. I think the current issues related to the big matches will be curtailed as the school administration has also taken several initiatives.

Big Match fever gives boost to voting
Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest takes a new turn with the commencement of the 2017 traditional big match season from this month.
With the first XI cricketers warming up for their most crucial engagements of the season, their supporters, young and old as well as the cricket fans, have joined in their numbers to vote for their star schoolboy cricketers, thus supporting the emerging players of their alma mater.
Hence, voting for the most popular contests of the 39th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year has caught a greater interest among cricket fans as it would be a psychological boost for their school cricket heroes before the big uns.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year series has produced many legendary cricketers, who had made their mark in the international arena, right from its inception way back in 1979. Former Sri Lanka, NCC and Royal captain turned ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, who had become the first recipient of the prestigious title, heads that select band of cricketers who had emerged through the contest.
In a recent interview, the first-ever winner of the prestigious award in 1979 had said that the Lake House and the Sunday Observer should be complimented for keeping the show going for almost four decades. In a recent press interview, Madugalle had also paid a tribute to the sponsors of the Mega Show, stating that such sponsorships are essential to keep the show going. He was particularly happy to see the emergence of rural stars through the event in recent times. In the past, most of the winners of the top awards were from Colombo and its suburbs, but now, the outstation schools have come in a big way and it is a positive sign for the game, he was quoted as saying.
Sri Lankas World Cup winning captain turned Minister Arjuna Ranatunga is a familiar face at the past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards presentations, ever since he first won the coveted title in 1980 - as a cricketer, spectator as well as a VIP guest. In fact, Sri Lankas world cup-winning captain is the second recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year after Madugalle in 1980 and the first schoolboy to win the major title twice.
Ranatunga is of the view that the dream of every schoolboy cricketer from his era is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. In a recent interview, the former Ananda, SSC and Sri Lanka captain had commended the Sunday Observer for hosting the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest from 1979 to encourage the budding schoolboy cricketers.
I am happy at the improvement of outstation cricket as the game has spread far and wide in the country. Many Sri Lankan cricketing giants of the past and the present are those who have either won the prestigious and coveted Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Award or one of the many awards presented at the contest, says Ranatunga.
The cherished dream of every schoolboy cricketer from the day he holds a bat or ball at junior level is to play for the Sri Lanka national team one fine day. When their school careers come to an end, they will look forward to one encouraging signal  to secure a top award at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year ceremony.
They are acutely aware that such an award would be an unofficial guarantee to enter the big league. Hence, there is a common belief among schoolboy cricketers that if they could end their school career with the top award at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega show, they are only a step away from wearing the Sri Lanka cap.
The past track record of the Mega Show provides ample examples to prove that belief. Most of the top award winners at the Mega Show in the past had straightaway walked into the national team, just months after they had won the top award. The best examples are Madugalle and Ranatunga.
Merely three years after he was adjudged the first-ever Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, Madugalle was able to secure a place in the Sri Lanka team for the countrys inaugural Test in 1982.
In contrast, Ranatunga found a place in the Sri Lanka team for the same Test just months after winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title for the second time in 1982. Both Ranatunga and Madugalle made that a memorable occasion by scoring debut half centuries for Sri Lanka in Test cricket.
As the proud host of the three-decade old prestigious school cricket awards show, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, the Sunday Observer is delighted to see the distinguish achievements of Madugalle and Ranatunga as well as other recipients of the top award such as Asanka Gurusinha, Roshan Mahanama, Muttiah Muralitharan, Sanath Jayasuriya, Marvan Atapattu and Kumar Dharmasena to name a few.
The Mega Awards Show which recognises talents of schoolboy cricketers is organized by Sri Lankas flagship English newspaper - the Sunday Observer, in association with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires & Sorcerers Association
Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel is the proud sponsor of the event for the 10th consecutive year. Its Chief Operative Officer (COO) Nalin Perera has played a key role in taking the event to a new level. It was due to the lavish sponsorship of SLT Mobitel that the hosts Lake House was able to elevate the standard of the event with superior trophies and attractive cash awards.

BPPL invests Rs 675 mn to  produce synthetic yarn  from recycled PET bottles
For the first time in Sri Lanka BPPL Holdings Limited (BPPL) will be manufacturing recycled synthetic yarn in Horana for the fabric manufacturing industry.
BPPL Holdings, one of the largest backwardly integrated brushware manufacturing facilities in South-East Asia, has invested Rs. 675 million to build a factory which will be ready by the end of this year.
BPPL Chief Executive Officer Dr. Anush Amarasinghe told Daily News Business that this polyester yarn extrusion plant, a first for Sri Lanka,will be utilising recycled PET bottles.
As a company, we are constantly thinking about how we could do things better, more responsibly, in a meaningful manner, adding value not only to our customers but also to Sri Lankas knowledge base. As our nation marches towards prosperity, we aim to be proudly positioned among the top local companies and showcase our talent and skills to the world, Amarasinghe said.
High imports
He said that currently Sri Lanka imports around 9,600 tonnes of PET for the plastic bottle industry and out of this 30% are re-exported by way of fluid containers/beverages made in Sri Lanka. The balance 70% is being used in Sri Lanka and later remain in dump yards. Out of this 40% are once again recycled and we buy one third of it.
He said that they use this for the purpose of manufacturing environmentally-friendly cleaning products for the professional, commercial and household markets. The company operates four state-of-the-art factories and warehouses in and around Horana. Operating in a niche segment, BPPL is a supplier to leading global brands such as Oates, Grainger, and Rubbermaid.
The company enjoys a strong track record as a high quality brushware and filament supplier to the US, Canada and Australasian markets and is well-positioned to diversify with its own brands within the South-East Asian region.
In the financial year ending 31st March 2016, the Group recorded revenue of Rs. 2.1 billion and a net profit of Rs. 306.9 million. un-audited revenue and net profit in the nine months up to December 31,2016 were Rs. 1.8 billion and Rs. 297.4 million respectively, an increase of 21% and 50% over the same corresponding period in the previous year.
The companys own Tip Top and JAB brands of household cleaning tools are currently successfully marketed in Sri Lanka and Indonesia respectively.
He said that the company is building its own Solar and Bio Mass plants which are helping them to lower electricity costs. The company has invested Rs. 110 million on these two plants.
He said that he was somewhat surprised as to why Sri Lankan industries are not using Solar which is a cheaper means of energy. Like us, Sri Lankan companies must look at simple and efficient cost saving methods like using solar and not only save costs for the company but reduce the burden on the national grid he advised.
He also said that local entrepreneurs must go globe and there are large untapped areas that can be exploited. You must travel, do market surveys, be innovative and then you can take Made in Sri Lanka brand globally.
He said one such example companys own Tip Top and JAB brands of household cleaning tools are currently successfully marketed in Sri Lanka and Indonesia respectively. We observed that Indonesia which has a large population dont have a good brand of household cleaning tools and introduced JAB brand to Jakarta. It has become an instant success not only because of its price tag and quality but mainly because we launched the packaging in the Indonesian language.
More exports
Tip Top brand is now available in local supermarkets.
Now we are looking at repeating this success story in other South East Asian countries. Sri Lankan companies can take a leaf from them and try to innovate.
BPPL is the parent company of the Beira Group of Companies. It was established in 1991 following the transfer of activities from Interbrush Lanka Limited, which was founded in 1984. Beira Brush and Beira Enviro Solutions are subsidiary companies of BPPLHoldings Limited.

The offer will be a sell down of shares from Hirdaramani Investment Holdings who will lower its ownership in BPPL to 13.4% from 23.4%. Infinity Capital and LOLC Investments will retain their 50.3% and 26.3% shareholdings respectively in the company.
The current shareholders will remain locked-in for a minimum of 12 months from the initial listing.The IPO will also broad-base ownership of the privately held business that has grown exponentially over the years. The Issue will open on March 7, 2017 and will close on the March 24, 2017 unless oversubscribed prior to the closing date.
