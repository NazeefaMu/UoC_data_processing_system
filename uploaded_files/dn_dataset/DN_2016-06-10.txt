RTC lives up to its  promise of drug free  racing in Nuwara Eliya

During the recently concluded April Racing festival in Nuwara Eliya, the Royal Turf Club with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Anti Doping Agency conducted race horse drug testing for the first time in Sri Lanka.
The chestnut mare Supreme trained by S P A Raju goes down in history as the first horse to be drug tested in Sri Lanka, when she won The Mayors Class 3 Stakes over 1400M on 20th March.
There were 14 random samples taken from the 35 races run during the April racing season which ended on 30th April , with all samples having been returned negative by an overseas accredited laboratory , namely the National Dope Testing Laboratory [ NDTL ] , which also conducts testing for some internationally recognized race clubs. We received the final report on Friday 3rd June and are delighted by the verdict, said Mr Wood
Not all samples collected from the racehorses were taken from the winners; some were taken from placed horses randomly selected by Wayne Wood, the RTC Chairman of Stipendiary Stewards to doubly ensure clean racing.
The club will kick off the next racing season on the 6th August with a Bollywood Theme and both race enthusiasts as well as those looking for a fun filled weekend should make their reservations without delay .

Cook says he doesnt compare  to genius Tendulkar

London, Thursday: England captain Alastair Cook insisted India batting great Sachin Tendulkars all-time record for Test runs had yet to come into his sights even though he had surpassed one mark set by the Little Master.
Cook became the 12th player in history to score 10,000 Test runs during Englands nine-wicket win in the second Test against Sri Lanka at Durham to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series ahead of Thursdays third Test at Lords.
The left-handed opener was also the first Englishman to achieve the feat and, at 31 years and 157 days, the youngest to get to the landmark, breaking Tendulkars record by more than five months.
Cook (10,042 runs in 128 Tests) is, however, nearly 6,000 runs short of retired star Tendulkars record aggregate of 15,921 runs from 200 Tests.
The England skipper has 28 Test hundreds to his name, with his runs having come at an average of 47, whereas Tendulkar bowed out with a record 51 centuries at an average of nearly 54.
Six thousand runs is a long way away, Cook, speaking at Lords, said Wednesday. It was set by an incredibly talented genius. Im no genius and Tendulkar is, so that is a long way ahead.
I want to play for England for as long as I can and at the moment Im really enjoying it. I am really motivated and hungry and where that takes me who knows.
Cook added: Ive never lived my life by saying where I want to get to publicly.
In private you have a few goals you want to try and achieve, but at the moment a lot of my goals are very immediate with this England team and as a captain that takes me away from personal milestones as a batter.
Nevertheless India hero Sunil Gavaskar, the first man to score 10,000 Test runs, said last week that Cook had it in him to set a new aggregate record for most Test runs because of his age and the fact that England play more games over the long format than many other nations.
Pink ball concerns
Following the Lords finale against Sri Lanka, England are then at home to Pakistan in a four-Test series.
England will then tour Bangladesh and India, where they will play a total of seven Tests. None of those matches will be day/night contests.
Australia and New Zealand broke new ground with a day/night Test at the Adelaide Oval late last year and Cricket Australia have now confirmed another such match against South Africa, also in Adelaide, for November.
But with Ashes matches between England and Australia well supported, Cook said international crickets oldest rivalry could stick with traditional hours. A lot of the games have really good attendances, and its probably not a series where you need to do it exactly at this time, he explained.
However, Cook also said: My general view of day-night Tests is that theyre definitely something cricket authorities need to keep looking at -- because its the way to keep the game moving with the times, making it more possible for spectators to come and watch.
My issue with it is the quality of the pink ball (used under lights because the standard red one is deemed too hard to sight).
No disrespect to the guys who make it -- but on the two occasions Ive played, it doesnt seem to behave the same way as the red ball.
Cook said his concern was that day/night fixtures could, as things stand, be too often decided by the fate of the team batting at the wrong time.
Its one of the great things about Test cricket - sometimes the ball swings conventionally, sometimes it reverses.
On my two occasions with the pink ball, it didnt do any of that - and then it nipped all over under twilight.
The quality of the ball is vital.

Bairstow defies Sri Lanka with another hundred

London, Thursday: Jonny Bairstow rode his luck to again rescue England from a top-order collapse with a century on the first day of the third Test against Sri Lanka at Lords on Thursday.
At stumps, England were 279 for six, having been 84 for four when Bairstow (107 not out) came to the crease.
It had been a similar story when Bairstow revived England from the depths of 83 for five in the first Test with a superb 140 on his Headingley home ground in a match England eventually won by an innings and 88 runs. Rather than scoring a maiden Test century at Lords, Bairstow should have been out for 11 on Thursday when he clipped Nuwan Pradeep firmly off his pads straight to mid-wicket only for Shaminda Eranga to drop the catch.
The Yorkshireman had another break when Eranga, selected despite having his action reported in Englands series-clinching nine-wicket win in the second Test at the Riverside, reviewed a rejected lbw appeal when the batsman had made 56.
Replays showed the ball hitting leg stump, but not enough, according to the Decision Review System, to overturn Indian umpire S Ravis original not out decision.
Apart from Bairstow, only England captain Alastair Cook (85), who won the toss in sunny conditions ideal for batting, passed fifty on Thursday, with Chris Woakes 23 not out at stumps.
Sri Lanka performed admirably with the ball, albeit they were again sloppy in the field, on a good pitch where there was a touch of seam movement.
Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep shared four wickets while impressive left-arm spinner Rangana Herath rook an economical two for 45 in 21 overs.
England had already won this three-Test series at 2-0 up.
Cook insisted in the build-up to this match that England were determined to correct their habit of losing dead Tests in series theyd already won following heavy defeats at the end of victorious campaigns at home to Australia in 2015 and away to South Africa earlier this year.
Cook, presented with a commemorative bat before play to mark his achievement in becoming the first England batsman to score 10,000 Test runs, a landmark he reached at the Riverside, and fellow opener Alex Hales compiled a fifty stand in 74 balls.
But Herath struck with just his fourth ball he had Hales (18), slogging across the line of a ball that turned, caught by Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews at slip.
By his own admission, Nick Compton was playing for his Test place.
But Englands number three, on his Middlesex home ground, fell for one when he was caught behind off a gentle Lakmal away-swinger.
Lakmal struck again when he had Joe Root (three) lbw, hitting across the line.
Pradeep got in on the act by bowling James Vince for 10 and England were now 84 for four -- the fifth time in their last seven Test innings they had lost four wickets before reaching 100.
Left-handed opener Cook was closing in on his 29th Test century when, shortly before tea, he was plumb lbw to Pradeep, bowling from around the wicket.
Cook faced 173 balls, including nine fours.
Moeen Ali, fresh from his Test-best 155 not out at the Riverside, followed Hales in falling to the Herath/Mathews combination for 25.
Bairstow, strong off his pads and on the drive, cut Pradeep for four to go to 94.
He then equalled his previous Test-best at Lords of 95, made against South Africa in 2012 before a single off Herath saw him to a 160-ball century.

Federer survives Fritz  challenge in Stuttgart

Stuttgart, Thursday: Roger Federer made a winning return to tennis on Thursday after a month away with back pain as he finished off a Stuttgart ATP grass-court match 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 over teenager Taylor Fritz. The pair were called off court in the second round on Wednesday as heavy rains raked the Weissenhof Club, with the Swiss leading 4-3.
Federer, who last played in a third-round Rome loss to Dominic Thiem, then missed the French Open, is building for another run at Wimbledon, where he is a seven-time champion.
The world number three is making his first appearance in Stuttgart since 2001, when he played the indoor Masters.
The 34-year-old reached another milestone as his defeat of the young American hopeful marked his 1,071st victory, tying him in second place with Ivan Lendl for the Open era win record. American Jimmy Connors holds the all-time record of 1,256 victories.
Federer will next face German Florian Mayer, a qualifier.
Fritz, the 18-year-old world number 65, made a match of it as he played toe-to-toe with the 17-time Grand Slam winner, who badly needs match play before Wimbledon starts in just over a fortnight. Federer finished off a 29-minute opening set but found himself in a battle in the second as Fritz began gaining confidence.
The youngster broke to level matters in the final game of the second set after Federer had saved three set points.
In the third, the Swiss top seed broke for 5-4 as Fritz lost a 40-15 lead with four consecutive errors. Federer secured the victory after one hour 40 minutes on court, having saved eight of nine break points faced.
Third seed Thiem defeated Sam Groth 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/2) despite the Australian sending down 21 aces.
Thiem will line up in Fridays quarter-finals against Mikhail Youzhny after the Russian beat Sergiy Stakhovsky 6-3, 7-6 (7/1).
French fourth seed Gilles Simon beat Germanys Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. - AFP
