Mozarts comeback

For more than 20 years, The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka has made its Young Musicians Concert a platform for Sri Lankan artists to showcase their musical talents. With the generous sponsorship of HSBC, this annual event has allowed our young musicians the rare opportunity to perform repertoire for soloist and orchestra, and has become a rite of passage among those pursuing careers in classical music.
It has long been one of the SOSLs primary aims to foster young talent in Sri Lanka, to promote classical music, and enable young musicians discover the joys of communicating through music.
Recently, the SOSL widened the parameters of this concert to include composers as well, with very encouraging results. On July 23, three talented soloists will take the Ladies College stage with the SOSL, while one young composer will have her work premiered.
Eshan Denipitiya, a pianist of rare sensitivity and technical ability, will perform Mozarts Piano Concerto No. 17 in G major. Eshan began his musical journey at the age of 6 under the guidance of the late Mrs. Dharmi Mudalige and later under Mrs. Ruvini Hapugalle. He is currently pursuing his undergraduate studies at the Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore, majoring in Classical Piano Performance.
Mozarts piano concerto no. 17 is one of the rare concertos that Mozart composed with a soloist other than himself in mind  his student Barbara Ployer. This elegant concerto is unusual it its multiplicity of musical themes. Where a traditional classical concerto would give two contrasting themes, the first movement gives us six, one growing out of the previous one, and extravagance that Mozart extends into the following movements as well.
Also performing on July 23 is a very talented duo of SopranosDinushka Jayawickreme and Shehara Liyanage. Both Shehara and Dinushka are founder members of Sri Lankas premiere female ensemble Soul Sounds, directed by Soundarie David Rodrigo, and have been the lead soloists in the group. Shehara and Dinushka have touched the hearts of many with the beautiful blend of their two voices in perfect harmony when they performed with Soul Sounds in countries such as Australia, France, USA, Kuwait, Malaysia, China and recently in South Africa.
Shehara and Dinushka will be performing Delibes Flower Duet from the Opera Lakme, and Sull aria che soave zeffiretto, a duettino from Mozarts Marriage of Figaro. There may be no classical tune  operatic or otherwise  that turns up in more varied places than Delibes Flower Duet; this almost other-worldly piece of music has become one of the most familiar numbers any composer, in any genre, has ever written. Sull'aria...che soave zeffiretto is a short duet in which Countess Almaviva dictates to Susanna the invitation to a tryst addressed to the countess' husband in a plot to expose his infidelity.
Apart from the performances by the featured soloists, the orchestra will perform an original composition titled Achrann by the young composer Shannon Jacob. The word Achrann means strife in Gaelic, with connotations of battle, war and trouble. This piece takes the listener on a visual journey of a medieval Irish battle through which themes of romance, loss, hope and warfare are evident.
Shannon Jacob graduated from Berklee College of Music Boston USA with a Bachelor of Music Degree in Contemporary Writing and Production. She currently resides in Boston and works for Berklee College of Music as an Admissions Enrollment Officer.
Also on the programme on the 23rd are two orchestral itemsSchuberts Overture to Rosamundeone of his finest and most popular orchestral works, and Sibelius Karelia Suitea patriotic work depicting the beauties, history and music of the Karelia region of Finland.
The SOSLs Young Musicians Concert is on July 23 at the Ladies College Hall, and is made possible by the longstanding sponsorship of HSBC. The concert is supported by TV1 and Yes FM (electronic media) and JWT (Creative Partner). Tickets are available online at tickets.lk from 4th July onwards, and can be bought in person from Sarasavi Bookshop (Nugegoda and Maharagama), Yamaha Music Center, and Abans Main showroom.

Return of the  composer

Suresh Maliyadde is a modern day progressive, musician who is a composer, director and a keyboard player. He embraces elements of Rhythm and Blues, soul and funk while adopting freer stylistic elements of jazz into his compositions. As part of composing music for many singers, Maliyadde helped redefind the role of jazz and classical rhythm sections in Sri Lankan music, and was one of the first Sri Lankan composers to embrace fusion styles. Yet for all his relentless experimentalism, Maliyadde's music is often melodic and accessible; he has had many songs achieve success among contemporary audiences. Maliyadde came to fame as a composer in high school, composing his first arrangement at the age of 18, while in 10th grade at Royal College, Colombo, Sri Lanka. The years that followed saw him play for bands such as Echo, Tri Star, Super 7, Shakthi and Fortunes.
Suresh has been the maestro keyboardist on tour for Nanda Malini, and Amaradeva in USA, UK, Australia and Canada. With such accomplishments under his belt it was natural for him to evolve as a Music Director/Producer of Sri Lanakan music. Suresh Maliyadde is the founder and owner of the Fame Recording Studio in Colombo. The state of the art sound studio produces many artists with Maliyadde's label utilizing Nuendo and Pro Tools interfaces to bring crystal clear sound that is parallel to any multi platinum studio production in the industry. This very drive for innovative production led to his latest venture, offering direction and co-production to Amarasiri Peries, Kasun Kalhara and Uresha Ravihari at Bishop College Auditorium on July 15 at 7 pm. This is his contribution to the Welfare Society of the Sarasavi Group of Companies.
Suresh Maliyadde's music scores also extended to movies and television. He composed sound tracks for Rupavahini teledrama production "Vasantha Kusalane" and "Pem Piyawara". For his work in tele dramas, he has been nominated for best composer for tele drama sound track category. For the lovers of music, especially for those who like it with a hint of "Sri Lankan" sprinkled on it.

RTCs horses travel in luxury

When it comes to the wellbeing and welfare of the equine, the Royal Turf Club, Nuwara Eliya has set the bar high enough. But the quest to raise it higher will be our constant endeavour, said President RTC, Suranjith Premadasa.
With this end in view, professional expertise and supervision coupled with a stringent and strict adherence to the rules, ensured that the recently concluded festival of racing went off smoothly and without a hitch. Top notch track maintenance and a hawk eye vigilance which included testing horses for banned and prohibited substances in world accredited labs went a long way in presenting the Royal Turf Club, Nuwara Eliya in the right perspective.
RTCs most recent innovation and step in the direction of uplifting standards both on and off the race track are the luxury, padded containers that the horses are currently being transported in to Sri Lanka . We have been receiving a number of horses from India and in an effort to give them a comfortable and travel free journey across the sea, we are proud to introduce our newly fabricated horse containers, designed with the comfort and safety of the horse in transit. They have special cushioning and padded interiors coupled with a hardened, plastered flooring and adequate ventilation. All of this together will ensure that our horses travel in first class comfort, said Premadasa .
There has been a respite in the off racing season in our march towards bettering the existing facilities. The groundwork for a state of the art equine hospital equipped with the latest appliances has already begun. Our stabling facilities are getting a facelift and plans are afoot to design two storey stables modelled on designs sourced from Hong Kong, while work on the new sand track has already begun and once in place will provide a wonderful alternative to trainers to train and school their horses, said CEO RTC, Wayne Wood.
Saturday, August 6 is the day you will be able to see these very horses as they are put through their paces in a specially arranged breeze up on the race track before they are produced in the auction ring for what promises to be the very first Breeze Up Auction ever held in Sri Lanka. 16 Horses will come up for auction and we look forward to new individual owners, Partnerships and even syndicates being registered with the RTC, said Wood.

I probably wont watch Olympic golf - McIlroy

IRELAND, TUESDAY: Rory McIlroy might not even bother watching the golf at the Olympic Games, saying in pointed remarks that he will only tune in for the stuff that matters.
Fears over the Zika virus have been cited by a number of top players, including McIlroy, who have pulled out of August's Games in Rio. But the Northern Irishman has also admitted that the Olympics just don't have the same meaning to golfers as other athletes.
He hammered home that point on Tuesday as he spoke at Royal Troon in Scotland, where this week's British Open will be held.
I'll probably watch the Olympics, but I'm not sure golf will be one of the events I watch, said the 27-year-old. When asked what he would turn his television on for during the Games, McIlroy added: Probably the events like track and field, swimming, diving, the stuff that matters.
Such comments can do little to help golf's prospects of remaining an Olympic sport in the long term after the damage already done with the spate of big-name withdrawals. AFP

Riaz promises Pakistan will back younger brother Amir

LONDON, TUESDAY: Pakistans Wahab Riaz has insisted Mohammad Amir has the support of all his team-mates as he prepares to make his return to Test cricket at Lords on Thursday.
Fellow left-arm quick Amirs career came to a dramatic halt during a Test against England at Lords in 2010, when he and new-ball partner Mohammad Asif were caught bowling no-balls to order on the instructions of captain Salman Butt as part of a tabloid newspaper sting operation.
All three received five-year bans from cricket and together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms. Amir, who served three months in an English young offenders institute, has only featured in the international games shorter formats since his return to Pakistan duty in January. AFP

Are A tours,  Development Squads  serving the purpose

Sri Lanka today finds itself short of quality players who are match-winners to serve in the national cricket team and that is not because there is dearth of talent in the country but due to a whole lot of things that are wrong with the present system and needs to be overhauled.
Currently Sri Lanka does not have a procedure to fast-track exceptional talent that is oozing out of the schools and put them under special and high quality training at the highest level so that they can be straight away drafted into the senior team.
A clear example is the fast-tracking of England batsman Joe Root who was sent to the Darren Lehmann Academy in Adelaide early in his career to fine tune his game where he went through a tough training schedule the results of which we are seeing today.
A case in point in Sri Lanka is batsman Kusal Mendis who has virtually graduated from under 19 level to play Test cricket at the age of 21. Mendis progress clearly shows that the country is not starved of talent but the process of picking out the rare gem that is available is all wrong.
We have in this country a unique position where 800 plus schools are playing cricket which means you are delivering around 8,000 to 10,000 cricketers from the nursery. Whether all of them are quality you cannot say. But the biggest asset is they have become our stock and all of them have taken a huge liking to the game where there is a massive following from the junior cricket stage with parents, coaches, supports etc all getting involved. Some top schools like Royal, S. Thomas, Richmond, Ananda, Nalanda, St Peters and St Josephs are having as many as 4-5 teams at junior level  under 13, 15, 17, 19 sometimes even two under 19 teams A and B.
The question that needs to be asked is: Are we going to lose this talent. We cant afford the risk of losing this natural base which has been created post 1996 World Cup to a large extent. This established base must be protected and for its protection we need to have a system of recognition. At present we seem to be following the old system of having Development squads, A teams etc and on the other hand our first-class domestic tournament is not competitive enough. The question is whether the age old system of A teams and Development squad teams are serving the purpose From the current A team touring England how many of them will play for Sri Lanka
In the A team there are average performers within the club system who also try to vie for places. Whether they are good enough to play at national level is a moot question. An A team at present also serves the purpose for players who have been in the national team and for reason of loss of form or injury they have been dropped from the senior side. They use the A squad as a platform to try and score runs or take wickets to try and regain their places in the senior side. If there is another youngster vying for the same place as the discarded cricketer would he encourage that youngster and help him improve his cricket is questionable.
On those grounds we should not abandon A teams but we got to have some radicalised thinking to fast track and get some absolute talent to boost the national side. We have to weed out the real class and once a player is fast-tracked these exceptionally talented cricketers should not got through the process of playing in Development Squads and A teams but sent for specialised training abroad like England did with Joe Root. Then we may find an odd Jayasuriya or Muralitharan somewhere.
One of the under 19 cricketers that is strongly spoken of is all-rounder Charith Asalanka so is fast bowler Asitha Fernando. Another is batsman Minod Bhanuka. All of them are members of the Sri Lanka A team touring England. There are also players like Sammu Ashan, Ashen Bandara and Avishka Fernando currently playing in the ongoing under 19 series against South Africa.
A good example is the case of spinner Akila Dananjaya whom Mahela Jayawardene recommended as a bright prospect for the national team. But after a handful of matches Dananjaya is not even heard of in the club circuit. This is where the system fails where the rare talent is not tapped properly and given the necessary platform to make a permanent place in the senior team because the follow-up is not there.
Picking a young schoolboy cricketer and sending him to play in some league team in England or Australia is not going to help his cricket. He should be sent to an academy where mental toughness, professionalism, fitness etc are all grilled into the individual. Its not just going out and batting and bowling in the centre. Most of our cricketers dont have these fundamentals and they are totally absent from their cricket.
Kusal Mendis is an exception. We see something on the lines of mental toughness, professionalism and fitness. His approach in the middle and his ability to score 25-40 runs staying at the crease in the first few overs is a big boon.
There have been efforts to run a provincial tournament but at the moment it wont work because every cricketer is coming to Colombo for his livelihood and then they want to cling onto a Colombo club. To get over this shortcoming Sri Lanka Cricket is developing the infrastructure in the provinces which is good,
What Sri Lanka Cricket should clearly understand is that all the cricketers who play at domestic level have economic issues and the first opportunity they get they will grab because they want job security. Either they are going to be employed and play cricket or they will look at opportunities to play league and district in England or Australia. Currently we have about 300 cricketers who are playing cricket outside Sri Lanka. They have gone out of the system because that is their livelihood. So SLC has to do something out of the ordinary to tap this talent and ensure that they deliver. Eventually at the end of the day whether it is a Jayasuriya, Sangakkara, Mahela, Murali, Dias, Aravinda or Arjuna it is the talent that has delivered. These players had raw talent.
