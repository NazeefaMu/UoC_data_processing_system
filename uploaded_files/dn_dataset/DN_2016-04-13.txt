The passion of schools rugby

Rugby is a game adopted "by the people, for the people concept" while previews, game reviews, live streaming, updates, features, analysis tend to be highlighted. Sharing the passion of rugby by the spectator sport in Kandy has huge concerns over the Schools Rugby League this season, particularly when their home rugby club Kandy Sports Club emerged Rugby Champions 2016.
There's no doubt that the popularity of rugby among Kandy school students is growing quickly. From scrums to rucks to mauls, the sport's physical and fast paced nature has athletes hooked. All schools have played three games each, with only Trinity and St. Sylvester's having won their matches, the rest have been on the losing side.
All schools and their old boy's rugby committees, have spent large sums of funds and in person on school rugby athletes, and have seen the tremendous growth of the sport. In Kandy all the schools Trinity, St. Anthony's, Dharmaraja, Kingswood, Vidyartha, St. Sylvester's, Sri Sumangala and Sri Rahula have many successful programs at junior and senior levels towards the successful growth of the sport to perform at their best.
While rugby has traditionally been much preferred by boys compared to girls, female athletes are also starting to become more involved in rugby which the schools controlling body should promote. Today, boys take a keen interest in the game of rugby, and one can see how significant the growth has been.
Rugby is a fast paced, wide open, fun game especially rugby sevens. It's a good way to introduce non-rugby players to the sport. It gives them the opportunity to be creative with the ball. Rugby is a real contact sport, and there are no modified rules. With rugby becoming more popular, students are also starting to recognize the opportunities available to them to compete on behalf of their school.
Trinity College is the only school playing in Segment 1A. They have a well balanced side and have won all their three games on the trot.
The rugby that was put on show by the Trinitians in the opening game against Wesley College was not all that enterprising even though they won in the last second of the game, thanks to substitute fly half Leshan Wijesuriya who gave the opening. In the second game against St. Joseph's, Trinity was at their best, and won comfortably.
In their last outing they beat D.S. Senanayake convincingly by 65 points to nil. If they continue to play in this fashion Trinity should have no problem in performing well in future games. The forwards are knowledgeable and they also have a fast running set of threes.
Their next game is against St. Thomas' for the Cannon de Saram Shield on April 23 at Pallekelle.
St. Anthony's College plays in Segment 1B. This is a very exciting side. They have played three games against Science College, Isipathana College and St. Peter's College and lost all three. The loss is no indication to how they played.
They played very good rugby at different stages but were unable to sustain themselves and the winning streak was lacking in them. However, this side has good scope for the future provided they maintain their will to win. They have a wealth of talent in their forwards and some exciting players in the back-division. Their next game is on April 23 against Dharmaraja College at Bogambara.
Dharmaraja College plays in Segment 1B. With good talent they looked good, out of the three games having won one - against rivals Kingswood College for the William Weerasinghe trophy and lost to Isipathana College in the opening game and to Science College. They must step up their game as right now they are below form considering their potential.
Kingswood College plays in Segment 1B. A side with some good players but not performing at their best. They are still to win a match, having lost all the three games played to St. Peter's College, Dharmaraja College and to Isipathana College. Their next game is against Science College on April 22 at Bogambara.
Vidyartha College is in Segment 2A. This time they are blessed with a good talented side. Their forwards are playing well and threes are doing their job to their best of knowledge. In the opener they beat Piliyandala Central but went down to Mahanama College in the next game but recovered to beat Prince of Wales College.
St. Sylvester's College plays in Segment 1C. They have good talent and potential to perform well. In their opening game they beat St. Thomas' College Matale and followed it up with wins over Carey College and Ehiliyagoda MMV. Their next game is with Richmond College on April 21.
Sri Sumangala College, Sri Rahula College and Nugawella Central have still to play.
Kandy SC to make it a triple
Former St. Anthony's College rugger captain Lasantha Wijesuriya says that Kandy SC are all out to pocket the Sevens title too and make it a triple, after having won the League and the Clifford Cup knockout.
Lasantha, who led Kandy S.C. to win the triple by being unbeaten for the first time in 1997, should be thankful to his advisor Malik Samarawickrama who guided him on the correct path, and today under his chairmanship Kandy SC have proved to be untouchable. Lasantha said that if not for Malik's backing, Kandy would have never achieved what they have.

Anandi leads Navy Women's hockey team

National hockey player Anandi Rajapkse will captain the star studded Navy Women's team having the largest complement of players this year.
The Navy Women's team have been unbeaten for many years and last year they won all the tournaments they participated namely the Senior Women's Hockey Nationals, the Seetha Devi Sevens and the Defence Service Inter-Services Championships.
Thus Anandi Rajapakse has a challenging task ahead of her to win all the trophies they won last year and also if there are any new tournaments.
Anandi Rajapakse is a product of that famous hockey playing school from Kandy Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya where she was introduced to the game by their longstanding coach M A M Ashroff. She said that she hails from the village of Yakkagahapitiya.
But it has no back ground and you have only the village meadows in which the children play and no organized sports activities, she said.
Then how did she come to represent the country in a sport which is popular only in Matale, Colombo and Kandy and now has taken root in Panadura, Kalutara, Badulla, Negombo and Wennappuwa. She said that one coach Ashroff met her and asked whether she would like to play hockey.
She had heard of this game but never in her life handled a hockey stick. She knew that her akkis (elder sisters) in school were making gaunt strides in this game winning championship after championship. She readily agreed.
That was in 2002 when she had just entered her teens. She was inducted into the under 13 team as left half and she has continued to play in that position. Next we achieved success by winning all island under 17 championship and also the National School Games in the under 19 championship in 2003 and 2004.
The euphoria of success made us set our goals much higher with centre forward Chathurika Wijesuriya spearheading us with her dynamic play. She was very lean but when she gets into action she is virtually unstoppable. Her last year in school was in 2006 and had helped her alma mater to secure many championship titles. She also represented the Kandy Schools and the Central Province Schools. She was also automatic choice to the Central Province women's team from 2006 to 2008.
She first played for Sri Lanka in 2009 and also played in hockey nationals. Earlier she represented the Sri Lanka Schools in many tournaments and made tours abroad. In the year 2012 she joined Sri Lanka Navy and helped them to win many championship titles.
An agile player always having her eye on the ball as the opponents forwards could pounce on the defence at any time with a long pass. Manning the middle line of defence is a tough job she said as it will expose the last line of defence and the custodian and make them vulnerable.
