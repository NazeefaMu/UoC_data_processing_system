Buy back clause in Htota Port agreement
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said that the government had included a buy-back clause in the Hambantota Port agreement between the government and China Merchants Port Holdings to give the former some flexibility within the agreement.
He stated the above in response to a question posed by a journalist at a media briefing yesterday, over the statement that the Chinese side was not happy with the structure of the agreement.
The perception is that we had outright sold 15,000 acres of the country, which is not the case. It was the investment that came in that requires such. Though we have said we would offer a 80 percent stake, we will also retain the option to buy back some when the opportunity arises, said Karunanayake. He further explained that the government did not have the capital required for complete public investment at the Port and hence they had no choice but to go for a public-private partnership.
The Port will start as soon as the go ahead is given.
We are at the concluding phases of the negotiations, said the Minister who added that Cabinet approval for the agreement had already been granted. Media reports this week however reported that the Chinese interests in Hambantota Port could be delayed by several weeks or months as the Chinese have stated that they would only sign the deal if the 15,000 acre industrial zone comes with it. The Chinese plan to invest US$ 5 billion to develop the area within 3-5 years.
Port unions and residents in the area have voiced strong objections to the industrial zone and the sale of the Port with some going to courts to put a halt to the lease of the lands. Hambantota port and Air Port was built in 2008 by former President Mahinda Rajapaksas government with the help of US$ 1.7 billion in Chinese loans.

Worlds oldest aquarium fish dies in his 90s
A lungfish believed to have been the longest-living aquarium fish has been put down due to failing health.
The Shedd Aquarium in Chicago said the fish, in his 90s, was euthanised after losing interest in food and showing signs of organ failure.
Granddad, who weighed 11kg (24lbs), had been seen by more than 100 million people since arriving in Chicago from his native Australia in 1933. He was believed to be in his teens at the time, meaning he could have been in his 90s or possibly beyond the century mark.
A Shedd spokeswoman admitted Granddads exact age was unknown, but that he was believed to be in his mid-90s.
Lungfish, which can live to be more than 100 years old and are a protected species in Australia, have existed for nearly 400 million years and fossils show they have remained unchanged for more than 100 million years.
They are native to two rivers in Queensland, have a single primitive lung and are among the few fish that can breathe air.
Shedd Aquarium president Bridget Coughlin announced his death: For a fish who spent much of his time imitating a fallen log, he sparked curiosity, excitement and wonder among guests of all ages who would hear his story and learn about the incredible biology that makes his species a living fossil and one of the oldest living vertebrate genera on the planet.

Can- Sur-Vive: New hope for Breast Cancer patients and survivors
Observing International Cancer Day in the month of February, Can-Sur-Vive, in collaboration with Jetwing group conducted the 5th CAN  SUR  VIVE CSR program on January 28 at the Lanka Hospitals.
A group of strong- willed women gather every three months not only to share their experiences, and to extend their support to the like-mined but also to educate themselves on various medical and lifestyle issues from a panel of experts.
The workshop aimed to actively educate survivors of breast cancer on medical, physical, financial, spiritual and other related aspects pertaining directly to a cancer survivors well-being while reinstating the survivors and family members confidence. The workshop was enriched with lectures by Consultants, including well-known Clinicians, Psychologist, Occupational therapists, Physiotherapists, Sociologists, financial advisors and Clergymen.
Cancer is undoubtedly a deadly and in certain cases, a fatal disease  however, what affects patients more is the lack of understanding, empathy, and support they have during their ordeals. Even survivors to a great extent pull through not just because of medicine, but because of their own determination. Jetwing has partnered with the CAN-SUR-VIVE Trust ever since inception; as we truly appreciate their efforts to educate both patients and survivors through a variety of unique sessions, and because we have always believed in the power and potential of people to overcome. Their commitment shows that no one is truly ever alone  you always have the help and support you need, as a community. Said Chairman of Jetwing Group, HiranCooray .
The workshop, which was conceived by Consultant Oncological Surgeon of Lanka Hospitals PLC, Dr. Naomal Perera, focuses on the lives of breast cancer survivors and their role in society. The Can-Sur-Vive Trust, has been fully functional for the last one year and is being held for the benefit of the survivors, with the main purpose being to register as many survivors for additional assistance they may require with their everyday lives.
Can  Sur- Vive workshops address the issues faced by the survivors of breast cancer  their psychological needs, Physical and sexual issues stemming from disfiguration and therapy as well as many other important topics such as nutrition and exercise said Dr. Naomal Perera.
We want these women to be proud and outspoken, for them to realize that there is hope and help and mostly for them to be independent. added Dr. Perera.
I was diagnosed of breast cancer four years ago. The news shook my world. But look at me today. I am well. I am happy. Can- Sur-Vive workshops helped me in numerous ways. I want to educate women of the foreseeable advantage of forums like this. Malkanthi Pathirana, a breast cancer survivor spoke with conviction. Pathirana is one of many survivors who won the battle against breast cancer; the most common cancer among women, the world over.
Although the survivor is often used to mean someone who has completed active treatment, CAN  SUR  VIVE program intends to invite all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who are presently on treatment too. -LH

Chinese Ambassador warns: Htota protests will put off investors
No private land will be taken without owners consent:
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianling expressed his concerns that the protests in Hambantota may turn away the investors who have already agreed to invest in the proposed industrial zone down south.
The Ambassador, highlighting the importance of the industrial zone to support the operations of the Hambantota Port, assured that no private land would be taken without permission of the owners for the purpose.
Xianling made these remarks delivering the 13th Sujatha Jayawardena Memorial Oration organized by the Colombo University Alumni Association held at BMICH on the topic One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative.
I already persuaded 10 CEOs of big companies to invest USD 3-5 billion in the next two to three years. Most of them belong to the 500 Fortune companies. However, if protests continue how can I persuade them When they approach me I asked them to get the answers from the Sri Lankan leaders, not from me. However I encourage them to invest here and I am confident that the corporation between Sri Lanka and China will be a success in the future he said. The Chinese ambassador largely digressing from his prepared speech took pains to allay the doubts on the Hambantota port project and explain that China is not interested in meddling with internal politics in the country. When I addressed more than 2,000 locals in Hambantota during a Chinese cultural performance at the International Convention Centre I promised to them that we will not take their lands without their own permission. I talked to the District Secretary and explained that we would just use the BOI lands and lands already available at the port for the first phase of the project, he said. The port belongs to Sri Lanka. The Chinese investment of USD 1.1 billion is to operate 80 percent of it. No contract or agreement is made yet. Only the framework agreement has been signed. Whatever the share we get, we will fully respect the Government procedure and consensus of the people. We have no intention to intervene in the internal differences between politicians or political groups or former, current and future leaders, he stated.
Elaborating on the importance of industrial zone, he observed many developed countries such as Singapore, Japan and the US and achieved fast development through special zones.
This is also the way to protect your land and environment. Otherwise you cannot have industries anywhere he pointed out.
The Ambassador said the advice of the Chinese President to him during the delay of Colombo port city project was to be patient and work cordially with the Sri Lankan Government and its people. I have time and I have patience, but I am worried about the patience of the business community, he said.
China and Sri Lanka have no disputes and differences generally. Of course, I have some differences with some Ministers, but this is not a difference between the two states. China is already the number one financial supporter to Sri Lanka. Last year our grants, donations and commercial and concessionary loans to Sri Lanka amount to RMB 10 billion, he added.

Why not make CMC rates also payable through ATMs
The utility payments such as water bills (from NWSDB), electricity bills (from both CEB and LECO), and telephone bills (from SLT and other mobile operators) could be very easily settled at any time convenient to the consumer through CDM/ATM/kiosks installed at leading banks. This facility, both card and cardless transactions, is very time saving as you dont have to take a token and await your turn/ wait in a queue to settle these bills.
This is to suggest that the Colombo Municipal Council should collaborate with banks so that the Property tax (rates) also could be paid through the above machines which is operative 24/7 and also user friendly. Otherwise, the rate payers have to visit the Municipality to settle these assessment rates which will be very time consuming with the heavy traffic nowadays.

Civilisation is calling
History of Civilizations across the world reveals that towns originated in the major riverine civilizations such as Mesopotamia located in between the river basins of Tigris and Euphrates, Egyptian civilization in the Nile river valley, Harappa in the Indus River Valley in modern day Pakistan and northern India and in China the riverine civilizations found by the river valleys of Hwang Ho and Yangzi.
These unique civilizations emerged in river valleys due to the fact that hunter gatherers found it convenient to settle down in river valleys due to numerous reasons. They learnt how to domesticate food crops and animals. Over the years, both men and women in the riverine civilizations experienced the annual floods and adjusted themselves to the vagaries of weather patterns and climatic changes.
Rivers provided the inhabitants of river valleys water which was indispensable for the development of agriculture, and in addition the most essential requirement for the human and the animal survival. Annual floods of the rivers deposited alluvial soil on the flood plains which facilitated the cultivation of excess of food crops more than what was required to feed the riverine communities.
Availability of excess of agricultural products in the riverine civilizations paved the way for the rest of the members of these societies to concentrate on non-agricultural ventures for their livelihoods.
The urban culture that emerged in the Indus River Valley and the surrounding area was known as Harappa which was excavated in the third millennium B.C. on the banks of Ravi River which was a tributary of Indus River. Indus Valley Civilization is also known as Harappa Civilization as it was the first city to be excavated in the Indus River Valley. In 1861 Archaeological Survey of India under the British Colonial Administration initiated the excavations of Harappa and Mohenjo- Daro the two major cities of Indus River Valley.
Pre-urban to the mature urban
In addition to the major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro,the ruins of other towns excavated in the Indus Valley were Kot Diji (Sind), Kalibangan (Rajastan), Rupar (Punjab), Rakhigarhi, Banawali, Mitathal (Haryana), ports of Lothal and Dholavira, Surkotada (Gujarat). Another location yet to be excavated is Ganweriwala (Bahawalpur).
The extent of the land area covered by larger cities was around hundred hectares and smaller towns were found to be half of that size. Total land area influenced by Harappan Civilization was around 1.3 million square kilometres or 502,006 square miles. Harappa Civilization was divided into different periods. This division was made from the late fourth millennium and continued to 2,600 B.C. The Mature Harappan period from 2,600 B.C. to 1900 B.C. and the Late Harappan to 1750 B.C. The period known as Early Harappan was preferred rather than Pre Harappan period due its continuation towards the Mature Harappan period. The series of town-ships found scattered in the Bolan area such as Mehrgarh, Pirak and Nowshehra and the settlements at Harappa had shown a unique and speedy transition from the pre-urban to the mature urban and finally towards the declining phase of the civilization.
Harappan society which was the earliest urban society in India brought power and wealth to the Indus River Valley. The worlds highest mountains of Hindu Kush and the Himalayas drained water to the Indus river from torrential rain and melting snow which contributed immensely in the formation of an agricultural society in the Indus valley.
Surplus of Agricultural products fed the city dwellers of the two major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. Archaeologists had excavated about 1500 Harappan settlements along the Indus River valley. As a direct result of increased agricultural yields the population also grew rapidly and by 3000B.C. Neolithic villages in the Indus valley gradually transformed into thriving urban cities. The early inhabitants of the Indus River valley cultivated wheat and barley. After the flood receded they collected the harvests in the following spring.
Meat obtained from domesticated herds of cattle, sheep and goats supplemented their staple food comprised of barley and wheat. The Urban splendor of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro could be attributed to the rural wealth provided by the Indus River Valley inhabitants.
Brick platforms
Archaeological excavations carried out in the City of Mohenjo- Daro (Mound of the Dead Man) built around 2,500 B.C. and located in Larkana District in the province of Sind in Pakistan. Excavations carried out In Mohenjo-Daro brought to light that Goldsmiths, Potters, Weavers, Masons and Architects were among other professionals who ran their business centres that lined the ancient streets in the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro. Modern name of Mohenjo-Daro had been given different meanings such as Mount of Mohan and Mohan is identified as Krishna and Mound of the Dead Man.
Iravatham Mahadevan an archaeologist analyzing a Mohenjo Daro Seal believed the citys ancient name could have been Kukkutarama having the connotation The City of Cockerel. Ancient city of Mohenjo -Daro was famous for the domestication of chicken for ritual purposes. The ancient cities of Harbappa and Mohenjo Daro represented highly sophisticated knowledge of city planning and maintenance. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were divided into small Citadel area to the west where important institutions beneficial for the maintenance of civic life located including the shrines used for public rituals.
Larger residential areas were found in the eastern side of the city. Harappan city planners appeared to have paid greater attention on maintaining urban order and an efficient economic system of management of lands, labour and water. Foundation for the buildings of the Citadel was made out of man-made brick platforms as a safety measure against floods because the majority of the cities were located on the banks of Indus river and its tributaries. Rivers facilitated the trade and exchange of the numerous products of Indus River Valley and also in obtaining the raw material from the neighbouring regions.
Archaeological findings
Grid pattern was followed in the city planning of the Harappa Civilization. The public buildings and big houses were built on the streets while the modest houses were built on the lanes. Stones were not used as a building material in the Indus River Valley Civilization instead burnt bricks and sun-dried bricks and of equal size had been used extensively in the Cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.
Both Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had city walls, a fortified citadel and a large granary. The granary would have served both as the centre for the collection of and redistribution of taxes paid in the form of grain.
In both the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro there were market places, temples, public buildings and extensive residential districts required human labour. After analyzing the archaeological findings of these two ancient cities, archaeologists came to the conclusion that Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were the earliest known examples of deliberately planned well managed cities. Houses had been built in Harappa taking into consideration the environmental conservation. Houses had been laid out to protect the residents from noise pollution and the protection of residential privacy. Residents of these cities had their own water wells both for the sanitary purposes and ritual practices.
In the city of Harappa ruins had been excavated of a great granary of 169 feet by 135 feet. Two other rooms had also been found attached to the granary with a common courtyard. Two rooms were believed to have been used by the workers or the slaves engaged in thrashing the corn to be stored in the granary.

Dead insect cake feast
Loved-up customers wereoffered a rather unique Valentines Day menu - cocktails and cakes served up with added dead insects.
Diners were given the option of chowing down on bug carcasses or innards, that had been mixed into their alcoholic drinks or sweet desserts.
The imported giant water bugs from Thailand part of a special Valentines Day-themed event at the Duranbar bar in downtown Tokyo on Sunday.
The bar served up whipped cream, cakes and cocktails laden with insect bodies and innards for the event, which organisers said brought in around 90 people. Customers said the event helped them overcome their fear of bugs.
My impression of bugs were that they are dirty and scary. But this cocktail is fruity and tasty...and this bug has a really nice smell so I think there is potential for it to be food, said 20-year-old student Saki Osawa.
Among popular items served were a cranberry and water bug cocktail and caramelized worms with walnuts, which went for 800-1000 yen (5-7) each.
They [insects] are crispy like the skin of walnuts and go pretty well with chocolate. I hope this will be made into a product, said 20-year-old customer Sayumi Makino, who has never eaten bugs before.
While insects can be found in some regional cuisines in Japan, theyre not commonly eaten across the country.
Yuta Shinohara, the organiser of the event, is keen to promote insects as an alternative food culture in Japan.
I love insects and I think its really fun to eat them. Im quite confident of the potential of insects and of how attractive they are and eating insects are now in the spotlight from the point of view of food sustainability and also the environment. But first of all, we have to get people to think that [eating insects] is fun and interesting, said Shinohara.
Shinohara, who has consumed insects from an early age, has held similar events making things such as cricket ramen.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recognised insect consumption as a more environmentally-friendly source of protein globally. Mirror

Dogs love chilling to reggae
Listening to music with your dog Fido wont have a bone to pick with reggae.
A new study published in the journal Physiology and Behavior suggests that dogs in animal shelters prefer listening to reggae and soft rock more than other musical genres.
Researchers with the Scottish SPCA and the University of Glasgow studied how different musical genres affected the stress levels of shelter dogs.
The dogs wore heart monitors while listening to different music styles, including Motown, pop and classical.
Reggae skanked its way to the on top at reducing canine stress, according to a news release.
Overall, the response to different genres was mixed highlighting the possibility that like humans, our canine friends have their own individual music preferences, University of Glasgow professor Neil Evans said in the release. That being said, reggae music and soft rock showed the highest positive changes in behavior.
Evans believes the results make a good case for piping in music into animal shelters, which can be stressful and scary to newly arrived dogs.
We want the dogs to have as good an experience as they can in a shelter, Evans told the Washington Post, adding that people considering pet adoption want a dog who is looking very relaxed and interacts with them.
Buzz60 correspondent Adam Cardona notes in the video at the top that dogs preferences for reggae and soft rock proves that dogs are basically everyones dad.
That mans best friend thing makes a lot more sense now, he added.
As a result of the study, the Scottish SPCA now plans to install sound systems into all of its kennels complete with a canine-approved playlist.

Due to MP Gunawardenas derogatory remarks: Lottery tickets down by 15% : LDA Secy
Secretary to the Lottery Dealers' Association(LDA) B.S.S Madarasinghe, condemned remarks made by MP Bandula Gunawardena concerning the National Lotteries Board.
The percentage of sales have gone down by 15 percent as a result of his derogatory remarks made against the National Lotteries Board, he said, addressing the media yesterday in Colombo. More recently, MP Gunawardena told the media that the public trust over lotteries had breached for the first time in history, following the Rs 5 levy imposed on lotteries by the 2017 Budget. He further alleged that although the President ordered the Lotteries Board to reduce the price of lottery tickets back to Rs 20, retailers were still selling lottery tickets at Rs 30. Madarasinghe said lottery sales have been good since January 2015. There are a few issues. But discussions are taking place to solve them, he said.
He further said that Gunawardena had made these remarks when the unions had finally found a solution to the problem by talking to the President. The Lotteries Board had been enriching the lives of the people. The main objective of the board was to assist the government to raise finances, Minuwangoda Provincial Councilor W.N. P Ariyadhasa said.
He said that Gunwardena failed to speak about the corruption that took place before the 2015 Presidential election in the Lotteries Boards.

E. Palaniswami is new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister
Edappadi K Palaniswami took oath as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister yesterday ending the 10-day political drama in Tamil Nadu which witnessed AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala and rebel O Panneerselvam involved in a bitter battle over the CMs chair. Palaniswami, a Sasikala loyalist, is the third Tamil Nadu Chief Minister in less than three months. Governor C.Vidyasagar Rao has given Palaniswami 15 days to prove his majority in the Assembly.
On Wednesday evening, Palaniswami had met Rao and submitted a list of 124 MLAs supporting him in the 234-member Tamil Nadu Assembly, and requested the Governor to invite him to form the government. The Governor later also met the OPS faction.
The Tamil Nadu crisis started after J Jayalalithaas death on December 5 triggered a massive succession war within the ruling AIADMK.
Meanwhile, Sasikala Natarajan may have been thwarted by the judiciary, but the jailed general secretary of the ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu appears to be on a stronger wicket for now at least.
She has successfully managed to get her confidante, Edapaddi Palaniswami, into power, two days after the Supreme Court convicted her in a corruption case dating back to the 90s.
With the decision of the state governor - who had been delaying choosing the next chief minister - to appoint Palaniswami as chief minister, Sasikala has the last laugh from her prison cell in Bangalore. Palaniswami is her trusted man, at least for the moment. He may be able to gather his own clout and emerge as an independent leader, but as of now that is only a distant possibility.
O.Panneerselvam, who was sworn in as caretaker chief minister after the death of Jayalalitha in December, was vacillating between rebellion and loyalty to Sasikala. He chose to rebel in theatrical fashion, conducting a 40-minute meditation at Jayalalithas memorial at Marina Beach in Chennai (Madras) before declaring that he was pressured to resign. But his rebellion came rather late in the day. He could never recover the ground he had lost. Sasikalas elevation by the party had been questioned by acting chief minister O Panneerselvam, who said he had been forced to resign to make way for her. Her candidacy for the top job had been questioned, since she has never been elected to public office.
Sasikalas role was always that of aide and confidante - she had never been given any formal role by Jayalalitha in the party or the state government.
But analysts say her proximity to power allowed her and her extended family to wield huge influence. - HINDUSTAN TIMES

GMOA to up the tempo from next week
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will strengthen the ongoing countrywide awareness campaign and go for strong trade union action from next week to protest against the Higher Education Ministers shameless efforts to mislead the public ignoring carrying out his official duty on SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, he said that a part of the responsibility of ensuring the quality of the medical education in Sri Lanka in order to provide a safe and high quality medical service to the people belongs to the Higher Education Minister.
The GMOA is carefully watching whether the Higher Education Minister is taking decisions in order to protect the future of the country and its people without giving into money.
According to Dr. Zoysa, what the Higher Education Minister should do now is obtain the Compliance Certificate for SAITM from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). If he cannot do it, he should cancel the gazette notification issued by the Higher Education Ministry in the past during the time of former Higher Education Minister S.B.Dissanayake. The current Higher Education Minister has powers to do so under the Universities Act number 16 of 1978.
Dr.Zoysa pointed out that former Higher Education Minister S.B.Dissanayake issued a `gazette notification without a date in 2011 pointing out the shortcomings in SAITM and again issued another back dated `gazette notification in 2013 without the Compliance Certificate from the SLMC which says that SAITM has met all requirements from 2009.
But in 2009, the SAITM did not have the hospital.
The SAITM made a request to obtain degree awarding status in 2011 and not in 2009 as stated in the 2103 gazette notification.
The Court of Appeal judgement very clearly says that the female medical student got admitted to SAITM in 2009 in order to obtain Russian MD degree but came out from SAITM in 2016 with a SAITM MBBS degree, Dr.Zoysa added.

Hackett found alive and sober after disappearance
SYDNEY, THURSDAY: Olympic swimming great Grant Hackett is alive and sober, his father told media Thursday after he went missing following a family bust-up, sparking fears for his safety.
Hacketts father Neville said Australias troubled former 1500m world record-holder, who was briefly detained this week after a domestic incident, was in contact with police.
Police officers are happy hes alive and sober, Neville Hackett said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
Hes told the police officers he just wants to hide from everybody. Hacketts father raised the alarm earlier Thursday after his mentally disturbed son, 36, failed to turn up for appointments with a doctor and a lawyer.
Hackett had posted a picture on social media showing himself with a black eye, and accused his brother of beating him up.
Hes in hiding from everybody, including us, Hacketts father said. I think hes very, very embarrassed, but lets see how things go. The double Olympic gold medallist was released without charge Wednesday after his family called police following a reported bout of heavy drinking which led to uncontrollable rage.
His brother, Craig, said the former swimmer had mental health problems and was no longer the person he once knew.
On Thursday, Hackett a picture of himself on Instagram showing a cut and blackened right eye, and dry blood on his nose.
My brother comments to the media... but does anyone know he beat the shit out of me, Hackett wrote in the caption.
Hackett came out of six years of troubled retirement in 2014 in a bid to make the Rio Games, hoping to become the oldest Australian swimmer to qualify for an Olympics.
But he narrowly missed out on a berth and after the Olympic trials in Adelaide last April, he hit the headlines again after a meltdown on a plane.
Hackett was accused of drunkenly squeezing the nipple of a fellow business-class passenger in an embarrassing incident which prompted him to vow to quit drinking.
This is now a chronic problem... so, from a mental health perspective, I hope something can be done, Craig Hackett said Wednesday. This is not Grant Hackett, this is a completely different person. I dont know this person, my mum and dad dont know this person.
Hes there in body, but he is not there in mind, in soul, or spirit, he said.
Hackett mumbled a few words to reporters after his release, saying he was not great and probably needed to go into rehab.
Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates and Swimming Australia both offered their support.
We are concerned for Grants welfare, Coates said in a statement. This is not the Grant we know and respect.
Grant is a great Olympic champion, one of the greatest swimmers of all time... We hope he can overcome his current challenges. Swimming Australia chief executive Mark Anderson added: Given these recent circumstances, we once again reached out to Grant and his family to continue to offer support and assistance in any way we can. Hackett retired after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, having won the 1500m freestyle at both the 2000 Sydney and 2004 Athens Games. He also claimed four world titles in the 30-length event. AFP

HNB partners UnionPay cards to launch POS acceptance
HNB announced a new partnership with UnionPay International, to accept card payments from one of the largest payment networks in the world.
Through the new agreement, Sri Lankan merchants who operate HNB Point-of-Sales (POS) devices will now be able to accept UnionPay cards, empowering businesses across the island - particularly with regard to the formal and informal hotel sector, traditional crafts, jewellery and restaurants,to cater to a massive new market of potential customers with ease.
HNB's partnership with UnionPay International is without any doubt a historic achievement for the Sri Lankan banking industry. Over the last year alone Sri Lanka recorded tourist arrivals from China well in excess of 270,000 visitors and it is anticipated that these figures will only increase in the coming year.
By moving proactively to partner with UnionPay International, we believe HNB has taken a vital first step towards further integrating Sri Lanka into the international economic system while at the same time, supporting Sri Lankan businesses to tap into a large and lucrative new customer demographic, Card Centre Senior Manager Roshantha Jayatunge said.
We are delighted to be partnering with HNB. Sri Lanka is an important market for UnionPay International in South Asia.We are uniquely positioned and ready to contribute to the growth of the tourism industry in Sri Lanka by providing travellers with the secure and easy payment option. Senior Head of South Asia of UnionPay International Derek Chang said.
Now, the UnionPay global acceptance network has expanded to 160 countries and regions, providing safe, convenient and preferential payment services for its global cardholders. With more than 6 billion cards issued accumulatively in 40 countries and regions, UnionPay has not only become the major payment brand of the Chinese outbound tourists, but is also the preferred payment option for an increasing number of customers from markets outside mainland China.
HNB currently stands as the dominant leader in card acceptance in the Sri Lankan market and together with the roll out of UnionPay International in Sri Lanka, the bank also plans a similar expansion into the Maldivian market later this year.

The Finance Minister addressing a media briefing at the Finance Ministry yesterday, said the factory was not closed but the issues surrounding the granting of land was being resolved by Development Strategies and International Trade Minster Malik Samarawickrema.
Nandana Lokuwithana, the businessman behind the factory, promised an investment of US$ 75 million for it and the government earlier granted him 100 acres of land on a 99-year lease for an annual rent of just Rs 100 an acre. When the deal was made public, President Sirisena issued an order to suspend the project and Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has insisted that the President suspended the project because Lokuwithana was a close ally of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and was allegedly involved in various scandals, the minister said.
Karunanayake however quipped that the project was not suspended and that the fact that the businessman had dealings with the previous regime, was not a reason to not do business with him now,
There is no law which states that just because you deal with one government, you cannot deal with the next. They are all investments, the minister said.

A win will take Sri Lanka closer towards qualification, while South Africa will make it with a triumph since the result will eliminate the chances of a five-way tie at the end of the Super Six, in which sides carry over wins against other qualifiers from their preliminary league group and play qualifiers from the other group.
For host Sri Lanka, Chamari Atapattu, Prasadani Weerakkoddy, Eshani Lokusuriyage and Nipuni Hansika have all been among the runs and with its spin attack led by captain Inoka Ranaweera too doing well, the side has suddenly found new inspiration ahead of the South Africa match.
We are really looking forward to the match against South Africa. We have played some fine matches in the tournament and our win against Pakistan has given us more confidence. We are determined to put up a good all-round performance, said Sri Lanka captain Inoka Ranaweera.
South Africa captain Dane van Niekerk understands the importance of the Sri Lanka fixture and was not happy with the teams batting as it lost by 49 runs to India in its opening Super Six game, during which she became the seventh player to complete an ODI double of 100 wickets and 1000 runs.
We keep on speaking about our batting and the base up front but we are not quite getting it right. So, that is something we want to rectify as the team is looking out for that, said van Niekerk.
We are still a quality side and I still back ourselves to qualify. That is our main goal. We will think about winning the tournament later. Sri Lanka against South Africa will be a great challenge.
India leads the Super Six points table with three wins, which comprise two preliminary league wins and one against South Africa on Wednesday, while Sri Lanka and South Africa have four points with two wins each. Though India may make the grade even without another win, beating Bangladesh on Friday at the NCC grounds will seal qualification.
In another match at the CCC grounds, Pakistan will be looking to beat Ireland and breathe easy ahead of its last match against arch rival India.
The top four sides from the Super Six qualify for the ICC Womens World Cup 2017 and the ICC Womens Championship.

International consequences of Brexit
Often the crowd betrays the people- Victor Hugo
As Britain sets its course towards exiting the European Union (EU) this year, the EU, plagued with economic uncertainty and issues of immigration and security, has found itself questioning its very form and identity. President of the Constitutional Council of France and former French Premier, Laurent Fabius however was of the opinion that Brexit was an opportunity for Europe to restructure the Union towards a more strong alliance in future.
Delivering a lecture on Europe and the International Order, Post-Brexit at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies on Tuesday, he spoke of an unpredictable future for Europe, as the extreme political right and populist ideas take hold of the political sphere of the continent.
Though Europe is mostly moderate and strong supporters of democratic values, the extreme right is taking the lead in many polls. In Columbia at the same time, a long awaited agreement which puts an end to a 50 year civil war- an agreement awarded the Nobel Peace Prize is turned down by a referendum.
In many places, autocrats and populist ideas are taking the lead. Last June, in the UK, Brexit won in spite of the opposition stance exhibited by most rational elites. It would not be wise for me or you to take for granted the international consequences of Brexit, said Fabius.
Europe after Brexit
However as the European Union celebrates 60 years this year, Fabius observed that the European community was no longer that of its founding fathers.
The European community we know today came into being in 1992. In 1973 the UK had joined the Union amidst protests from General De Gaulle and in 2004, we had the arrival of 10 member states from Central and Eastern Europe. Today we have 28 members; 27 when UK withdraws, he explained.
With a 510 million community our motto is unity in diversity, but today many people feel that diversity is stronger than unity, he added.
The main reason for such scepticism according to Fabius was, Not the rejection of the EU but mistrust of the Unions capacity for concrete action.
Does the Union work
Over half a century since the establishment of the Union, member states who came together to look for joint economic prosperity have both achieved as much successes as failures. As the EU became a leading economy in the world, economic and social disparities within member states as well as between has also grown. Fabius also explained that with the rise of other economic power houses, coupled with average growth in the EU over the last few decades, the feeling of Euro scepticism has spread further.
In the advent of Brexit, perception has been ripe that the European economy would suffer further and Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, Mangala Samaraweera questioned the future of trade between the EU and Sri Lanka after Brexit, but Fabius assured that Europe would continue to be an economic power, irrespective of the impact of Brexit,
One third of exports from Sri Lanka go to the EU and the EU is a major financier of infrastructure projects in the country. With the lifting of the fishing embargo last year and this years elimination of the GSP plus ban, the EU will consolidate itself as a major trading partner in the years to come, he said.
He reiterated that perception that the EU was not doing much for the economies of its members and the world was mainly because most governments failed to communicate European achievements but were quick to blame the EU for decisions and situations they themselves were responsible for.
The same is probably true for here. How many are aware that EU has dispensed mostly in grants, nearly 800 million euros over the past decade for a wide variety of development projects and has allocated 250 million euros on development projects by 2020 France alone gave 160 million euros for bridge reconstruction and for water projects in hospitals as part of the reconstruction after the Tsunami, said Fabius.
Another reason for Euro scepticism was the institutional scheme of the Union which has made Europeans feel that they have less and less power over decisions that concern them, The institutional scheme contributes to lack of vision and creates distance between Europe and the general public, he said.
Finally a major reason for lack of faith in the Union was the issue of borders, security and immigration.
The number of member states and its geographical expansion has been worrying. Many questions are raised over the Balkans and Turkey. There is new doubt over the European identity, questions concerning its own borders, migration and security and this played a role in Brexit and it persists in other EU countries, said Fabius.
Despite all these concerns however, the former French Premier insisted that in the last three years alone, the Union had made admirable progress, The EU economic policy has shifted considerably; until recently it was only concerned with Budget reconsolidation, but now the issue of growth and investment has become top priority. Interventions of the EU central bank have been positive and 350 billion euro in investment projects are planned and we have achieved a banking union for better regulation of finance.
Europe has also been taking action in countering terrorism, the massive inflow of immigrants and Greek Financial crisis- they may not be perfect but action was taken, he said.
Britain obtained significant economic concessions from the EU but the people were not convinced. It is not an easy task for a government to win a referendum and most British governments have been criticising the EU for decades so it was not easy to ask voters to remain. An important lesson in this is that very sensitive issues such as immigration which took centre stage and that led to an unfortunate result. Brexit leaves several victims in its wake- Great Britain, its member states and the EU itself, said Fabius.
All lose
The EU which has been annoyed to say the least with Brexit, has also started to worry that this may leave room for others to follow.
Brexit will open a breach in the EU construction. We have made constant progress up to now and Brexit was a step back, it may open the path to other forms of divisions, said Fabius who also worried that it would also spell a period of economic uncertainty for all.
Economic uncertainty
To formally withdraw from the Union, the UK has to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty which provides voluntary withdrawal for member states. UK is to put it into effect by the end of March and according to the Supreme Court decision, the House of Common gave its vote and the final vote by the House of Lords is to be expected by March. And then the new terms of cooperation between the UK and the EU would be long drawn out- for two or more years, said Fabius.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has announced that the UK will leave the single market but, as Fabius pointed out, there is no mention of what the precise rules maybe, particularly with regard to custom policies, border control, residency rights and EU migrant worker rights.
The economic sector wants predictability and legal support, he said.
Brexit, he predicted could also jeopardize the unity within the Union as Scotland and Northern Ireland have been opposed to it and have voiced their support for the EU.
With such difficulties created by Brexit, Fabius made it clear that the EU would ensure that the UK pays for Brexit.
International balance
We will have to expect many changes. We do not know if the UK will continue to participate in EU field operations, such as the fight against terrorism in the Sahel or migrant smuggling in the Mediterranean Sea, said Fabius.
The UK may verify certain positions, not so much in NATO but to the UN Security Council where it is a permanent member. He also predicted that it would probably strengthen its ties with the US- as the recent state visit of US President Trump to the UK suggested.
As for historical partners within the commonwealth, contradictory arguments were made. Brexiters say stronger links with the commonwealth would happen but others say that a weaker UK would be less attractive and if it was opposed to EU immigration, it will be even more opposed to all immigration, he said. Fabius also noted that EUs weight in major conferences such as the G8 would be weakened with the UK leaving its fold.
In the end however, the precise conditions of the exit would determine international relations- whether it is a soft Brexit or hard.
In the event of a soft Brexit, the UK would leave the single EU market but would not completely cut off ties and they could renegotiate negotiateed specific customs agreements with member states and the applicable laws would be similar to that of today. Switzerland already has such an agreement with the EU.
But many EU leaders are calling for a firm hand in negotiations, insisting that Brexit means Brexit. In other words, the UK cannot have one foot in and another out, benefitting from certain privileges while imposing restraints on mechanisms of solidarity, said Fabius.
If pushed for a hard Brexit, a position the British PM has advocated for, there would be complete breakoff from the Union. The vacuum will have to be encountered with new national legislation in many sectors and trade and investment by major international groups would slow down. The financial passport which allowed banks and financial institutions which established in the UK to work freely throughout EU would disappear. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that if differences with the EU were wider than expected, the UK then might implement aggressive competitive tax strategy targeting its neighbours and in which event the EU would probably react and we will have a situation which is negative for everybody, said Fabius.
Reforming the Union
The consequences of Brexit thus has made many question the future of the Union and Fabius said that this was a good opportunity to force the EU to clarify its own strategies and operations. This is an opportunity to define the face of Europe of the future, he said.
Prior to such a move, they would have to deal with the challenge of building a more coherent union with just 27 members, build a stronger political union to face powers such as US, China and India and to build a union with greater solidarity to foster social progress, culture, research, economic progress, innovation and sustainable development.
In addition, the biggest challenge to Europe has been changing and shifting notions of what Europe is. Migration as well as shifting borders has led to many Europeans preferring to close their doors to cooperation with others. But Fabius believed that if they could change the structure of the Union by having a three circled Europe- they could engage differently with member states through a concept of a differentiated Europe- making tensions between the so called other less apparent.
The stretch of Europe must be specified as the question of immigration, security and borders have grown urgent. Lack of clarity in these areas explains the dissolution felt by Europeans, he said as he explained what the three circled European structure would look like.
Europe could agree on some shared principles for say 2030 and bring together partners who are willing to move forward together- where most willing states can advance at the same pace, away from those who are not ready at that moment or who are not ready for greater integration, he said. The concept was being discussed more as General elections in several major countries this year particularly France and Germany stressed the need for it, he said.
The first circle which would include countries like France and Germany, would, Move quickly to deepen their economic and social integration. These countries should determine to manage economies together and plan legal, situational and economic means to do so and cooperate on diplomatic, military, scientific and research areas. It would be open to all member states who are ready in this shared sovereignty and joint efforts this change requires, he added.
The second circle would include all 27 member states and some of these countries over time may integrate with the first circle. It would be wrong to force them to do so now and it will hold back the first circle from action, said Fabius.
The third circle would then allow countries geographically close to Europe but not given membership in the foreseeable future to work with the EU.
The Union cannot expand infinitely but this will be handy for countries like Turkey which has been involved in the process for membership for the last 50 years. Certain privileges of the EU without full membership, said Fabius.
He advocated that this would also help the Europeans as well as non-Europeans understand the architecture of Europe and where their own country fits in the project. This will be useful if one is to implement genuine security policy within and outside of Europe, he said.
For example, we can only control immigration if we are certain of the Unions borders and the obligation of each state. If you want to build European defence policy which in no way contradicts NATO policy, we need a position on where it stands, added Fabius.
Another possible scheme after Brexit- would be where different groups of countries could be built according to different competencies- called enforced cooperation.
For example frontiers wont be the same for energy, monetary or defence policy. Chancellor Merkel has said she was thinking of a possible scheme for a differentiated Europe for energy, he explained.
No matter what shape Europe takes in future however, Fabius was insistent that there was now Room and necessity for shift in the EU construction, and Brexit made it not only possible but necessary, making it even more needed that countries such as Sri Lanka renegotiate its relationship with Europe as well as the United Kingdom.

JO to boycott CA Public Finance Committee activities
The Joint Opposition (JO) members in the Public Finance Committee of the Constitutional Assembly have decided to boycott committee activities, UPFA parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
He alleged that the government was trying to introduce federalism to the country through the new Constitution.
The MP said the government has already drafted a Constitution secretly. Gunawardena said he was the chairman of the committee, and the committee members agreed that the central government and Parliament should have control over public finance.
Parliament should have the responsibility with regard to government revenue, taxes, expenditure and foreign loans, he said.
Gunawardena said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition have already announced that they would not support any constitutional reform that would be detrimental to the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Six subcommittees were set up as supporting bodies to the Steering Committee. These committees will develop constitutional principles for the consideration of the Steering Committee in respect of the designated subject areas, the MP said.
Speaking at a press conference at the former Presidents office in Battaramulla, Gunawardena said the joint opposition members of the public fianc committee participated in eight committee meetings and this committee obtained the assistance from experts from many institutions including the Finance Ministry, Auditor Generals Department and Inland Revenue Department.

Judge tosses out defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby

A federal judge inMassachusettshas dismissed a defamation lawsuit against comedianBill Cosby, although he still faces criminal charges inPennsylvania.
Judge Mark Mastroianni ruled Thursday that Katherine McKee didn't adequately show Cosby defamed her when his representatives called a 2014 New York Daily News story on her rape allegations defamatory and demanded a retraction.
The former actress alleged the 79-year-old Cosby raped her in a Detroit hotel in 1974.
McKee was among dozens of women to come forward with allegations recently and among at least eight suing for defamation in Massachusetts, where Cosby owns a home.
Cosby's lawyers called Thursday's decision the "correct outcome." McKee's attorneys didn't immediately comment.
In Pennsylvania, "The Cosby Show" star has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a former employee at Temple University.

Kandy SC opens Clifford Cup k/o against CH today
Defending champions Kandy Sports Club will go all out to assert their supremacy when they play host to CH & FC in their Clifford Cup quarterfinal fixture at Nittawela today at 4.15 pm.
On current form Kandy SC will not have any difficulty in beating CH whom they have twice thrashed in the league matches scoring over 50 points in each match. Kandy is expected to carry on from where they left off last Sunday and continue their winning vein into the knockouts.
For todays match Kandy will include the best young talent they have at their disposal. Kandy has been playing cohesive rugby which has unsettled many of their opponents. Another incentive to the Kandy SC side is the encouragement given by their trustee Malik Samarawickrema.
Kandy SC had their final work out last morning and the two coaches Sean Wijesinghe and his assistant Nalaka Weerakody who put the players through their paces has in consultation with the rugby committee decided to make a few changes from the side that played CH last Sunday.
In the forwards play, Kandy SC should get the better of their opponents and give the Colombo lads a torrid time. Their backs have been performing with good understanding as they have proved in the league games. Their backs have regularly provided that extra pace which has made their task easier. Their strong point against CH will be their back division.
CH & FC will be at full strength, but will face a tough task to stop their opponents from going on another scoring spree. A better show is expected from the Maitland Crescent Club. But whatever they do it is going to be a difficult task for them to match the champion Kandy outfit.

Malaysia Airlines flight to Colombo turns back to KL due to technical problem

A Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight bound for Colombo was forced to turn back to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) earlier today (17) due to technical problems, the airline said.
Malaysia Airlines said flight MH179, which departed from KLIA at 10.10pm on Thursday, was forced to turn back when its auxiliary power unit (APU) was unable to start.
"The aircraft landed uneventfully at 1.50am today," it said in a statement.
The APU is a backup power unit that is required to be switched on when an aircraft crosses over water.
Malaysia Airlines said due to closure of Bandaranaike International Airport for scheduled maintenance at the runway, an immediate retiming was not possible and passengers were accommodated at nearby hotels.
It said the flight would now operate as MH179D and depart KLIA at 3.30pm and arrive in Colombo at 4.35pm (local time), today.
Malaysia Airlines said the return leg MH178D was retimed to depart Colombo at 5.10pm (local time) the same day and arrive in Kuala Lumpur at 11.20pm.
"Safety is Malaysia Airlines' number one priority at all times," it said.
The airline apologised to all its guests for the disruption to their travel plans.

Many fruitful measures taken for peoples benefit: Govt aims a healthy nation: President
The government's policy is to strengthen the health service aiming a healthy nation, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Warakapola yesterday.
He said the government allocated more budgetary allocations this year compared with the previous years.
President Sirisena said accordingly, Rs. 260 billion has been allocated for the health sector this year.
The President made these comments after commissioning a newly constructed fully equipped six storied clinical ward complex at the Warakapola Base Hospital yesterday.
The new clinical ward complex consisting of three theatres, an ICU and a labour room along with 315 beds has been constructed at Rs. 1,103.7 million allocated jointly by JICA and the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council.
President Sirisena said the new hospital is one of the four fully equipped hospital projects carried out in the country with financial assistance from JICA.
The service at this hospital, situated close to the Colombo  Kandy, will not be limited to the Kegalle district. When considering its geographical situation, it serves the entire country, he said.
The President noted that even if the government takes measures to improve physical resources in hospitals, it is up to the medical and other staff to provide a quality medical service.
President Sirisena said he faced much difficulty when strengthening and establishing good governance.
Right after the presidential election victory, the then highest ranking officer of the judiciary came to me and requested not to remove him from his post, he said
He told me that he was ready to work as I wish. I told him that such a decision has not been taken yet. He came again the following day with the same request. I then decided to remove him as he was not suitable for the judiciary system. With this incident I was amazed, how decisions were obtained during the last regime, the President said.
He added that the governments aim is to create a peaceful and strong country in which anyone can live happily and peacefully.
"The government will never allow to destroy ethnic harmony, even though certain narrow minded politically motivated persons are aiming to destroy ethnic harmony."
President Sirisena said the government has taken many fruitful measures for the benefit of the people. The President said under the Moragahakanda Kaluganga development project, 400 tanks are renovated while another 300 tanks are renovated under the Wayamba irrigation scheme.

New visa changes influence Sri Lankas real estate market
Five years ago, Sri Lankas government imposed stricter rules on visa requirements. This happened as part of an on-going process to improve administrative procedures following the end of the war in 2009.
Since the new visa laws were proposed, a new government has come into power. What impact do the new visa requirements and this new governments enforcement of the rules have on real estate investment on the island Leading property portal Lamudi finds out, Visa programmes in Sri Lankas new system Since the end of the war, Sri Lankas immigration services have evolved considerably. The process of applying for a visa and having a visa approved is now more similar to processes in fully developed countries like Australia. All visitors to Sri Lanka now require an electronic travel authorisation document (ETA) to enter the country.
This represents a similar procedure to the USA and Canadas immigration services. When it comes to spending longer periods of time in the country, (and depending on your citizenship) you can either apply for a Visitor Visa (for a short stay), or a Residence Visa.
There are various different types of Residence Visa. You can get a visa for being an employee, an investor, a member of the clergy, a diplomat, a student, a family member, a returning former-expat/dependent, an Indian person covered by the 1954 Indo-Lanka Agreement, or someone applying to the My Dream Home Visa Programme (a program for retirees).
The My Dream Home Visa Programme serves to allow senior foreign nationals to purchase property in Sri Lanka as long as they meet certain requirements.Foreign nationals over the age of 55 can apply for this scheme as long as they remit US$15,000 or the equivalent in an approved foreign currency. They then have to deposit the funds into a Sri Lankan bank account. Other requirements also apply.
Increase in real estate FDI in Sri Lanka Having a valid permanent residency visa is usually a requirement for purchasing property in Sri Lanka. However, factors other than immigration status can affect the process of acquiring a home on the island. In fact, the rules of property acquisition by foreign nationals have changed for the better in recent years.
Since President Maithripala Sirisena was elected in 2015, Sri Lanka has relaxed laws restricting foreign investment. This move has encouraged foreign investors to purchase homes in Sri Lanka.
Before the relaxation law was passed, foreigners who wanted to invest in property on the island (those buying leasehold) had to pay a large and off-putting sum in tax. Since the law was passed, foreign nationals wishing to buy land can now initially be 49% shareholders of leasehold.
Foreigners used only to be allowed to own 25% of this land.Foreigners now have the opportunity to apply for a freehold arrangement 20 years after buying this share.This is a big step as in many emerging markets, it is not possible to apply for freehold as a foreigner at all.
Foreign investors can now purchase a home with leasehold of up to 99 years with a minimal tax fee. In addition, the process for signing a deal on property is now much more streamlined for foreigners. It still isnt possible for foreigners to buy freehold properties and land from the outset, so there is still a fair way to go, but the situation is definitely getting better. This implies good things and a bright future for Sri Lankas property market.
Demand for luxury property among foreign nationals in Colombo
City centre property is in high demand in the nations capital. According to JLL, Colombo records high sales velocity in projects close to completion; out of 3,300 luxury apartments supplied since 2005, 98% of the completed units were reported sold in 2014.
While this trend does not appear to be increasing by very much, demand remains stable and the economy is stable too.In addition to foreign investment providing a boost to Sri Lankas real estate economy-wise, FDI has also had an impact in the type of property that is the most in demand. Luxury property in Sri Lankas capital, Colombo, is on the rise.
This trend is largely motivated by foreign nationals penchant for luxury apartment living, especially among the retired, including those on the My Dream Home Visa. Demand is expected to grow. (Lamudi.lk)

Parking fees through mobile phones
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) yesterday introduced a Smartphone APP that will enable motorists to pay their parking fees through mobile phones.
This is being implemented as a public-private partnership project between the CMC and Tenaga Car Parks (PVT) Ltd,.
The company has entered into an agreement with the CMC to implement an effective parking system in designated areas of Colombo from January 1, 2016.
Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Engineering services). Eng. L R L Wickramaratne said it was the CMC which began the practice of collecting parking fees through female park wardens nearly ten years ago.
However, the CMC did not meet the targeted parking revenue as the service was inefficient. There were also many public complaints. As a remedy, we have found a more effective and efficient electronic parking system for the selected areas in Colombo.
The Tenaga Car Parks (PVT) LTD was selected after a tender process to implement this project and it was the highest bidder.
This was implemented as a pilot project from last year on Galle Road (from Dehiwala bridge to Galadari Junction and connecting bylanes) and R.A.De Mel Mawatha (from Dharmarama road to Liberty Plaza Junction and all the connecting bylanes.).
We have installed 100 machines including 8 machines in Galle Face Green,55 machines on Galle Road, 24 machines on Duplication Road and 13 machines in by Lanes.
The aim of the new parking system is to introduce better traffic discipline with an improved parking management system in the Colombo area to ease traffic congestion, he said.
The CMC believes it is necessary to have advanced parking solutions to ensure steady flow of traffic and to ease vehicular congestion.
 Now, we have made it easier for the public to pay parking fees via the mobile phones.
The fee structure will be as follows trucks and lorry-Rs.50, Car and jeeps-Rs.30, threewheelers-Rs.20 and motorcycles and schooters-Rs.10.
This street meter parking management system is being monitored by the traffic division of the Urban Engineering Section attached to the CMC.
Tenaga Car Parks (PVT) LTD CEO Dilan Perera said the mobile app will provide many benefits to customers. Customers can pay parking fees at their convenience without having to walk to a meter and payments are cashless and paperless. Automatic reminder for expiring parking time and easy management for user including the e-receipt,parking history and parking tracking are other benefits.
Smart parking is a vital step towards building a smart city and this dynamic partnership between Tenaga Car Parks and the CMC will serve to take the parking space in the city of Colombo to the next stage in its developmental history, he added.

The Pinnacle of Colombo Seven
Juliet Coombe checks out the cities most exciting hospitality newcomer Jetwing Colombo Seven
Remember the scene in The Devils Advocate where the Devil, played brilliantly by Al Pacino, takes the Attorney, Kevin, played by Keanu Reaves, onto the rooftop of his high rise building with an amazing infinity pool and a view to die for Well, the setting at the top of Jetwing Colombo Seven is similar but even more beautiful, especially at dusk, and the good news being a Jetwing property you dont have to sell your soul for it.
Neither will you be tempted, like Jesus, by the same Devil, to think that you might have dominion over all you see if you worship him, for this has been built by a family with the greatest integrity and vision, who ward off such spirits and ensure that everyone they work with is valued as it is the Jetwing team that makes Jetwing Hotels exceptionally special experiences. Like his father, Herbert Cooray the company founder, before him, Hiran Cooray Chairman of Jetwing Hotels has strong vision and religious faith in God and his amazing team. His father had the inspiration to build Jetwing Colombo Seven but sadly never saw it materialise in his life time But I am sure his blessings from above will always be here, Hiran says.
L-R Architect Sim Boon Yang, Ruan Samarasinghe, Hiran Cooray, Shiromal Cooray, Ramesh Costa, Jerome
Jetwing vision spans the whole of Sri Lanka and will one day, no doubt, go beyond its shores to teach the rest of the world how to value mother nature so it is protected and all its beauty, but also equally importantly all the people involved in the wonderful business of making people from all over the world feel at home in the best settings the island has to offer. In fact, the family, and this is another key element to their success, goes beyond making you feel at home and towards making their staff and you feel that they are part of maintaining a healthy, diverse, exciting and sustainable approach that protects the island for future generations to enjoy in the same way, and working in a new constructive world dominated by clarity and most importantly of all integrity they make the impossible happen even with the smallest plots of land, which in this case was originally Herbert Coorays family home.
Jetwing Colombo Seven is the latest in an exciting line of stunning hotels to be rolled out by the group around the country with more opening later in the year. The hotel caters to all tastes but is probably most attractive to the serious business traveller who needs to put in a focused, productive day in the business centre of Colombo, a very short ride away from Ward Place without the stress of battling through hair-raising grid locked traffic. Its central location makes it possible to return quickly after meetings to complete peace and tranquillity, either to unwind in the most relaxing possible way or to finish off communications for the days tasks in a conducive boudoir designed to be both chic and ultra modern.
A world of amazing shapes
Hiran, a lover of world travel and great architecture, explains how the inspiration for this stunning property, on a tiny plot of land, came from a very small Hotel in Singapore called the Naumi. When Hiran stayed there, he thoroughly enjoyed the utilisation of the space in this small block and immediately wanted to meet the architect who designed it. That is how Hiran met Sim Boon Yang of Eco ID and invited him to Sri Lanka to design a hotel for Jetwing.
One can only fully appreciate the brilliance of this architect by zipping up in the lift to the rooftop and diving into the beautiful pool overlooking Colombo. You wont feel like you are swimming in a pool, but more like flying through the city like Peter Pan, surrounded by a world of amazing shapes lit up in dazzling bold neon lights against a moody black crenelated tropical Manhattan skyline. This is where the infinity experience really comes into its own, some twelve storeys above the exciting port city of Colombo. The bar is also perfectly situated for a valentines liaison, a deal clincher if ever there was one. A superbly stocked bar which to be honest you need not drink at all here for you will get quite tipsy enough on the atmosphere, ambience and altitude of the setting.
After the most breath-taking of swims as the sun sets over the city turning from orangey reds to royal purple golden hues, you will be ready for something to eat and you can continue to drink in the panoramic views from the comfort of the hotels world class restaurant, treated to exquisite food cooked by the young Indika Bandara, trained under the three star Michelin Chef Yannick Alleno. In the luxury of such, you can admire the sights in slow comfort, of this tropical resort style setting  the Nelum Pokuna Theatre is particularly stunning with its flower-like vibrant colours at night and depending on which direction you are looking you will see views of the Indian Ocean and be able to see historic buildings like the National Gallery and the National Museum amongst many other architectural wonders.
A birds eye window
As with all Jetwing hotels, the staff reflect its style, with the management having wide and long worldly experience whilst the 7 team are drawn from both the local population with great knowledge of their surroundings or having been trained at other great hosting establishments. They are trained primarily to make you feel fully at ease, being attentive when you need help whilst also knowing when to leave you in peace.
The hotel is also fully fitted with a host of other great things such as four very different conference rooms for a diverse range of presentational styles, a luxurious spa, 24 hour room service, a concierge service with fantastic local knowledge and, if you are poorly or just need a little advice on your health, a resident doctor. And, of course, there is a fully fitted gym where you can listen to your favourite music whilst you treadmill-walk the perfect city panorama.
Whilst its still affordable, with amazing opening deals this hotel is an absolute must for those seeking solace and great service with a multitude of facilities in a unique resort style ambience in the heart of it all and who want to feel that penthouse amongst penthouses experience, up on a prominent city mountain, to reflect and recuperate, free from the temptations of the buzzy world below.
Hiran who sees his father as both his hero and his guru says building this hotel was pivotal to his fathers vision of the Jetwing group being an island wide group I would like to see Sri Lanka positioned as one of the best Island nations in the World, offering not only lovely beaches but also wildlife, culture, thousands of years of fascinating history, and amazing greenery. We are known all over the world for the beauty of our Island, but todays traveller is not aware of the product improvement that has happened over the past seven years, since the end of the thirty year conflict. This needs to be communicated so that we can continue to attract discerning travellers to our Island.
Hiran, along with selecting a great architect, has put together a dream team and is delighted to have Ramesh Costa, who was based in London for over 30 years, join Jetwing as the general manager of Jetwing Colombo Seven. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to Sri Lanka and Jetwing, not only in food and beverages but also in general management.
This is truly a hotel in the centre of Colombo with a birds eye window on the world and a style that embodies everything that is truly Sri Lankan, from a family whose roots run deep into the very soul of the island, or in this case, the very foundations on which this magnificent hotel is built. For me, the view from the roof, the azure swimming pool bars uber cool minimalist design, and the terrific restaurant will make this a legendary stopping-off point for all worldly travellers that truly appreciate premium hospitality.

Plantation Minister in Russia in major tea promotion drive
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake is currently in Russia to launch a major tea promotion campaign in the Soviet States.
The Minister also held discussions with Russias Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev on getting greater access for Ceylon tea into the Russian market.
Minister said that Russia is the highest tea during nation in the world consuming over 175 million kgs per year. They also prefer black tea and also to consume loose tea (tea bags).
He said that at the start of 2016 Sri Lanka was the largest tea seller to Russia but with the depreciation of the Ruble India managed to supply tea at a lower price and became the number one country.
My visit was aimed at once again re launching the Sri Lanka tea brand and once again recapture the market leader position in Russia. Over 10 Sri Lankan tea exporters including Dilmah, Impra and also small time exporters participated in Prodexpo Russia Fair to promote Sri Lanka tea. Minister Dissanayake during his visit met several key members of the Russian government and also thanked them for once again buying Sri Lankan fish after the EU fish ban was lifted.

Minister Faiszer Musthapha and State Minister Dilan Perera addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters said the term of office of President Sirisena was not curtailed by the 19th Amendment.
President Sirisena was elected before the 19th Amendment was passed. Therefore he is entitled to a term of six years Minister Musthapha said.
On these grounds, he said the next General Election would be held before the Presidential Election. The term of Parliament ends in 2020 and a General Election will have to be held first he stated.
Responding to a journalists question, Minister Dilan Perera also reiterated that if the SLFP Central Committee decides that President Sirisena would be the party candidate for the next Presidential Election, the President cannot turn his back to the majority opinion.
Minister Perera was also critical that certain individuals in the Government were trying to overrule the Presidents decisions misreading the peoples mandate.
The President was elected by the majority vote of the entire country. However, some whose mandate was limited to districts try to overrule the Presidents decisions. The President has to give repeated reminders to resolve those problems. His intervention into the SAITM issue, rice shortage, lottery ticket price issue and Treasury bond issue are instances to prove this he said.
Minister Perera was also confident that the SLFP would contest the upcoming Local Government election under one broad alliance which includes even the SLFP members working for the Joint Opposition and minor parties attached to the JO. He said a mechanism in this regard is now being worked out.
Commenting on the JOs decision to withdraw from the Sub-Committees appointed by the Constitutional Assembly, the Minister said it would have no effect as Sub-Committees have already completed their tasks and submitted reports. They are still in the Steering Committee and MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Prasanna Ranatunga are actively engaging in the discussions. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been very patient and ready to listen to all views during the Steering Committee meetings, he said.

President tells Anti- SAITM student unions: Solution soon; have patience
President Maithripala Sirisena said the Government is now engaged in discussions with all relevant parties to find a solution acceptable to all regarding the private SAITM Medical College and requested all members of student unions attached to Universities to exercise patience until solutions are found without disrupting their academic activities.
The President made this appeal during a discussion held with delegates of University students Unions regarding the SAITM issue at the Presidential secretariat yesterday morning. Student delegates present submitted their ideas and suggestions for finding a solution to this problem at this disccussion.
President Sirisena said the Government will take steps to resolve this issue after consulting students unions, Deans of faculties, SLMA, UGC, the Management of the Malabe Private Medical College as well as all other parties concerned.
Student union representative pointed out that during the previous government too they expressed their opposition to this private Medical College but it failed to pay attention to it then. They were confident that the present government would find a solution to this problem for strengthening the free education system in the country.

Professional obligation for legal stability
The keynote address delivered by K. Kanag Isvaran, Presidents Counsel at the Bar Association of Sri Lanka National Law conference 2017 themed as A contemplation of the Law and the way forward
I am greatly honoured, nevertheless, to have been invited to deliver the keynote address at this momentous conference. Momentous, because the principal theme  the keynote  of this Conference, from the concept note sent to me, is Con-tem-pla-tio
- it is Greek  I mean the language is!
Translated it means a thoughtful introspection, a profound thinking.
Introspection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of years.
The philosopher Plato, asked, circa 349 BC, and I quote
... why should we not calmly and patiently recover our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are
The topics carefully chosen for the Conference's six sessions would seem to reflect Plato's rhetoric to ... see what these appearances in us really are.
appearances - what things look like or seem to be rather than what they actually are! The selected themes forcefully underscore the concerns and persuasions that drove the organisers of the Conference to embark on an introspective agenda for the Conference. A contemplative examination by a body politic involved in the delivery of justice to the citizens is novel in Sri Lanka  if it is not the first time ever that it is being undertaken.
Legal practitioners and judicial officers
Soul searching does not come easy. It comes in the wake of a catasclamic event or in the wake of continuous flow of events which have tended to outrage one's morals, one's sensibilities, causing disillusionment, a sense of betrayal, urging one to stand up and question the current state of things and begin to question whether things ought not to be something different, something better. Whether things ought not be changed. The perennial question of what is and what ought to be.
Has a Sri Lankan spring arrived
May be a response to the slow realisation that human entitlements which human dignity demands have not been given a due place, or a place of pride, or a place of pride, or respected or implemented sensitively and meaningfully by governments and the justice system. May be a realization that political morality and judicial morality are not what they ought to be.
Talking to the Junior members of the Bar at their Junior Bar Conference, a few months ago, last year, I was left with the a distinct impression of their frustration and disillusionment with the pace of development and direction of the legal landscape in the country, legal reform, the lack of competency of legal practitioners and judicial officers, a lack of meaningful mechanisms for delivery of justice, insensitiveness of the politicians to the rule of law, and the resultant political instability and the stagnation of economic growth.
Practitioners of the law are in constant interface with the society, their needs, their expectations, their demands which is in an ever-changing state of flux.
Buffeted by winds of change from all directions  globalisation, technological developments, un-precedented state interference with the affairs of commerce, industry, finance, environment and the like, it becomes imperative for the legal profession not only to be learned in the law, but to tune their antennae to receive and assimilate these assaults and give leadership and direction for the way forward.
In this background the concerns expressed by the younger members of the profession have much validity. We need to pay heed. We need to understand and examine it.
One may legitimately ask what has the legal profession to do with economic growth and political stability
What indeed, will be the first impression!
But if one looks broadly at the legal profession as including not only the black coated fraternity, but also the academics, those in employment in the private sector, the public sector and in the Attorney General's department and the judiciary  one cannot fail to see that they are all involved in the provision of services directed towards achieving access to justice and justice itself. Which in turn is fundamental to achieving political stability and economic growth by providing a level playing field to all competing interests.
Political stability
Any meaningful and acceptable rule of law and delivery of justice to the public at large must necessarily require men and women of proven competence, of independence, having integrity and high standards of intellect and character. They cannot get there by rote.
William Pitt, the Elder 18th Earl of Chatham, English politician and orator, said,
Where laws end, tyranny begins.
Avoidance of tyranny is our first obligation. By tyranny is meant the use of cruelty, injustice, oppression and the like to enforce authority or power by governments or groups of people.
Some call it majoritarianism.
Advocacy of conformity with the law, (Legalitarianism) and the promotion of the principle that all human beings are equal and should enjoy the same rights, (Legal Egalitarianism) should be the primary, moral and professional obligation of the legal profession. It is a sine qua non for the promotion of political stability, without which there cannot be economic growth.
It is imperative that the profession ought therefore recognise as one of its core concerns, not only the standards and values inherent in his or her own professional work, but also its wider political and quasi political responsibilities, so as to ensure stability and growth. This is well reflected in the theme of this conference - A contemplation of the law and the way forward.
This responsibility increases in the present day because politicians have become men of flux. You cannot pin them down  they have nothing settled or steady either in their own minds or in of their discourses.
The pretensions of the politicians, of course is that they are in a singularly superior position to undertake a so-called objective and well informed responsible decisions concerning the citizens.
The Bar must surely recognise that there is something inherent in the nature of politics and politicians in our country that is not conducive to achieving stability. What is it
I see it as the lack of responsibility, in the sense of liability to be made to account  I.e., accountability.
Many will argue that this has been so since dawn of independence in 1948  69 years ago, should we let it stand
Elemer Hankiss, the Hungarian sociologist, in his essay on The Loss of Responsibility says that responsibility presupposes the motivation, and the ability and the possibility to choose between alternatives. It also presupposes predictability and accountability.
By motivation is meant the creation of stimuli to motivate the people to act in a responsible way. Do we see that
By ability, is meant the inner capacity of an individual to act in a responsible way  a strong and mature personality, in attitudes, values, inclinations and willpower. Don't we miss it
Predictability means the ability to calculate the consequences of one's acts with a relatively high probability. Do we see that By accountability is meant that people act according to a certain set of norms and consider themselves accountable to a tribunal representing these norms I.e., to their conscience, to a group of people, to society, to the Almighty, or to any other real or symbolic tribunal. On this the less said the better!
I would add another, sensitivity. In a pluralistic society, such as ours one should be sensitive to every group's socio-economic, cultural, ethnic and gender concerns. No comment!
But we must surely need to accept these as the precepts for the delivery of justice, political stability and economic growth.
Necessity's sharp pinch ought to remind us that in the Contemplation of the Law and the way forward, in moving things in the way they ought to be from what it is, we need responsible, honest and competent governance, and a competent and independent legal profession which will restore public confidence in all institutions of governance, institutions which provide access to justice and the delivery of justice, to name but a few.
The new reformist firebrands, young and old, who have been casting rhetorical stones, must deliver, without harking back to the ills and wrongs of yesteryears.
It is well to remember that some days you may be the pigeon, but other days the statue.
It is imperative therefore that we must evolve a sound and sustainable legal, political and economic environment. Or else we will become wreckers  not reformers.

Pussalla Meat invests US$ 6 mn  to refurbish poultry feed mill
Pussalla Meat Producers has invested US$ 6.06 million to refurbish and upgrade their poultry feed mill at Dompe to international standards. Managing Director Dilshan Wewita said the feed mill is technically advanced right from the handling of raw material to the loading of finished products.
This fully automated mill is the only such one owned by a Sri Lankan entrepreneur.In September 2015 the companys feed milling operations at Udamapitigama, Dompe, in the Gampaha district came on stream which helped the company to a great extent.
With the demand increasing they had to reinvest to increase capacity as Feed Conversion Ratios (FCR) were not adequate.This was the case until we built our own feed mill,Wewita told to Daily News.
Pussalla has the distinction of being the first Sri Lankan company to operate a 20 tonne per hour plant. It is also the countrys first fully automated facility, capable of producing 12,000 tons of feed per month which would fulfill our current requirement. Today we are running the poultry feed at 60% capacity.
Running its own feed plant meant that Pussalla could have better control on the quality of the raw material. This is in turn will give good quality, end products.
Pussalla started seeing big improvements as early as April last year when FCR dropped to1.6. Prior to that FCR was fluctuating at around 1.75-1.85. Pussalla Meat
Where breeders were concerned, Pussalla started seeing better egg weight, which contributed to uniformity in the flock.
We were never able to stay in the weight ranges recommended by the breeder company. Now we can maintain the right weight. We were also able to cut down breeder feed by 10-12%, he said.
The customers who buy chicks from us now used to purchase feed as well and they are also happy with our feed and this would bring additional revenue to us. In addition the broiler contract farmers who use our chicks are experiencing their profits growing, he said.
Pussalla Meat Producers feed products are doing well on the market. The company has sold around 30-35% of its volume to commercial farmers during the last six months.The company creates specialized feed products such as antibiotic-free feed to produce antibiotic-free chicken. We are already practicing withdrawing antibiotics in the feed, seven days before harvest. We hope to launch antibiotic - free Chicken by mid-2017,, Wewita said.

Sella Kataragama Ganadevi Kovil to mark Maha Shivarathri Day
Hindu devotees throughout the world will celebrate Maha Shivarathri day with honour and devotion on February 24. Arrangements are being made in Hindu kovils countrywide to celebrate the occasion throughout the day. In India, kovils are being cleaned up and Shiva and Ganadevi statues are being gold plated in preparation for the occasion.
Preparations are being made at kovils throughout Sri Lanka too.
The Maha Shivarathri special pooja held at the Sella Kataragama kovil takes pride of place among the Shivarathri celebrations in Sri Lanka. Every year Buddhist and Hindu devotees from all parts of the country congregate in their thousands at this Ganadevi kovil to participate in the pooja and seek blessings.
The Sella Kataragama Ganadevi kovil is at a picturesque spot in the Menik Ganga in the Kataragama Divisional Secretariat division in the Moneragala district.
Several interesting folk tales are woven round the Sella Kataragama Ganadevi Devalaya. It is believed to be the spot where God Skanda had his rendezvous with Walli Amma, his bride. According one folk tale when Walli repudiated God Skanda due to his old looks, he had requested his brother God Ghanapathi to help him win her over.
Ganapathi had said he would disguise himself like an elephant and chase after Walli Amma and for God Skanda to intervene and save Walli from the elephant and gain her consent.
The Ganadevi kovil is said to be at the spot where this episode took place as well as the venue of the marriage between God Skanda and Walli Amma.
Devotees also refer to Sella Kataragama as Kuda Kataragama currently Swami Upul Dissanayake functions as the Trustee and Chief Swami of this kovil.
He teams up with his siblings to cater to the needs of thousands of devotees flocking to the devalaya and obtain divine blessings on them.
Commenting on Maha Shivarathri day, Swami Upul Dissanayake said according to Shivarathri and Brahmanda love, there had been a contest between Brahma and God Vishnu to prove who was more supreme and powerful out of them.
The contest was to find out the height of God Ishwara. Brahma opted to measure it upto the head and Vishnu agreed to measure it upto the feet. Vishnu who disguised himself like a pig failed to find the leg and he gave up the contest. Brahma too failed to find the head, but came across a Wetakeiya flower.
Although both failed to achieve their target, Brahma did not like to concede defeat and be bragged that he found a Wetakeiya flower, whenever they met each other and said the Wetakeiya flower proved that he found the head. At this moment, a powerful light appeared giving birth to the Shivalingam.
Brahma who uttered a falsehood about seeing the head earned the wrath of God Ishwara, Swami Upul said according to folk lore, there are no centres Devalayas or kovils dedicated to Brahma and the birth of Shivalingam had occurred in this manner.
There is another interesting story woven round Shivarathri, according to Swami Upul. It says a hunter who once entered the forest for a hunting expedition had lost his way and got stranded.
A tiger roaming in the jungle had seen the hunter and started chasing after him.
To escape from the tiger, the hunter had climbed a Beli tree.
The tiger had kept vigil under the tree until the hunter climbed down. As the hunter was a devotee of Shiva he had sought his solace by chanting Om Shiva while picking Beli leaves and dropping them down spending the night in hunger.
However all Beli leaves he dropped had fallen on a Shivalingam found under the tree. God Shiva who appeared in the morning had showered blessings on the hunter and the origin of Shivarathri is attributed to this event.
He said five devalayas dedicated to God Ishwara were built around Sri Lanka.
These included devalayas built to overcome king Ravanas wrath on Sri Lanka following his demise.
These devalayas also referred to as Pancheshwara devalayas are situated in Mannar, Thirukethishwaram, Jaffna, Naguleshwaram, Trincomalee, Koneshwaram, Chilaw, Munneshwaram, Batticaloa and Thanthondeshwaram as Shiva and Ishwara devalayas. Shivalingams found in these devalayas have automatically come into being.
According to folk lore the residence of God Ishwara is said to be situated in the Himalaya mountain.
The Ghanapathi devalaya in Sella Kataragama is situated at a location commemorating the marriage of Prince Skanda and Walli Amma. There is a Shivalingam naturally sprouting in this devalaya too.
Shivarathri day is a significant day to Hindu Devotees as much as Vesak day is to Buddhists. Hindus commemorate this day by fasting and paying homage to God Ishwara. A Maha Ganapathi pooja will be held at the Sella Kataragama Ganadevi kovil on February 24 at 2.30 am.
This will be followed by a Maha Abhishekam pooja at 3 am. A series of Maha pooja will be held from 6 am to 12 noon and from 3 pm to 6 pm. After a Maha pooja at 8 pm devotees will conduct poojas from time to time till following morning seeking gods blessings. Swami Upul said Shivarathri pooja celebrations will conclude with the morning pooja on February 25.
He has requested devotees coming to attend the poojas to refrain from eating fish and meat, be attired in white garments and bring along offerings such as king coconut, milk and oil.

Shashi Welgama further remanded till March 2
Two persons including former Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) Chairman Shashi Welgama, a nephew of former Transport Minister KumaraWelgama were yesterday, ordered to be further remanded till by Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Weligodapitiya, for allegedly cheating and misappropriating Rs. 125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
At a previous occasion, the Court refused to grant bail to the suspects citing that there are no exceptional circumstances to release them on bail. However, the defence had filed a fresh bail application on behalf of the suspects and the permanent Magistrate is to deliver his bail order on the next hearing date.
On December 20, 2016, Shashi Welgama and Nandana Priyantha Perera, the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Ltd., were arrested by the CID regarding an investigation into a financial fraud said to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs. 40 million and Rs. 166 million to Perera to provide leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to the SLTB with a deficiency, which amounted Rs. 24 million and Rs. 101 million.
The CID further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had authorised the financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then chairman of the SLTB. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding this incident had been made by the present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena. The suspects are charged under the offences under the Public Property Act. However, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for the former SLTB Chairman had denied the allegations levelled against his client, citing that there is no evidence to prove that his client was involved in the financial transaction.

SL Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) dips in January
The Manufacturing Sector PMI recorded an index value of 56.2 in January which is a decrease of 2.1 index points compared to December 2016. The deceleration in PMI indicate that the manufacturing activities expanded at a moderate pace in January 2017 largely attributable to post seasonal realignment of business plans ahead as reflected in Production and New Orders sub-indices.
The Stock of Purchases sub-index increased in January indicating an accumulation of stocks mainly as a precaution to face possible delays of supply of materials which is also associated with the lengthening of Suppliers Delivery Time. The Employment sub-index also increased compared to the previous month. Overall data points to an expansion where all the sub-indices are above the neutral 50.0 threshold. The expectations for activities indicated an improvement for the next three months.
The Services Sector PMI recorded 57.5 index points in January 2017 from 59.8 index points in December 2016. The decline in PMI over the last month's value indicates that economic activities in the Services sector expanded at a slower rate in January 2017, compared to the previous month. The deceleration in Services PMI was caused by the decelerations in New Businesses and Business Activity sub-indices and the decline in Backlogs of Work sub-index. Employment sub-index remained unchanged while Expectations for Activity sub-index increased in January 2017 compared to December 2016. Prices Charged and Future Labour Cost, which are not taken into consideration in PMI compilation process, increased in January 2017 compared to the previous month.

SLC launches L/O and T20 tournaments in gala ceremony
A gala opening ceremony was held by Sri Lanka Cricket at the R Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday to launch its major tournaments for 2016/17 - the Limited overs and the T20.
I believe these tournaments have contributed to uplift cricket in Sri Lanka in the past years. That is why we think of giving priority to the club matches. Only one team will win the championship but our aim is to treat all the players as winners, said Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanga Sumathipala who was the chief guest at the occasion.
Between 400-500 players who will be involved in the tournaments are lucky, because they were selected from 20 million people in the country. Today 100 players are with us on a contract basis. We expect these players to become our future through determination and dedication, he said. We have supported cricket clubs with infrastructure facilities and we expect to support them in the future as well. We will study the performances of all the players who participate in this tournament and record the performances of each player.
Twenty-three clubs will clash with each other in the one-day and T20 championships. Sri Lanka Cricket will present two of the latest Renault KWID motorcars to the best players of the one day and T20 championship and, the best club of the year will receive the latest 16-seater Nissan van.
SLC vice president K. Mathivanan, Tournament Committee chairman Bandula Dissanayake and Test cricketer Rangana Herath and the players representing the participating clubs were also present at the occasion.

Spectrum issues blows  Google Loon away
Minister laments not being in charge of TRC to clear legal snags
The much awaited and long overdue Google Loon project initiated last year may not take off due to legal constraints in spectrum allocations, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
Speaking to media in Colombo he said that firstly the project pilot project did not receive the much needed clearance for spectrum from The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission as well as from the International Telecommunications Commission due to the same issue.
Fernando said he is disappointed that though he is the Telecommunications Minister is not in charge of the TRC. This may be the reason I could not get the much needed approvals. Now we have forwarded this matter to the Attorney General for his views.
Fernando said that in addition the project also carried a lot of negative local publicity which may also have had a negative impact. To clear both local and foreign legal issues it will take another two years. I understand that Google has now looked for other options and they are about to select another country to launch this project. The Minister said Rama is a company owned by Chamath Palihapitiya who was the go between for the project.
Subsequently several Ministers and even the Prime Minister visited and met Google top brass and they decided to launch the pilot project of the worlds first Google loon project from Sri Lanka.
*In July, 2015 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between ICTA, Google Loon LLC and two of its affiliates Lotus Flare Holdings Limited and Rama Co. for the purpose of formalising working relationships and facilitating pilot project implementation. He said the Google top brass for the first time visited Sri Lanka and did launch a test balloon. He said that though the project is in the balance now, had it gone through as planned Sri Lanka would have been the first country in the world where the entire country would be covered by 4G. If this had happened there would have been an influx of foreign investors to Sri Lanka to take advantage from this. Commenting on the new tax structure imposed on the internet he said that this is a temporary measure and would be reduced when local television channels go full digital soon. Then the spectrum would clear and then we would be able to offer lower tariff.
Fernando said there was lot of negative publicity for the project and at one point he was also called Balloon Harin and he convened the media to clear some of the misconceptions.

Sri Lanka takes on under strength Aussies in T20I series
MELBOURNE: The Australian squad for the T20I series against Sri Lanka reads like a best of the Big Bash League with Australia unable to call on any Test regulars for this series with their long format team already in India.
While we are not short on any talking points in the hosts squad the visitors have one player who has been making a headline grabbing return to international cricket, Lasith Malinga.
Malinga produced a ripper of an in-swinging yorker in his first over back in Sri Lanka colours against the Prime Ministers XI and has created ripples of excitement around a team who have had little to celebrate in recent times.
Sri Lanka beat an inexperienced Proteas team 2-1 in their T20I series last month and face a similarly under strength Australia side but where the wickets in South Africa were bizarrely suited to the visitors in that series they are unlikely to get any favours from Aussie groundsmen.
Michael Klinger is set to make his long-awaited and thoroughly deserved Australia debut and while the game will be his first at international level he is a player with vast experience in the game having made his domestic debut back in the 1998/99 season.
Australia are not short on T20 quality despite the absence of their Test team and can call on Aaron Finch, Travis Head and Moises Henriques at the top of the order.
In the bowling stakes they have the handy James Faulkner and Pat Cummins who will be supported by the enormously talented and just plain enormous Billy Stanlake as well as one of the bowlers of the BBL this season Jhye Richardson.
Australia have sent nearly all their quality spinners to India but they have left behind one of immense quality in the shorter formats in the shape of Adam Zampa.
One of the few positives to come out of Sri Lankas visit to South Africa has been the emergence of Niroshan Dickwella as a potent top order player while stand in skipper Upul Tharanga has proved to be in top form towards the end of the trip scoring the first hundred for Sri Lanka on the tour.
This is a format that Sri Lanka can prove dangerous in with the shorter innings negating to some extent the Sri Lankan propensity to collapse in a heap when placed under pressure for prolonged periods.
Squads
Australia squad: Aaron Finch (captain) Melbourne Renegades (VIC), Patrick Cummins Sydney Thunder (NSW), Ben Dunk Adelaide Strikers (QLD), James Faulkner Melbourne Stars (TAS), Travis Head Adelaide Strikers (SA), Moises Henriques Sydney Sixers (NSW), Michael Klinger Perth Scorchers (WA), Tim Paine Hobart Hurricanes (TAS), Jhye Richardson Perth Scorchers (WA), Billy Stanlake Adelaide Strikers (QLD), Ashton Turner Perth Scorchers (WA), Andrew Tye Perth Scorchers (WA) Adam Zampa Melbourne Stars (SA)

Stalking tiger, drowsy lion
Title : TAMIL TIGERS DEBT TO AMERICA
Author : Daya Gamage
The author Daya Gamage is a journalist who served many years in the U.S. Department of State and its Embassy in Sri Lanka. His title sums up the argument that he so tellingly fleshes up in his compelling 578 page narrative. He has had the advantage of being an inside observer/participant of the ideological battle, for American understanding and sympathy, between the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) and the LTTE diaspora. This is a sad litany of the incompetence and ignorance of those responsible for Sri Lankas foreign policy as contrasted to the slick professionalism of the anti-regime campaign waged by the Tamil diaspora.
There is little point in rehashing the argument that the architect of the flight of our Tamil elite was J.R. Jayewardene in 1983 when he let loose his monstrous brutes on the Tamil community.
It is these Tamil fugitives, burdened with bitter anger and equipped with superlative skills and intelligence who, over the years, brain-washed the American establishment into punishing the governments of Sri Lanka. For a few glorious years that outstanding patriot Lakshman Kadirgamar steered our foreign policy cannily enough to defuse the LTTE proxy campaign in the US and UK. After his assassination, foreign policy descended into a catastrophic decline of incompetence, ignorance and incredible cronyism.
Ethnic Tamil enclave
The Ambassadors appointed to Washington had forsaken Sri Lankan citizenship and cosily embraced the American Way of Life. Not only did they lack diplomatic competence, but their loyalty to Sri Lanka would always remain dubious. Outwitting these incompetents was childs play to the LTTE diaspora of highly qualified professionals.
America always had a policy of mollycoddling dissident minority cabals from many countries. Among these were the Armenians from Turkey, Kurds also from Turkey, Tibetan exiles, and Tamils from Sri Lanka. These groups were kept on tap to irritate their countries of origin by media attacks and photogenic demonstrations whenever called upon.
The LTTE Tamil diaspora is streets ahead of all other such groups in its slick professionalism and long term strategy to destabilize the government of Sri Lanka and carve out an ethnic Tamil enclave.
A report to the US government spells out the role of diaspora activists very succinctly. Emigrants often replay the conflicts of their homelands and try to enlist the government and civil society institutions of the settlement country to their cause. In this endeavour the LTTE diaspora succeeded superlatively.
Since their arrival as fugitives from Sri Lanka after the communal riots of 1963, the Tamil diaspora systematically carried out a campaign to brainwash the US establishment of the brutality of the government and the need to establish a separate Tamil state in the Island. Therefore, when the government was waging its Thirty Year War against the LTTE, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to proclaim the US view that this was a war of Sinhalese against Tamils  not a struggle to defeat a separatist agenda.
To quote Gamage The pro-Tamil Tiger network..was well focused to make it a diplomatic offensive since the demise of the LTTEs military strategy.The NGO sector has a special place in Washingtons foreign policy agenda, and they maintain a close rapport with USAID which appropriates funds for various NGO projects worldwide. Sri Lanka has a plethora of this breed!
Humanitarian crisis
Gamage goes on to quote, courtesy of Wikileaks, a cable from the US Ambassador in Colombo. The Tamil Diaspora, a highly educated internet savvy group across Europe, North America, Australia and several other countries has long been a source of funding and hard-line support for the LTTEAs Sri Lankas humanitarian crisis has worsened, Diaspora anger and lobbying have increased. On March 16 members of the Tamil community held demonstrations in Toronto, Brussels, Geneva and New York..The demonstrators carried Tamil Eelam flags and portraits of LTTE Supremo Prabhakaran and labeled GSL actions as genocidal..The Ambassador and a number of Embassy officers receive e-mails from the diaspora on a daily basis, most of them expressing points of view similar to those of the demonstrators. There is no evidence that the GSL was ever aware of this relentless barrage by the diaspora to influence US policy.
To quote Gamge again The LTTE was defeated in May 2009. The Tiger global network was on diplomatic offensive against Sri Lanka long before the Tigers were militarily annihilated. As much as the Tiger leadership built its lethal military network, globally it put in place a well co-ordinated diplomatic network to work within the Tamil diaspora to develop a close working relationship with Western policy centres.
US government sources
The narrative makes it quite clear that, as the armed conflict was ending in victory for GSL, the US hoped for only a partial defeat of the Tigers enabling it to survive as a pressure movement, centred in the West. It is this expectation that led the US to contemplate the unprecedented move to protect the lives of the top leadership of the LTTE and facilitate the surrender of activists ..during the final weeks of the intensive battle.
The value of this book lies in its meticulous documentation of official communications and directives from US government sources. These are balanced with reports from American academics and journals thus establishing the credibility of Gamages arguments.
What strikes the reader is the incredible naivete of the US policy as regards Sri Lanka, almost wholly based on prejudiced (LTTE) sources, inexperienced diplomats and plain hypocrisy. The last item is amply shown by the US determination to drag the Rajapaksa government before international tribunals for human rights abuses and genocide, while vigorously refusing such tribunals from investigating US troops accused of identical crimes against humanity in Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen.
Gamages detailed, amply documented and accurate expose of US policy towards Sri Lanka and its almost total reliance on LTTE sources makes it essential reading for students of politics, foreign policy advisers, and all politicians involved in dealing with the US.

Telecom manpower issue to be resolved
Sri Lanka Telecom has taken measures to solve the issue of the manpower workers attached to it without causing any injustice to the existing permanent cadre, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said. He made this observation at a press conference at the Jaic Hilton yesterday.
He said there were around 2,181 manpower workers attached to Sri Lanka Telecom and out of them, 400 have already been made permanent with 100 being absorbed last year and another 300 this year into the permanent cadre.
He also said that there were more than 5,000 employees in the permanent category and they opposed making the manpower workers permanent as they would face difficulties when promotions are granted .
Minister Fernando said however the issue had been solved without causing any injustice to the permanent staff. He added that the Board of Directors of Telecom decided to increase the age limit to 47 for recruting into the permanent cadre.
However, the management would have to find out another solution for those who are above 47 years, Fernando said.
He added the Board of Directors decided to recruit the manpower workers into the permanent cadre at the rate of 200 each year.
He also said that due to this decision all manpower workers below 47 years of age would be recruited within three years.

Thajudeen murder case: Former OIC granted bail
Former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera held in remand custody over a period of nine months for his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder was yesterday granted bail by Colombo High Court.
High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed by the former Crimes OIC challenging the Colombo Additional Magistrates order to refuse bail.
The suspect was ordered to be released on a Rs.100,000 bail with three sureties of one million rupees each by the Colombo High Court.
He was further ordered to appear before the CID on the last Sunday of every month. The High Court further ordered the suspect to surrender his passport to Court and severely warned not to interfere with the investigations.
The bail can be canceled if the suspect interferes with the witnesses, the High Court Judge observed.
Perera was arrested by the CID on April 20, 2016 for allegedly covering up evidence and misrepresenting information to court regarding Thajudeens murder which took place on May 17, 2012.
Through the revision application, the former Crimes OIC sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrates refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The suspect said the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder.
The petitioner said there is evidence to prove that he was not involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The former Crimes OIC said he had acted in accordance with the instructions given by higher ranking police officers and did not commit anything wrong.
The prosecution maintained that there is suspicion that the suspect had involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since circumstantial evidence suggested that the suspects had conducted investigations to record Thajudeens death as a fatal road accident.
Senior Counsel Ajith Pathirana with Harin Hettiarachchi appeared for the petitioner. Senior State Counsel Suharshi Herath appeared for the Attorney General.

A timely overture
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's appeal to all Lankan asylum seekers in Australia to return home with no questions asked would we welcomed by all those who lay great store in the country's honour and dignity. Sri Lanka earned a blackened image for itself as another country of Boat People in the same way as the Cambodians who fled their country to escape the Khmer Rouge in the late seventies. Though the Lankan exodus was nowhere near the same magnitude, it was nevertheless a slur that the country could have well done without.
True, a majority of those who fled were Tamils, in the aftermath of the ethnic war, fearing persecution at the hands of the state or majority reprisals. This was also the time of the dreaded White Van where Tamils were said to have been abducted for ransom with the full knowledge of a powerful defence official. There were also the Economic Refugees who fell victim to human smugglers and rounded up at the other end to be banished to Australia's off shore islands for a vetting process. These asylum seekers are still being held in these islands pending deportation.
Like the Premier said, these unfortunates, who braved the rough seas, risking their lives, some fleeing persecution while others seeking the pot of gold, had entered the Australia illegally and liable for punishment. But the Premier had chosen to overlook the offence and invited them back to the country with the promise to forgive and forget'.
Not just in Australia, we have had asylum seekers who were streaming out of the country in their thousands at the height of ethnic war who have now settled down in Western countries which were more accommodating than Australia. A good many of them were professionals and skilled workers, lost to the country. These are the people who today form what is known as the Tamil Diaspora. On an earlier occasion Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera wanted to invite the members of this diaspora, as a gathering, in Sri Lanka, a move that was viewed with a jaundiced eye by the nationalist elements of the Joint Opposition who forget that even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the first flush of the war victory, invited ALL Sri Lankans domiciled in the West to return to the country to help rebuild the nation.
President Sirisena too has time and again made overtures to the Lankan community living abroad to return and be partners of the development process. However a climate conducive for the return of these Lankans should be created if the country is to avail itself of their skills and expertise once again. The current spate of strikes and the resulting dislocation of public life is certainly not going to inspire these Lankans to return to their motherland. Nor will the chauvinistic slogans and nationalist rhetoric beckon these people to come back. If even they are to consider returning, the government should make it worth their while. This could be done by offering them attractive terms in the professions and the many fields that require the special skills of these folk.
One should also consider the fact that the older generation of the Tamil minorities fled the country due to a sense of discrimination they harboured after Sinhala Only became official government policy. Their progeny too may be of the same mindset. This is why we should at least now try to end this senseless rabid nationalism that is being practised by some which will not only put off those willing to take on the President's offer but also drive away others from the country.
To her credit, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga strove to undo her father's legacy while she was at the helm of affairs, going to the extent of even attempting to introduce a constitution which was all but Federal in name. Had such a spirit been nurtured following her departure from office the Tamil minorities living abroad would certainly have been encouraged to return to their roots.
GLs selective amnesia
The General Secretary of the newly formed pohottuwa party Prof G.L. Peiris has lashed out at the government accusing it of trying to interfere in judicial appointments. His grouse is the undue appointment of a High Court judge bypassing those with seniority. Peiris has from time to time displayed this tendency of selective amnesia.
The former law professor was a powerful Minister in both the CBK and MR governments when the country's judiciary was plagued with scandalous appointments. Peiris was not concerned about seniority when Sarath Silva was elevated to the post of Chief Justice bypassing the more senior Mark Fernando. Neither did he give a tuppence for seniority, when he, on his personal initiative, brought his student, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, from nowhere to be planted as a Supreme Court Judge. Peiris also had no qualms when Mahinda Rajapaksa overlooked Appeal Court President the late Justice Sri Skandaraja for appointment to the Supreme Court, all because the latter gave a judgement in favour of the selfsame Shirani Bandanayake in the infamous impeachment matter. So much for seniority talk.

Trinco harbour economic  developments appallingly  slow- Governor Fernando
The Trincomalee harbour in todays strategic maritime context would be ideal for functioning as a commercial hub and as a centre for regional maritime security architecture focusing the Bay of Bengal, Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando said.
Speaking at the first round of Trincomalee Consultations held in Colombo, organised by the Pathfinder Foundation, Fernando said security is an important prerequisite to economic development.There are written and unwritten practices that have affected our economy and security, that is related to the sea around us. It is common to the other Bay of Bengal countries too.
Due to the economic and strategic importance of the Indian Ocean, the region has become an area of geo-political and geo economic competition for major powers. Fernando said the Trincomalee port area development has been appallingly slow and the road for investment is wide open.It is now limited to wheat milling, cement production, petroleum product development, minor fishery development and tourist service delivery.
He also noted that plans are being taken to jointly develop the balance oil tank farms with India.
If it is executed, it will make a visible impact in the Trincomalee business environment.
A master plan for the development of Trincomalee is undertaken by Singapore infrastructure consultancy, Surbana Jurong focusing on shipping manufacturing and tourism sectors. The plan is set to cover transportation tourism infrastructure, environmental implementation proposals.
The Hambantota development plans now pursued will be complemented by Trincomalee development activities and both will compete to gain from the Bay of Bengal business environment.
The population of Bay of Bengal community exceeds 1.8 billion apart from the sheer size of the population, the bay also has considerable economic potential led by India which is poised to become the one of the strong economic powers in the world.

In tune with the infinite
The rain had hardly been experienced in this area. The heat has been almost deadly. But as you enter Chamaras little palace, you will feel as if you have entered an icy courtyard owing to its high roof.
Chamara Nayanajith runs a small-scale fruit business in Gampaha with his wife Gayani Dinusha. But he would never forget to visit his hometown, a little village deep inside Horowpathana, Anuradhapura, to cultivate his paddy field. If the fruit stall is his source of income, paddy cultivation is his passion. When the paddy cultivation season dawns, Chamara would drive his tuk tuk the whole way to Anuradhapura with his wife.
Is paddy cultivation actually worth being passionate about
As you drive a few kilometres from Anuradhapura to Horowpathana, you will come across this lesser known village called Rasnakavewa. The villagers have an unwritten custom. They would never enjoy the harvest without offering a share to the temple. Rasa noka dun vewa, which means offered without tasting in Sinhala, was gradually rephrased as Rasnakavewa. The area is residence to about 200 villagers. The younger generation is slowly moving to Colombo in search of posh employment, while their parents and grandparents have settled down comfortably with farming.
Chamaras parents belong to that generation. They had no source of income other than paddy cultivation. They have raised their four children, of which Chamara is the youngest, solely on paddy income. Even today well into eighties, the elderly parents find themselves fit enough to work and walk around without an aide.
Even under the scorching sun, Rasnakavewa glistens with greenery. The villagers have concerns such as settling the debts after investing heavily on the paddy-fields. But still they find the life comfortable as they do not have any other worries. Rasnakavewa reminds us the fact that the village that we witnessed in fiction is still alive in Sri Lanka.
Make a trip to Rasnakavewa during the cultivation period, and you will witness how the farmers use the traditional methods. Some farmers slowly have moved on to modern machinery like tsunami, while some opt not to use pesticides. Rasnakavewa is blessed with a temple where only a few monks reside. The villagers are not bothered about their spiritual life. As long as the monks dwell there, the villagers would continue to nourish them. The temple is home to caves as well as inscriptions which journeys you to the past.
There is a huge difference between life we spend here and Gampaha. In Gampaha we are constantly on the move. We have to focus on the business because of the competition. But here we hardly have any competition, Gayani draws parallels between two lifestyles in her four-year old marriage.
In Gampaha, Gayani and Chamara would never get an opportunity to have a meal together. In Anuradhapura, they share only one plate, as they have ample time. Gayanis house in Anuradhapura is not without the traces of modernity. They are privileged with electricity, though mobile phone reception is still a luxury.
The village life is not comfortable like that in Colombo and suburbs. Hospitals and national schools within close proximity is a dream here. Yet Chamara and Gayani crave to spend time here for many reasons. Life without Rasnakavewa is inconceivable for her. She lives her life in Rasnakavewa.
We breathe properly here. In Gampaha we have to check everything. We have work here. But we have enough time to relax too.
Chamara hopes to buy a paddy mill and settle down in Anuradhapura. He would hand down the business in Gampaha to his relatives and would permanently find shelter in Anuradhapura.
The trip to Rasnakaweva is not a little one. It takes about six hours. And at the end of the journey, you will feel dead tired. But that tiredness would not last. The lush greenery and the shady warmth will take the tiredness away soon. And all those noises deposited in your head will be restored into silence with the restricted tones of birds and other creatures of nature. Those plain-clothed villagers will offer you a warm greeting albeit slightly bewildered as Colombans are a rare sight in this part of the country.
Once you speak a word or two, it is not difficult to find a chatterbox or two. They would willingly enlighten you about the traditional methodologies. Throw one question, and you will be answered in dozen voices.
What is more welcoming is the brisk gusts of ice-like wind that would blow across your body.
Chamara would say nothing when the villagers explain something. Chamaras marriage to Gayani was an offshoot of a longstanding love affair. But that love affair required a proper place to spark. Rasnakavewa is the only probable place where their post-marital love would bloom.
And for you, it is one of the few spots on earth that fill your mind with the earthly orchestra.

Two-match unofficial test series against England Lions today: Looking for the next Rangana Herath
Finding a successor to the great Rangana Herath will be one of the top priorities for Sri Lanka when their A team prepares to take on the touring England Lions team in a two-match unofficial test series commencing at Pallekele International Stadium today.
Master class Herath has taken on the mantle as the champion spinner for his country following the retirement of the great Muthiah Muralitharan six years ago. But Herath is now 38 and nearing the end of a memorable international career and while he is still around Sri Lanka are looking to find a successor to him.
 A team series is all about feeding the senior side with players and this two-match series against England Lions offers us the chance of exposing some of the players against international opposition and see how good they are, said Sri Lanka A team coach Avishka Gunawardene.
Malinda Pushpakumara and Amila Aponso are two left-arm spinners who can fill the void when Herath decides to call it a day, he said.
Both spinners are named in the Sri Lanka A squad picked for todays game and their performances will be monitored closely by the coach as well as the national selectors.
Pushpakumara (29) is the leading wicket-taker in the current domestic season capturing 77 wickets (avg. 13.79) from nine first-class matches for Chilaw Marians SC in the Premier League. He also picked up six wickets in England Lions warm-up 3-day match against SL Board Presidents XI at Moratuwa early this week.
Twenty-three-year-old Aponso in only his fourth season of first-class cricket has played an integral part of Ragama CCs bowling attack with 51 wickets averaging 16.41. Apart from the spinners Gunawardene stated that the match offers a chance for Sri Lanka batsman Dhananjaya de Silva to recapture his form. De Silva has been named captain of the Sri Lanka A side and in the recent series in South Africa struggled to score runs in all three formats with 43 being his highest score.
Gunawardene said that the selectors will also be closely watching the performances of fast bowlers Kasun Rajitha, Lahiru Gamage and Asitha Fernando.
Another player in the mix is CCCs prolific 21-year-old left-hander Ron Chandraguptha who is having a prolific run with the bat this season averaging nearly 60 for his aggregate of 837 runs inclusive of four centuries.
Ron is a player who keeps everything simple. His greatest asset is that he has the temperament to bat for long hours and compile big scores, said Gunawardene.
The Lankan A team coach pointed out that it was in the A team series against West Indies A and the tour to England that players like Dhananjaya de Silva, Lakshan Sandakan, Lahiru Kumara, Sandun Weerakkody and Kasun Madushanka were discovered and allowed promising leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay to make a successful come back from injury.
Gunawardene stated that with a series against Bangladesh lined up for next month, the matches against England Lions was very important for Sri Lanka in deciding the composition of their teams.
SRI LANKA A TEAM: Dhananjaya de Silva (captain) Dimuth Karunaratne, Udara Jayasundera, Sandun Weerakkody (wk), Charith Asalanka, Roshen Silva, Lahiru Gamage, Kasun Rajitha, Ron Chandraguptha, Kasun Madushanka, Asitha Fernando, Dilruwan Perera, Amila Aponso, Jeffrey Vandersay, Malinga Pushpakumara.

The medical degree of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) continues to be in the centre of controversy. The recent decision of the Court of Appeal legalizing the degree has given a new impetus to the agitation against SAITM as well as encouraged the SAITM authorities to aggressively pursue their own agenda.
Though several key ministers are vociferously stating that the issue is finally settled with the Court verdict and nothing further could be done by any one or any organisation, the agitation is unlikely to wane off.
It seems that these gentlemen ministers have overlooked several salient factors in the present situation. First, the Court could and would decide only on matters placed before it. There are many aspects that were not presented to the Court. Second, the court decision was based on the decision of the then Minister of Higher education S B Dissanayake. That was a political decision.
SAITM issue remains a political one and hence a court verdict cannot be the ultima thule in such instances. This is a factor that the Government could ignore at its own peril.
Clearly different persons or groups would have different opinions on the issue and they would act according to them. However, it would be unwise to come to conclusions without looking at or analyzing the issue in all its aspects. A satisfactory solution to the problem could be found only on the basis of such a comprehensive analysis.
There are several arguments against recognizing the SAITM medical degree. The broadest objection is that it should be opposed as it is a private institution that is transgressing an educational sector that is the exclusive prerogative of the State. It is presumed to be a first step in totally privatizing education, at least higher education.
Private sector education
Education today is largely in private hands. The private sector has encroached upon primary education in a big way. At first it came surreptitiously through the BOI. Then it became bolder with the passage of time. It is considerable in the Secondary education sphere too. The sad fact is that there is hardly any regulatory action by the State to maintain quality and content of education.
Pre-primary education is almost completely private and regulation is non-existent. Strangely this issue has not caught the attention of any educationist yet. Another matter of concern is the increasing cost of free education in public schools. Parents have to spend considerable sums to maintain school facilities as well as to buy stationery, supplementary reading materials and other requisites of children attending school. These expenses have increased so much that one could hardly speak of any free education at all.
In the tertiary education sphere private sector education is considerable. What is new in the SAITM issue is that it is the pioneer in private medical education. If private education is found in all other disciplines except medicine it would be illogical to oppose it simply based on its ownership.
The case for private higher education is based on the following indisputable factors: State Universities could absorb only about 15 percent of students that qualify for University admissions at the GCE (A/L) Examination. This number cannot be rapidly increased due to financial constraints due to the under-developed nature of our economy. On the other hand, rapid development of human resources is necessary for economic development especially in view of the knowledge society that needs to be built.
Regulatory authority for tertiary education
However much private education spreads the Government cannot wash its hands off its responsibility for the education of its citizens. It has to ensure minimum standards of quality and content of education taking into consideration the development needs of the country and the welfare of its subjects. In the absence of proper regulation private education providers would be interested solely in making the biggest profit in the shortest time with minimum content. Hence, it is absolutely necessary to establish a regulatory authority for tertiary education since the UGC is only for State Universities.
Though private or private-public participatory educational institutions could exist the government should ensure that resources of State Universities are not depleted or diverted to private institutions. What has happened to certain State health sector institutions should not happen in the University system. If private Universities attract material and human resources of the State University system then it would ruin the latter. Hence, the protest of the University students cannot be dismissed as a handiwork of subversive politicians.
The main issue concerning SAITM Is regarding the quality of education and training imparted. This is a technical issue for which a technical solution is possible. The GMOA as well as medical consultants oppose the recognition of the SAITM medical degree on the ground that it is not up to the required standard. This is a grave allegation which should not be dismissed offhand. The call for mandatory approval by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is legitimate and should be obliged with. Also revision of legislation to improve the powers and actions of the SLMC is also imperative.
As stated earlier the Court decision was based on the decision of former Minister S B Dissanayake (No wonder he is so vociferous in its defence). It is a moot point whether he had sufficient grounds to arrive at that decision.
SAITM students
Instead of cooperating with the SLMC, authorities at SAITM also took a confrontational attitude, perhaps encouraged by the then government in power. It seems that by its own experience they have found it easier to lobby and win over ministers to the SLMC to their point of view. That may be why they kept on admitting two batches of students per year and do so even today, while the future of their medical graduates remains uncertain.
This issue, I repeat, would not wane off. Already a broad front of the working population and the student community has been formed to carry on the agitation. Leaders of the Consensus Government could not and should not remain as nave political babies ignoring the oft repeated truism that in politics there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies.
This is not a problem of Himalayan proportions requiring a Herculean effort to find a solution. It is a simple problem requiring a simple solution. The immediate problem could be solved through negotiations in which all stakeholders take part. The President should take the initiative as promised. Those involved in putting their foot in the mouth in public over this issue should be kept as far away as possible from the negotiating process.
Finally there is also a human dimension to the issue. SAITM students awaiting the recognition of their medical degree should be given opportunities to perfect their training through an interim process with the assistance of the Government, the SLMC and the GMOA. Admissions to the SAITM medical course should be temporarily stopped till a final solution is found to the problem.

Waters Edge begins work on  mega entertainment centre
Waters Edge Battaramulla broke ground for a mega entertainment centre that will provide recreational and entertainment opportunities for the public.
The Station at the Edge will be a one-of-a-kind entertainment hub that brings together sports and entertainment.
Waters Edge Chairman Chamath De Silva said the development project aims to create a recreation, leisure and sports facility on the far side of the water front in collaboration with the Sports Ministry and the Urban Development Authority.
The space will also allow various sports associations and bodies the chance to utilise the area for national and international level sporting events. The centre will facilitate thirty sports including many water sports such as kayaking, rowing and wind surfing among many others. The centre will be segregated into three different categories under extreme sports, leisure sports and kids sports.
The main objectives behind the project are to convert acres of land into an area that provides the public with an opportunity to engage in sports and relax while also providing the youth of the country with state-of-the-art facilities to train at.
The project will also feature a unique train running along a rail track consisting of seven carriages that will be converted into kitchens and three passenger compartments revamped into restaurants serving up hawker style street food.
The platform beside the railway track too will be used as part of the restaurants creating a typical train station atmosphere with the hustle and bustle that is commonplace of a Sri Lankan railway station. Ensuring that the restaurant is accessible to all, food will be affordably priced and made fresh daily.A fresh fishmarket is also on the cards.

Wildfire razes homes in New Zealand
NEW ZEALAND: A wildfire destroyed at least 11 homes and forced hundreds of terrified residents to evacuate in the New Zealand city of Christchurch, authorities said Thursday.
Civil defence officials declared a state of emergency in the South Island city late Wednesday as two blazes that had been smouldering for days merged into a single giant fire-front.
Christchurch City Council said more than 1,800 hectares (4,500 acres) of land had been torched in the Port Hills, an area of rugged terrain difficult to access to the east of the city centre.
About 1,000 people had been evacuated and, with winds forecast to pick up and fan the flames, authorities warned residents to flee at the first sign of danger.
We understand its hard for people to leave their homes but the fire can change direction and move incredibly quickly, police senior sergeant Ash Tabb said.
If youre worried, dont leave it too late -- its better to be safe than sorry. With a thick pall of smoke hanging over Christchurch, residents with respiratory ailments were advised to stay indoors.
Wildfires of such ferocity are rare in New Zealand, where regular rainfall usually prevents them reaching the intensity seen in places like Australia and the US west coast.
Prime Minister Bill English took a helicopter flight over the disaster zone on Thursday and said the blazes may have been deliberately lit. Ive only had a very brief description of the fire starting in two places at about the same time, which to me looks suspicious, he told reporters.
But those investigations are underway. The emergency has so far claimed one life, when a helicopter that was dumping water on the flames crashed Tuesday and killed pilot Steve Askin, a decorated special forces veteran.
Civil Defence said it had confirmed 11 homes had been razed but added the situation was constantly changing.
It said 14 helicopters and three planes were helping battle the blaze, the maximum number of aircraft that could safely operate around the fire-front at one time.
Some 200 firefighters were operating about 45 pumps and tankers on the ground, with police and the military also providing additional personnel for the emergency response. Civil defence said weather conditions were forecast to ease on Friday, slowing the fires progress. - AFP

Wooing the wild
Amrit Rajaratnam and Shanik De Silva are true wildlife lovers. Their passion for wildlife has led them on a journey that they have captured through the lens. The Wild is the first exhibition for both these photographers which took place recently at the Lionel Wendt Gallery. The Daily News chatted with Shanik about this wondrous exhibition.
Q. Shanik tell me a little bit about the varieties that were on display
A. There were 80 pictures on display at the exhibition. It was mostly centered around the African Savannah and its inhabitants. This included many landscapes and portraits of animals. There were also many from the wilds of Sri Lanka.
Q. How did you manage to capture these photographs How many sites in Africa did you visit to capture these photos
A. These pictures were taken over a period of about four years and over several trips to national parks in many countries.
Q. Why wildlife What interests you about wildlife
A. We have been fortunate to be introduced to wildlife at a young age by our parents, but its something you can appreciate and enjoy at any stage of your life. For us the solitude you get when you are in a national park and the enjoyment of observing animal behavior is what fuels the interest
Q. Do you plan to go elsewhere As in, out of Africa to capture more wildlife photos
A. Would love to
Q. Have you visited other countries to take photos of more species
A. I have only been to some national parks in India but without much luck. Amrit has had better luck
Q. How old were you when you started this hobby
A. I have been going to wildlife parks from a very young age but only got into photography about 15 years ago
Q. What kind of a camera do you use
A. Canon DSLR
Q. Do you have assistants
A. We go on wild life trips with friends and family for the enjoyment of the experience, photography is a byproduct of this
Q. What kind of adventures have you had taking these photos Were you ever chased by an elephant
A. Have had lots of adventures and funny anecdotes, will have to meet in person to elaborate
Q. What have you learnt
A. Photography and animal behavior is a vast subject and you need to know both to get great photographs. Its a subject you will learn all your life. Mostly from your mistakes.
Q. What message do you want
to give people about animals
A. Protecting our wildlife and ecosystems is vital for our very existence. This has to be addressed at a macro level and a micro level. We need to have sustainable development that will let both humans and animals coexist and prosper
Q. Were you one of the many wildlife
enthusiasts who were horrified and appalled by the killing of Cecil the Lion
A. There is a huge debate currently on whether trophy hunting should be allowed. The hunting lobby will have you believe that the money earned from hunting plays an important part in the preservation of wildlife and pays for its protection.
They also say that they only remove old animals from populations however there is no real justification for it. At the end of the day people are paying to destroy an animal, if they were really concerned about its welfare they could just donate the money towards conservation. The need to kill is what drives them and that cannot be a normal thing.
Q. Do you feel you have a duty to protect animals
Especially endangered species
A. Of Course, if everybody does their bit, we can make a difference

Youngest person and first woman to visit EVERY country on Earth
A 27-year-old has become the youngest person and the first woman to visit every country on Earth - after hitting 196 destinations in just 18 months.
Cassie De Pecols epic voyage has taken in all 193 sovereign nations plus Taiwan, Kosovo and Palestine since she set off in July 2015.
The globetrotterss trip cost $198,000 (158,000) and involved 280 flights.
The intrepid traveller, from Washington, Connecticut, USA, began to plan her adventure - dubbed Expedition 196 - on the 25th birthday.
She will be listed as a Guinness World Record-holder after the ticking off the last country, Yemen, this month.
But despite taking in incredible sights across the globe, she stressed: Despite what you may think, this expedition has not been easy.
Cassie acted as peace ambassador for the International Institute of Peace Through Tourism and Skal International during the her journey.
Her work involved meeting with university tourism students to discuss responsible tourism and economics.
In addition, she worked with Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation to collect water samples to test for the presence of micro plastics.
After completing the adventure, she wrote on Facebook : People in real life of all walks of life in every country of every color of every religion and nationality have been so incredibly kind to me.
Cassie previously said: Since school, Ive had this desire to visit every country in the world, intrigued to learn more about every culture, natural habitat, and religion.
In America we are lucky to have such a vast melting pot of cultures and people from all over the world who make the country what it is today.
I wanted to learn about where these people came from, more specifically, where I came from, with my ancestors originating from Europe. I wondered what existed outside of North America and what it was like. Is the Middle East really like how they say it is on the news What about the Amazon Going to every country was for me a personal quest to learn as much as I could about our world, stepping outside my comfort zone and becoming comfortable in the unknown, while also aiming to leave a legacy behind.
After 15 months on the road, Cassie has had both highs and lows and believes that travelling as a solo woman has shaped some of her experiences.
She said: On average, I spend two to five days in each country.
Its been amazing meeting with the students and dignitaries, also travelling to off the beaten path locations on my own, places that no one else I know has experienced. I also love long bus rides. Lows are flying, being in airports, and not being in a safe enough environment to go for a run. Ive been harassed and in sticky situations, whereas a man in the same situation likely wouldnt have experienced the same.
She added: Though I havent yet become the first documented woman to travel to every country in the world, I imagine that the feeling of accomplishment and awe will be overwhelming. I just hope that Im able to inspire young women (and men!) around the world to go after goals and feats that so far, people think can only be done by man.
