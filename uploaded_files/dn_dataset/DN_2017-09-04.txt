Injecting arts !
Nurses say that nursing is an art, and 24-year-old Kimberly Joy Magbanua of the Philippines gave another beautiful meaning to that.
Kimberly, who works as a registered nurse in a hospital in the Philippines, is making waves online for her unique artwork that she creates using a syringe.
How she came up with that idea is no surprise: I started scribbling by using only a pen and paper. Ive always wanted to try in on canvas, but I needed paint to do it. The idea came up to me two years ago. One time during duty, I was giving meds to my patients, and the idea struck me of using a syringe as my paintbrush.
It usually takes her three to six hours to finish one, easy as it may sound, its a lot more technical than you think: I remove the needle shaft leaving only a piece of it. I use different needle gauges depending on the details of the painting. Since Im working with paint, it dries up quickly, and I have to change the needle if it clogs up.
Kimberly served as a volunteer nurse for two years then worked as a community health nurse for months before landing a job in a government hospital in her hometown as a medical-surgical nurse. When not taking care of patients, she creates another form of art - syringe art as what she calls it. You can palpate her passion when she: Art is my comfort zone. Art feeds my soul.
An art-lover since she was a child, Kimberly remembers being fascinated by colors and paints: I remember I have been in-love with colors, paints, and other art stuff since I was in kindergarten. During my elementary years and beyond, I started joining different art contests in our school.
But it was her parents who nurtured her talent, When I was a kid, my parents would buy me art supplies instead of toys. Also, during story times, they would read me bedtime stories while doing drawings and doodles of the character and the scene on a piece of paper.
Faithful to being a nurse, Kimberly performs proper hand hygiene while singing the Happy Birthday song, before and after painting with a syringe, she jests. And mind you, she uses clean and unused needles. Bored Panda

SLMC, former regime adopted SAITM child, now they try to kill it
"The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) is a child adopted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and the former regime led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is a crime to see them now attempting to kill the child, Parents' Association Secretary of Private Medical Colleges Anura Dhanarane said addressing a press conference at its Battaramulla office yesterday.
He said the SAITM was set up after the SLMC agreed that a private institute could be set up under the provisions of the UGC Act. Those opposing it today were seeking political mileage by inconveniencing the Government.
Dhanaratna said university students, the GMOA, SLMC, Joint Opposition, left parties and trade unions had today teamed up to oppose the SAITM to topple the Government.
Dharmaratne said the Government should strengthen the SAITM by contributing towards its management and setting up standards for promote medical education.

## Title: ADB to assist in increasing insurance penetration in SL

ADB to assist in increasing insurance penetration in SL
The insurance penetration in Sri Lanka is 1.2% of its GDP in 2015 whereas those in Malaysia and Thailand are above 5% respectively, said Sri Widowati, Country Director, Sri Lanka Resident Mission, Asian Development Bank.
Speaking at the Insurance Day celebration on Friday as the Chief Guest she said that this is a critical issue in Sri Lanka because its insurance sector is still in a nascent stage.
Against this backdrop, ADB has been supporting the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka to implement two initiatives under the ADBs capital market program.
This first initiative is establishing a formal dispute resolution panel in lieu of the existing informal Ombudsman scheme to enhance consumer protection. The second initiative is launching a comprehensive retail education program to improve peoples financial literacy and understanding of insurance.
These two initiatives are aimed at making insurance products more credible and getting people familiarized with the concept of risk management. The importance of better risk management with insurance cannot be emphasized too much for Sri Lanka, where the population is aging rapidly and natural disasters, such as floods and drought, are common.
The expansion of insurance market is critically important not only for developing financial sector but also for building a better social safety net system. To close, ADB would appreciate if insurance companies provide a strong support for successful implementation of the two ongoing initiatives by the Insurance Board and other ADBs financial sector work.
As you may be aware, with robust growth over the last decade, Sri Lanka is now close to becoming an upper middle-income country. However, there are many challenges to maintain the momentum of rapid inclusive and sustainable growth.
Under its new country partnership strategy, ADB is supporting Sri Lankas transition to upper middle income status through many ways, including through financial and private sector development. First, ADB has supported SME sector development to diversify economic activities and enhance productivity across sectors.
ADB has been providing a $100 million line of credit to SMEs to encourage banks to lend to underserved SME segments, such as women entrepreneurs, new clients and SMEs located outside of Colombo.
Capital market development has positive spillover effects on insurance business. As securities market get deeper and more liquid, risk-adjusted investment returns of insurance companies increases and their capital cost decreases.
On the other hand, to develop capital markets, insurance sector needs to be expanded to ensure sufficient demand for securities.

From Angel of the slums
Tomorrow Tuesday September 5th, 2017 marks the fourth annual International Day of Charity, also referred to as World Charity Day. Established in 2013, the United Nations created this day to honour the death anniversary of one of the most well-known humanitarians and philanthropists in history.
Charity work
Obviously of more significance is that on September 4, 2016 the day prior to her death anniversary, Blessed Mother Teresa was canonized as a saint. Not only did Pope Francis raise Mother Teresa to the altars at a canonization Mass in St. Peters Square on September 4, the entire week  September 1-8  was devoted to celebrating the Albanian religious sister who became known as the Angel of the slums.
It is the day when the world pays tribute to the selfless character of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, her incredible dedication to help those in need and the impact she made on the world which will last far beyond her death. On this day, people around the world are encouraged to contribute to charity in some way, and become a part of the change that is needed to improve the lives of future generations.
It is appropriate that the day of her death commemorates the tireless work that Mother Teresa achieved by devoting her whole life to charity work. To celebrate this special day every year, the work of different charities all over the world is publicised and celebrated and people are encouraged to donate money and time, to carry out altruistic works, and also to educate people and raise awareness about the many charitable issues worldwide. Mother Teresa was a humanitarian of the highest calibre. She was a tiny woman of just 4 feet 11 inches and weighed less than 100 pounds. Although diminutive in stature, she stood out conspicuously as a colossus among the leaders of the world. Astoundingly, she spent many years lifting and carrying those who were dying or sick. Mother Teresa chose to serve the poorest of the poor and to live among them and love them.
Mother Teresa was widely known as a living saint as she ministered to the sick and the dying in some of the poorest neighbourhoods in the world. Although some people criticized her for not also challenging the injustices that kept so many people so poor and abandoned, her simple service touched the hearts of millions of people of all faiths.
She spent her entire adult life working persistently to advance the quality of life of the people, particularly the deprived and the disadvantaged. She never wavered from her chosen path despite several challenges she had been confronted with.
Mother Teresa saw beauty in every human being. She, along with others of the Missionaries of Charity, strove to make the lives and deaths of those around them more peaceful, comfortable and full of love. She fed, washed and cared for anyone who needed such assistance. Mother Teresa was awarded the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for founding her missionary congregation.
A good purpose
It was a commendable choice. No character in recent history was more deserving of such an international honour and recognition of humanitarian enterprise. Over the years, Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity established homes all over the world for the dying, the sick, orphaned children, leprosy patients, the aged, the disabled and AIDS victims.
Mother Teresa saw beauty in all of these individuals who were abandoned or rejected by others. Every year, charities all over the world help to save and improve peoples lives, fighting disease, protecting children and giving hope to many thousands of people. In truth, there is more than enough wealth and money in the world to adequately provide for everybodys need, but the problem is that it is not distributed evenly to those who need it. As such, in most communities to gain wealth and not use it for a good purpose it has to disadvantage someone else. A corrupt few individuals accumulate most of the wealth so that only a limited amount of wealth is distributed to the average person. For an average person to gain wealth it has to be taken off another average person. One example is where governments waste money on unnecessary effects that benefit the rich at the expense of the poor. Poor people are starved of funding and also pay taxes to the government. Their tax money is given to the rich and wasted. The government only has a limited amount of money in the budget.
The relentless will
Some people wrongly believe that strong economic activity benefits everyone. Often in countries with the largest wealth there is more poverty. The rich are getting richer and the poor poorer. Countries and people are becoming more indebted. The gaining wealth of the multinationals is doing the opposite of making the average person prosper. It is resulting in the destruction of useful small businesses that cannot compete. The end result is that local jobs, services and wealth are lost.
Mostly, the poverty of the poor is not their fault, but the fault of corruption, disasters, wars, multinationals, unjust prison detention, their countrys policies, illness, abuse, technical problems, governments, high costs, trade unions, and other unfortunate circumstances beyond their control.
If we could form a better system it would be fine to have a lot more personal wealth than suggested. That is a tall order because you cant change the whole world system, but in a small group we could form a better system independent of the mainstream one. If more affluent people shared their wealth we would have more than enough finances to do what we need and help others.
There are three kinds of givers - the flint, the sponge and the honeycomb. To get anything out of a flint you must hammer it. And then you get only chips and sparks. To get water out of a sponge you must squeeze it, and the more you use pressure, the more you will get. But the honeycomb just overflows with its own sweetness. Which kind of giver are you
As the world has been turned upside down by civil violence, religious conflict, natural disasters, government corruption and numerous power struggles, we must turn to simple acts of kindness to make a difference in our own communities. The International Day of Charity is a day for every individual to step up and do their part to make a positive impact on the world.
If political and diocesan leaders are tempted to grumble about a lack of time or resources, Mother Teresa also offers another valuable example. You dont really need deep pockets or massive infrastructure to get something done, only the relentless will to make it happen.

[APPRECIATIONS - (04-09-2017)]
A. H. M. Azwer
A down-to-earth politician
It is with sadness I mourn the passing away of my friend A. H. M. Azwer. The late Azwer was a warrior with a cause who chartered the course of politics and politicians with his simplicity and loyalty, which was his hallmark to his last.
I fondly recall, it was a Friday morning, just after morning (Subhu) prayers in 1988, Azwer was going through his daily mail following the Presidential Election victory. To his dismay, he had received a letter of termination for not reporting to work.
Azwer was the Private Secretary to the then Southern Province Governor Al Haj Bakeer Markar. The reason for his failure to report to work was due to the fact that he accompanied the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa during his campaign, addressing over 150 meetings across the country. This election was marred with violence spanning from North to South. It was a hard-fought campaign which was won by the United National Party candidate Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Azwer waited till sunrise, heartbroken and devastated, got ready and walked to Galle Road and got on a CTB bus and left for Bambalapitiya. Thereafter, he walked to my residence. Rather exhausted and eyes filled with tears, he gave me the letter he had received and said, " I have been given an award." I told him Haji, don't worry, this is a blessing in disguise; now your place is in Parliament.
I had planned to go to Singapore that night and invited Azwer to join since he needed a well-deserved rest. Immediately, I called our mutual friend Omar Kamil and conveyed what happened to Azwer and requested him to prepare a CV for him. I asked him to join us for our usual Friday lunch and went to Suchaitha to wish the President Elect Ranasingha Premadasa. In the meantime, I managed to get a copy of the letter removing Azwer to President Premadasa through the late A. J. Ranasinghe.
After Jummah prayers and lunch, we went to Sucharitha. VIPs including well-wishers were queuing to greet the President Elect. Southern Province Chief Minister M. S. Amarasiri walked in and I gave him a copy of the letter sent by the Governor. Azwer was very angry with me for distributing copies of the letter.
Around 7.30 pm, we were asked to come to wish the President Elect.
The three of us walked in and as soon as President Premadasa saw Azwer, he jokingly said, "you have been sacked." Copy of the letter dismissing Azwer was on his table.
The President asked Azwer "What are your plans" In response, I said, "Sir you must have him in Parliament." President Premadasa said that that was a very good idea and asked from which district he would like to come forward to contest. I promptly said, "Sir, we can't field him from any district as he will be travelling with you in the campaign and therefore, let him come on the national list." Saying that, I handed over Azwer's CV to President Premadasa. President Premadasa immediately called the party's General Secretary Ranjan Wijeratne and told him to include Azwer's name in the national list.
The President wanted us to go to Sirikotha and immediately meet the Party General Secretary. I told President Premadasa that Azwer was dejected this morning when he received the letter which removed him from the post as Private Secretary to the Governor of the Southern Province. The President assured me that Azwer will be appointed through the National List to Parliament.
That night, with great relief, we both left for Singapore. Following the General Election, Azwer was nominated to Parliament from the United National Party. This is the true story of how Azwer was able to enter Parliament. Over the years, whether in or out of power, Azwer was true to himself; he never misused his position and always lived life in a down-to-earth manner, strictly following the five pillars of Islam. Azwer leaves us at a crucial juncture in Sri Lanka's political landscape, where wisdom and foresight of experienced politicians such as Azwer would be sadly missed.
May the almighty Allah grant Azwer the highest place in Jannah.

Australia mull three-pronged spin attack for Bangladesh
Chittagong: Australian captain Steve Smith said Sunday he was considering fielding three spinners in the must-win Test against Bangladesh after their shock loss on a turning wicket in the series opener.
Australia suffered their first-ever Test defeat against Bangladesh last week and are desperate to restore some lost pride when the teams meet in the second and final Test starting in Chittagong on Monday.
Bangladesh, ranked ninth in the ICC Test rankings to Australia's fourth, are hoping to shed their underdog status with a series sweep against Smith's men.
Overcoming the home team's spinners is one of Australia's biggest challenges.
All but one of Australia's 20 wickets in the series opener fell to spin, and the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium pitch in Chittagong is expected to favour slow bowling.
Australia have recalled left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe for the injured Josh Hazlewood and could play him alongside their frontline spinners Nathan Lyon and Ashton Agar.
Smith said no final decisions had been made, with rain interrupting their last training session Sunday and preventing an inspection of the wicket. But the skipper hinted at fielding a spin attack.
"I think the inclusion of O'Keefe into the squad is a good one. It gives us the option to play three spinners if we like," Smith told reporters in Chittagong.
"Obviously Bangladesh did that against us last week. If the wicket is spinning it's really a good option and there is a possibility we go on with that."
Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim said his men would go all out for another win against the former world number one Test side. "There is no way we will play safe cricket. Whichever team we play now, we play against them for win. We will do whatever it takes us for making it 2-0," Mushfiqur said.
Australia risk dropping to sixth in Test rankings if they lose the second Test.Bangladesh came agonisingly close to beating England in Chittagong last year when they needed 33 runs on the fifth day with two wickets in hand. AFP

Buddhist Cultural Centre releases Western contribution to Buddhism book
The Buddhist Cultural Centre has just released a new book titled
'Western contribution to Buddhism' authored by William Peiris. The publication of this volume will be a welcome addition to the literature in English on the subject of Buddhism and the Buddha. A foreword by the late Venerable H. Saddhatissa Maha Thera, a distinguished Professor Emeritus of the Benares Hindu University and of the University of Toronto, Canada, is evidence of the importance of the new publication.The author has been a journalist and broadcaster for over half a century and is well qualified to speak with authority on his chosen subject. The preparation of this work had entailed an enormous amount of research, for it is an account of the great services which Western scholars have rendered in the last 150-200 years to the noble cause of Buddhism and truth.
The book, which has 48 portraits of famous scholars, is made up of 11 chapters in which the author deals with the work of scholars from England, France, Germany, Russia and America. Schopenhauer, the famous German philosopher who early in the nineteenth century, drew the attention of the Western hemisphere to the importance of Buddhism, occupied a prominent place in the work and is honoured with a portrait. Sir Edwin Arnold, author of the world-famous Buddhist poem 'The Light of Asia' also ranks as one of the outstanding Western contributors to our knowledge of Buddhism.
Author William Peiris had written a most readable biography of Arnold which was published by the Buddhist Publication Society of Kandy. The Rhys Davids husband and wife, who contributed greatly as founders of the Pali Buddhist Tripitika, occupy a prominent and well-merited place in William Peiris' book. The author has pointed out that Buddhist Asia owes a great deal of gratitude to Western scholars for their enormous contribution to Buddhist scholarship and the spread of Buddhism in the West. William Peiris enumerates the facts relating to this growth and achievement.
According to William Peiris, of all the countries in the West, Britain has rendered the greatest service to Buddhism. The name of Rhys Davids heads the list of British scholars who dedicated their lives to the study of Buddhism and the propagation of its tenets and doctrine. The name of Rhys Davids is remembered and honoured as the founder and first president of the Pali Text Society. His missionary zeal for Buddhist studies made him the staunched champion in this sphere. He helped the Society to publish almost the whole of the Pali canon and a considerable number commentaries and English translations. Rhys Davids' wife will always be remembered as the greatest expositor of the Buddha's doctrine. She was also given an equal tribute and by their combined endeavour, they have established a place for Buddhism in the Christian world. Rhys Davids once mentioned, "I have examined every great religious systems of the world and in none of them have I found anything to surpass in beauty and comprehensiveness of the noble, eightfold path of the Buddha. I am content to shape my life according to that path."
Rhys Davids was committed to organize Pali studies in the West and to pave the way for Buddhism to become a household word in the West. The contribution made through Sir Edwin Arnold's poem 'The Light of Asia' was practically helpful for the propagation of Buddhism in the West. The book achieved a phenomenal success and its sales exceeded one million copies in Europe and America. Its circulation has been wider than any other book on Buddhism. Buddhism became widely known in the West by its publication in 1879.
Friedrick Max Muller, was another who contributed to Buddhism from England, where he spent the greater part of his life and earned a high reputation as a competent editor and translator of Buddhist texts.The name of I.B. Horner, as the president of the Pali Text Society, prominently stands out among the benefactors of Buddhism in the West. She was a Pali scholar of the front rank. Dr. Edward Conze was another outstanding English Buddhist scholar and author, well-versed in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian and Japanese. He was a practicing Buddhist for thirty years and was one of the world's greatest Buddhist scholars. Christmas Humphreys was another well-known British pioneer and propagandist who believed in World Buddhism and was convinced that only in a combination of all schools of Buddhism can the full grandeur of Buddhist thought be found. His numerous writings indicate that he had a wide knowledge of Buddhism.
William Peiris confirms that Germans can claim to be the first Westerners to gain an insight into Buddhism and to extol it. He comments, the number of those who practice Buddhism without publicly announcing is believed to be very much high. Schopenhauer, the philosopher, assigned Buddhism the highest place among world religions. He had been since the first quarter of the 19th century the most widely read German philosopher. He was the first to tell the West about Buddhism. "If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. It must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers for more followers than others," Schopenhauer said.
The founder of the Buddhist House in Berlin, well-known all over the world as a thinker of great originality, Paul Dhalke said, "Buddhism has a great mission to fulfil in the life of mankind that cannot be performed by any other religion or philosophy. Irreplaceable for the seeker after truth and entirely unique in its mental structure for the thinker. The Buddha Dhamma stands secure in the power of its inner truth, waiting serenely for that recognition of its worth which other religions seek to obtain by eager propaganda."
The late Ven. Nanatiloka Maha Thera, who spent 54 years of his life in Ceylon, was among the Western pioneers of Buddhism. He was the first German to enter the Order and selected a small island in south Ceylon in 1911. This island hermitage became famous throughout the world and in it, many westerners, specially Germans, were ordained.
"The credit for beginning the systematic and scientific study of Buddhism in the West goes to France," said William Peiris. It was the French orientalist Eugene Burnouf who may be described as the Father of Buddhist Studies in Europe. He published scholarly pioneer work of Buddhism. He was the first to make Pali, the language of Theravada Buddhism, known in Europe. V. Trencher initiated the massive Critical Pali Dictionary which was compiled with international support and collaboration. It was Dr. Paul Carus who pioneered a vigorous movement to popularize Buddhism in America. His first book, 'The Gospel of Buddha;' published in 1894, was a best seller. What appeals to him in particular is the freedom of thought and expression underlined in Buddhism, its invitation to the inquirer to investigate its doctrine and to believe nothing until the inquirer is fully satisfied about the truth enshrined in it.
It is worth quoting the words of the Ven. Saddhatissa Maha Thera who wrote that "this fascinating chronicle should become a text-book for all who wish to pursue a study of Buddhist history. This book is essential reading for all who are interested in the development and range of influence of Buddhism and the Buddha. As it is written in English, it will appeal to millions of potential readersgood auspices in the present deplorable state of morality in the world of today."
Dr. Edward Conze said, "Dear Professor Peiris, rather belatedly I have just studied your book. It gives a most fascinating account of the many gifted people who took up Buddhism in the West."
The publisher, the Buddhist Cultural Centre in Nedimala, Dehiwela, deserves a word of praise for the excellent get-up of the book. Copies of this book are available for sale at 125, Anderson Road, Nedimala, Dehiwela; Sri Sambuddhathwa Jayanthi Mandiraya, 32, Sri Sambuddhathwa Jayanthi Mawatha, Colombo 5 and www.buddhistee.com

Carlos ire
Maverick academic Prof. Carlo Fonseka was in combative mood the other day after visiting a medical faculty student leader, now in remand, over damage caused to public property, during an anti-SAITM demonstration. He (Fonseka) said he will be in the forefront in any campaign to overthrow the present government over its privatisation of medical education and all other ills. The diminutive octogenarian who is well known for his colourful prose and witty remarks was in his element, responding to journalists outside the remand prison, wading into the government with uncharacteristic gusto.
This was in quite contrast to the genial and humble former chief of the Sri Lanka Medical Council when he was visited by President Maithripala, recently, while recovering from an ailment, at hospital. On that occasion, in the presence of head of state, the professor was the epitome of politeness and decorum, responding to the inquiries of the President with a humbleness that belied the gung ho figure who was breathing fire and brimstone outside the remand prison.
When reminded by a journalist that the SAITM did not originate under the Yahapalanaya government but dated back to the days of Mahinda Rajapaksa and as to why, as President of the SLMC, he remained mum at the time, the good professor attempted to explain this away by playing with phonetics, in characteristic fashion. He said when SAITM was given the green light by him, as head of the SLMC, the M (in SAITM) denoted management. It was only subsequently was he to learn that this M indeed stood for Medicine. He promptly wrote to former President Rajapaksa informing him of the dire consequences if the institution was allowed to continue. This was by way of an answer to a journalist who queried if he feared the Rajapaksas.
We are not aware of any protests or combative posture adapted by the good professor from 2012 (when he sent the letter to MR) until the change of government in 2015. Neither was there even a whimper of protest by Prof. Carlo Fonseka when a private medical facility was established at the Kotalawela Defence Academy, which came under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
As a reputed and respected academic, it is incumbent on the likes of Prof. Fonseka to ensure that academic activities in the universities continue without interruption and that they should do everything in their power to see to it that students are not used as pawns in political games, as is the case with the current SAITM imbroglio, that is being fanned by the GMOA, which has the full backing of Prof. Fonseka. The good professor is well aware that there is a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors in the country and that every effort should be made to bridge this gap if we are to sustain the free health service and combat the rapid spread of disease.
Instead, we have a scenario where academics like Prof. Fonseka egging on the students to take to the streets by their combative speeches and aligning with organisations like the GMOA whose members make no bones about where and with whom their political sympathies lay. Does Prof. Fonseka truly believe that the SAITM issue will be resolved, were the Rajapaksas to come to power, after remaining silent for four long years, passing on the baby to the Yahapalanaya government Rajapaksa for his part says that he handed over the letter sent to him by Prof. Fonseka to the minister concerned. Why pray, was the matter allowed to end there, with Rajapaksa not pursuing any follow up action Does not this alone indicate that Mahinda Rajapaksa had no intention to move in the matter just like MR and co. are bound to leave matters to lie, were they to return to power
It is time that Prof. Fonseka act in exemplary fashion and refrain from goading students to abandon their academic activities, and, above all, steer clear from making political statements that are not in keeping with his high reputation. The government has another three full years to complete and the public will decide, at the end of that period, if the Yahapalanaya regime is fit to continue or not. The 84-year-old Prof. Carlo Fonseka is well advised, therefore, to enjoy his retirement and not involve himself in projects to topple governments or be in the forefront of protests to achieve this end, in the evening of his life.
MR's no show
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says although he received an invitation to attend the 66th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, he was unable to attend the event since he received the invitation at the eleventh hour and was not in position to cancel his busy schedule'. We thought that Rajapaksa did not need an invitation to attend events associated with his party of which he is patron. It was only the other day that Rajapaksa claimed that he was still the chairman of the SLFP and the present incumbent is holding that post by default. Why wait for invitations when he is a true blue, as he often emphasizes

Cathay Pacific to launch non-stop services to Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen in Summer 2018
Cathay Pacific continues to grow Hong Kongs connections to the world. From summer 2018, the airline will launch pioneering non-stop routes linking Hong Kong with Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen, further strengthening the airlines network and providing new trade and tourism opportunities between Asia and Europe.
Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer Rupert Hogg said that the announced services will meet customer demand for non-stop travel to these vibrant cities, while at the same time providing Europe-based passengers with more convenient access to key destinations in Asia and Southwest Pacific through the airlines home in Hong Kong.
Were excited to offer the only direct flights between Hong Kong and Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen. These are all fantastic destinations and attract business and leisure travellers from the world over. We listened to our customers demands for more options and greater flexibility and have responded by building direct air links with these great cities, said Hogg.
Growing our reach to new destinations that arent served from Hong Kong boosts the citys status as Asias largest international hub and enables us to capture new and important sources of revenue. Following the recent launch of services to Gatwick, Madrid and Barcelona, Cathay Pacifics European expansion continues. With the commencement of the new routes, the airlines network will cover 15 European destinations served direct from Hong Kong.
Cathay Pacifics long-haul fleet of aircraft averages just five years of age, making it one of the youngest in the industry.The three new routes will be operated by Cathay Pacifics state-of-the-art Airbus A350-900 aircraft, which feature the latest seats and cabin design and which have been especially well-received by the airlines customers. All flights to Brussels, Dublin and Copenhagen are equipped with the aircrafts enhanced inflight entertainment system and Wi-Fi onboard.
Cathay Pacific has in operation 18 of the 22 A350-900s it has on order, with the remaining four aircraft due for delivery before the end of 2017. Additionally, the airline has 26 of the larger A350-1000 type scheduled to join its fleet from 2018. These environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient aircraft allow Cathay Pacific to open up new markets not otherwise served from Hong Kong.

CDEM celebrates World Diabetes Day
The centre for diabetes endocrinology and cardio-metabolism (CDEM) will be celebrating the World Diabetes Day which falls on November 14.
World diabetes day is significant to CDEM in many ways. Being a premier centre for diabetes and first specialty facility in Sri Lanka for diabetes CDEM has a duty to treat diabetes, prevent complications of diabetes and screen for diabetes. The CDEM was opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on world diabetes day, in 2016.
CDEM ensures the free glucose testing during the months of September, October and November. We are keener to get down those who do not know they have diabetes. Diabetes as a disease has very few symptoms and signs and one can have high blood glucose for a long period unnoticed. Still high glucose levels continue to damage heart, brain, eyes, kidneys, feet and lower limbs.
The CDEM is determined to serve you and look after you totally. One in ten persons have diabetes with or without your knowledge. For unknown we serve by finding whether they have diabetes. For known we see whether their glucose is controlled.
In keeping with the theme Looking after lives CDEM plans many more activities towards the month of November for world diabetes day. They include free diabetes clinics, foot screening, more discounts on packages and educational programmes.
CDEM invites you to enjoy the free glucose testing from September 1.

China and India are buying much less gold
Global demand dropped 12% during the second-quarter compared to a year earlier, a report from the World Gold Council Thursday showed.
China and India, the world's biggest gold buyers, were responsible for almost half the fall in demand to 914.9 tonnes.
Gold prices have been sliding in recent months as a stronger U.S. dollar and expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade scares off investors. The metal current trades at $1,117 an ounce.
The jewelry market suffered some of the sharpest declines as consumer spending in Asia eased. Global demand for jewelry sank 14%. The sector has been a casualty of China's cooling economy. That slowdown, coupled with extreme volatility in the country's stock markets, dampened demand for gold jewelry.
"Sharp falls in Chinese stock markets have shaken the largely consumer investment base," said Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the WGC.
In India, heavy rains hit incomes among important rural customers and hurt spending. Central bank buying dropped 13%.
At the same time, demand for jewelery rose in the United States and Europe.
Gold investment improved in Europe as the Greek crisis lured buyers. Gold is seen as a safe store of value and tends to benefit in times of financial anxiety. Demand for bars, coins and ETFs got a boost as drawn-out debt wrangling in Greece sparked fears over the stability of the euro area.
But gold prices remain weak. The metal slumped to a five-year low last month after China's central bank announced it had been stockpiling the metal at a slower pace than previously thought. The country has historically been tight-lipped about its gold stocks. CNN News

Chocolate could prevent diabetes: Cocoa stimulates the release of insulin
Chocolate could prevent diabetes, new research suggests. A compound in cocoa, known as epicatechin monomers, enhances the secretion of insulin from specific cells, a study found.
The compound also reduces obesity and increases animals' ability to cope with high blood glucose levels, the research adds.
Although the study was only conducted in animals, the researchers add humans may require large quantities of the compound in order to benefit. Study author Professor Jeffery Tessem from Brigham Young University (BYU), said 'You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it. It's the compound in cocoa you're after.'
How the research was carried out
The researchers built on previous research by Virginia Tech.
Virginia Tech scientists fed epicatechin monomers to animals on a high-fat diet.
They found the compound reduced obesity and improved the animals' ability to cope with high blood glucose levels.
When the researchers from BYU assessed why this occurred, they discovered that epicatechin monomers enhance beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.
'You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa'
Professor Tessem said: 'What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress.
'The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.
'You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it. It's the compound in cocoa you're after.'
Co-author Professor Andrew Neilson added: 'These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes.'
Watching television for three hours a day may raise a child's risk of diabetes
* Watching television for three or more hours a day may increase a child's risk of diabetes, research suggested last month.
* Children who spend at least three hours in front of a screen are heavier and have greater insulin resistance, a study found. Both of these are risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
* Such youngsters also produce impaired amounts of the hormone leptin, the research adds. Leptin is involved in regulating appetite.
* These results remained even after the study's participant's activity levels were taken into account, the study found.
* Study author Dr Claire Nightingale from St George's, University of London, said: 'Our findings suggest that reducing screen time may be beneficial in reducing type 2 diabetes risk factors, in both boys and girls, from an early age.'

Cinnamons city hotels and SriLankan reward FlySmiLes members
Gastronomy has always been an integral part of the travel experience. It matters little whether one travels for business or leisure, the question of where and what to eat feature nears the top of any travellers priorities.
To further foster this age-old connection between food and travel, Sri Lankas premier five star city hotels Cinnamon Grand and Cinnamon Lakeside have come together with the national carrier  SriLankan Airlines to offer FlySmiLes frequent flyers great rewards when they patronize any of the five selected signature restaurants at the two properties.
The offer kicked off on September 1 and is specifically for SriLankan Airlines FlySmiLes members. It is the first collaborative scheme of its kind between a five-star hotel chain and SriLankan Airlines. Miles can be earned and redeemed when members patronize Cinnamon Grands Echo (Italian restaurant), The London Grill (fine dining restaurant) and The Lagoon (Seafood restaurant) as well as Cinnamon Lakesides Royal Thai (Thai cuisine) and Long Feng (Chinese restaurant).
With this partnership, FlySmiLes members can earn 1 FlySmiLes mile on every Rs 100 spent on food and beverage when they patronize these five restaurants. Similarly members have the opportunity to redeem their miles at any of these signature restaurants.
Cinnamon Grand Colombo
The Cinnamon Grand is Sri Lankas largest premium five-star city hotel while Cinnamon Lakeside is the citys biggest urban five star resort. Both properties have cemented their places as Sri Lankas premier hospitality providers and have set the standard for the entire industry.
The Cinnamon Grand is Colombos largest five star city hotel with a vast and varied offering. It is in fact a city within a city with 500 rooms, 14 restaurants and a vast selection of different spaces that have been carefully curated to offer patrons an unforgettable experience.
Cinnamon Lakeside, on the other hand, prides itself on being a resort within the city. Situated in the middle of the mayhem that is Colombo - it takes the city out of the picture and instead replaces it with a far-away feeling of a distant holiday destination. It has 350 rooms, four restaurants, a large swimming pool and lakeside views which come together to offer business and leisure travellers all the rest and relaxation of resort life in an urban setting.
The five restaurants at which this offer is valid are all Cinnamon signature restaurants that define the top-end of Colombos culinary offering. With Cinnamons uncompromising approach to quality, authenticity and service, they are undeniably in a class of their own.
Echo at the Cinnamon Grand is an Italian restaurant that thrives on authenticity. In typically Italian fashion, it spoils the diner with a choice of more than 15 anti-pasti options at its daily business lunch buffet. And thats just a teaser to the main course. The Infinity Buffet every Wednesday is an absolute Italian feast with carefully selected beverages to complement the food.
The Lagoon, at the Cinnamon Grand is reminiscent of the chaos and lively banter of a seafood market within a five star atmosphere. In a country surrounded by ocean and overflowing with seafood restaurants, the Lagoon tops them all with its vastness and excellence. One-hundred-and-fifty different ways to prepare seafood and 30 sauces blend into Indian, Continental, Chinese, Thai and Sri Lankan seafood dishes in the hands of not one  but two specialty chefs.
The London Grill at Cinnamon Grand is a fine dining restaurant. Its nostalgic old-world setting, open style show kitchen and live piano music set the stage for a gourmet culinary experience. The steaks are legendary. Single-malts and gourmet cheese come to the table on roll-in trolleys. Lobster, salmon, escargot and foiegras are presented in new and unique ways while the wine cellar holds a fabled collection. In the world of Colombo fine dining, the London Grill finds itself without peer.
Long Feng at Cinnamon Lakeside takes diners into the heart of ancient China with delightfully traditional interiors and a menu that traverses the length and breadth of the Orient. The Long Feng houses indoor dining, terrace dining and a private dining room especially for friends and family. The afternoons feature a Dim Sum buffet to complement an already enormous culinaryoffering.
Royal Thai at Cinnamon Lakeside is bursting with exotic aromas and flavours that spring to life. Its majestic interior and ambience is completely in keeping with its royal persona. The daring experiments of the Thai Chef combined with private dining spaces, alcoves and Cinnamon scented air seal its reputation as the best Thai restaurant in Colombo.
SriLankan Airlines  the national carrier of Sri Lanka is an award winning airline and is known for its world class, friendly service. It has a global route network of over 100 destinations in 47 countries and has the privilege of being the foreign carrier that serves the highest number of destinations in India.

LEASE OF HAMBANTOTA HARBOUR AND LAND
There had been several letters for and against the government leasing out Hambantota and acres of land in Hambantota area to set up industries by a Chinese government company, culminating in the removal of Minister for Justice and Buddhist Affairs, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on the grounds that he had violated collective decision of the Cabinet in criticizing the Cabinet.
It brings to my mind of nearly similar issue when our country was administered by the Britishers, where the government was accused of alienating land to planters.
The then Governor of Ceylon Sir Hugh Clifford, when addressing the Second Annual Agricultural Conference on March 11, 1927 had this to say.
The Land Question, moreover, is a matter of such tremendous moment and, I might add, of such stupendous difficulty, that it is essential that its complexities should be explored with the calm and with the metal detachment of statesmen, not with the fire and fury of political partisans;.
The most important statement he makes is The government of Ceylon may be constituted, it will always be one of its primary and most imperative duties to guard and defend the land  this great asset of the people, of the taxpayer  from encroachment by individuals or groups of individuals; and further, to the best of its ability, to see that it is alienated in the manner most nicely calculated to promote the prosperity of the island and the highest interests of its inhabitants. This shows the interest they showed to safeguard the land for the people of this country and develop same for prosperity.
Not only that, it was made mandatory that Indian labour employed in estates to go back to India after termination of their services, for which a special train service was provided to Danuskodi so that those numbers did not add to the population of the country. Sadly, our politicians to remain in power granted them citizenship rights and today, they are a power to recon, to form governments.
All in all, the people are not aware of the conditions under which the agreement was reached to lease Hambantota Harbour and land for industries. It is presumed the Chinese labour brought to Sri Lanka, will be asked to leave after their period is over and not given citizenship rights as done in the case of Indian labour. It is also hoped that our personnel will be trained to carry on when the Chinese employees leave after the expiry of the lease.
Let our political leaders and those interested in the welfare of the people and the country learn a lesson from what the colonial rulers displayed to safeguard the interests of the country and its inhabitants.

Coach Woods praises Lankan rugby sevens team
"I am really satisfied about my young team when they became plate champions of the first leg of the Asian Rugby Sevens Tournament as they finished in fifth position, said Sri Lanka Rugby Sevens coach Peter Woods.
Japanese team won the Cup championship when they beat hosting Hong Kong team by 19-12 in the final played at Kings Park Sports Complex, Kowloon, Hong Kong on September 2. The Sri Lankan team participated in B category and they won three matches out of six including three preliminary matches under the captaincy of Sudarshana Muthuthanthri.
"I am happy about the performances of our players. Our players participated in Sri Lanka Super Sevens and Mercantile Services Championships before they come to Hong Kong. Some key players did not participate in this tournament due to injuries, as we did not have enough time for recovery. However we won three matches out of six. It is 50 percent. It is a big thing," Woods said.
"We have to improve many sections and have to overcome our mistakes before the second leg, that means the Korean Rugby Sevens. This championship is a good opportunity for our young players. They gained great experience from Hong Kong Sevens.
I think it is very useful for upcoming Korean Sevens Championship", he stated.
"It was sad not included players like Danushka Ranjan and Chanaka Chandimal for the first leg. They all practiced very hard and wanted to do their best for the country. Danushka was in fine form, but had to withdraw from the squad at the last moment on medical grounds. Hopefully we expect some of injured players will join the squad at the second leg in Korea, Woods further said.

Colombo an important hub for us - Emirates VP
The growth of Emirates as an airline has paralleled the growth of Dubai as a global hub as well as a stopover destination, said Emirates Senior Vice President Commercial Operations, West Asia and Indian Ocean, Ahmed Khoori, recently.
He said the vision the government had for the city has always been aligned to that which it had for the airline and therein lay the key to the success of each.
To illustrate his point about how Emirates airline has grown since its inception, Khoori said he first flew to Colombo sometime between 1989 and 1991, as a young management trainee, on an Emirates Airbus A310 and now, nearly 30 years later, he flew on its A380, the largest and most sophisticated aircraft available today.
Dubai's geographic position, veritably at the centre of the world, makes it strong hub connecting East to West and West to East, which has contributed to Emirates' success, Khoori said. Most major destinations are no more than eight hours away. In addition, Dubai has one of the most sophisticated airports in the world as well as skyscrapers, restaurants, malls and other infrastructure, entertainment and amenities that one finds in any major international city, encouraging passengers not just to transit, but make a stopover.
Emirates' strength is that it has been able to cope with the travails of political upheavals in the region, downturns in the global economy and the ups and down of the aviation industry. Through such tough times as well as in more opportune ones, as in the recent past when fuel prices and the sterling pound fell, the Emirates product has been consistent, he said.
Of the recent one-off A380 flight to Colombo, he said it was to introduce the product to the Sri Lankan market as well as to test the upgraded runway and services at Colombo airport for handling this aircraft. He said Emirates received cooperation from all concerned authorities and was happy with airport services.
Khoori said Colombo is an important market for Emirates which flies passengers from Colombo through Dubai to Europe as more and more Lankans seek employment there. The A380 is deployed on many European routes.
Colombo is also a hub for Emirates which has flights from Colombo to Male and Dubai and from Colombo to Singapore, with easy connections to Melbourne.
Khoori is upbeat about the potential that Colombo has to become a strong hub. He says the country has advantageous geographic positioning and with new resorts, hotels and other infrastructure as well as investment opportunities, Sri Lanka can become a major destination.
He is therefore positive about passenger growth from USA and Europe into Sri Lanka. Passenger numbers in countries like India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, which are in the region he overlooks, is set to grow, he says.
Khoori said Emirates is consistently expanding its route network and upgrading its product as air travel becomes the order of the day. (MM)

Decisive days ahead!
The apparent situation has become dramatic. Yes, Dharma Yuddaya has entered the very center of the Yahapalanaya. Todays UNP is a party that hounds out Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, but will staunchly defend Rajitha Senaratne. UNP while disclaiming that it is the party of pro imperialist bourgeoisie prides itself on being the party of professionals and the educated. Today it is a party that replaces as Minister of Justice, a Presidents Counsel and a former examiner in the Faculty of Law at Colombo University, who has also earned two PhDs, with a mature political lady who has no academic credentials; because Wijedasa proved to be Sinhala Buddhist racist who harassed minority communities and anti fascist leaders.
In spite of the fact that UNP is a party which scrapped the mandatory percentage of electoral candidates under age 35, in order to give a strong presence to females, today it is a strong liberal party that has won the faith of oppressed minorities. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Minister Sajith Premadasa are working closely following Lichchawees tradition. All these changes stem from and reflect the perspective of the leadership. President has come into this liberal combine and emphasizes that Yahapalanaya will continue up to 2022. Dhamma Yuddaya between fascistic Mahinda camp and the camp of unity and reconciliation have become dramatic. Also, we witness the successful action of the Sixty two movement that sends a peoples message to both the government and the opposition. Militant democracy demanded the sooner implementation of promises while indicating that fascistic politics has no chance.
Apparently people overseas sincerely believe that the white van culture is back and that the government is behind it. Their SOLE argument for continuing to support this government, namely that it had restored a modicum of democracy, seems to be collapsing. However, this is completely wrong; there is an intense battle between the democracy that brought forward a positive draft for a new constitution and the fascistic opposition.
Karunanayakes resignation
However, some say the resignation of Minister Ravi Karunanayake due to a suspicion created in the issue concerning the Central Bank Bond scam is a gallant step and it created an example to everybody. In particular, the entire episode shows against the political opponents of the Yahapalana government whom it accused of far worse wrongs. Latter includes the fascistic murder of media men and groups of minority people. Democratic masses that support the government are happy that the reforms it has instituted, in particular, to empower state institutions to act independently are being used more resolutely by those who wish to undermine it than by the government itself. Two examples would be the protests against the lease of the Hambantota port to China and the SAITM private medical school, the grounds for both of which were laid by the previous government. Making use of free media and the democratic establishment pro opposition political and social organisations created almost anarchy with misery. However, in the end, Yahapalanaya in a fair game won the battle.
When the electorate voted at the presidential and general elections for the change of government, they did so because they understood that Mahinda regime was the fascistic menace. Also, promises that the new government leaders and democratic activists made were ones they could identify with. The pledges to bring before the law, those accused of brutal fascistic killings such as Lasantha, horrible racist violence such as Beruwala, war crimes, vast corruption and abuse of power under the former government; and to institute good governance by reinstating the rule of law that took centre stage in the governments election campaign. Today the disillusionment of the electorate is primarily due to these promises not being delivered on. Their disillusionment is increased by the failure of the government to deliver economic benefits to the masses who are struggling to keep afloat amidst the rising cost of living. However, people are willing to keep the faith and push the government forward as shown by the very successful Satyagraha recently launched by the Sixty two movement.
It is correct to say that despite the failures of the government, it has support. Its continuing strength comes in two ways. The first is that the brutal truth is there is no alternative; Mahinda clan is no alternative at all. Hence people continue to hope that Yahapalanaya will deliver on its promises, as they have no alternative to going, as good governance and the protection of human rights are their goals too.
The second is that the government has delivered on the most important aspect of governance, which is to give them a sense of security that their human rights will not be subjected to the arbitrary violation. In particular, women have come forward to be in charge of the rights won. On the other hand minority communities feel they are free and treated as equals. During the period of the last government, this latter fear was widely prevalent. Even people in business, and those at the grassroots equally felt uncertain; who were far from the centers of power, feared for their lives on this count. They felt that there was impunity in the system and those at lower levels too could take the law into their own hands.
President Sirisena quit the previous rule as he could not stand corruption, as explained by himself. Of course, there were other more criminal issues involving the Rajapaksas. Apparently, he protested in all that. PM Ranil helped him to come out and people rallied behind him.
They sought a government which is not burdened with corruption but offers democracy and good governance. Constitutional reforms, electoral reforms, and judicial independence are all linked with the change expected. However, removal of executive presidency and devolution of power put together was the main demand.
During the first term, the President was able to do away with some of his executive powers considered draconian. Besides, he managed to get the 19th Amendment enacted making way for independent commissions to be set up.
However, people are expecting fundamental changes. President has not spelled out his proposal for constitutional change.
Nevertheless, he was able to build up Sri Lankas image in the international arena. Today, it is public knowledge that those responsible for mass scale corruption are exposed. The President said in a recent meeting that he had no way forward with corrupt elements. He vowed to form a government without corrupt elements. No one has accused Ranil Wickremesinghe of corruption. So, this new Yahapalanaya could come out with the support of the UNP. President can consider the fact that Minister Tilak Marapana resigned from the Cabinet once because he was just accused of something. He was the lawyer retained in the Avant Garde case by the defence. This policy will be continued says the UNP general sectary. There are accusations against prominent UNP leaders. PM is accused of safeguarding these people. The UNP cannot remain mute in this regard. Such things are no more; relatively speaking everybody feel relieved. However, this is not enough, not at all; we have to mobilize and fight for more!
About the Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said that they would launch trade union actions in near future. Addressing the media, member of the Media Committee of the GMOA Dr. Prasad Colombage said that the Attorney-General's Department (AG's Dept.) had turned a blind eye to command the government to announce its stance on SAITM and adding the political elements had misled both the AG's department and the government to come out with reasonable solutions over the issue! Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge stressed the government was deliberately delaying to issue, the stance on SAITM, by virtue of the whims and fancies of some politicians and responsible officials.
New taxes
We have almost come to the edge of this struggle to insist the government to abolish SAITM. But, we have not lost our grip and therefore, we are prepared to launch protest marches and vehicle parades followed by massive island-wide trade union actions in near future. What nonsense! The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill (IRB) which is to be tabled in Parliament next week weighted in favour of foreigners and a disadvantage to Sri Lankans, MP Bandula Gunawardena said recently. He told a Joint Opposition news briefing that according to the new Bill, Sri Lankans working abroad would be taxed when they bring in their wealth to the country. However, foreigners working here will be exempted from taxes when they take away their income out of the country. This is not rational, the MP said. Cleary these fascistic elements are irrational. New taxes are formulated to tax the rich while reducing the burden on the poor.
Truth and Justice Project
The MP said senior citizens and those engaged in crop cultivation would also be severely affected by the new amendments.
In the meantime the Truth and Justice Project (ITJP), in South America has filed war crimes lawsuits against former General Jagath Jayasuriya who is now Sri Lankan ambassador to Brazil, Al Jazeera reported recently. The lawsuits against Jayasuriya alleged that he oversaw military units that attacked hospitals and killed, disappeared and tortured thousands of people in the final phase of the war in 2009. Jayasuriya has diplomatic immunity in Brazil and five other countries where he is the ambassador - Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Suriname. But the groups pursuing the suits hope they will compel regional governments to open investigations of Jayasuriya, remove his immunity and expel him, the article said.
Carlos Fernandez, the lawyer who is coordinating the effort, has told a foreign news agency that suits have been filed on Monday in Brazil and Colombia. Hence this will be an occasion to test the validity of war crime accusation.

Diary of a fire lookout
June 1
More than four inches of rain fell in Mayvery unusual. This season has felt more like a paid vacation than work. So far.
I was taking a nap in the tower this afternoon when a group of maybe three dozen ravens came overhead, calling to each other and circling. They wheeled and dipped and sang cronk, cronk, cronk. Two or three would fly seemingly straight up in the air, corkscrewing around each other, and then they would break apart and float away in big looping curlicues. Eventually they drifted off to the north.
As the sun moves overhead the dog likes to sit in the shadow cast by the tower. Like me she is mostly indolent, but also like me she serves as a first-alarm system, a lookout in canine form: at the first sight or sound of hikers she barks and howls to let me know our solitude is about to be sullied.
June 4
A thrill today: first fire of the year, for me anywaythe Loco Fire, just northwest of Loco Mountain. A little plume of gray-white smoke twenty-two miles as the crow flies. It showed at five oclock. I got a cross from Black Mountain, so we knew it to the quarter section. To be the first to spot a smoke is a sublime feeling. You know youre the only person in the world who sees it.
A new smoke often looks beautiful: a wisp of white like a feather, a single snag puffing little fingers of smoke in the air. You see it before it even has a name. In fact, you are about to give it one, after you pinpoint where it is and call it in to dispatch. We try to name the fires after a nearby landmarka canyon, peak, or springbut there is often a touch of poetic license involved. I might have called the Jackass Fire, spotted by the Mogollon Baldy lookout this morning and named for Jackass Park, simply the Ass Fire, to see if I could get away with it. Worked when I named the Drum Fire after Drummond Canyon last year.
June 6
Simply being in the tower tests my resolve today. The wind gusts to near eighty miles an hourmy anemometer only goes to seventy, and the little ball marker shoots straight to the top, signaling a reading off the chart. The dog took one look out the door of the cabin this morning and went back to bed. Standing in place in the tower I feel like Im dancing the jitterbug. There is a lip of metal overhang to the towers roof, to shunt off the rainwater, and when the wind gusts the overhang sounds as if its going to bend or snap upright and shear the roof off. Those CCC boys did a marvelous job erecting this old tower, still sturdy after seventy years in a high and windy place. Sturdy, but not impervious to an eighty-mile-an-hour wind. Luckily there are no big fires at present, and none along the Mogollon or Black Range crests, or theyd be hurling burning pinecones a quarter mile ahead and starting spot fires a dozen at a time.
The Loco Fire is down in the low country, where the winds are much lighter. With all the rain weve had it hasnt burned very hot yet at allmaybe a few dozen acres.
I hung on in the tower all day except for lunch and another break mid-afternoon. The guy-wire cables twirled like jump ropes. I couldnt write or read. I lay on the cot with my eyes closed listening, rising now and then to make sure no fool had left a campfire unattended or thrown a cigarette from a car. The wind was a menacing symphony, discordant and brutal in the trees. An awesome performancethough not a show Id pay to see again.
June 13
As a lookout in high country, I often tell people I get paid to look at trees. But I find myself lately thinking more and more of grass. For millennia fire and grass worked in tandem here. Grass burned quickly and fertilized the soil, from whence came more grass. Fires moved quickly through the forest understory, rarely torching in treetops. Fire kept the saplings in check.
Trees lived in mature stands where most were hundreds of years old. An ancient juniper from the heart of the Gila shows that fire burned around it, on average, every seven years; fire helped it thrive. Ponderosa covered much of the forest in open parkland with trees forty to sixty feet apart, surrounded by grass. Then, in the nineteenth century, the cow arrived.
The grass fires became fewer, brush began to encroach on grassland; pion and juniper crept down the foothills. With the coming of the Forest Service at the beginning of the twentieth century, two values prevailed: respect for cattlemen and disdain for fire. The goal became to put out every fire by ten oclock the morning after it was spotted. As late as 1826 a white explorer reported being fatigued by the difficulty of getting through the high grass, which covered the heavily timbered bottom of the Gila River drainage. The cattle that came soon after devoured the grass, trampled the stream beds, pushed the Gila trout to the edge of extinction, and subsisted many places with the aid of stock tanks rigged to capture running water. Low elevation canyons saw beaver slaughtered for the whims of Eastern fashion; dammed wetlands were drained and with them went the waterbirds.
A century of fire suppression allowed the fir and pine and spruce to grow unchecked in the higher elevations, crowding out the aspen, which love big stand-replacement fires. Brushy ladder fuels took hold and created a link to old-growth crowns; the fires became harder to suppress, so the Forest Service responded with ever more military technology: airplanes, helicopters, chemical drops, a full-scale techno-industrial war on fire.
Now, for the first time, we see catastrophic fires that burn so hot they sterilize the soil on tens of thousands of acres. Prescribed fire is needed more than ever but has been used too capriciously, too often, diminishing the constituency of the reasonable. (Burn down someones house with an intentionally lit fire and see if you win a friend.) Wildland fire use fires are the preferred tool here now: fires started naturally by lightning and allowed to burn within predetermined areas, mostly within the wilderness, far from human settlements. Burn, baby, burnthat is the mantra now in the Gila, and for that reason among others this place is healthier than most places like it in the West. But does it even remotely resemble its optimum post-Pleistocene state Not by any means. Too many cows, too few fires. - Paris Review

Djokovic becomes father of baby girl
BELGRADE AFP Sept3, 2017 :Twelve-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and his wife Jelena have become parents of a baby girl, local media reported on Sunday.
Jelena gave birth on Saturday evening and their second child will be named Tara, Blic newspaper reported on its online edition.
The couple have a two-year-old son Stefan.
The 30-year-old Djokovic announced in July he would miss the rest of the season with an elbow injury. The Serb retired from his Wimbledon quarter-final against Tomas Berdych in July because of the problem, from which is suffering for a year-and-a-half.
Between mid-January 2015 and June 2016, Djokovic won 17 of his 22 finals played in 24 tournaments. It seemed nothing could interrupt his dominance of world tennis.
But for months the Serbian national hero -- now fourth in the world rankings -- has been a shadow of his former self.
Since winning the French Open last year to complete the career Grand Slam, he has failed to claim another major title.
He crashed out of the Australian Open in the second round and the French Open in the last eight.
Djokovic said in July he would need a couple of months without the racket but that surgery was not an option.
With Andre Agassi continuing as his coach while he recovers, Djokovic now intends to be ready to start the new season at the beginning of 2018.

The issue has caused consternation among some members of the School Development Society. They allege that the school is already having 15 non-academic staff in excess.
Principal Tudor Perera confirmed that his school has a driver idling since he cannot be assigned with other duties. The principal had informed the Zonal Education Office about it.
The Principal said the driver was a resident of Kurunegala. He comes to work by bus and signs the register and goes back home in the evening, he said.

Especially tasked for defence
In 1984 September, I have just returned to the island after undergoing specialized training in the UK (Hampshire) and qualified as a small arms officer.
September 1, 1984, was a Sunday. Most of us who were in the pistol shooting team proceeded to Kalutara Police College firing range every Sunday morning from FFHQ in a vehicle for practical shooting practices.
DIGG M D Perera, Muni Gomes, Sumith Liyanage, Zerney Wijesuriya, SSPP Deva Corea, T H Jayah and many others were in that Police vehicle with Ravi Jayewardene (J R Jayewardene was the President at that time) who also used to travel with us in our Police vehicle for firing practices.
Before practices commence, we normally clean our weapons and prepare. In that group Zerney Wijesuriya was also cleaning his weapon and suddenly looked at me and told me that he is taking over STF as Commandant from today and he explained, what is STF role and he told me that they are looking for an officer to be in charge of (as OIC) and he thinks I will fit in there and suggested me to join the STF.
Role of the STF
I was not fully aware of the STF responsibilities, as I was away from the country for over one year in England. I was not too sure of the role of the STF.
I did not give my word for two reasons. If I joined a unit like that, I had to undergo training and I will be posted outstations and will be away from my family again. I was married less than two years and had a child just eight months. When I came to the firing lane Ravi Jayewardene was on the left flank next to me. He suddenly looked at me and said: Nimal I heard the good news. You are joining the STF. Then I told him I just returned from abroad, I was away from my family for a long period and I had to consult my wife, who was a very young working girl at that time. But Jayewardene again insisted that I consider his request. After the firing practices were over in the evening, I came home to my quarters at Bambalapitiya. I was an Inspector at that time and I explained to my wife the proposal. Because the son was small, her working and me being away from family for a long period, this was to be a difficult thing. She did not completely overrule the possibility of my joining STF. One hour later around 7.30 p.m, I got a call from Field Force Commandant SSP G B Dissanayake asking me to come and see him in his office immediately. I got into the uniform and went to his office.
He told me, I have to go to Katunayake Air Base to bring four bodies of the STF personnel, who got caught to a landmine in Thinnaveli, Jaffna.
It was a huge drawback. What will my family think now
Later I had to make a huge effort to explain the situation to my wife when she vehemently disagreed with me for joining the STF. I had a good career as a Policeman in addition to being a recognized outstanding sportsman in the Police where IGP had recognised me as an officer with a future.
Since I was keen to join, she discussed the same with her parents finally I decided to join the STF. I underwent a specialized training conducted by Ex-British SAS Officers and I was posted to Kalawanchikudi Base as Base Commander in 1984. Former IGP N K Illangakoon (ASP at that time) was posted to Kalladi Camp as Commanding Officer. Initially, the STF had only two camps in the Batticaloa Ampara District.
It was a highly demanding role and a strenuous journey where various high-profile responsibilities handled during the dark days of our country. Protecting the President in the late 80s soon after the Parliament bomb blast, the STF under me was entrusted with the security of the President and I was appointed as Head of the STF unit to protect the then President, J R Jayewardene. In 1993 after the assassination of President Premadasa I was called up to protect the new Prime Minister and made me Director of Prime Ministers security. Both assignments were completed successfully. Since the terrorists were planning to dilute the Sinhala leadership, we were determined to make sure that they would never get that opportunity.
Anti-terror operations
Leading the troops on many occasions to capture and destroy terrorist hideouts, all LTTE bases in Batticaloa were captured under my leadership. They are 48 base in Kanjikudiaru, 46 Base in Mailawattuwana and the biggest base Beirut in Kokkadicholai. Some of these operations were airborne and very risky targets. We took total control of the Eastern Province and cleared same in 2008.
Apart from the anti-terror operations, VIP protection, prepared of security assessment for VIPP, security plans of key installations in Parliament, Sapugaskanda refinery etc in the country were successfully implemented under my leadership. I thank Ravi Jayewardene and Zerni Wijesuriya for keeping faith in me and entrusting me with a huge task which will go down in the STF and countrys history.
My wife and (my children) later, were a real source of inspiration and strength to me whenever I was in tremendous pressure and stood by me at every moment and the excellent support and understanding I had from the rank and file in the STF are unbelievable. We, as the STF/Police officers, have done our part without any lapses and with the huge commitment. Today, we have a society, where people can live in harmony.
I only hope that all politicians do their part the way that we in the SF did, to eradicate terrorism and build a comfortable environment where all political actors will have to rally round with the President and give all the necessary support to build a prosperous country for our younger generation. For this, we must have correct people at the correct place and we only expect this from the politicians.
It is their duty and responsibility, as many have sacrificed a lot to achieve peace.

Ex Sampath Bankers  Club completes two  more CSR projects
Ex Sampath Bankers Club completed its first CSR project when it set up a Childrens Library at a school which lacked many facilities as the children were all from very poor families in the area.
Duwegoda Primary School which is located in Halkadawala a remote area in the Kalutara District. The Executive Council of the Club took a decision to continue to assist the same school by engaging in more CSR projects in order to stay focused and continue to improve the schools facilities .
The representatives of the Club who visited the school observed that the standard of English of the students was very poor. It was impossible for the only English teacher in the school to single handedly handle the gigantic task of teaching English to all students in the school.
Almost all the parents were not literate in English which added to the problem. Therefore the Executive Council of the Club decided to engage a teacher from a school nearby to provide English tuition to the students.
The classes were started in March 2017 and it was heartening to see that the students can now have a simple conversation about their personal details in English. Furthermore, they were very keen and were happy to be learning the language.
Sampath Bank provided the thirty nine school with bags along with tills and they were presented to the new students at this ceremony.
The school principal, teachers and the parents in their speeches expressed their appreciation of the contribution made by the Club to fulfill a long felt need of this poor remote school. Ex Sampath Bankers Club thanked all those who contributed towards this worthy cause and looks forward to their continued support for its future projects as well.

Fathers influence stronger sibling ties
Usually, mothers and maternal sisters dominate all aspects of an individuals social life, but a recent baboon study has revealed how a father plays an important role in encouraging sibling bonding among his kids.
Lead author Emily Lynch from the University of Missouri, Columbia, US highlighted how social bonds develop between paternal half-siblings when their shared father is in the vicinity. Researchers studied the movements and interactions of a group of 39 immature olive baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis) in the Laikipia district of Kenya for fourteen months.
Half of the parents of the baboons in this group had been caught by leopards within a period of two months prior to data collection. This relatively rare occurrence allowed the researchers to examine possible differences in the social bonds and behaviour of wild immature baboons that grow up with or without the influence of mothers and fathers.
Fecal samples were also collected and were used as genetic samples to establish kinship. The strongest bonds were found between young baboons who shared a mother, while the weakest relations were among those who were not related in any way.
Notably, paternal half-siblings enjoyed bonds of intermediate strength. This bond only existed among immature olive baboons when their mutual father was around.
His presence also increased the chances that his offspring would groom each other. When their fathers were present, young baboons had weaker relationships with maternal half-siblings than those without fathers.
The presence of a father in a group facilitates the development of strong social bonds among his offspring, Lynch stated. This recognition may be driven through familiarity with a shared father or through some form of phenotype matching, the researchers stated. The research appears in Journal of Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.

Foetuses with Lethal Congenital Anomalies should be allowed to be aborted: Health Minister

Foetuses with Lethal Congenital Anomalies should be detected early and aborted since allowing an abnormal human being to be born is a sin, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne stated.
Minister Senaratne said that the proposal to allow abortion of foetuses with Lethal Congenital Anomalies and foetus conceive due to rape will be submitted to the Cabinet once the Health Ministry receives it in writing.
During the Annual Academic Sessions of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka, aproposal was made to legalise abortion in two occasions. But still the proposal has not been forwarded to the Health Ministry in writing, the Minister stated.

Food for drought affected temples
The Government will provide a basket of food items worth Rs. 5,000 to each temple in drought affected areas since devotees in these areas find it difficult to provide dana to the Maha Sangha.
Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickreme Perera disclosed this when he called on the Malwatte and the Asgiriya Prelates at their temples in Kandy and received blessings on September 2.
The Minister regretted the recent controversy at the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya and said he hoped to bring in regulations governing devalayas through a parliamentary act.
He said he has paid attention towards making a daham pasal certificate compulsory to obtain jobs in the state sector.
Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Maha Thera of the Malwatte Chapter said he had struggled for 12 years to get the Buddhist Vihara and Devalagam Act and the Theravada Ecclesiastical Code registered without any success since no one came to his assistance to get it done. Ultimately he had decided to keep mum about it.
The Most Ven, Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Champter said he witnessed many shortcomings at northern temples during his recent tour of Jaffna and a programme should be launched to address the situation.

Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 42.4% (or LKR 1.38Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH & Aitken Spence which accounted for 92.58% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banking ,Finance & Insurance Sector meanwhile accounted for 38.29% (or LKR 1.24Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Commercial Bank, Sampath Bank, Amana Takaful & HNB which accounted for 79.51% of the sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 7.39% (or LKR 0.24Bn) to the market driven by Nestle which accounted for 94.77% of the sector turnover.

Amana Life was the weeks highest price losers, declining 13.3% W-o-W to close at LKR 1.30 while CIT (13.1% Y-o-Y), Taprobane (-12.1% W-o-W) & Nuwara Eliya Hotels(-11.2% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net selling position with total net outflows amounting to LKR 0.43Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 0.25Bn (-274.7% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases increased by 25.6% W-o-W to LKR 1.24Bn from last weeks value of LKR 0.99Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 1.68Bn relative to LKR 0.74Bn recorded last week (+126.1% W-o-W).
In terms of volume, JKH & Teejay Lanka led foreign purchases while Aitken Spence & Commercial Bank led foreign sales.
In terms of value, JKH & HNB led foreign purchases while Aitken Spence Holdings and Nestle led foreign sales.
Point of view
The ASPI continued to lose grounds by 18.63 points (-0.29% W-o-W) to end at 6,390.74 points with retail activity remaining mostly flat with some profit taking as policy concerns over Inland Revenue Bill buoyed market sentiment1.
Turnover value however rose by 22.8% W-o-W to LKR 3.24Bn, supported mostly by institutional participation in crossings which accounted for 30.88% (or LKR 1.00Bn) of the total turnover value. Counters including JKH, Nestle, Amana Takaful, Commercial Bank and Sampath garnered significant HNI interest among crossings, with large transactions in these counters contributing to 28.53% of the weeks total market turnover that helped drive the rebound in turnover. Consequently, weeks average daily turnover value stood at LKR 0.81Bn over the week, compared to LKR 0.53Bn in the week before.
Meanwhile, foreign investors marked a turnaround ending the week on a net selling position of LKR 0.43Bn after 30 consecutive weeks of foreign buying, mostly attributable to the LKR 0.50Bn transaction in Aitken Spence.
In terms of foreign purchases, JKH topped foreign purchases while Aitken Spence topped foreign sales (both in terms of value and volume of shares).
We expect activity in the following week to be determined by policy direction toward the Inland Revenue Bill expected to be presented in the parliament on September 6th.
Broadly positive June quarter earnings
~54% of the 276 corporates reported positive earnings in the Quarter ending June17 where total market earnings reached LKR 53.9Bn relative to LKR 49.5Bn (up ~8.8%) reported by the same companies in June16. Banks Finance & Insurance companies along with Diversified, Beverage Food & Tobacco, Manufacturing, Construction and Telecommunication led the growth in June quarter earnings.
Gains in Banks, Finance & Insurance (+16% Y-o-Y) companies were led by counters such as COMB, SAMP, HNB, LOLC while gains in Diversified (+29% Y-o-Y) were led by stocks such as JKH, MELS, FLCH, VONE & HHL.

Germany stars slam fans for Nazi chants
BERLIN, Saturday - Germany players have blasted a hardcore group of fans for shouting Nazi-era chants during a World Cup qualifier as the world champions hope to secure a finals berth on Monday.
Germany have three qualifiers left but can wrap up their place at next year's tournament in Russia by beating Norway in Stuttgart on Monday if nearest rivals Northern Ireland fail to beat the Czech Republic the same night in Belfast.
However, the behaviour of a group of travelling fans in Friday's 2-1 win against the Czechs in Prague has shocked Joachim Loew's team.
The chants were particularly embarrassing from a German perspective as they came on the anniversary of the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, which started World War II in 1939.
Mats Hummels late header in Prague maintained Germany's perfect record of seven wins from seven World Cup qualifiers.
But the result was tainted by the repulsive chants, while German fans whistled during the minute's silence before kick-off for two deceased Czech officials. Chants of Sieg Heil (Hail Victory) from a block of German fans during the game were heard by the horrified players on the pitch.
Germany striker Timo Werner was also verbally abused by a 200-strong group of travelling supporters despite scoring the opening goal after four minutes. The 21-year-old RB Leipzig forward is unpopular after diving to win a penalty during a controversial Bundesliga match last season at Schalke.
The Germany players refused to go to the away block after the final whistle, as is customary.
The chants were a catastrophe -- really bad, fumed Hummels. That started during the minute's silence, which showed the bad behaviour of some fans.
Timo Werner was insulted and ridiculed, that is when the fans started shouting that shit.
We distance ourselves completely from it and want nothing to do with it.
That's why we didn't go (to the away fans). These people aren't fans, they are trouble-makers, hooligans who have nothing to do with football fans.
We have to get them out of stadiums.
Werner thinks the chants could have come from Dynamo Dresden supporters, arch rivals of his RB Leipzig club. Dresden, the heartland of Germany's right-wing scene, is just 150 kilometres (93mi) from Prague. You know what is nearby, so you can imagine where that comes from, he said. The DFB president Reinhard Grindel was proud of the fine sense the team showed in making a stance and said that a group of German fans had managed to buy tickets without the DFB's consent.
The German Football Association (DFB) hope there will be no repeat of such poor behaviour from their own fans against Norway. We will never tolerate fascist, racist, insulting or homophobic battle cries, said Grindel.
Together - as a team, the fans and DFB - we have to face these trouble-makers.
Werner is looking forward to playing in his home city Stuttgart, where he started his career, even if he may face more jeers and insults during the match against Norway. I'm looking forward to Stuttgart, even if I should face a few whistles there, I don't care. I'll just play my game, he said. - AFP

Grip on crippling panic attacks
Panic attacks can be powerful, frightening and out of your control. Those who experience panic attacks learn that they are highly unpleasant experiences. This week a Senior Lecturer attached to the Department of Psychiatry of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya,Dr.ThiliniRajapakse speaks about this common disorder faced by many in our society.
Q - What is a panic attack
A  Anxiety is useful and often motivates us to do things, and may keep us safe. But excessive anxiety can lead to a panic attack. A panic attack is an episode of severe anxiety. In a panic attack, the feelings of anxiety often start very suddenly, out of the blue, without warning. These feelings of anxiety increase very quickly often over minutes to become extremely severe.
The person experiencing the panic attack will suddenly feel a whole combination of physical symptoms of anxiety such as sweating, tremor, palpitations, difficulty in breathing and dizziness.
Together with these sudden severe physical feelings of anxiety, the person will also feel extremely worried and fearful.He may feel terrified of losing control or of dying, or of having a heart attack.
These feelings of severe anxiety are usually short lasting. It will gradually become lessover a period of minutes or at most an hour or two. But the experience can be very frightening.
After the panic attack the person feels completely back to normal but he/she may be very worried about what happened, and also may worry about getting another attack again in the future.
Sometimes the feelings of anxiety, like palpitations and breathlessness, are so severe, that the person having the panic attack, may actually think they are having a heart attack.
Often they may rush to the emergency treatment unit of a hospital, with their family. But panic attacks are all due to anxiety. There is no underlying physical, cardiac or respiratory issues and relevant investigations will be normal.
Some people may experience one panic attack, and may not experience it ever again. Some others may experience recurrent panic attacks, which may occur intermittently spread over weeks or months.
People who are depressed, or who are suffering from another anxiety disorder (such as social phobia) are more vulnerable to experience panic attacks. Occasionally, a person may experience repeated panic attacks (four or more a month) in the absence of any other psychiatric disorder in this situation it is called a panic disorder.
Q How can panic attacks be treated
A  If you experience several panic attacks, occurring intermittently it is best to seek a psychiatrists opinion and assistance.If the panic attacks are happening in the context of a depression or another anxiety disorder, then it is important to treat that underlying disorder.
The psychiatrist would asses and discusses these options with you.
When the underlying depression gets better, the panic attacks will also cease.If the panic attacks are due to a panic disorder, then there is both medication and non-pharmacological management for this as well.Apart from medication, there are specific relaxation exercises, and breathing exercises, that will help reduce anxiety.
Q How can others assist a person experiencing an acute panic attack
A  If somebody is experiencing a panic attack, it is important to remain calm and supportive. Try to avoid getting very excited and panicking yourself! If the person has experienced these attacks before, reassure them about what is happening, help them to sit down or lie down and practice the breathing exercises or relaxation exercises that they would have been taught by the doctor. If the anxiety is very extreme during these episodes, the doctor may also give a medication to be taken if needed.
Q - How can we prevent a vulnerable person developing a panic attack
A  It is hard to predict when a panic attack will happen as it occur without warning. But if you have experienced repeated panic attacks, seek medical advice and treatment and continue the medication for as advised. It isalso importantto practice the relaxation exercises and strategies. This is the best way to minimize the risk of recurrence of panic attacks.
Q How can a normal healthy person avoid panic attacks
A  Keeping up with good healthy habits is the best! For example, for a start avoid repeatedly breaking rest at night.
As far as possible, get adequate sleep at night. This is a key to good mental health.Regular exercise is also important to maintain both physical and mental health. When we do brisk exercise, our body releases endorphin (a natural hormone) that makes us feel relaxed and de-stressed afterwards. These are like the bodys natural anxiolytic.
Other strategies like good time management, having time to relax, taking abreak, these are all sensible strategies to minimize anxiety in our everyday lives. Of course, with our busy lifestyles and responsibilities, you may say this is easier said than done. But if we try, it is possible. Sometimes we just dont allow ourselves time off we may feel guilty or obliged to carry out all our responsibilities and duties for our families and work.
But if we give ourselves some time off / time to relax we will be healthier, feel better, and in the longer term, this will allow us to do our jobs and look after the people we care about better.
It could be as simple as taking time off to listen to your favourite music for half an hour, or baking a cake, or starting dancing lessons, or going on a hike, or reading a book or just gossiping with a close friend. Find and practice whatever that works for you and helps your relax.

Hamilton delights in spoiling Ferrari party
Monza: Lewis Hamilton heaped praise on Mercedes after he and Valtteri Bottas outclassed Ferrari on their 70th anniversary at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday.
The 32-year-old Briton, who is seeking his fourth world title, moved three points clear of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in the title race after Mercedes delivered a stunning one-two to wreck the home fans' celebrations.
Vettel finished third, more than 30 seconds adrift of the Silver Arrows, in front of a 93,000 crowd packed into the classic Autodromo Nazionale circuit at Monza.
"Today, it was all about teamwork," said Hamilton, who shrugged aside boos from the 'tifosi' during a spectacular podium ceremony.
"It was about the team pulling together and maximising the car. It was fantastic... It really was a dream to drive.
"It's obviously such an incredibly exciting season. The last two races have been incredibly strong for us as a team. We have gone from strength to strength.
"I'm not really sure why the pace of the Ferrari was not closer to us, as it usually is, but the car felt fantastic today, particularly in the first stint. "Ultimately, we did the better job this weekend. I guess, because we had a bit of breathing space, it was easier for us to extend the life of the tyre  perhaps, if we had a Ferrari behind us, we would have been pushed."
Hamilton took over as leader of the championship for the first time this year with his lights-to-flag victory, his sixth this year, his fourth at Monza and the 59th of his career.
"And, you know, I love Italy and I look forward to coming back here next year and to the rest of this season... It's still close and there's a long way to go," he added.
"Now, we go to a track  Singapore  where Ferrari should be quick, with the down-force, but the fight will continue. AFP

Hirdaramani IT Arm, H One launches RES.Q | QMS for apparel sector
Sri Lankas leading enterprise solution provider H One launched RES.Q | QMS, a quality management solution tailor-made to minimise defects in apparel manufacturing.
H Ones solution draws on the rich heritage of expertise provided by its parent company - Hirdaramani Group, a 120-year old apparel powerhouse in Sri Lanka.
RES.Q | QMS is a cloud-based IT solution that provides decision-makers with a 360 view of factory floor production quality. It uses data analytics to improve production quality, eliminates reporting time lags, enables faster and more accurate decision-making and reduces wastage.
Director H One Rakhil Hirdaramani speaks at the RES.Q launch on the challenges of the global apparel manufacturing industry and why smart solutions are so critical moving forward
It can be used by anyone with minimal training and easily adapted by apparel manufacturing businesses of any size - small, medium or large. RES.Q | QMS doesnt require costly servers and can be set up in under a week.
The platform is also exceptionally affordable; a single device facilitating quality inspectors on the production floor will cost as little as Rs 175 per day. RES.Q | QMS is also 100% paperless and functions via a device positioned with a supervisor at the end of each factory line.
The solution builds on a concept known as Industry 4.0, which advocates the idea of a smart factory. In a smart factory, digital and physical systems monitor the physical processes on the factory floor to bring greater visibility and speed to the decision-making process. Apparel has struggled to move towards Industry 4.0, as it is constrained by the inability of systems to fully address or resolve issues unique to the manufacturing process. RES.Q | QMS fills a critical technology gap, helping decision-makers tackle hidden and often, recurring quality issues which often eat away at profitability, head-on.
RES.Q | QMS, in effect improves the overall cut-to-ship ratio faced by apparel manufacturers. The cut-to-ship ratio is a key performance indicator in any garment factory and represents the losses incurred from the point a factory cuts pieces of a garment to fulfill an order to when it is shipped out to the customer. In Sri Lanka, where apparel is a US$ 4 billion turnover industry, the average cut to ship ratio is 98% - for most manufacturers the loss is incurred in millions. RES.Q | QMS estimates that with its analytical insight, manufacturers can cut back on this 2% loss; for example, by reducing internal sewing line defects by 50% and cutting the traditional 10% end of line defect rate by half, thus saving up to US$ 40-80 million per year on internal defects. This is a conservative estimate, given that actual defect rates are usually much higher than those published.
We developed RES.Q | QMS because we know the challenges faced by apparel manufacturers intimately. We field-tested our solution for over a year within Hirdaramani factories. We were deliberate and methodical because it was really important to us to get this right.

Hong Kong, criminal city that knows no night
Hong Kongthe Fragrant Harbor or the Barren Rock The Cantonese named it the former; the early British colonialists in the mid-19th century the latter. Captured by the Royal Navy after the First Opium War (1839-1842) and politically cauterized from the mainland of China by a most unequal treaty signed in the face of British gunboats.
Hong Kong Island was to be Englands in perpetuity, with Kowloon and the New Territories (that are essentially part of the Chinese mainland) leased for 99 years. In 1997 those 99 years came to an end, Britain surrendered the territory in the Handover, and Hong Kong reverted to Chinese control becoming a Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic.
Wealthiest tycoons
One of the most densely populated cities in the world, stunning banks of high rises surround a harbor above which rises the Peak, once home to only the most senior of Colonial officials and now only the wealthiest of tycoons. Across Victoria Harbor, Kowloon is raucous, always busy and thanks to the citys obsession with neon, never dark as you pass through Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok and Kowloons other districts. Away from the hustle and bustle the islands of Lantau, Lamma and dozens of smaller oases have beaches and coves to explore, while the more sparsely populated New Territories extend to the border with mainland China at Lo Wu.
The quintessential Hong Kong of densely packed streets and the rhythmic cacophony of Cantonese contrasting with verdant islands and unexpected countryside is perhaps best captured in John le Carrs sole Asian outing, The Honourable Schoolboy (1977). The Hong Kong weather burns hot and clear and breathless as Jerry Westerby wanders from the legendary Foreign Correspondents Club to his safe house on Cloudview Road in down-at-heel North Point. Le Carr, as ever, hits all the marksthe FCC, the American Club, snobby cocktail parties, the Peak Mafia of HSBC bankers, the Governor, senior military commanders, ruddy-faced club stewards and the odd resident OBEs and CBEs of the British community trading on past glories.
Then down to noodles in the backstreets of Kennedy Town and compromising indiscretions in the Girly Bars of Wan Chai. The novel still stands as perhaps the most intricate description of post-war colonial Hong Kong in literature.
Doorstoppers
Others have delved into Hong Kongs past and there are some old time bestselling blockbusters, notably James Clavells twin doorstoppers Tai-Pan (1966), where Hong Kongs foundation as a colony is a story with plenty of crimes, and later Cold War thriller Noble House (1981). Perhaps most people thinking of Hong Kong-set novels capturing the 1950s and 1960s will recall Han Suyins Love is a Many-Splendored Thing (1952) and Richard Masons The World of Suzie Wong (1957).
However, none of these, strictly speaking, are crime novelsthough you might count stealing other peoples territory, their secrets, creating an opium-selling empire, being forced to be an illegal immigrant and working as a prostitute as minor infractions of the law! But well stick with genre and go with the rather lesser known A Coffin From Hong Kong (1962) by James Hadley Chase.
When a Hong Kong girl turns up dead in Nelson Ryans office, the Pasadena P.I. is in the frame and gets himself on a plane to Hong Kong to prove his innocence.

I was able to change a corrupt electoral process: Faiszer
I was able to change a corrupt electoral process and give a rightful place to those deserving and reform the entire social system. With the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, with great difficulty, I was able to change this corrupt electoral process, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
He said so addressing the media on the historical political achievement with the introduction for the 20th amendment to the constitution, yesterday.
According to political commentators, this act will become a reason for a great revolution in the field of politics.
With the introduction of 25 percent womens representation, the voice of women in Parliament will be increased and we can expect a new political culture where morality and justice will prevail.
"I am thankful to the Secretary to the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Cabinet ministers of the Government, Chairman of the Election Commission, delimitation committee who helped me to succeed in this endeavor and those who encouraged me by their criticisms," he added.
"I respectfully thank everyone who gave me the strength in this process. Everyone was a source of strength to me. I did all of these for the people of the country," he said.
Because of my actions today, I believe that in the future, we will have an intelligent political generation. Especially we have achieved a big victory in introducing 25 percent womens representation. I believe that where there are women present, the opportunities for corruption will be reduced," the minister said.

Increase in price of lunch packet unreasonable and unfair: CEA Chairman
Increasing the price of a lunch packet by Rs.10 in the wake of the lunch sheet ban is highly unreasonable and unfair by the consumers, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Prof Dharmasiri pointed out the polythene ban that came into effect from September 1 was for the common good of peoples health and environmental protection, adding that it needs the wholehearted support of all segments of society.
Food vendors are not without options. A biodegradable sheet is available in the market. The producers of this sheet said they could offer it at Rs.1.50. The price of a lunch sheet is about 75 cents. How fair is it to increase a lunch packet by Rs 10 in view of this marginal change of cost, he asked.
He said in addition to biodegradable sheets, many suppliers have come forward to supply banana and lotus leaves for the purpose of preparing lunch packets.
They ask for a price of Rs.5 for it. Still the additional cost the buyer has to bear will be worthy given the flavour and aroma it adds. It is purely a matter of spending a few more Rupees for the good of your own health, he remarked.
Prof Dharmasiri, pointing out that the reactions of the people at large over the decision to ban lunch sheets and shopping bags have been encouraging, said the majority of comments were in support to the move.
I could read several web comments in news sites over this matter. I understood that the people welcome this move and are ready to walk the extra mile to make it successful, Dharmasiri added.
Observing that the Sri Lanka Canteen Owners Association has so far not sought any meeting with him, said the CEA is ready for discussion at any time. Resorting to cheap actions or protests wont do. They have to come to grips with the current situation, the CEA Chairman said.
The Sri Lanka Canteen Owners Association on Friday decided to increase the price of a lunch packet by Rs.10 in protest against the ban on lunch sheets.
Association President Asela Sampath said they would also consider revising the prices of other food items such as string hoppers, kottu, fried rice, pittu etc as they are also usually wrapped in lunch sheets.
President Maithripala Sirisena on Friday issued a Gazette Extraordinary prohibiting manufacture, sale, offer for sale, offer free of charge,exhibition or use of polythene or any polythene product that are 20 microns and below,lunch sheets,grocery bags,food containers (lunch boxes), plates, cups, and spoons from expanded polystyrene.

Low-fat diets could kill you
Low-fat diets could actually raise your risk of early death by a quarter, a major study has indicated. The Lancet looked at 135,000 adults and discovered that those who cut back on fats had far shorter lives than those who ate butter, cheese and meats.
It is in direct opposition to health advice that people should reduce their fat intake  the NHS warns against having too much saturated fat because it raised cholesterol levels which can cause heart disease.
Those who cut out fat tend to replace it with carb-heavy products like bread, pasta and rice. This means they miss out on important nutrients.
Carb-laden diets are among the most unhealthy, and the study found that those scoffing refined sugar and processed meals have a 28% higher risk of early death.The Canadian research  based on studies on people in 18 countries - was put forward at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Barcelona. The findings are stark: low intakes of saturated fat increase the chances of early death by 13%. Consuming high levels of all fats cuts early death rates by up to 23%. Researcher Dr Andrew Mente, from McMaster University, said that getting 35% of calories from fat was the sweet spot for good health. Loosening the restriction on total fat and saturated fat and imposing limits on carbohydrates when high to reduce intake to moderate levels would be optimal. NHS guidance is for men to eat a maximum of 30g of saturated fat per day, with a limit of 20g for women.Lead researcher Dr Mahshid Dehghan said anyone who gets more than 60% of their calories from carbohydrates is at risk of early death. http://www.independent.co.uk

Modern Toilet Restaurant has you eating out of a toilet bowl!
This is as strange a restaurant as it can get. And no I am not kidding, this is the Toilet Bowl Restaurant located at Ximending. Well, the colourful Taiwan also has eating locales that resemble jailhouses and hospitals.
Lets see. You walk in, and sit on covered toilet bowls (which is kind of hard and uncomfortable). You eat on a glass table which is on top of a bath tub. The brown mushy curry comes in a mini-black plastic toilet bowl, fries in bath-tubs and drinks are served in miniature urinal. It makes reading newspaper on the bowl more appropriate.
The first Marton Toilet Restaurant opened in 2004 in Taipei by Wang Tzi-Wei and a group of muckrakers, inspired by a cartoon Dr. Slump that featured a toilet drawing on a menu. It first started with selling chocolate ice cream on toilet bowl plates and has been flushing with success ever since.
Anybody in the right mind should order a Modern Toilet Chicken Curry (NT 200 or SGD$8.60) which is like gooey sauce with a sad looking broccoli in the middle. The soft carrots make the dish look like a form of diarrhoea. Anyway, just eat it and it should taste like a sweeter version of Japanese curry.
The Mediterranean Seafood Au Gratin (NT 250 or SGD$10.70) comes in a less exciting form  a mini bath tub. The food generally is not fantastic, but definitely decent and more fun to eat from. Not restaurant standard, but should be better than fast food.
Order something like dark chocolate ice cream and you will have a bizzare time, shooting all combinations of yourself playing with s*** This is crazy place and people love it. You can seal the deal by washing your hands in a toilet bowl!

MP Bandula distorts Inland Revenue Act: Finance and Media Minister
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said MP Bandula Gunawardena was making distorted statements on the Inland Revenue Act following Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is conspiring to disrupt the current regime.
"MP Bandula Gunawardena had stated recently that the new Inland Revenue Acts was in favour of foreigners. He seems to have conveniently forgotten the various tax holidays and exemptions given by the ministers of the previous regimes to their cronies and nepotists making use of the provisions of the Strategic Development Act," Minister Samaraweera said.
"The actions of the previous regime in granting long term tax concessions and tax holidays in an undue and unjustifiable manner to their henchmen and to selected foreign nationals upon lucrative commissions have resulted in the distortion in economic benefits in the country. This situation has led to 10 percent of the population to enjoy 54 percent of the economic benefits,: the minister said.
"The Government has introduced a transparent policy of tax concessions through the new Inland Revenue Act where all parties including the so far neglected local investors can enjoy tax concessions upon their investments putting an end to the era of going behind politicians and their henchmen by bribing them for such concessions," Minister Samaraweera said.
"Since the Act clearly defines tax concessions available to investors, they can recognise beforehand the tax concessions they deserve," he said.
"Mahinda Rajapaksa and his group is against streamlining tax holidays due to fear that in future no politician would have the upper hand in deciding the issuing of tax holidays to investors because the Ministers of the previous regime made use of the Strategic investment Act to arrogate powers unto themselves and to make money for them," he said.
"With the introduction of this Act, the discretionary power vested in the Finance Minister to grant tax concessions will also be negated," he said.
The present Finance Minister would like assure the caretakers of religious institutions as well as the entire public that theres no truth whatsoever in the canards propagated to mislead the public claiming the members of families with an annual income of Rs. six lakhs, senior citizens and religious institutions will be taxed by the new Act," Minister Samaraweera said.
He said the Government would launch eight new concessionary loan schemes in September for diverse beneficiaries including entrepreneurs, small and medium scale industrialists, farmers and journalists through state and private sector banks introducing tax concessions and tax holidays in comparison to their investments.

Nadal, Federer move on at US Open
NEW YORK, Sunday - Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer edged closer to a US Open semi-final blockbuster on Saturday as controversial Italian Fabio Fognini was kicked out for a vile, misogynistic tirade at a female umpire.
Nadal, 31, saw off Argentine lucky loser Leonardo Mayer 6-7 (3/7), 6-3, 6-1, 6-4, taking his record over the world number 59 from Buenos Aires to 4-0. He will face Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov, against whom he is 6-2, for a place in the quarter-finals.
Five-time champion Federer brushed aside 31st seed Feliciano Lopez 6-3, 6-3, 7-5 to take his career record against the Spaniard, playing a 63rd successive Grand Slam, to 13-0.
Next up for Federer is Philipp Kohlschreiber, who he leads 11-0.
Nadal had dropped the first set of his second-round match against Japan's Taro Daniel before winning in four.
Saturday was almost a carbon copy with the 15-time major winner unable to convert any of six points in the opener.
But the match turned in the 10-minute seventh game of the second set when, on his 14th break point of the encounter, Nadal finally smashed through.
It was tough. It took 14 break points -- that's not a good figure. But I was there mentally and fought a lot at the right moments, said Nadal under the Arthur Ashe roof as rain fell outside. Federer had needed back-to-back five-setters to defeat Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny in his first two rounds.
However, on Saturday, he swept past Lopez to reach the fourth round for the 16th time. I'm very happy to get through.
It's a great feeling to play out here, said Federer. I struggled in the first two rounds but tonight I played a very clean match.
Kohlschreiber, the German 33rd seed, eliminated Australia's John Millman 7-5, 6-2, 6-4.
Austrian sixth seed Dominic Thiem defeated France's Adrian Mannarino 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 to make the last 16 for the third time in four years. Thiem next faces 2009 champion Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, who put out Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
Russia's Andrey Rublev became the second teenager in the last 16 when he beat Bosnia's Damir Dzumhur 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.
Rublev, just 19, faces Belgian ninth seed David Goffin, who progressed when 2016 semi-finalist Gael Monfils retired with a right knee injury.
Meanwhile, Fognini was kicked out of the tournament for making foul-mouthed comments to female umpire Louise Engzell during his first-round loss to Stefano Travaglia.
Fognini and compatriot Simone Bolelli had reached the third round of the men's doubles but tournament organizers axed him from the event. Fognini, the world number 26, was also fined $24,000.
Women's top seed Karolina Pliskova saved a match point to defeat China's Zhang Shuai, hanging on to her world number one spot in the process. Top seed Pliskova, the runner-up in 2016, triumphed 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 but was forced to save a match point in the 10th game of the second set and recover from a break down in the decider.
I was match point down and I thought I haven't tried many forehand winners down the line. That's what I did. I may not have got another chance, said the 25-year-old, who will next face Jennifer Brady of the United States.
Brady has just seven wins on the tour this year, but all have come at the Slams.

Navy assists to stop Ingiriya fuel spill
Naval personnel attached to the Sri Lanka Coast Guard prevented the fuel spill from a toppled fuel bowser belonging to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation at Madala in Ingiriya last Friday.
Timely measures were taken by the Navy personnel to block the drain which had led the spilled fuel to seep into the Kalu Ganga. Round-the-clock clean-up operations were carried out by SLCG personnel comprising two officers and 28 sailors. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board disconnected water supply to several areas following the accident.
The NWSDB said the situation was brought under control.

No suspicion over Gamini Atukorales death: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale yesterday said she held no suspicion over the death of her brother, the late Gamini Athukorale.
Minister Atukorale was addressing the media following a visit on Ramanna Sector Chief Prelate Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Maha Thera.
Commenting on a remark made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Atukorale said Rajapaksa was trying to use her brothers death to level allegations against Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was then candidate for the 2005 Presidential Election.
"If Rajapaksa was so concerned or had even a slight suspicion over my brothers death, why couldnt he investigated it when he was the President for 10 years, Minister Atukorale questioned. Why wait until I become Justice Minister to make inferences she asked.
Minister Atukorale said Rajapaksa and Gamini Atukorale were confidantes from 2000-2001 when Chandrika Bandaranaike was in power.
Speaking on former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes claim that he was removed from his post since he did not intervene in the Attorney Generals Departments affairs, Minister Athukorale said Yahapalana government in no way would act outside its mandate.
In Mahinda Rajapaksas time, Attorney Generals Department was under his purview, which was unethical. It was the time when the Chief Justice was fired within 48 hours. The same group sent Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in to prison in 2010 for no reason, Minister Atukorale said.
"President Maithripala Sirisena allowed the AGs Department under Justice Ministry to make it an independent entity," she said.
Minister Atukorale said plans are afoot to remedy the shortage of staff in the AGs Department.

North Korea hails perfect H-bomb test
SOUTH KOREA: North Korea declared itself a thermonuclear power on Sunday, after carrying out a sixth nuclear test more powerful than any it has previously detonated, presenting President Donald Trump with a potent challenge.
The North has tested a hydrogen bomb with perfect success, a jubilant newsreader announced on state television, adding the device could be mounted on a missile.
The test was of a bomb with unprecedently large power, she said, and marked a very significant occasion in attaining the final goal of completing the state nuclear force.
The broadcaster showed an image of leader Kim Jong-Uns handwritten order for the test to be carried out at noon on September 3.
The announcement came after monitors measured a 6.3-magnitude tremor near the Norths main testing site, which South Korean experts said was five to six times stronger than that from the 10-kiloton test carried out a year ago.
Hours earlier, the North released images of Kim inspecting what it said was a miniaturised H-bomb that could be fitted onto an ICBM, at the Nuclear Weapons Institute.
Hydrogen bombs or H-bombs -- also known as thermonuclear devices -- are far more powerful than the relatively simple atomic weapons the North was believed to have tested so far. Whatever the final figure for tests yield turned out to be, said Jeffrey Lewis of the armscontrolwonk website, it was a staged thermonuclear weapon which represents a significant advance in its weapons program.
Chinese monitors said they had detected a second quake shortly afterwards of 4.6 magnitude that could be due to a collapse (cave in), suggesting the rock over the underground blast had given way.
Pyongyang has long sought the means to deliver an atomic warhead to the United States, its sworn enemy, and the test will infuriate Washington, Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and others.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said ahead of the announcement that a test would be absolutely unacceptable.
South Korean President Moon Jae-In summoned the National Security Council for an emergency meeting and Seouls military raised its alert level. Pyongyang triggered a new ramping up of tensions in July, when it carried out two successful tests of an ICBM, the Hwasong-14, which apparently brought much of the US mainland within range. It has since threatened to send a salvo of rockets towards the US territory of Guam, and last week fired a missile over Japan and into the Pacific, the first time time it has ever acknowledged doing so. Trump has warned Pyongyang that it faces fire and fury, and that Washingtons weapons are locked and loaded.
Analysts believe Pyongyang has been developing weapons capability to give it a stronger hand in any negotiations with the US.
North Korea will continue with their nuclear weapons programme unless the US proposes talks, Koo Kab-Woo of Seouls University of North Korean Studies told AFP. Pictures of Kim at the Nuclear Weapons Institute showed the young leader, dressed in a black suit, examining a metal casing with a shape akin to a peanut shell. The device was a thermonuclear weapon with super explosive power made by our own efforts and technology, KCNA cited Kim as saying, and all components of the H-bomb were 100 percent domestically made. Actually mounting a warhead onto a missile would amount to a significant escalation on the Norths part, as it would create a risk that it was preparing an attack. - AFP

Notts win first T20 Blast title
BIRMINGHAM, Saturday - Harry Gurney starred as Nottinghamshire held on to beat Warwickshire by 22 runs to win the English T20 Blast for the first time at Edgbaston on Saturday.
After a shaky start batting first, Samit Patel (64 not out) and Brendan Taylor (65) powered Notts to a match-winning total of 190-4. Warwickshire, playing in front of a raucous crowd at their home ground in Birmingham, also lost early wickets though, and despite a brilliant 72 from young batsman Sam Hain, ultimately fell well short. Former England international Twenty20 bowler Gurney was the hero for Nottinghamshire, as he took 4-17 from his four overs with a mix of slower balls and cutters.
Hain put on 55 with big-hitting New Zealander Colin de Grandhomme, but Gurney dismissed them both to leave the lower order with too much to do. Having also won the One-Day Cup final in July, Nottinghamshire are the first side to complete England's limited-overs double since Hampshire in 2012. Notts had been in big trouble when England seam bowler Chris Woakes reduced them to 30-3, taking the big wickets of his international team-mate Alex Hales, Riki Wessels and Tom Moores. But Zimbabwean batsman Taylor teamed up with England all-rounder Patel to compile a crucial fourth-wicket partnership of 132.
Scores from finals day of the English T20 Blast at Edgbaston on Saturday:
FINAL
Nottinghamshire 190-4 (B Taylor 65, S Patel 64 no; C Woakes 3-29) v Warwickshire 168-8 (S Hain 72; H Gurney 4-17)
Nottinghamshire beat Warwickshire by 22 runs
SEMI-FINALS
Warwickshire 175-9 (E Pollock 50) v Glamorgan 164 (J Rudolph 65; O Stone 3-29, C Woakes 3-40)
Warwickshire beat Glamorgan by 11 runs
Nottinghamshire 169-7 v Hampshire 146 (J Vince 56; H Gurney 3-19, S Mullaney 3-22)
Nottinghamshire beat Hampshire by 23 runs.

Pacquiao wants Horn rematch in the Philippines
MANILA AFP Sept3, 2017 :Manny Pacquiao said on Sunday he was still wanted a rematch with Jeff Horn after the Filipino boxing heropulled out of their scheduled bout in Australia later his year.
Queensland's premier, whose state government was the financial backer of a November 12 fight, announced on Friday that Pacquiao cannot return to the ring due to other commitments.
It will not push through there in Australia. But we are bringing the fight here in the Philippines, Pacquiao said on radio station DZBB, adding negotiations were ongoing. This will be good for our country's tourism.
 Pacquiao, 38, had initially called for a rematch after losing his World Boxing Organization welterweight title to the 29-year-old on points Horn in a major upset in Brisbane on July 2.
Pacquiao, who has won world titles in an unprecedented eight weight divisions, had demanded a review of the bout but the WBO declared Horn the clear winner after a panel of judges re-scored the fight.
Now in the twilight of a 22-year professional career, Pacquiao has not stopped an opponent in eight years and briefly quit boxing last year to pursue his long-held political ambitions and was elected senator. But he quickly made a successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in November, saying he still felt like a youngster.
Pacquiao has defied calls to retire for good, including from his family and celebrated American trainer Freddie Roach.
Pacquiao dismissed funding concerns about hosting the multi-million dollar fight in the Philippines.
We have lots of friends who are supporting us including our tourism (department). The president is giving his all-out support, Pacquiao said referring to his political ally Rodrigo Duterte.

Perpetual Lawyer to step down: Chief Dealer says computer was crashed on purpose

Perpetual Treasuries Lawyer, Nihal Fernando PC said that he could not continue to represent the company and will make a decision by Wednesday following the revelation of deleted phone calls by Perpetual Treasuries.
It is matter of my professional reputation. I did my best with regard to the transactions but this was beyond me he said. He further said that he completely relied on the instructions given to him by his client, Perpetual Treasuries.
I told them to give everything they had. The notices were first sent to the holding company, but still I told them to give everything they have. That is all I can do, he said.
Commissioner Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said that he did not doubt the integrity of Fernando: We dont doubt your integrity for a moment. We have the highest regard for you, Jayawardena said.
Earlier during an exchange between ASG Dappula De Livera, Yasantha Kodagoda and Fernando, De Livera said that Fernando had given an undertaking that all the recordings were provided.
Fernando said he did and that he complied with the undertaking to the best of his knowledge relying on the instructions given to him.
Kodagoda, thereafter asked Fernando if his client had lied to him to which Fernando said, yes.
Fernando further said that it was not professionally correct to walk out of the proceedings as he had an obligation to his client. However, he said he will talk to his client and step down. They can find someone else instead of me, he said.
The Commissioners thereafter asked Fernando to make his decision by Wednesday.
Giving evidence today Perpetual Treasuries Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado said that they had planned to  crash the computer which recorded the calls.
He, together with Kasun Palisena- the Chief Executive Officer of PTL, and the Head of IT Sachith Devathantri had discussed the crashing of the computer.
When questioned as to if Arjun Aloysius was aware of the decision to crash the computer, Salgado said he assumed he was - "yes he should have been aware, he said.
Salgado also said that he was instructed by Kasun Palisena to delete recordings which were bad for PTL in the event an investigation was carried out.
The instructions from Palisena were given after the Central Bank placed restrictions on PTL in November 2016.
Salgado also said that even though he was the Chief Dealer for Perpetual, he was not involved in any of the transactions with Saman Kumara, the Chief Dealer of the Employees Provident Fund.
He said all the dealings between Saman Kumara and PTL were handled by Palisena.
Salgado further said that he was not involved in the February 27 Bond transaction. He said the transaction was conducted by Palisena.
When questioned by the Commission as to if Arjun Aloysius was involved in the decision making of the February 27 transaction, Salgado said,  Yes he should have been"

Police to reward disciplined drivers
In an effort to combat the high incidence of traffic accidents, the Police Department acting on the direction of IGP Pujith Jayasundera has introduced a new practice of selecting disciplined and cultured drivers and rewarding them in addition to the normal practice of nabbing errant drivers and taking legal action against them.
As a first step of this programme, a batch of 300 disciplined drivers were routinely selected in the Kandy City and presented gift vouchers of Rs.3,000 each after a workshop held for them in Kandy for their benefit for a duration of one week plus a free inspection of their vehicles.
The programme was sponsored by AMW pit stop.
The next step of this programme would be held in Colombo and later extended to Kurunegala and Matara, a Police Headquarters release said.
As the programme progressed, added benefits would be given to disciplined drivers selected including free medical check-ups, and a discount for services in leading hospitals and Hotels and restaurants.
N.M.Nalin Bandara, a resident of Gurudeniya, Kandy who was the first motorist halted by Police during the programme in Kandy said when police waved his car to a stop he was trembling thinking he had breached a traffic rule. But, the Policeman who was very courteous cleared his apprehensions saying he was stopped for the disciplined manner he was driving the vehicle. He said this motorist friendly attitude on the part of police would help clear public mistrust in the service.

Primary Industries Ministry last week launches Damana Amba Kalapaya  Damana  Mango Range
Primary Industries Ministry last week launched Damana Amba Kalapaya  Damana Mango Range with an eye for export and add foreign exchange earning to the treasury.
The first phase of the free distribution of Tom E J C mango plants among the 10,000 farmer-families took place with the participation of Primary Industries Minister, Daya Gamage and the officials along with the Secretary of the Damana Divisional Secretariat, Ampara.
Farmers selected for the occasion from nine Grama Niladhari Divisions including Pahala Landa Grama Niladhari Division were symbolically given mango plants of this variety, with necessary instruction as to how they should take care of the Tom EJC mango plant to get the best of their labour and commitment.
The project is to provide 25 mango plants of this variety to each family numbering 10,000 altogether and drawing the women to take the lead in implementing the project and earn extra money to meet their ends. The total number of mango plants would be 250,000 altogether and Rs.100 million has been invested to this project.
It is claimed that there is a big demand for this variety of mango in the world market for its unique taste and pleasant appealing appearance. The strategy of the Primary Industries Ministry is to secure a permanent place in the foreign market to this variety of mango and ensure continuous supply as the mango trees of this type bear fruits for long eight months unlike the other varieties.
In his address to those present at the occasion Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said through the Tom EJC mango plant project the country enters into a new economic era responding to the need of the times. Thanks to our First Prime Minister, D. S. Senanayake, Father of Our Nation, the entire Ampara district is nourished by his Agriculture scheme in the face of opposition from many quarters. And with the launching of Tom EJC Mango Plant project we enter into a new economic, era, Minister Gamage observed.
He went onto say that he wanted the women-folk to enter the scene and take the project forward, instead of flying overseas to work as housemaids and earn to keep the family fire burning through their hard labour. I am confident that they can earn the same amount or something more by getting themselves involved in the Tom EJC Mango Plant project. The amount they earn would also be more than what they earn from farming,  he said.
From each mango tree one would be able to get 60 to 120 kilos and if the selling price Rs. 150 or Rs. 200 one could earn Rs,12, 000 to 15000. We will also introduce a new investor and steps also would be take construct a new factory for this purpose. Our aim through all these activities double our foreign exchange earning, the Minister pointed out.

Rethink taxing policy  holders heavily - IASL
Sri Lanka insurance sector too should be given a fair playing field by the government and should not be over taxed, said Chairman, Insurance Association of Sri Lanka, (IASL) Deepthi Lokuarachchi.
Speaking at the launch of National Insurance Day at Independence Arcade last Friday he said they are made to understand that there is going to be a huge tax burden to be imposed by the government. Policy holders are to be taxed heavily. This is defiantly more than what the banking industry is currently paying and we appeal to authorities to re think this move.
Deepthi Lokuarachchi
He said that though the mobile penetration is very aggressive in Sri Lanka where on average every citizen has two phones the insurance penetration is very low at around 2.5%. This gives and opening for insurance companies to look at an untapped market of around 97% and they should be more aggressive to woo more policy holders. The aim should be to insure the youngest to the oldest person.
Lokuarachchi said that the non motor segment should be strongly looked at by insurance companies and areas such as health, households, house and property, aging population should be targeted more. Naming of an insurance day annually on September 1, would help towards the increasing the penetration and IASL Chairman thanked the government for that.
There were over 1.5 million letters delivered every day and he said they felt that the stamp would create some awareness among public. With these initiatives we hope to have a 50% insurance penetration in 10 years time.
However the proposed high tax would discourage companies as profit margins would drop. He also disclosed that the net assets of the industry is around Rs. 500 billion.
Meanwhile Chairperson Insurance Board of Sri Lanka Indrani Sugathadasa also pointed out that most of the insurance policy holders are in the Western and Southern provinces and other areas too should be pursued.
She also said that the industry too should look at ways and means to be more profitable.A first day cover too was launched on September 1 to mark the annual Insurance Day.

Rossi leaves hospital after surgery on broken leg
ROME, Saturday - Italian MotoGP great Valentino Rossi left hospital on Saturday morning, one night after surgery for a broken leg which looked set to end his title chances this year.
The 38-year-old said he spent a good night on Friday after doctors inserted a pin into his right leg to fix fractures sustained during a training accident in eastern Italy. This morning I felt good, Rossi said in a statement sent by his Yamaha team. I will begin the rehabilitation as soon as possible and well see how my body reacts before making any decisions.
I will do everything I can to get back as soon as possible, he added.
Doctors said Rossi, currently fourth in the overall MotoGP standings and 26 points behind leading compatriot Andrea Dovizioso, would need 30-40 days rest. He had been expected to stay in hospital for three or four days.
His condition was good, so we decided to discharge him, Raffaelle Pascarella, director of the Ancona orthopaedics and trauma department where Rossi was treated, told a televised news conference.
Deciding when Rossi gets back on his bike is up to him, Pascarella said, adding, I dont have a crystal ball. Six MotoGP races remain and the Italian seems sure to miss at least two of them, likely ending his title chances for another year. A race win is worth 25 points. - Agencies

Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge expecting third child

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their third child, Kensington Palace has announced.
The Queen and both families are said to be "delighted with the news".
As with her previous two pregnancies, the duchess, 35, is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness.
She will no longer carry out her planned engagement at the Hornsey Road Children's Centre in London today.
Catherine is being cared for at Kensington Palace, the statement said.
The Duke and Duchess have one son, George, and one daughter, Charlotte, aged four and two.
With the previous two pregnancies, the couple were forced to announce them before the 12-week mark because of the duchess being unwell with hyperemesis gravidarum.
Her first pregnancy was revealed when she was just a few weeks pregnant with Prince George after she was admitted to hospital in December 2012.
Her second pregnancy with Princess Charlotte was announced in September 2014, when she was treated at the palace for the condition.
Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about one in every 200 pregnancies and results in severe nausea and vomiting - with one of the main dangers being dehydration.

SAITM refutes Prof. Carlos allegation
The South Asian Institute of Technology & Medicine (SAITM) management yesterday refuted claims allegedly made by Sri Lanka Medical Council former Chairman Prof. Carlo Fonseka that the SAITM had earned a Rs.1,265 million profit.
The management issuing a media communiqu noted that it wishes to place on record that the statements made to the media and the general public by Prof. Carlo Fonseka are completely inaccurate.
The false statements made by Prof. Fonseka is an attempt to provoke University students who are being misled by various fractions in order to halt private medical education in the country, the statement said..
In regard to the accusations made by Prof. Fonseka, the SAITM wishes to clarify with the public that at no point has SAITM earned Rs.1,265 million in profit, it said.
The statement said, the SAITM was built with a personal investment from Dr. Neville Fernando at a cost of Rs.700 million within a 4-acre land in Malabe housing 120,000 sq. ft.
Following the obstructions from the GMOA to carry out clinical training, the SAITM built its own teaching hospital to accommodate the necessary training. Subsequently, SAITM acquired Rs.2 billion as a loan for its construction and equipment where annually around Rs.500 million is repaid to service the loan in addition to other operational expenses incurred by the institution.
The income obtained through student and patient fees were annually been reinvested in improving facilities at the hospital and the SAITM for the benefit of students and its patients.

Second Indian Ocean Conference : Indian Ocean will define the future of the world: PM
Addressing the Second Indian Ocean Conference recently, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe conveyed the following speech:
Your excellencies; Seychelles Vice President Vincent Meriton, Indian External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj, Singaporean Foreign Minister Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Bangladeshi Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed, Japanese Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Vice-Minister Iwao Horii.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Just a few hundred metres from Temple Trees, is an Ocean that is destined to define the future of the world. Sri Lanka, located enviably in the centre of the Indian Ocean is well-poised to play a significant role in determining this future. Our shores are washed by the waters of this great ocean. It has shaped us as a distinct people. Our future development is intrinsically linked to it and we share responsibility in keeping its waters safe. We believe, as people of the Indian Ocean, 'Peace, progress and prosperity' are goals that need to be pursued together.
We will continue to take a leading role, in bringing our partners in the Indian Ocean together to deliberate on issues of importance to all of us. It is in this context, that I warmly welcome you to the seconnd Indian Ocean Conference. Thank you for being present here today.
Our good friend and neighbour, India, envisioned this forum to provide the re-establishment of the Indian Ocean Region as an economic entity. A welcome initiative to remedy the undeveloped architecture for a closer regional cooperation.
The India Foundation, held the inaugural Indian Ocean Conference in Singapore last year to consider ways and means of increasing regional connectivity. This is a topic which is vital to Sri Lanka both politically and economically. Together, we have convened political leaders, key officials, academics and researches to deliberate on the future of the Indian Ocean.
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are meeting at a time when global and financial economic power shifts point toward Asia. The global economic power rebalance, away from the established advanced economies in North America and Europe, will continue well into the latter part of the century. Economic dominance, technology and military might, the basis of political power in the West has eroded to a significant extent by the extraordinary economic development of Asia in the last 50 years. The 'HSBC World in Forecast 2050' forecasts 19 countries from Asia to be the largest economies by 2050. By 2030, Asia is expected to surpass the West in terms of global power, based on population, GDP, technology and military spending. 2016 Annual meeting of the Global Future Council convened by the World Economic Forum concluded that by 2030 there will not be a single hegemonic force, instead there will be a multi-polar worldUSA, China, India, Germany, Japan, Russia as the key players.
These predictions are reassured by the recent Price WaterHouse Coopers (PWC) Report: World in 2050. It concludes that 9 (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Iran) out of 32 countries, are predicted to be leading economies of the world, will be from the Indian Ocean Region. This reality will increase our strategic importance in the globe.
In practical terms, some countries in Asia have already taken over from the advanced Western countries in purchasing power parity. Despite projected slowdown, it is predicted that the Chinese economy will supersede the US economy by 2028. India has shown great potential to become the second largest economy in the world in terms of Purchasing Power Parity by 2050. Indonesia and Malaysia are also predicted to achieve remarkable rates in economic growth and to have great potential to overtake some of the western countries in the Purchasing Power Parity by 2030.
ASEAN is poised to cover thirty percent of the global GDP, once the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement among the ASEAN countries is concluded.
Despite these promising predictions, intra-trade in the Indian Ocean region including the Bay of Bengal remains low. For example, South Asia remains the least economically integrated region in the world. Unlike the European and Pacific nations, there is an absence of political will to promote Indian Ocean Economic Cooperation more specificially, trade liberalization and connectivity. Trade and connectivity are central to achieving and maintaining a high regional growth rate. The IORA Summit in Jakarta this year also focused on increasing economic and strategic integration of the region. The Jakarta Concord agreed to at this IORA meeting contains a commitment to enhance trade and investments in the region by:
(a) Increasing intra IORA flow of goods, services and investments and (b) Continuing regulatory reforms to promote competitiveness investments and ease of doing business.
Therefore, let us make a start by implementing IORA Action Plan 2017-2027 recommendations on trade and investment proposals within the next four years. The plan envisages organizing capacity building and technical support for regional trade and investments with focus on facilitating and reducing barriers. Let this conference recommend to IORA the need for a credible strategy which will include:
- preventing protectionist trade measures
- implementing ease of doing business measures
- commitment to the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement
- remove high tariffspara tariffs and non tariff barriers over agreed time period.
Businesses in the region must grow for intra-regional trade to develop. These businesses require capital for expansion, which is a scarce commodity in the region. This is why I have called for the establishment of an Indian Ocean Development Fund. This fund will make financial resources available to National Development Banks which will promote growth and expansion in the region by providing capital for business expansion.
In Jakarta, IORA also emphasized on the Blue Economy of the Indian Ocean. While other oceans in the globe are experiencing a decline of its fish stocks, that trend is not visible in the Indian Ocean. As I speak today, many fishing fleets of countries, where fish trade is an industry continue to harvest fish stocks in the Indian Ocean. These fish stocks are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. It is estimated that 40 precent of the world offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean with large reserves of hydrocarbons being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India and Western Australia. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposit are actively excavated by Sri Lanka and other bordering countries. The recent UN Conference on Oceans concluded that preserving the health of the oceans is vital for the existence of mankind. In order to avoid irreversible damage to the Oceans, IORA must coordinate efforts by all member countries to address overfishing, pollution from offshore and land-based activities, biodiversity and habitat loss.The creation of wealth and enhanced economic activity in the Indian Ocean region will not only bring benefits but will pose enormous security challenges to all of us.
It is evident that most of the worlds armed conflicts are presently located in the Indian Ocean region.
The waters of the Indian Ocean are also home to continually evolving strategic developments, including the rise of regional powers with nuclear capabilities. Conflicts in the Gulf, unrest in Iraq and Afghanistan, rise of violent extremism, growing incidents of piracy in and around the Horn of Africa loom over our region. Given the rising conflicts in the Middle East and West Asia, worlds major powers have deployed substantial military forces in that part of the Indian Ocean Region. In our view, the vital Sea Lanes of Communication in the Indian Ocean that fuels the global economy needs to be open for all and must be used for mutual benefit in a sustainable manner.
It is essential to maintain peace and stability in the Indian Ocean Region which ensures the right of all states to the freedom of navigation and over flight. That unhindered lawful maritime commerce are conducted in keeping with current international laws and regulations. In terms of the maritime build up taking place in the Indian Ocean, we see major players such as India, Australia, USA, China, and Japan envisaging various projects ranging from ocean excavation to placing remote sensors for ocean research. The latter three are increasing their forward naval presence. Naval power will play a greater role in the regional maritime affairs. This will in turn lead to naval power competitions, with plans for sea control as well as sea denials.
As you would be aware, there are 10 critical choke points in the Indian Ocean that remain vulnerable to air and maritime encounters and possible terrorist attacks by non-state actors. Given the rising conflicts in the Middle East and West Asia, worlds major powers have deployed substantial military forces in the Indian Ocean Region. This trend will continue for some more time until the world community gets together and resolve the causes for these conflicts.
These traditional and modern security concerns are yet to be addressed internationally. Articles 34  56 of UNCLOS are insufficient to deal with the concerns that are related to freedom navigation in the Indian Ocean. Therefore, Sri Lanka intends working with all our partners in creating a shared vision for economic and security engagement. We remain convinced that a code of conduct that ensures the freedom of navigation in our Ocean will be an essential component of this vision. In this regard, as I mentioned earlier Sri Lanka will soon commence exploratory discussions on convening a meeting to deliberate on a stable legal order on freedom of navigation and over flight in the Indian Ocean. Taking such a course of action will enable the littoral states to take the initiative to manage competition and determine our own fate.
We believe that maintaining the Freedom of Navigation is of paramount importance for Sri Lanka to become the Hub in the Indian Ocean. It is only then that we can reap the full benefits of our strategic location as well as the availability of ports on all coasts and two international airports with good land connectivity. The air and sea connectivity will naturally promote logistics. Colombo will also be a center for offshore finance and business. Finally Sri Lanka will offer a competitive platform for manufacturing and services.
Let me refer to Sri Lankas decision to develop its major sea ports, especially the Hambantota port which some claim to be a military base. I state clearly that Sri Lankas Government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena does not enter into military alliances with any country or make our bases available to foreign countries. We will continue military cooperation such as training, supply of equipment and taking part in joint exercises with friendly countries. Only the Sri Lanka Armed Forces have the responsibility for military activities in our Ports and Airports. We are also working with foreign private investors on the commercial development of our ports.
In the absence of an effective multilateral trade agreements for the Indian Ocean region Sri Lanka has decided to enter into bilateral agreements with the neighboring littoral states. This is the only option available.
We already have Free Trade Agreements with India and Pakistan. We are in the process of deepening our FTA with India to enable greater economic cooperation. We will finalize a FTA with Singapore and then to conclude similar trade agreements with other countries in the Bay of Bengal region. We are also negotiating an FTA with China. Furthermore, Sri Lanka is also entitled to EUs concession granting GSP+ facilities.
Sri Lankas development as a shipping, air and business hub together with the above Trade Agreements will contribute to the development of intra-regional trade. The Economic growth in our region can only be accelerated by increasing intra-regional trade and infrastructure development thereby strengthening connectivity. This requires our governments to evolve strategies to expand the trade sectors of our national economies enabling the creation of regional value chain.
Therefore, let me reaffirm that Sri Lanka is open to trade with all our partners. We aim to become as in the past, a destination of choice for all those looking to tap in to the potential of the Indian Ocean. We intend taking a leading role in initiating a legal order in the Indian Ocean to ensure freedom of navigation.
We look forward to engaging with all interested Littoral states in creating a policy framework to promote intra-regional trade within a time line so that economic activity in the Indian Ocean region can be enhanced.
It is our belief that if we all work for these common objectives, sustainable peace and prosperity in our region can be undoubtedly achieved. I wish you all a successful conference and a great stay in Colombo.
Thank you.

Shes still the Peoples Princess
It may be an exaggeration to say that Princess Diana saved the monarchy. But its still fair to say the wildly popular peoples princess did buy the royal family some time.
Twenty years after the death of Diana, hundreds of people made a pilgrimage on a sun-kissed Thursday to the gates of Kensington Palace, her former home, to pay tribute to the woman who many say helped to modernize the fusty Windsors.
Royal fans  a few dressed head-to-toe in Union Jack clothing  placed flowers, cards and candles outside of the gates of the palace, creating a makeshift shrine to the late Princess of Wales.
Diana, Princess of Wales, arriving at Orly airport on November 13, 1992 for a private three-day visit she is making without her husband Prince Charles
We deeply miss and love you dearly, Grandma Diana, read one message signed by a fan from Australia.
Tributes also rolled in on social media. Elton John, who sang Candle in The Wind at Dianas funeral, posted a picture on Instagram of the two of them, adding the caption: 20 years ago today, the world lost an angel. RIP.
Diana died in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, after the car she was riding in crashed while trying to speed away from paparazzi.
The driver of the car, who also died in the crash, was found to have had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit. The princess was 36 years old. Her jarring death triggered an outpouring of emotion in Britain that, up until that time, was very un-British.
In her short life, she rattled the emotionally reserved monarchy. She shook the hands of AIDS patients. She spilled the beans on her soap opera marriage and talked to the press about her battle with bulimia. She pursued  and was pursued by  the celebrity-obsessed media. She was one of the most famous people in the world, and the British public loved her. They still do.
Shes still the peoples princess, ran a front-page headline in the Sun on Thursday.

One of Dianas lasting legacies, many said at Thursdays palace gathering, was helping to reinvent the royal family.
Diana paved the way for Kate, really, said Margaret Tyler, 73, referring to Dianas daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. Tyler said she comes to Kensington Palace every year to pay her respects to Diana. In the old days if you married into the royal family and you were a girl, you didnt see your parents at Christmas.  You automatically spent it with the royal family. Now William and Kate take turns. Her family one year, the royal family the next year, so its little things like that.
Chris Imafidon, an educator in his 50s who was sitting on a chair outside the palace, noted: Today we have an anachronistic royal family on Twitter because she broke down the wall separating the masses from the monarchy. We have royals who tweet! Not like Trump, of course, but they tweet about profound things that can inspire the community, he said.
He said that when Princes William and Harry stopped at the palace to inspect the tributes to their mother on Wednesday during a pouring rain, they held their own umbrellas aloft and accepted flowers from the crowd instead of asking their minders to do it for them.
Dianas not here, but her principles are there in her two sons, Imafidon said.
That scene had echoes of one 20 years ago, when 15-year-old William and 12-year-old Harry paused outside of the same gates and gazed out at the sea of flowers.
This time the atmosphere outside the palace was poignant but not heartbreaking.
On Thursday, Maggie Boulton, 73, said that Diana had a common touch and mixed easily with ordinary people. By contrast, she said, Prince Charles doesnt know how to show emotion. When he tries to be personal, it comes across as awkward.
The princess seemed approachable, Boulton said: She took her kids to McDonalds, they stood in the queue. It meant a lot to see her mix with ordinary people like us. We will always have a bit of her here with her boys.

Silent honour
Cricket almost brings things to a standstill in his life. Sri Lankan cricketer Jeevan Mendis got nothing without labour. Sweat, strive, struggle were an inseparable part of his cricket chores. The Test spot, batting slot, recognition, all had to be earned. An all-rounder who bowls leg spin, Mendis has represented Sri Lanka in One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals, including the 2012 World Twenty20 and 2015 World Cup. He played for Derbyshire recently this year. Vanessa Mendis ne Wood gives us an insight to the man behind the bat and ball.
The cricketer
Jeevan was popular as a batsman during his school days at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. His talent for bowling emerged only after he joined the national team. He is a left-handed batsman and a right arm leg spinner.
Jeevan is into arts as well but since he chose to follow cricket, he could not prolong in other sectors. He got the opportunity to pursue higher studies at Kelaniya University but selected cricket over that. I was around 17 years old then and I did not realize how important education was but now when I ponder over the matter, I think he should have done both together.
The meeting
I met Jeevan when he was playing for one of the Royal-Thomian matches in 2002. He was popular as a school boy cricketer at that time. I was studying at Methodist College, Colombo and went to watch the match because my brother, Aundray and my cousin were both Thomians. I went because it was a thrill to watch a Royal-Thomian match. It was pretty much a customary affair because we go to watch every year.
Jeevan had seen me on the grounds and had inquired who I am. My cousin passed the messages across to me. I was in my G C E O/L classes. I was not interested in anything except studies. I was a bookworm and meeting and talking with a boy seemed like a scary experience for me. However we became friends first before getting into a relationship.
We chatted on the phone regularly and my aunty (fathers sister) was very supportive. I used to go to her house during the holidays and meet Jeevan. My mother was very strict and would be angry even if I hung on the phone too much. My father was cool and he allowed me to go out with Jeevan once he got to know about us. However the rule was that my brother had to accompany us everywhere.
We went out for dinner with some of my cousins. We had burgers in the car. That was our first date. Once my parents got used to Jeevan they allowed me to go on trips with him as well.
The marriage
We went out for seven years before tying the knot. Time made me realize that Jeevan is the one for me because we both understand each other very well. I did commerce for my G C E As and Jeevan followed the arts stream. We both did economics as a subject. He used to help me do my projects for my G C E As.
I believe that he proposed to me a couple of weeks after meeting me! Jeevan is a quiet person by nature. He would not do elaborate things to amuse anyone. I am the one who loves affection. Jeevan keeps his feelings bottled up. He conveys his feelings through facial expressions and behaviour. I have learnt to read what he wants through such gestures now. We communicate like that most of the time.
Jeevan introduced me to his mother eventually. We used to go there to play and ride bicycles. Then I hung out there and had dinner with them as well. His family was pretty cool about it. We got married in December, 2008. I was 21 then and Jeevan was 25. We got married in church and held the reception at Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Baby boon
Jeevan and I wanted a son the first time I learnt that I was expecting. Jayden was born in October, 2010. He was our lucky charm because Jeevan got a call informing that he has been selected for the national cricket team on the day he was born.
Joshua was born in 2013. He is Jeevans pet. Joel was born in 2015. We named our sons with names starting with the letter J because that is the first letter in Jeevans name. Later we realized that Jeevans father and grandfather both are J Mendises!
The father
Jeevan is very family oriented. If he is not playing cricket he is always with us. He would even get us to accompany him to the store. He plays, washes and feeds the children. The boys too are very attached to him. Jayden was a good, trouble-free baby but the other two are rather naughty.
It is too early to tell if the boys are into cricket. They play with anything. However Jayden is very proud of his father. He likes to tell people that he is so and so.
Similar and diverse interests
I love reading but Jeevan is not into books. He likes to watch movies but I am no movie buff. I love travelling. Jeevan used to hate travelling but I get him to travel now.
Both of us like entertainment and company. We move around mostly with Jeevans school friends.
Travelling
We used to travel as a family those days but now, since Jayden is schooling it is difficult to follow up.
However we always try our best to stay together. We get to travel mostly during the school holidays. Nuwara Eliya is out favourite travel destination in Sri Lanka. We love the countryside in England too. We travel at least once or twice a month. We travel to Galle often and spend the night at a hotel.
Happiest and saddest moments in life
One of the happiest moments in Jeevans life is the day Jayden was born because it was a cause for a double celebration. He is also very much into his religion. Accepting God as his saviour are special moments in life for him.
During the 2015 World Cup Jeevan was injured while warming up for the second match. He had to give the tournament a miss after that and that was a real blow for him.
Foodwise
Jeevan is a fan of Sri Lankan food. He loves dry fish, coconut sambol and meat curries. I cook once in a while because we have help. It is difficult to please Jeevan - foodwise. He even looks at the colour of the dish and if it does not please him, he will not consume it. He likes the chicken salads I whip up. Jayden likes his rice and curry but the other two are junk food lovers.
Most touching gesture
I was diagnosed with pancreatitis a couple of years ago. I was hospitalized for three weeks and our youngest was one and a half months then. Jeevan handled the boys wonderfully. He handled everything from taking the baby for his two month vaccine to taking care of the kids.
Most embarrassing moment
Jeevan did the Gangnam Style dance during the ICC T20 World Cup 2012 in Pallakele. I was so shocked when I hear that because though I was there, I did not see him dancing. I never expected him to do such a thing because he is such a reserved and quiet person.
An alternative profession for Jeevan
I think Jeevan would have continued his studies. He himself says that he would have been an interior designer. Though our house is designed by an architect, the furnishings and dcor are Jeevans ideas.

SLFP celebrates 66
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) celebrated its 66th anniversary on September 3. The anniversary celebrations was held under the chairmanship of Party Leader President Maithripala Sirisena at the Campbell Park in Colombo. The formation of the SLFP in 1951 marked a turning point in the political history of the country. Until then the Sri Lankan political arena was confined to a contest between the capitalist political elements and those of the Marxist left. The advent of the SLFP marked the entry of a socialist third force.
The entry is important for two other reasons. The political parties hitherto in the Sri Lankan political arena represented generally either the interests of the capitalist class or the urban and plantation area working class. For the first time, the SLFP came forward to represent predominantly the interests of the rural peasantry and the lower middle class.
Sri Lanka had no political party then which took a special interest in Sri Lankan national culture. The SLFP filled that void.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party was always the party of the common man. Throughout its 66-year proud history, it has engaged in an outstanding national service, right from the declaration of the country as a sovereign Republic to the preservation and promotion of national culture. Let us dedicate ourselves this day to carry forward that mission with greater determination.

Sri Lankas fast sinking cricket image took another hammering when they were whitewashed 5-0 for the first time in a one-day international series at home. Overall it was their third 5-0 whitewash in an ODI series having lost in India in 2014-15 and in South Africa in 2016-17.
Fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar wicketless in the series till yesterday took his first five-for and captain Virat Kohli guided the team with his 30th ODI century and his second consecutive of the series as India completed the rout of Sri Lanka in the five-match series winning the fifth and final ODI played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday by six wickets. India had also whitewashed Sri Lanka in the three-Test series earlier by a 3-0 margin.
Sri Lankas highest total of the series  238 proved insufficient to contain the Indian line up that had made four changes from the one that won the fourth ODI on Thursday strengthening the bowling with five regulars but all of whom capable of contributing with the bat. However their skills with the bat were not required yesterday as Kohli with an unbeaten 110 off 116 balls (9 fours) sealed the match for his team.
During the course of his innings the Indian skipper became the first player to reach 1000 ODI runs for the current 2017 calendar year.
Kohli and Manish Pandey in partnership made shortwork of the Lankan bowling. Whereas the Lankan batsmen struggled to keep the scoreboard ticking by constantly rotating the strike, the Indian pair milked the bowling finding the gaps at will to put together a stand of 99 off 106 balls that eventually paved the way for their win after two wickets had fallen for 29.
Following Pandeys dismissal at 36, Kohli associated himself in another useful partnership of 109 off 126 balls with Kedar Jadhav (63) to completely shut the door on Sri Lanka.
The pitch was not an easy one for run scoring because by the time India had started to bat it had slowed down to a degree where you had to work the ball into the gaps and hitting boundaries was not an easy task. In that aspect Kohli displaying his repertoire of strokes made run scoring so easy that India were home and dry by the 47th over.
Sri Lankas batting woes continued as they once again failed to put up a decent total on the board after winning the toss and choosing to bat first.
Captain Upul Tharanga back in the side after serving a two-match ban for slow over rate got his team off to a flying start when he played cameo knock of 48 off 34 balls that was studded with nine fours many of them glorious strokes through the off and covers.
After his dismissal Lahiru Thirimanne and Angelo Mathews figured in a record fourth wicket partnership of 122 off 179 balls as they consolidated the position from 63-3. It was Sri Lankas first century partnership of the series.
But another all too familiar lower order batting collapse saw Sri Lanka lose their last seven wickets for 53 runs and be dismissed for 238  their highest total of the series, when 280 had looked a likely score during the Thirimanne-Mathews liaison. Their partnership of 122 beat by one run the previous record held by two former Lankan batting stalwarts Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene against India at the same venue in 2012.
Thirimanne scored 67 off 102 balls and Mathews 55 off 98 and just as when they were well set to launch into the bowling, India somehow managed to breakthrough.
Kumar had Thirimanne playing on to his stumps and Mathews attempting a sweep top edged a catch behind the wicket to Dhoni. Sri Lanka failed to consolidate from there onwards and the lower order simply folded up tamely with not so much of a whimper.
Kumar was the pick of the Indian bowlers. He picked up his first wicket of the series when he caught and bowled Dickwella for two and came back to take four further wickets to dent the Lankan middle and late order batting to end with figures of 5 for 42 and take the Man of the Match award.
Jasprit Jumrah won the Man of the Series award.

Sri Lanka, Israel : An alliance for advancement
In an interview with the Daily News, Israeli Ambassador Daniel Carmon spoke about the ways in which Sri Lanka can learn from his countrys entrepreneurial spirit and says that the goal is not for Israel to provide aid to Sri Lanka, but for the two countries to collaborate more bilaterally. Speaking of the current water and agriculture crisis in Sri Lanka, Ambassador Carmon said, Were here and thats part of our agenda with the Sri Lankan Government. It can be in any way that the Sri Lankan Government would decide upon, with one little nuance which is that it should not be considered as help or assistance. It should come out of the need to cooperate.
Excerpts follow:
Q: How do you see the current state of relations between Israel and Sri Lanka and are there ways in which you envision ties between our two countries could be strengthened Im talking agricultural, economic, military, social, etc.
A: There is a long history of relations between Sri Lanka and Israel. We have witnessed fluctuations in these relations, but we are definitely on the upswing in the last few years, with the will to enrich the diversity of the relations. If you follow diplomacy and the bilateral relationship between countries in the last more than a few years, the recent generation of diplomacy practitioners look at the very vast area of disciplines that are covered by diplomacynot only ministries of foreign affairs exchanging views on political, strategic and regional affairs, but economy and development and the various priorities of countries on the top of the agenda of todays top diplomats. And when we look at Sri Lankan-Israeli relations, development and economic trade and arenas in which Israel can share its comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture and water, innovation, and technology are definitely on the table.
Q: Indian Prime Minister Modi recently visited Israel, and the trip was hailed a success by many foreign commentators. Do you see this as a sign of greater cooperation between Israel and South Asia
A: Israel, in the last twenty to twenty five years, has corrected a fact of the matter from previous times in which we were less welcome in this part of the world, and since we were less welcome, we were looking more to the west, our west. And in the last twenty to twenty five years, weve seen a very positive development when relations with China and India have become much better. Yes, we can look at South Asia as a region, but I would rather look at things [relations with each South Asian country] as bilateral. I think that looking at South Asia as a region, rather than at the bilateral benefits and interests of each player in each bilateral relation, does not do justice to the fact that we attach great importance to the bilateral effect and not only to the multilateral. And nowadays, the world has dramatically changed, in the aspect that although the nonaligned movement is still there, within the nonaligned movement Israel has very good relations with members of a group that, as a group, is critical of Israel. But the ingredients of the group bilaterally have very good relations.
Q: In the aftermath of Modis visit to Israel, is there a chance an Israeli delegation would be making a reciprocal trip to South Asia any time soon, and if so, would a visit to Sri Lanka be on the agenda
A: Since Im the ambassador to India as well, thats a good question relating to India, of course. We have seen in the last three years more visits and more visibility in the bilateral relationship between India and Israel, and there have been ministers going back and forth from one country to the other. Regarding Sri Lanka, unfortunately, Israeli ministers have not visited in the last few years, but Sri Lankan ministers have visited Israel, and I definitely hope that in the near or foreseeable future, we will also have Israeli ministers reciprocate visits to Sri Lanka. But I would not make the India connectionthey are two different places.
Q: At Sri Lankas first ever drone symposium on Monday, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawake mentioned Israel as an example of a country that has used technology and entrepreneurship to grow its economy. Do you see parallels in how Sri Lanka has harnessed technology and entrepreneurship to do the same, or ways in which Sri Lanka could learn from Israel
A: Part of our Israeli DNA is to share our knowledge, know-how, and experience in various fields that have boosted our economy and social and economic progress and development. We ourselves have been for years a development laboratory. We have built a nation from scratch from 1948 until now.
We have developed into a very vibrant and stable economy. We have innovation and entrepreneurship as our middle name. We have been defined as a start-up nation, with the number of start-ups per capita by far the highest in the world. And, we have also initiated a process and have contributed a process to the international community, to the UN system, of entrepreneurship for development. We hope this could benefit Sri Lanka, which has similar goals to our country concerning technology and entrepreneurship. As well, what we are suggesting to our friends in Sri Lanka is to take from the Israeli experience as a country that, out of our necessities and challenges, managed to develop systems and capacities to bridge those gaps by developing specifically in the energy, water management, desalination, recycling, and conservation.
Q: Seventeen districts in Sri Lanka are currently at a water stress state due to severe drought, and this has caused issues that span from lack of available drinking water to poor crop harvests. Israel, on the other hand, has been a pioneer in turning undrinkable or contaminated water (ocean water, for example) into drinkable water and, in general, in farming on arid land in the Negev. Are there any aid programmes in development that might allow Sri Lanka to benefit from Israeli expertise at harnessing and taking control of a difficult climate
A: Were here, and thats part of our agenda with the Sri Lankan Government. It can be in any way that the Sri Lankan Government would decide upon, with one little nuance which is that it should not be considered as help or assistance. It should come out of the need to cooperate. The more we view it as cooperation rather than aid, the better it will be, with both sides having to contribute to this venture. We have good examples with India, with our Centers of Excellence for agriculture, which are a joint venture. But of course, Sri Lanka is not India and we have to adjust the necessities. And we will adjust to these necessities. Part of our conversation with the Sri Lankan authorities about these concerns, in the last two days Ive had very good meetings with various members of the Sri Lankan Government, is how can we share our experience and our knowledge and our know-how, under which umbrella can we make a sustainable project that will last beyond the foreseeable future We need to build something that we can maintain.
The agricultural centers that we have in India, for example, around 15 operative Centers of Excellence, are demonstration and training centers where farmers from around the area can come and learn and experience and see and use the technology. Perhaps we can do the same in Sri Lanka. We are negotiating with the Government to do this, though, we dont come as donors or helpers. We come to cooperate and to share our experience.
Q: There are currently around 140,000 Sri Lankans working in Qatar, mainly in migrant labor fields like domestic and construction work. As well, around 7.5 percent of tourists to Sri Lanka (per year 2015) flew Qatar Airways. Therefore, the country is invested in the stakes of what happens there. Can you explain Israels position on the Qatar blockade
A: I could give you a whole seminar about Qatars support for terrorist organizations. But I feel this has nothing to do with the issue at stake so I would rather talk about Sri Lanka and Israel.

Sri Lanka should be watchful - our  economic development programme under the Maritime Silk Road
Bernard Goonetilleke, Director MMBL, Pathfinder Group, made the keynote address at the International Conference on China in South Asia/South Asia in China: OBOR and the Sri Lankan Experience, held iat the BMICH, Colombo, on August 30-31, conducted by the Regional Centre for Strategic Studies.
Following is the text of his speech:
The OBOR (One Belt and One Road), also known as the BRI (Belt and the Road Initiative) launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in September 2013 has become a popular subject of discussion involving Chinas intentions, participating countries expectations, as well as concerns of regional and extra-regional powers at strategic level. Within the short time allotted to me, my job today is to focus on Sri Lankas experience in relation to the BRI, which would require me to focus not only on relations between China and Sri Lanka, but also certain other countries. You must excuse me, if I were to meander a little, focusing on history, both ancient and modern, to get a proper perspective on the subject.
The Land Route
Silk Road Economic Belt is the new name given to the ancient land route traversed by caravans since the Han Dynasty (206 BC -22AD). The Belt will consist of one railway corridor from central China, and the other from northern China to Europe via Russia; a non-rail corridor from western China, through Central Asia to Iran, the Levant and Turkey, with one spur named China Pakistan Economic Corridor (C-PAC) proceeding southward to the port of Gwadar in Pakistan through the Pakistan administered Kashmir, and the other named China-Myanmar Economic Corridor from the Yunnan Province to the port of Kyauk Phyu in Myanmar, involving railways, motorways oil and gas pipelines.
The Maritime Route
A maritime route had also been in existence for many centuries connecting China with South East Asia, south Asia, Middle East and eventually Europe, through the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula. Historical records indicate that over the centuries, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Persians, Indians, and even Sri Lankans had engaged in lucrative trade with the Chinese, spanning the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, connecting Rome and Athens. As for navigators from Sri Lanka in Chinese ports, a Chinese mandarin Li Chao reports that among the many foreign ships arrived at An-nan and Kuang-chou, the ships from the Lion Kingdom were the largest with stairways for loading and unloading, which are several tens of feet in height. Regular presence of Chinese in the Indian Ocean for trade is borne out by historical accounts left by many, including the Chinese monk Fa Xian (5th C), Marco Polo, (13 C) Ibn Battuta (14th C), ending with the adventures of Admiral Zhang He, in the early 15th century.
With the Ottoman supremacy in Constantinople in the middle of the 15th century, the once popular land route fell in to disuse, prompting European powers to seek new trade routes to the east, in which quest they succeeded in 1488 AD with the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope. With that development, strategically located island of Sri Lanka, with ports in Colombo, Galle and Trincomalee became an asset for the European powers interested in controlling the maritime trade.
Present day land route
If one were to fast forward the scenario to the 21st century, due to the bold initiative of China, hitherto defunct land route has once again become operational, replacing camels and caravans with diesel locomotives. In April, this year, a train loaded with goods left the eastern Chinese city of Yiwu in the Zhejiang Province, passed 8 countries, covered 12,000 km and reached London 18 days later. In fact, London is the fifteenth destination of Chinas land bridge in Europe! Today, there are goods trains plying between Chongqing and Duisburg, Beijing and Hamburg, and to many other destinations in Europe.
Unlike the land route that went to disuse, the sea route, now termed the 21st -Century Maritime Silk Road, connecting Chinas east coast with South Asia, Africa and Europe, continued to function over the centuries. Under the Chinese initiative, what is expected to happen under the Maritime Silk Road is, development of infrastructure along the sea route to the west stimulating Chinese and local economies. Given our location, Sri Lanka is expected to play a pivotal role in the development of the Maritime Silk Road.
Impact of BRI on South Asia and Sri Lanka
BRI is a project that would connect and impact 65 countries, representing more than 60 per cent of the world population and one third of the global GDP. It is a much larger version than the US Marshal Plan following the WW II.
Response of South Asia
To understand Sri Lankas position vis  vis the BRI, we need to understand how BRI would impact on South Asia including Sri Lanka. In south Asia, China shares borders with Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. The 1962 border war between India and China sealed the fate of friendly political relations between the two Asian giants. However, economic relations between the two countries are quite robust with bilateral trade exceeding 70 billion dollars in 2016.
China- India relationship is further strained by Beijings close relationship with Pakistan, with whom India fought three wars over Kashmir. Seriousness of the situation could be gleaned from the confession made last month (July 2017), by the former Pakistani president Musharraf that he had contemplated a nuclear strike against India during the 2001 confrontation!
The Karakoram Highway built in 1978 by China connecting the two countries across the Pakistan administered Kashmir claimed by India, is yet another bone of contention. To make the matters worse from the Indian perspective, BRI project has an important adjunct i.e. the C-PEC - estimated at 46 billion dollars, involving rail, road, port and power generation projects connecting Chinese Kashgar in the Xinjian Uygur Autonomous Region with the Pakistani port of Gwadar in Baluchistan, providing China with direct rail and road access to the Indian Ocean. C-PEC is vitally important to China, as it will also provide for crude oil and gas pipelines to the western regions of China, direct from the Gulf, thereby assisting development of economically backward and politically restive Xingjian and several other nearby provinces. The project would bring considerable development to Pakistan, but economically under-developed and politically unstable Baluchistan will be a security nightmare for both China and Pakistan.
These developments prompted India to express its strong objections to the BRI. Hence the Indian decision against taking part in the BRI summit held in China last May.
However, despite Indias serious concerns, six of the eight South Asian countries viz. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka took part in the summit attended by 29 heads of state or government. Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were represented at prime ministerial level, indicating their strong support for the Chinas initiative. These south Asian countries had good reason for their support for BRI. For example, in addition to 46 billion dollars worth of projects in Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh have projects valued at 8.3 billion and 34.45 billion dollars respectively. While the proposed Bangladesh, China, India Myanmar (BCIM) Economic Corridor spanning 2400 km from Kunming in China to Bangladesh and eventually reaching Kolkata via Myanmar, would initially connect the three out of four countries, Nepal has a railway project that would connect Lhasa in Tibet with Kathmandu and eventually Lumbini, the birth place of Buddha, located next door to the Indian state of Bihar!
I have given a snapshot of the response of the south Asian countries bordering India to the grand Chinese economic project of the 21st century, which would eclipse any other development project launched by the global community in the past. I thought it was important to focus on the response of these south Asian countries, to set the stage for discussing Sri Lankas response to and its experience with BRI.
Rationale for BRI
Let us now briefly look at the underlying reasons behind President Xis proposal. In October 2013, Beijing convened an important conference termed as the Peripheral Diplomacy Work Conference, billed as the major foreign policy gathering aimed at developing policy towards neighbouring countries. At that meeting, he emphasized the need to build the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, creating a new regional economic order and follow the principles of helping, stabilizing and enriching neighbors.
That new regional economic order would cover 65 countries representing one third of the countries in the world, 65 per cent of the world population and 40 per cent of the global trade.
Looking at the sheer scale and the reach of the BRI and the grand global design of China, it appears that 2013 was the year of coming of age for China - politically, economically as well as militarily.
With the abandoning of President Obamas Pivot to Asia, withdrawing from President Trumps Trans-Pacific Partnership  which was the largest regional trade accord in history - as well as walking out of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, it appears that the US is on retreat, and China is reaching out to claim mantle of global leadership. One-step in that direction would be achieved by overtaking the US economy by 2030.
There are several other compulsions for China to embark on the BRI. China faces several challenges to achieve its quest for global economic leadership, when its double-digit economic growth has reduced to 6.5 per cent in 2017. A source of acute concern has been continuing inequality between the inland western regions described as barren, remote and poor, such as Xingjian, Tibet, Qinghai etc., and the prosperous and extravagant regions along the eastern seaboard, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. To address this wide disparity, China adopted Western Development Strategy in 1999, which failed to produce the desired results. President Xi believes that BRI would boost economic development within the country, including Chinas western regions, which would positively impact on the neighbouring countries.
The second challenge is the increasing cost of production and wages, and the chronic excess industrial capacity, whether it is cement, steel and similar industrial productions. Consequently, China has reached a stage, where it must relocate production capacities by arranging for migration of surplus factories. The persistent demand for 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota for a Chinese industrial park should be understood in this context. The 10 s. q. km 2500-acre industrial free zone at Gwadar port in Pakistan with planned 300 factories, and the 4000-acre Special Economic Zone in Kypuk Phyu deep sea port developed by a consortium of 5 Chinese and a Thai company will be another destination for surplus Chinese industries.
The third challenge is to find new markets for its technological products, so that the country could move on to the next stage of technology driven economy. One example of Chinese drive for new technology is the development of the Chinese version of Japanese bullet trains that currently cruise at 300 km per hour, and Chinas ability to outbid Japan to develop tracks, and provide rolling stock for the Jakarta - Bandung connection by providing a 4.5-billion-dollar loan covering app. 75% of projects total cost. Other clients targeted by China include Malaysia, Thailand and surprisingly India! Chinas largest high-speed train manufacturer has already signed an agreement with India to establish a 63.4-million-dollar joint venture plant to manufacture and repair railway locomotive engines. Agreements to undertake two feasibility studies for Delhi-Nagpur and Delhi-Chennai high-speed railway connections were also signed last October.
Sri Lankas experience
This brings me to Sri Lankas experience with the BRI, which is rather a complicated story.The former President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced Sri Lankas support for the BRI during his visit to Shanghai in May 2014 and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) during the historic visit of President Xi to Sri Lanka in September that year. Sri Lanka continued its support for the Chinese Belt & Road initiative even after the change of government in 2015, and this policy continues to date, as demonstrated by the participation in the BRI Summit by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe last May.
Both SLFP and UNP had good reasons to support the opportunity for infrastructure development presented by the Silk Road initiative. President Rajapaksa recognized China as an unwavering friend as demonstrated during the armed conflict. Chinese economic, political and military support helped Sri Lanka to meet security challenges during the conflict years. Following the end of the conflict, President Rajapaksa had no access to funds for urgently needed reconstruction work. To make the situation worse, Sri Lanka had to face a hostile group of western countries that accused the country of violating human rights, and dragged Sri Lanka to the Human Rights Council within weeks of successfully ending hostilities.
Thus, relying on China for development needs was the only choice Sri Lanka had, immediately after the conflict period.
The change of government in 2015 came as a heavy blow for China-Sri Lanka relations, as the new administration, due to narrow political expediency and external pressure, decided to suspend implementation of 1.4 billion dollar Colombo Port City project and several other Chinese funded projects. Repudiation of an international agreement signed by two heads of state, sent shockwaves among not only the potential Chinese investors, but also others as well. Much to the embarrassment of the new administration, other than laudatory statements and unsolicited advice, no investments came from the Western countries, and Sri Lanka had no choice but to kowtow to the Chinese one year later.
Unlike the land route that went in to disuse in the 15th century, the maritime route continued to function up to the modern era. Consequently, what is expected to happen under the Maritime Silk Road initiative is, building of new infrastructure along the route in South East and South Asia, East Africa, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Such projects would include ports, airports, highways, railroads, power plants, oil storage facilities etc., which would stimulate economies of the target countries.
As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, Chinese investment started to flow in to the country long before launching of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Such projects include, phase 1 of the Hambantota port completed in August 2010 at a cost of 470 million dollars, phase 1 of the 1.3 billion dollars worth, 900 MW Lakvijaya (Norochcholai) coal power plant completed in March 2011, and the 741-million-dollar Southern Expressway to Galle, inaugurated in November 2011. However, one could fold these in to the Maritime Silk Road, as the remaining phases of those projects came in to operation in the post 2013 period. Although there is no clear list of projects under the Silk road in Sri Lanka, the 27 agreements and MOUs signed during President Xis visit provide an insight, as they cover the Colombo Port City project, Hambantota Port Development project, extension of the Southern Expressway, operation and maintenance of Lakvjaya power station.
There are two types of projects that come under the Silk Road Initiative. One is government, and the other, private sector projects. In the case of Sri Lanka, major projects such as ports, airports and expressways were government projects on long-term credit. Such projects were initiated without going through an international bidding process, thereby leaving room for allegation of corrupt practices. Examples of such projects are too numerous to list, but we have considerable knowledge of the antecedents relating to the Hambantota Port and the Mattala International Airport, the latter termed as the loneliest international airport in the world!
There are also private sector projects such as the Colombo International Container Terminals Ltd., (CICT) a 500 million dollar joint venture, involving the Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPH), a Sri Lanka blue chip company, which later divested its 15% shares to the Chinese company, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), under a 35-year Build Operate and Transfer agreement. A comparison of performance between the barely operational 1.322-billion-dollar loan Hambantota Port and the almost non-operational 209 million dollar Mattala International Airport with the CICT, would be sufficient to understand the difference between poorly planned and inefficient government projects as against successful private sector projects. By the way, how reliable are these figures is something one cannot vouch, as from time to time we end up with different sets of figures depending on the source.
The result of such grandiose projects that failed to bring Return on Investment, was accumulation of a massive external debt that would require app. 4.99 billion dollars for debt servicing alone in 2019! Of the 46.5 billion dollar external debt, Chinese loans said to represent more than 8 billion dollars, with many more billions on offer said to be in the range of 24 billion dollars. Consequently, sale of national assets  in fact, most of those should be termed as national liabilities  seems to be the only way out of the dilemma. Referring to unsolicited Chinese projects opening room for corruption, an editorial of a Sunday newspaper recently commented, The secrecy, the swiftness and the economy with facts and figures in its financial dealings with the Rajapaksa government, fuel conspiracy theories and genuine fears alike, that to put it mildly, Sri Lanka is in China's pocket. These shenanigans make tax paying public wonder, who should take the blame. Some express the view that local politicians and bureaucrats should be investigated and others argue lenders, who lent without proper project evaluation, should also share the blame. Some others point out that lenders have devious plans and one of them is turning debt in to equity! I will leave it for you to decide on whose doorstep the blame should be placed.
Strapped for cash to meet heavy loan repayment obligation, swapping debt for equity seems to be the only solution available for the debt servicing problem, as demonstrated by the renegotiated lease agreement for the Hambantota port signed on July 29, after suffering an accumulated loss of Rs. 46.7 billion! However, China takes the position that the arrangement was not a swap, but two different deals and that the Chinese party agreed to pay 1.12 billion dollars for a 70 per cent stake for 99 years, and Sri Lanka should decide how it should manage its debt servicing responsibility. In addition to the port, 1115 hectare i.e. 2780 acres of land, the tank farm and the 100-acre artificial island and associated buildings, China wishes to add another 15,000 acres of land for a Chinese industrial zone, insisting that the port on its own is of no use without industrial production for export.
The next item on the block will be the loss making Mattala International Airport built at a cost of 209 million dollars covering a vast area of 2000 ha (5000 acres). There are reports that among several offers are a proposal for a PPP from India. I will leave it for you to guess, who would eventually claim the airport Suffice it to say that it will be a catch 66 situation for Sri Lanka.
Despite the heavy loan burden and the debt-servicing problem, it is reported that Sri Lanka is still seeking funding for new projects such as highways, railways etc. and China is reportedly willing to provide new loans under BRI. Whether such loans would be invested on revenue generating enterprises or they would be electoral extravaganzas without considering Return on Investment, is something to be seen. My hope is that one such project would be an expressway and a high-speed railway connecting Colombo with Trincomalee.
Experience of Chinese investors
With periodic elections, change of ruling parties and heads of State and Government, China did not have an easy ride in Sri Lanka. With political changes in our country, to which Chinese political system is not accustomed, came a group of new political leaders, who wished to re-negotiate agreements that were already signed and sealed. The saga of the Colombo Port City project is one good example of sheer greed, machinations and Machiavellian designs by individuals and enterprises with no qualms about exploiting a foreign investor in trouble, characterized by endless groups representing interests of fishermen, environment, religious denominations etc. and demanding either gratification or compensation!
Sad to say Sri Lanka once again cut a sorry figure, how it handled its policy and conducted negotiations with China over the Hambantota port as demonstrated by many events ending with the strident position against the deal by the former minister of Ports and Shipping and another former minister threatening to reveal the sordid details. What Sri Lanka should remember is that with all its resources and being heirs of a civilization going back to several millennia, China could patiently wait until the right time, a luxury the debt-ridden Sri Lanka could ill afford.
Finally, a few words about the strategic component of the BRI. Sri Lanka may have succeeded in winning back Chinese confidence following completion of the deals relating to the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota harbour. However, in the process of our wavering, we succeeded in creating doubt in Chinas mind about our reliability and the investment friendly environment of the country. Ironically our credibility also took a beating in the eyes of India by first agreeing to stop the Colombo Port City project as a pre-January 2015 election pledge and later changing our position. Former National Security Advisor of India Shivshankar Mennon in his memoirs explained how India sees Sri Lanka in relation to Indias security interests. We are also aware that the West, particularly the US, is quite wary of China becoming a global power and would be eager to trip that country whenever possible.
Forbes magazine recently observed Hambantota has interests to China that extend far beyond the economic capacity of the port itself, as it is a key building block of the countrys long-term foreign policy vision. Hambantota is a done deal now and Colombo Port City project is moving once again.
This means regional and extra-regional powers will be wary of Sri Lankas direction vis  vis their national interests. I do not say that we should sacrifice our national interests to satisfy theirs. However, Sri Lanka should be watchful, so that our economic development programme under the Maritime Silk Road will not be overshadowed by strategic concerns of others, thereby adversely affecting Sri Lankas sovereignty. I am going to leave it for the participants to decide whether Sri Lanka did well in its dealings with China in the wake of BRI. However, in conclusion what I have to say is that the political leadership of the country has to work hard to demonstrate that they could be counted as a reliable party.

Sweet Sixteen makes largest Australian family
People are generally inquisitive to know of unique affairs. This is such a story from Australia about the largest Australian family with 16 children. The family is popular in Australia as the Bonell family. They live in Queensland in the city of Toowoomba, not very far from Brisbane. The children of this family are Natalie, Karl, Jesse, Samuel, Katelyn, Claire, Cameron, Brooke, Sabrina, Timothy, Nate, Eric, Damian, Rachel, Eve, Brandon.
House with one toilet and one bath
Jeni is now 48 years and Ray Bonell the husband is just one year older to her. Ray by profession is an electrician. At present the three elder children live away from the house as they have found employment but until recently they all lived in this four-roomed house with one bathroom and one toilet. Everyone has a comfortable sleeping space in the bunker beds arranged in the three rooms.
Toilet time is no doubt the biggest problem. It is a matter of organising things well. Everyone knows to manage the toilet and bath fast and others learn to cultivate patience, Jeni said in an interview.
Feeding
Feeding 18 mouths, including Rays and mine at three meals in no joke, She said. They have a large dining table where she can get all to sit for meals.
The difficult time is the breakfast time. It is mostly cereal for breakfast with milk. So they can take their serve. When all the children were going to school and Ray to work it was really hard on her. But I never fuss. I get everybody to work fast. Elder kids help the younger to get ready and even feed them. They are trained for team work, Jeni said.
The family vehicle
The family uses a bus for travel. Obviously such a large family cannot be accommodated in a car or a van. So they have bought a used school bus for the family and it is Jeni that drives the children to school.
They all do not go to the same school. So I have to start early and drop them in the respective school and collect them after schools are over. Everyone participate this in proper sprit, she said.
Washing and cleaning
Jeni must be the hardest working woman in Australia to keep the house clean with eighteen people living in it. She must wash a load of clothes every day. It is about 30 kilos of clothes being washed a week in addition to the bed linen. Elders help in the folding of the dried clothes and ironing them.
The most difficult was the mix up of washed clothes, so I have used 16 colour codes for the clothes, so that they can be identified with the colour spot Jeni states.
Marketing
The tedious task is to get to the super market to buy groceries and stuff. She needs 25 large cereal packets, sixty litres of milk and four dozens of eggs per week. This is in addition to the chicken, meat vegetables, bread and other stuff needed for the month.
They need 600 dollars, approximately about seventy five thousand rupees to buy the groceries a week. The difficult part is to bring about two to three loads of groceries over to the mini bus, Jeni said.
Festival times and birthdays
They do not need additional people to celebrate festivals and birthdays. Their gathering alone is sufficient. The family celebrates every birthday with gifts and food. All birthdays are displayed in the house. They make greeting cards for the family members and the mother makes a large cake and sing happy birthday and celebrate the birthday specially at the dinner time. Jeni says that the happiest time is when they enjoy Christmas.
They make a Christmas tree and Jeni wraps Christmas gifts for every kid and the husband. Shopping during Christmas is really fun she added.
A woman who never wanted any children
Jeni, though a mother of sixteen children now, never wanted to be a mother even for a single child when she got married. It was Ray Bonells desire to have a large family and Jeni began to enjoy children as the numbers grew. When the sixteenth child was born, Jeni did not rule out the possibility of the seventeenth. Ray Bonell, the father of the children is so fond of them and is like a friend to them.
Entertainment
Like most of the Australian families, Bonell family also enjoys TV time together in the evenings especially after dinner. They have only one TV at the sitting room and all flock there to enjoy programmes selected by popular choice. Australian research shows that 74 per cent of Australians get entertainment through TV movies.
Sad news for Jeni
The sad news that Jeni was diagnosed with a cancer made prominent news of the press this year. She shared the news through the family face book that has a record 3,600 friends. The family together prays for her recovery whilst she is under medical care. Our prayers are very strong and I hope that there will be great results, she said.

Taylor Swift: Look What You Made Me Do hits number one

It has taken her eight years, but Taylor Swift has finally made it to the top of the UK singles chart.
Given the number of records thatLook What You Made Me Do has smashed, it is perhaps not a surprise.
The song, her first solo release in two years, has already had huge success on Spotify and YouTube.
It had 5.3 million streams and 30,000 downloads in its first week, the Official Charts Company said, and bumps Dua Lipa's New Rules off the top spot.
Look What You Made Me Do -which some people think is about Swift's feud with Kanye West - is her eighth top five single in the UK.
Before this, the highest point she had reached in the charts was number two, with Love Story, I Knew You Were Trouble and Shake it Off.
The video, which sees Swift saying farewell to her past incarnations, has now broken YouTube's one-day streaming record and it broke the same record onSpotify.
Elsewhere in the charts, there are new entries for Macklemore's Glorious, featuring Skylar Grey, which goes up 13 places to number 23.
Camila Cabello's Havana, with Young Thug, is one place behind at 24.
In the album charts, Queens of the Stone Age's new release Villains goes in at number one.
Their seventh studio album was produced by Mark Ronson and is their first UK chart-topper.
It sold more than double the number two - Ed Sheeran's Divide - with 32,000 physical, download and streaming-equivalent sales.
Villains is top of the Official Record Store Chart too, meaning it was the most popular in independent record stores.
The other albums in the top five are new too, with chart debuts for the albums by War on Drugs, PVRIS and Shane Filan in slots three, four and five respectively.

Turkish Airlines GM leaves SL after successful stint
Turkish Airlines General Manager, Sri Lanka, Ozgur Suucak handed over his duties to counterpart Murat Baydar on September 1.
After working in multiple departments in Turkish Airlines in many countries, Suucak who has been General Manager in Sri Lanka since 2013 has now been appointed as General Manager of Turkish Airlines in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, September 1.
Turkish Airlines Sri Lanka, established its office and started operations in 2013 with four flights a week.
Within a successful year of operations, the flights increased to daily flights. Since October 2016, Turkish Airlines further added a cargo freighter which operates once a week and has planned to increase to two cargo freighters per week within the coming months.
Suucak said, I believe that the historic relationship between Sri Lanka and Turkey has been sealed with Turkish Airlines flying into Sri Lanka. Turkish Airlines has added more value to Sri Lanka tourism due to its vast network of 300 destinations around the globe. Being awarded The Best Airline in four categories at the Skykrax Passengers Choice Awards 2017, Turkish Arline has given the Sri Lankan market an opportunity to choose flying with an award winning European carrier and experience the quality of the flying experience. They would also be able to have better connections with the rest of the world since Turkish Airlines flies to more counties than any other airline.
I like to thank Sri Lankan authorities, namely the Civil Aviation, the Government and all travel agents and staff for their support and hospitality given to me. As a stable European carrier which will continue to fly to Sri Lanka, I would like more and more Sri Lankans to come and experience flying with Turkish Airlines. I like to wish Murat Baydar all the very best on his new appointment.

UK manufacturing growth accelerates
Growth in the UK's manufacturing sector accelerated last month, according to a closely watched survey, with output, orders and employment all picking up.
The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to 56.9 in August from 55.3 in July. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.
The PMI reading was the second highest for more than three years.
Rob Dobson from Markit said the sector continued to show signs of "solid progress".
He said it was increasingly likely that growth in the sector would be maintained "given the breadth of the expansion", with both big and small companies seeing conditions improve.
"The survey data suggest that the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support on-going growth in the economy in the third quarter, which will add fuel to hawkish policymakers' calls for higher interest rates."
On Thursday, Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), said "a modest rise" in interest rates was needed to curb high inflation.
Saunders has voted in favour of raising rates at the past two meetings of the MPC.
The PMI survey found that production increased at the fastest pace for seven months in August, helped by a pick-up in new orders. The main source of new orders was the domestic market, although orders from abroad "remained robust".
The recent weakness of the pound has helped to push up demand for UK goods from overseas, although it has also raised the cost of imports. Nearly a third of companies said the prices of goods they bought had risen, which was mainly due to rising commodity costs.
The rate of job creation in the manufacturing sector rose at the fastest pace for 13 months, the report said.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said,"The pick up in the PMI brings tentative hope that the recent decline in the official manufacturing output data will be reversed swiftly.
"The manufacturing sector, however, should be doing even better, given sterling's huge depreciation and the emergence of a strong recovery in the eurozone." BBC News

Unity Gov. helped usher new political culture
President Maithripala Sirisena said that many international allegations, especially the allegations levelled on human right violations were mitigated by implementing a new political culture through the Unity Government.
The President added that with the forming of the Unity Government, the country showcased to the world that human-rights, democracy, equality, ethnic harmony and many more advanced human qualities had been established.
Several sanctions had been imposed against Sri Lanka when the Unity Government was formed ie; European Union fish ban and curtailing of GSP Plus concessions. However,as a result of the people-friendly and democratic governance of the Unity Government, those sanctions were lifted.
As we were able to strengthen democracy and protect human rights, many world leaders extended their fullest support to Sri Lankas foward march, the President said.
President Sirisena was addressing the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys 66th Anniversary Convention under the theme Janabalaya Hari Athata at Campbell Park, Borella yesterday.
Addressing the huge gathering, the President stressed that no one will be allowed to bring the War Heroes, who were actively involved in defending and safeguarding the countrys territorial integrity and sovereignty into disrepute.
I will never allow anyone including international elements to harass not only former Army Commander Lt.Gen.Jagath Jayasuriya but any War Hero. I never dance to the tune of NGOs, which have become a cats paw of LTTE supporters. Lt. General Jayasooriyas case is an international issue, the President said.
The President highlighted that when looking from a global context, every political party unites when a country has to overcome a challenge.
It can be observed that our challenges and threats were overcome by uniting and setting aside minor issues. That is the concept of the Unity Government. The Unity Government was formed with the United National Party to overcome several international challenges, the President said.
The President pointed out that Sri Lanka was defeated at international councils including the United Nations Human Right Council.
The country was side-lined, he said.
The President reminded the people to think of the fate the nation would have faced if he was not elected as the countrys President in 2015.
President Sirisena said that he was able to protect democracy in the SLFP unlike in the past when no one dared to speak against the decisions of the then Chairman at party meetings including the Central Committee Meeting.Everone is free to air their views in the SLFP today.
President Sirisena said that the SLFP will undergo radical change and will be transformed into a vibrant political force which would help it regain its past glory.
The SLFP should be further strengthened as it is a people-friendly party aiming to achieve future political victories, the President said.
This years SLFP Convention which coincides with President Mathiripala Sirisenas 66th birthday, started at around 2.30 pm with the multi-religious observances and the singing of the SLFP theme song.
SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake pledged to make the party a pure, corrupt-free, progressive and democratic political force that could emerge victorious.
SLFP leaders including former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and former Prime Minister D.M.Jayaratne too were in attendance. Representatives from 42 political parties also attended the Convention.
Former Prime Minister late S.W.R.D Bandaranaike was the founding leader of the SLFP. Since its inception in 1951, the partys base has been the Pancha Maha Balawegaya (Five Great Forces) comprised of the Sanga, Weda, Guru, Govi and Kamkaru (Buddhist monks, native doctors, teachers, farmers and workers).
The SLFP which first came to power in 1956 and has been in Government on a number of occasions contributing to the countrys development.

Walking a dog does wonders!
Walking a dog is as good for the owner as it is for their pet, according to the most in-depth study on the activity to date.
The research published on Thursday revealed dog walking does wonders for human mental health.
In fact, the researchers at the University of Liverpool found owners are more strongly motivated to go dog walking because it makes them feel happy, rather than its other health and social benefits.
They carried out interviews with pet owners, then gathered peoples personal written reflections of dog walking experiences.
The researchers found that while owners may say the reason they go walking is to benefit the dog, the importance of their own improved happiness and wellbeing is clear.
These feelings of happiness, however, are based on the owner believing that their dog is enjoying the walk too.
Anything that threatens this, such as behaviour problems, a perception that they have a lazy dog, or their dog is too old, reduces their motivation to walk.
Increased physical activity and social interactions with other dog owners were found to be secondary bonuses but were rarely motivating.
Study leader Dr Carri Westgarth, a research fellow at the University of Liverpool who interviewed 25 dog owners, said: The factors that motivate dog walking are extremely complex, yet we know they can strongly motivate human health behaviour.
It is crucial to understand why owners walk their dogs if we are to be able to effectively promote owners to walk their dogs more.
Dog owners are generally more physically active than non-owners, yet some rarely walk with their dog at all. A pet owner briskly walking their dog for at least 30 minutes each day easily exceeds the 150 minutes recommended minimum physical activity per week.
The researchers said if all dog owners did this it would dramatically boost population levels of physical activity.
Dr Westgarth added: Its clear from our findings that dog walking is used to meet the emotional needs of the owner as well as the needs of the dog.
This may explain why pilot dog walking interventions with messages focused on health or social benefits have not been particularly successful.
Possible key points for future interventions to increase dog walking are to promote how it may increase the dogs, and thus the owners, happiness. The findings are published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

What is the Blue Whale Challenge

The Blue Whale game orBlue Whale Challengeis believed to be a suicide game wherein a group of administrators or a certain curator gives a participant a task to complete daily  for a period of 50 days  the final of which is the participant committing suicide. Participants are expected to share photos of the challenges/tasks completed by them.
These daily tasks start off easy  such as listening to certain genres of music, waking up at odd hours, watching a horror movie, among others, and then slowly escalate to carving out shapes on ones skin, self-mutilation and eventually suicide.
There is still uncertainty over how a participant plays the game. While some say the user has to install some app on their smart phone, others say its via social media platforms such as Instagram andFacebookwhere the administrators get in touch with the participant after those interested throw out postings on social media asking for a curator. A number of different hashtags #bluewhalechallenge, #curatorfindme, #i_am_whale  act as signals for the anonymous curators.
It must be noted, however, that there still is no confirmation of the existence of the game, and suicides linked to it are from personal accounts of families/friends of those deceased who claim they have seen their loved ones performing tasks. While reports of suicides linked to the game have surfaced across the globe, authorities claim that the origin appears to be in Russia, which has reportedly seen about 130 related deaths and at least two arrests.
Schools as well as police officials in Europe and America have begun issuing advisories to parents urging them to be vigilant and to keep an eye out on what their children are sharing on their social media accounts.

What makes popular science books so popular
Neil deGrasse Tyson begins Astrophysics for People in a Hurry by assembling evidence of the increasing popularity of the universe, drawing our attention to the fact that the highest grossing movie of all time is set on a planet orbiting a distant star and features, as its lead, an astrobiologist (he declines to name the film, but one of us needs to re-watch Gone with the Wind). His claim that astrophysics tops the list of popular sciences is convincing, though devoid of hard data; the explanation he offers is that most of us have looked up at the night sky and wondered some version of what is my place in the universe
The book, he hopes, will help answer that question  an ambitious aim for just 200 pages  but it is the following claim that will reassure (or terrify) readers: If Ive succeeded, youll be culturally conversant in my field of expertise.
Are we, the laity, now meant to be having informed conversations about astrophysics Having raised the bar to foundational fluency, Tyson rapidly lowers it to something more like not embarrassing yourself at the water cooler.
The concern is one of cultural survival. But still, is there a danger here
In attempting to become culturally conversant does one risk becoming a boulevardier of scientific conversation or, worse, a sincere tourist who believes that, because he has read the guide book, he has something to say That Tyson pitches his book at people too busy to absorb the cosmos via classes, text books or documentaries adds to the initial worry.
Trillionth of a second
Concerns quickly evaporate as Tyson relates the vital statistics of the young universe: smaller than a full-stop, 14 billion years ago.
Then, more precise details emerge: at 10-45 seconds old the universe was less than 10-35 metres across.
By the fourth page we are only a trillionth of a second into the history of the universe, but our guide is rattling along at full speed: he has already covered the Planck Era and the four forces (weak, strong, electromagnetic and gravity), and we feel confident that somehow, he is going to reach 2017 before the pages run out. By the eighth page we find ourselves one millionth of a second after the beginning of the universe. The temperature has fallen to below a trillion degrees kelvin and yes, antimatter is real. Two pages later, we start to think on a more human scale: a full second has passed. Things are slowing down. The universe is now a few light years across and only a billion degrees kelvin. Tysons dramatic device of announcing the passage of time every few pages works well, giving a sense of scale and drama: time is running out for the universe to get itself into shape.
He recounts these events with a great deal more certainty than most of the physics community feels about them, but he is trying to prepare us for a conversation, not a viva.
The book is a collection of essays but the arrangement is coherent, and those truly in a hurry may be frustrated both by the absence of diagrams, timelines and a clearly described canon of theories, as well as by the presence of appalling dad jokes (the one about the dairy farmer and the astrophysicist especially does not bear repeating) and recycled internet memes.
Tyson is, nonetheless, the worlds best science communicator. This may seem like a subjective claim but the data support it.
When he relaunched Carl Sagans television series Cosmos in 2014 the first episode reached 40 million viewers internationally.
His current programme, StarTalk, an astrophysics chat show featuring former presidents, Hollywood A-listers and scientists has broad appeal: I teach undergraduate students who watch it while stoned, and have friends in their eighties who find it enthralling.
Pressure peers
His achievements are hard-won: black astrophysicists are rare, and as a student at Harvard University in the 1970s Tyson had to resist not only the white establishment but also pressure from his peers: blacks in America do not have the luxury of [their] talents being spent on Astrophysics, he was told.
Now, he doggedly defends science as a quest for truth, a position that allows him to occupy the political centre and see the hot air on both sides. Indeed, one gets a clearer sense of Tysons politics in the final chapter, Reflections on the Cosmic Perspective, in which he asks, who is able to celebrate a cosmic view of life Not the sweatshop worker. Certainly, not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food. You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival. This chapter, which addresses the pettiness of most earthly problems, ends with a kind of creed: the cosmic perspective, Tyson says, embraces kindness, environmentalism, kinship and a search for truth, and rejects low contracted prejudices; he urges readers to once a week if not once a day ponder what cosmic truths lie undiscovered before us.
Prominent expert
The question is there a god is broached early on: some religious people assert, with a tinge of righteousness, that something must have started it all. Tyson seems tired of dealing with this old chestnut: he is the public face of science in America, and the countrys most prominent expert on the origins of life and matter. As such his opinion on God is sought frequently. He demurs (Ignorance is the natural state of mind for a research scientist), and stays on solid ground: we do know that the universe had a beginning and that we are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out. Throughout, the language of the book hints at the complex role of spirituality in astrophysics. Although he draws on Christian imagery (the first three chapter headings are the greatest story ever told; On Earth as in the heavens; let there be light), his cosmic perspective is spiritual  even redemptive  but not religious.
If Astrophysics for People in a Hurry examines the infinite reaches of time and space, Storm in a Teacup: The physics of everyday life by Helen Czerski addresses the life-sized and relatable. Her intent is to titillate and excite with details such as this: To make a standard full household bath as salty as the ocean you need to add about 10kg of salt, a large bucket full. Dull would he be of soul who did not marvel at this information, especially when it is coupled with an explanation of buoyancy and the thermohaline currents of our oceans. Czerski is a bubble physicist, an underappreciated specialism, and bubbles are deployed throughout as devices that will lead us from the everyday (bubble bath, focaccia bread dough, frying halloumi cheese) into complex physics. Physics inspires fear in many; bubbles do not. Indeed, a large part of the books charm lies in its embrace of the seemingly banal.
A discussion of gravity and why the Titanic sank begins with Czerskis creation of a raisin lava lamp with her family, in her mothers back garden. The anecdote is footnoted thus: By coincidence, the distance that the Titanic sank relative to its size . . . is pretty much the same as the distance that the raisins sink in a 2-litre bottle. The shift in perspective leaves one gazing, god-like, at a shipwreck in a bottle.
