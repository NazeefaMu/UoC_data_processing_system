Female councillors are not ornaments
The female councillors selected to local government bodies under the 25-percent mandatory womens representation law, should not be set aside as ornaments, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said on Tuesday.
Deshapriya was addressing a press briefing on the Provincial Council Election, which was held at the Election Commission premises. Deshapriya, commenting on the 25-percent female representation, said that the female councillors should not be kept unoccupied:
We should realise the real reasons as to why such a mandatory female representatation was pressed for, he said, Programmes should be launched targetting these female councilors.
Certain individuals inquired from me as to why such a law on female representation was brought forth, Deshapriya said. According to him, the newly-elected female representatives should not allow any room for such questions.
Deshapriya also said that there was a lack of female representation in political parties and in active organisations such as the Government Medical Officers Association, Bar Association, Sri Lanka Engineers Association and Inter-University Students Federation.

I never persuaded CCD DG to stop eliminating unauthorized constructions
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday, denied any attempt to persuade the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) Director General from eliminating the unauthorized constructions at Mirissa coastal area. Musthapha said that he had never tried to influence any government official during his political career. It was only making a request I made via a telephone call, appealing him to consider the humane aspect of the matter before demolishing these unauthorized constructions, Minister Musthapha said. Mustapha urged the CCD to temporarily suspend any immediate action to take down the unauthorized constructions and to opt for discussions to find out a solution benefitting both parties.
Musthapha was speaking at a press brief held at the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry yesterday evening.
Musthapha said that he respected CCD Director General for his unwavering commitment to implement laws as a government official. According to the law, this decision is lawful. However, as a politician who is committed to the welfare of the common majority, I plea the CCD to rethink its decision, as it would be a blow to these persons livelihood. This is our call as politicians. We should strike a balance. It is their livelihood we are talking about. These vendors have earned a living from these businesses for more than seven years or so. We should give these people an option without simply abandoning them. Minister Musthapha said.
Minister Musthapha also said that some groups are trying to portray him as the villain who is against demolishing these unauthorized constructions. However, When I said that I will step into ensure that the poor people of Mirissa are not suddenly left without their livelihood, that is not to say that I will in any way subvert the Constitution and laws of this country, but I will do my best to ensure that the laws are applied in a decent, reasonable and sensitive way by balancing the contextual realities of the poor people who are affected by those laws, Minister Musthapha stated.
He also pointed out that Hikkaduwa, Unawatuna and Mount Lavinia coastal areas too have similar illegal constructions in abundance.
It was reported that Minister Musthapha contacted CCD Director General Prabhath Chandrakeerti and urged him not to go ahead with the decision to remove the illegal business constructions at Mirissa the coast.

Mother of All Shows help change Sri Lankas cricket destiny
The Observer Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has become a part of Sri Lankas cricket history. Not merely because its the countrys oldest school cricket awards show but also due to the fact that it had produced legendary cricketers who have changed the destiny of Sri Lanka cricket.
At the same time there is a four-decade long unique and memorable story behind the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest.
Until 1978, there had been no formal school cricket awards show, although the countrys oldest inter-school cricket match  the Royal-Thomian, was set to complete its centenary then.
The schoolboys involved in inter-school cricket merely played their traditional fixtures sans any recognition whatsoever. Even though the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) had not even thought of conducting a league tournament for Under-19 First X1 school cricket, there was a great necessity to reward the most outstanding players and motivate them.
Schoolboys played only for the love of the game and purely for their satisfaction. There wasnt a single school cricket awards show at that time to reward the milestone achievements of the countrys schoolboy cricketers.
But the countrys flagship English newspaper  the Sunday Observer and its publisher Lake House, understood the need to reward the most outstanding schoolboy cricketers and inspire them before they step into club cricket and the national team.
Even the then Royal captain Ranjan Madugalle was taken by surprise when he, along with several other outstanding schoolboy cricketers, were invited for an awards show after the 1978/79 inter-school season.
Attending a school cricket awards show was something new to them because even the SLSCA had not thought of conducting an annual school cricket awards show at that time. Forget an awards show altogether, the SLSCA had not even thought of conducting an inter-school cricket tournament at that time.
Madugalle never knew that there would be an awards show for outstanding schoolboy cricketers after the 1978/79 First X1 season, which included the centenary Battle of the Blues cricket encounter between Royal and S.Thomas.
Ultimately, Madugalle was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year to become the first-ever recipient of the most prestigious award in school cricket.
Former Sri Lanka captain Madugalle, who now serves as the Chief Match Referee of the ICC, said he was 'honoured and privileged' to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award at its inaugural show in 1979.
In fact, we didnt even know that there was such an award on offer. We played traditional friendly matches to enjoy the game and not for competition or personal glory, says Madugalle. But it was great to feel that your hard work as a schoolboy cricketer is appreciated at the end of the season. It is a great inspiration and a satisfaction to feel that your performances are recognized.
It is not merely for individual glory but your performances as a team. It was great for the Sunday Observer to recognize the achievements of school teams and their players, he added.
Ananda College, a household name in school cricket which had produced many brilliant Sri Lanka cricketers, did not take long to produce a champion. In the very next year, Ananda produced its first Observer Schoolboy Cricketer  Arjuna Ranatunga who was then a 17-year-old youngster.
When Rohan Buultjens of St. Peters College emerged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1981, Ranatunga ended up as the runner-up.
But the outstanding left-handed middle order batsman Ranatunga had another rich harvest with the willow to secure the top award in 1982.
During the same season, he had the honour of representing Sri Lanka in its inaugural Test against England, while still being a schoolboy cricketer. He not only had that rare honour but also made it a double celebration by becoming the first Sri Lankan batsman to score a half century in Test cricket. Ranatunga, now a Cabinet Minister, is best remembered as the countrys World Cup winning captain after piloting Sri Lanka to a memorable seven-wicket victory over Australia in the final of the 1996 tournament played in Lahore.
Despite going places as one of the most successful captains that Sri Lanka has ever produced, Ranatunga still feels the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year trophies he had won to be among the most precious in his rich collection.
You may go places and win many other awards at higher levels, but an award won at the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event remains the most memorable in any cricketers life, said Ranatunga.
Winning this award twice remains the most cherished moment in my life. Those titles had given me tremendous inspiration and confidence for me to step into the international arena, says Ranatunga. When a schoolboy is adjudged the Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Best All-rounder or the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, thats a tremendous boost for a youngster, who could then aim at club level and international level thereafter, he added.
After Ranatungas dominance from 1980 to 1982, the next two years of school cricket was completely dominated by one brilliant batsman who showed no mercy to bowlers in school cricket in that period.
He was none other than Roshan Mahanama of Nalanda who became the first ever to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in successive years (1983 and 1984).
Recalling his days as a schoolboy cricketer at Nalanda College, Mahanama said: It was a great feeling to have their names on the teams fixture card.
Even the old boys made it a point to skip all other engagements to watch their school teams matches. It was a great honor for us to see our names in the fixture card - first as a player, then as a coloursman and later as vice-captain or captain. I still have those Nalanda fixture cards with me, Mahanama recalled. When Mahanama was stealing the Mega Show in 1983 and 1984, there had been an ambitious and talented batsman from his same school team in the audience, thinking what a prestige it would be for a schoolboy to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title.
Much to his delight and that of his Nalanda supporters, this very same player was adjudged Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1985. He is none other than former Nalanda captain and ex-Sri Lanka middle order batsman Asanka Gurusinha, who now serves as the manager of the national team.
When Roshan Mahnama won this award twice in 1983 and 1984, I felt how prestigious it is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. It is not an award that everybody could win.
One has to perform exceptionally well and be consistent right throughout a season to win that  work really hard to reach the pinnacle of school career, recalls Gurusinha.
Better known as Gura in cricketing circles, the 1996 World Cup star said he was ambitious after witnessing the proud moment of Mahanama as well as for his alma mater Nalanda. I knew hard work and dedication with exceptional performance could take a schoolboy cricketer towards that goal. That was exactly what happened in the following year, recalled Gurusinha.
After an outstanding 1984/85 season for Nalanda, with a rich aggregate of over 1,000 runs with the willow, young Gurusinha was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1985. It was a great moment, to win the highest award in school cricket before a packed house at the BMICH. After winning the title, I started believing in myself more. In less than five months after that I made my Test debut for Sri Lanka, he added.
Meanwhile, voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, conducted under three divisions, is on its last lap.
Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests could be made through voting coupons which continue to appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.

Southern Provincial Council members belonging to the United National Party (UNP) are at an impasse as they have no leader to whom they could look up to, Southern Provincial Council UNP member T. V. K. Gamini said.
He was addressing the media following a UNP discussion which was held on April 24 after the inaugural meeting of the Southern Provincial Council was adjourned.
"Their opposition group leader and UNP opposition chief whip had failed to get an appointment for them to meet party leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe," he added.

The write way
He does not quite fit the image of the typical author . He is neither the gray haired, bearded professor nor the middle aged motivation speaker turned wordsmith. You may think that all published writers have spent many years honing their craft but believe it or not, Thanuwana Serasinghe experienced publishing success when he was four years old.
The Sri Lankan boy who resides in Victoria, Seychelles has gone down in history as the youngest author ever to publish a book. He beat the Guinness record set by Adauto Kovalski Da Silva of Brazil for publishing a book at the age of five years and 302 days. Thanuwana had been four years and 356 days old when he had achieved this feat. His book titled Junk Food is based on a story of a boys who moves away from his habit of eating chocolates and sweets to become a healthy eater. The book, a Sooriya Publication was launched at the Sri Lanka High Commission in Seychelles on November 24, 2017. Copies of his book were presented to Seychelles Vice President Vincent Meritone and Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Seychelles Tikiri Herath Gunathilake.
Writing a book at such a young age is not the only remarkable thing about this lad. He was able to write alphabets of seven different languages: English, Sinhala, Russian, Greek, Hiragana (Japanese), Katakana, Arabic even before he started kindergarten.
Thanuwana had been an avid reader and has had a thirst for knowledge from his tender years. He started scribbling all over the house when he was about one and half years. No wall, flooring, furniture or pantry cupboard was spared from this toddler who went wild whenever he got his hands on a pen, pencil or marker. His parents Thusitha and Apsara Serasinghe who are strong believers in letting children express themselves freely, did not try to stop him. The tiny tot soon learnt the English alphabet all by himself. Since he showed signs of being eager to learn phonics they let him watch some educational videos on YouTube. By two and half years Thanuwana was penning the Russian alphabet. He had gone through alphabet videos in the recommended section in YouTube and had learnt to master them on his own. By three years he was able to read books that are usually recommended for an eight year old.
My class teacher in grade one, Ms Mary, noted my flair for writing and motivated me to write stories. Junk Food is a result of this endeavour . My brother, Archana, and I wrote stories during that period. He wrote stories based on the Angry Birds while I chose to write a tale about junk food because we were learning about healthy food at school then. I wanted to spread the message that junk food is bad for your health, Thanuwana explained.
Writing the book has not been a difficult task for the youngster but it has taken his parents some time to locate the right publisher. The family is grateful to Athula Jayakody of Sooriya Publishers and Yojani Upananda who did the enchanting illustrations for the book.
He has gotten lots of positive and encouraging feedback from everyone who had read the book. He recently received The Shining World Leadership Award. The award was presented to him for his outstanding ability to inspire and touch the hearts of all by lovingly caring for the health and well-being of other children.
He notes that becoming the youngest author to publish a book has never been in his or his parents mind when he had started this venture. The fact that his work made him a Guinness World record holder has simply blown him away.
It felt amazing when I was handed over the certificate. I truly felt like a genius! he added with a smile.
Unfurling his ideas about his ability to pick up diverse languages Thanuwana said that most of the letters are similar to English.
However the sounds are different. When I was little I liked to write different letters a lot because I saw pictures in them. They look funny. For example, Taa in Arabic looks like a smiley face. Thaa looks like he has his nose on his forehead. Hiragana letters look like ninjas, he elaborated.
Thanuwana is a fan of the Beast Quest childrens fantasy/adventure series. His favourite author is American writer Dr Seuss because he puts rhymes to good use in his work.
Thanuwanas father is a Director of Information Technology in Marriott Hotels group and his mother is an educator in the ICT field. His brother is nine years old and is a wizard at math. He has got a High Distinction in Australian Mathematic competition. Thanuwanas parents have moved to Seychelles in 2003 because they got employment opportunities at the Ministry of Education in Seychelles.
Besides writing Thanuwana is also into painting. He is also enthusiastic about doing mathematics. His ambition is to become a teacher.
I love teaching. I want to fly to Russia and Japan for further studies before returning to Sri Lanka to teach, said the six year old who is a grade two student of International School Seychelles.
Recalling memories about Thanuwanas talents his parents said that they had not pushed him to take up anything. He had simply followed his heart and his interests have varied overtime.
He is eager to learn maths, about other countries and computer programming. All he wanted was a violin for his sixth birthday. Now he wants to learn how to play it and wants to become a great pianist as well. The only thing which has not changed over the time is his goal of becoming a teacher in the future, they disclosed.
Another memory which lingers in their mind was when they had seen a news report of a hurricane on TV while they were dining at a restaurant. They could not hear what the news presenter was saying so wondered aloud where it was. Then Thanuwana informed them that the hurricane was in Texas and pointed out the Texas flag in the background on the screen.
The knowledge that todays youngsters have in various fields is surprising. We believe that children should have access to the Internet and the latest technology though they need to be monitored closely, they opined.
The most memorable moment in Thanuwanas life is his recent trip to Singapore with his family. He hopes to continue with his passion of writing but says that these days some other matters take his time. However thoughts for a new book are already in his mind and he says that the theme would most likely be about health or the human body.

The 16 paragons of virtue
The 16 rebel SLFP MPs who quit the Yahapalanaya government following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have decided to go public and expose the frauds and misdeed of their one time colleagues in the same government. Former Petroleum Minister Chandima Weerakkody, addressing a media conference, on Tuesday, said it was they, of the SLFP, who first exposed the bond scam and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, it was, who complained to the Bribery Commission on the matter.
Asked by a journalist as to why they kept silent for the last three years and planning to come out with these exposures only now, Weerakkody said they were earlier bound by Cabinet responsibility, plus decency, which precluded them from spilling the beans prior to this.
Is the former minister expecting the public to swallow this line If, as he says, it was the SLFP -which included the gang of 16- that exposed the bond scam, what prevented them from coming out with the other acts of corruption and misdeeds which he says took place within the Yahapalanaya government which they were going to go public with only now after three years.
He also says that collective Cabinet responsibility was the reason that sealed their lips. This collective Cabinet responsibility did not prevent the likes of Susil Premajayantha openly criticizing the Hambantota port agreement nor Dayasiri Jayasekera lambasting Minister Arjuna Ranatunga during the recent fuel distribution crisis. Hence, it needed little encouragement for Weerakkody and the rest of his conscientious colleagues in the gang of 16 to expose the frauds and corruption which he says were rampant in the government.
He also cites decency as another reason that kept them from enumerating each corrupt act of his then ministerial colleagues. Well, it is entirely left to the public to judge the level of decency in our politicians, of all hues. Suffice it to say that Weerakkody was one of the ministers (the other being Dayasiri Jayasekera) who stuck in their toes and refused to quit their posts even after leaving the government following the failed No Confidence Motion stating that they could be removed only by the President. How decent it is to sit with his own Prime Minister at the Cabinet after attempting to oust him through a No Confidence Motion only Weerakkody will be able to explain.
Former Minister Weerakkody could also not be unaware that some of his colleagues in the gang of 16 entered parliament through the National List, curtsy President Maithripala Sirisena, after losing at the General Election. How decent it is to turn their backs on their own leader who bailed them out from being thrown to the political wilderness, by spurning his efforts to continue with the Unity Government and make common cause with his political enemies, also only Weerakkody will be able to unravel.
Be that as it may, the SLFP rebels, who, until now, enjoyed ministerial office, are hardly in a position to clean up the Augean stables and emerge squeaky clean. Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, who, these days, has taken up the role of a crusader against corruption, has come out with some startling revelations in respect of one of them.
Now that the subject of a cleanup and going public (with the misdeeds of the government) has been brought up by a former member of the Cabinet, no less, President Sirisena should take immediate steps to probe his claim and ferret out the acts of corruption among his ministers. The probe should also be extended to cover the allegations made by Deputy Minister Ramanayake and also reopening the case against another prominent rebel MP that was allowed to lie in abeyance while he was a minister in the Yahapalanaya Government.
Vesak and May Day
Much debate has swirled around the decision to shift the universal day of the working class, or May Day, as is commonly known, in Sri Lanka, this year on account of the Vesak week clashing with the event, the rational of the authorities being the sound and fury of the May Day would intrude into the sanctity of the period holy to all Buddhists.
While the Mahanayakes and the Buddhist clergy in general (one member of the Sangha has declared his opposition to having Vesak in April) are in favour of this move, there are those who contend that Vesak is hardly observed in the appropriate somber tones but where the accent is on celebrations, nay, revelry, as is clear from the Vesak revelers that descend on the city during this period, akin to a May Day roister.
This was the stated reason given by Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera when he sought to ban Vesak pandals, so that the minds of the devotees are directed towards piety and serene contemplation during the Vesak period.

Boost in seafood exports after lifting of EU ban
Fisheries exports have been increased tremendously after the ban imposed on fisheries exports from Sri Lanka by the European Union (EU) was lifted in July 2016.
According to the statistics of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry, the country has exported 58,578 metric tons of seafood during the 21 months from July 2016 to March 2018, the period after the ban was lifted, and earned Rs. 92,117 million in foreign exchange.
Sri Lanka is one of the biggest seafood exporters to the EU.
But seafood exports were severely hit by the ban imposed in October 2014, and continued to decline.
Sri Lankas total seafood exports in the 2014 was 26,320 MTs. After the imposition of the ban, the country was able to export only 26,129 MTs of seafood and earn only Rs, 2,103 million in foreign exchange through the seafood exports between January 2015 and June 2016.
During the first three months of 2018, Sri Lanka earned Rs 11,804 million by exporting 7174.8 MTs of seafood. After imposition of the ban, most of the fish-processing factories were closed and now the number of those factories has increased from 34 to 68.
According to Ministry sources, the demand for tuna, prawn, crab and lobster exports from Sri Lanka has increased in the international market.
These facts were revealed at a progress review meeting held recently at the ministry under the patronage of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.

Private bus owners as a whole are in grave financial crisis since the value of the dollar is increasing relative to the rupee day by day, Chief Secretary of the Private Bus Owners Association Anjana Priyanjitha said.
Taking this to account the government should take measures to increase bus fares, the President of the Association added.

CBSL Clarifies on Treasury bond  service payments
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in a communiqu states that it has observed media reports erroneously highlighting lack of funds to pay-off Treasury bonds before their date of maturity.
The communiqu says : CBSL notes that there is no accuracy in above media reports and highlights the unblemished debt service payment record of the government in servicing both domestic and foreign debt.
The payment of interest and principal at maturity on due dates (timely payment) and not before the due date is followed to the rule by CBSL in discharging its agency function of managing public debt on behalf of the government. The availability of funds to pay maturity (including the interest component) for Treasury bills and coupon and maturity for Treasury bonds in 2018 also highlights the substantial liquidity available with the government in servicing its debt liabilities.
The following table highlights the coupon and maturity payments for Treasury bonds so far during 2018 amounting to Rs. 324,448 million compared to only Rs. 222,020 million raised by issuing Treasury bonds.
During the same period, CBSL holdings of Treasury bills as at April 25, 2018 also declined substantially to Rs. 69,114 million from Rs. 293,039 million as at April 25, 2017.

## Title: The Chelvanayakam chapter of Sri Lankan politics
## Supertitle: S.J.V. Chelvanayakams 41st death anniversary:
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, April 26, 2018 - 01:00
S.J.V. Chelvanayakams 41st death anniversary:
The Chelvanayakam chapter of Sri Lankan politics
S J V Chelvanayakam was born on March 31, 1898, and departed his life on April 26, 1977. On April 26 falls his 41st death anniversary. His political vision of federalism was misinterpreted yet its embers will continue to burn till the mission is achieved.
The political wheels of Sri Lanka would have definitely moved in a different way had S.J.V. Chelvanayakam played a pragmatic politics in 1968 rather than adhering to the Christian faith of honouring a promise. He strictly adhered to the Christian faith of honouring his promises. He considered his word as bond.
Failure to play politics rather than practising Christian faith foiled many such opportunities where Federal Party held the political scale to make and unmake governments were lost forever. No such opportunity ever arose but coffined for good.
FOUR DEMANDS OF FP
In the 1960s the Federal Party advanced four demands to support a UNP Government under Dudley Senanayake but Dudley Senanayake refused to accept any one of the demands put forward by Chelvanayakam.
The demands were to (1) stop State Aided Colonization, (2) grant citizenship to Plantation Tamils, (3) making Tamil Language parity with the Sinhala Language, and (4) establishing Regional Councils with powers devolved.
As Dudley Senanayake did not accept any one of the demands and consequently the Federal Party refused to form the UNP Government.
STRATEGY OF CO-OPERATION
In the year 1965, Chelvanayakam said: Since the 1960s we have experimented a new strategy of co-operating with the Sinhala Political Parties. First, we supported SLFP in March 1960 and the years thereafter to defeat UNP because SLFP came to an agreement with FP to implement the BC Pact but they never honoured the solemn promise and agreement.
SLFP made it clear that SLFP would honour its promises and agreements even if the SLFP was returned to power with the overall majority and even SLFP did not have to depend on the FPs support to run a government.
FP SUPPORTS SLFP
In the political scenario, SLFP wanted the support of the FP to mobilize Tamil support for its candidates in the Sinhala Provinces. With the clear understanding of the political implications, the FP helped the SLFP to achieve its political gain by its organizational network and openly canvassing for SLFP
SLFP has let FP down very badly. They even ignored to acknowledge the receipt of letters sent by the Federal Party.
BC PACT
The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact had in Part B eight clauses. The first three clauses are illuminating. They are:
(1) Regional Areas to be defined in the Bill itself by embodying them in a Schedule thereto.
(2) That the Northern Province is to form a Regional Area whilst the Eastern Province is to be divided into two or more Regional Areas.
(3) Provision is to be made in the Bill to enable two or more Regions to amalgamate even beyond the provincial limit and for one Region to divide itself subject to ratification by Parliament. Further, provision is to be made in the Bill for two or more Regions to collaborate for specific purposes of common interest.
FP REFUSED TO SUPPORT SLFP
When in the year 1965 move was made for the UNP and FP to form a National Government, Dr. N.M. Perera Anil Moonasinghe made their last effort to get the support of the Federal Party to enable Sirimavo Bandaranaike to form the government. They promised to implement the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact in toto. Chelvanayakam reminded them that they had given such solemn promises many times but all were dishonoured after the hour of victory and he refused to support them any longer.
DC PACT
The Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact was signed on 24.03.965. It stated as follows:
1. Action will be taken early under the Tamil Language Special Provisions Act to make provision of the Tamil Language of Administration and of Record in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Senanayake explained that it was the policy of his party that a Tamil speaking person should be entitled to transact business in Tamil throughout the island.
2. Senanayake stated that it was the policy of his party to amend the Language of Courts Act to provide legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to be conducted and recorded in Tamil.
3. Action will be taken to establish District Councils in Ceylon vested with powers over subjects to be mutually agreed upon between the two leaders. It was agreed, however, that the government should have power under the law to give directions to such councils under the national interest.
4. The Land Development Ordinance will be amended to provide that citizens of Ceylon e entitled to the allotment of land under the Ordinance.
Senanayake further agreed that in the granting of land under colonization schemes the following priorities be observed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces:
a. The land in the Northern and Eastern Provinces should in the first instance be granted to the landless persons in the District.
b. Secondly, to the Tamil Speaking Persons residing in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
c. Thirdly, to other citizens in Ceylon, preference being given to the Tamil citizens in the rest of the island.
DUDLEYGE BADE MASALA VADAI
After the formation of the National Government the Coalition Parties, SLFP, LSSP and CP went on the way of an offensive against the National Government. On the Joint May Day Procession, they marched with the slogan Dudleyge bade masala vadai.
It meant that the stomach of Dudley had masala vadai, an item of Tamil food which the Sinhalese too tasted.
JOINT OPPOSITION
Regulations were framed to give the use of Tamil in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The Bill was presented in Parliament on January 8, 1966. The Coalition Parties organized a protest demonstration. The demonstrators became violent and were acting unruly. Then, the Minister of State, J.R. Jayewardene ordered the Police to disperse the demonstrators. The Police used tear gas but the demonstrators were acting very violently. The Police opened fire, killing Ratnasara Thera, a Buddhist Bhikku.
DC PACT ABANDONED AND DUDLEY OFFERED TO RESIGN
The Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was not a strong-willed person. He became cold feet as the Buddhist Priest was killed by the action of the Police and dropped the DC Pact like dropping down as hot plate.
Prime Minister, Dudley Senanayake told the Federal Party Leader, Chelvanayakam he could not honour his word and he would resign as Prime Minister for his failure to implement the DC Pact.
Chelvanayakam did not ask Dudley Senanayake to dissolve the government or asked him to resign the premiership but Chelvanayakam asked Dudley Senanayake not to resign. Chelvanayakam asked Dudley Senanayake to continue as Prime Minister and that he would give his support for the entire period of four years as promised.
CHELVA WANTED DUDLEY TO CONTINUE
Had Chelvanayakam accepted the offer of resignation of Dudley Senanayake as Prime Minister, JR Jayewardena would have succeeded as Prime Minister as Sir John Kotelawala succeeded as Prime Minister upon the resignation of Dudley Senanayake as Prime Minister in 1953.
JR Jayewardena was a strong-willed person. Had he succeeded as Prime Minister he would have implemented the DC Pact fully or partly. In that event, it would have certainly alleviated the rigours of the several anti-Tamil Legislation.
JR WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY
Besides the above benefits, JR Jayewardene would have been the Prime Minister for the next two years and during the aforesaid period of his two years reign, he would have definitely changed the political scenes of the country and would have averted the political episode of 1970 and subsequent development of political theories. Chelvanayakam had pursued his political vision with religious mission and favour. He had fixed principles, not intransigent but unswerving in pursuit of his religious faith.
TERRIBLE PRICE
It was a terrible price the country and, more so, the Tamils had to pay. A careful political move would have avoided the horrors of communal programmes, economic and political mess that Sri Lanka was pushed into the mire.

Citizens' Mail
Standard ID for the Maha Sangha
There is a proposal to issue a standard and streamlined identity card to members of the Maha Sangha to expel rogues masquerading as Buddhist monks. This is good. We appreciate that move.
It is more important to understand what Buddhism is. In Buddhism, we develop our mind. What is more important is to study, research, discuss, observe and analyse and find out what Buddhism is and follow that correct path.
Buddhism is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings of the Buddha.
Buddhism is a path of practice and spiritual development leading to insight into the true nature of reality. Buddhist practices like meditation are means of changing yourself in order to develop the qualities like awareness, kindness and wisdom.
The experience developed within the Buddhist tradition over thousands of years has created an incomparable resource for all those who wish to follow a path which ultimately culminates in enlightenment.
An enlightened being seen the nature of reality absolutely clearly, just as it is, and lives fully and naturally in accordance with that vision.
This is the goal of the spiritual life, representing the end of suffering for anyone who attains it.
The goal of Buddhism is a state of lasting, unconditional happiness known as enlightenment.
To bring us to this state, Buddhism points us to lasting values in this impermanent world and gives us valuable information about how things really are. Through understanding the law of cause and effect (karma), using practical tools like meditation to gain insight and develop compassion and wisdom, we  all of us -- can tap into our potential to realize the ultimate goal of enlightenment. The Buddha taught methods of gradually overcoming our negative minds such as anger, jealousy, and ignorance. He taught us how to develop our positive minds such as love, compassion, and wisdom. Through this, we will come to experience lasting peace and happiness.
Delusions such as hatred, greed, and ignorance are not the intrinsic part of the mind. If we apply the appropriate methods they can be completely eliminated, as we shall experience supreme happiness of full enlightenment.
Having attained enlightenment, we shall have all necessary qualities  universal love and compassion, wisdom and boundless spiritual power.
This is the ultimate aim of Buddhism.

Colours to dye for!
Hair colours seem to be getting funkier by the day. Celebrities and models have nailed the trend and wacky hair colours like blue, yellow and burgundy have become a style statement for youth today. Here are some must-knows before you set about colouring your mane.
Exposing dyed hair to the sunlight
The sun bleaches and destroys the melanin in your hair giving you lighter hair. Since the hair is dead, the hair will stay that colour until new hair comes in.
Bleach and scalp irritation
The ingredients used in bleaching hair are harsh on the scalp. Transforming hair from dark to light requires a strong solution, and this can irritate the scalp if the solution is left on the hair for too long.
Colouring your entire head during touch ups
It is not necessary to colour your entire head when you visit the salon for touch ups. Once a full head has been done it is only necessary to get the regrowth done which is know as a root touch up.
Going back to ones natural hair colour
A bleach wash is traditionally done with a low peroxide and hair bleach mixed with shampoo if you wish to go back to your natural hair colour. You should wash your hair gently and this will cause a slight lift in the hair colour. It is gentler than any other method to get the colour out of your hair - unless you can get your hands on a colour remover. A colour remover shrinks the artificial colour molecule down and allows you to wash most of it out of your hair.
Bleaching hair
Bleach is used to lighten hair. The bleach reacts with the melanin in the hair, removing the colour in an irreversible chemical reaction. The peroxide is used in an alkaline solution, which opens the hair shaft to allow the peroxide to react with the melanin.
Using a toner
Toners are a deposit colour, which means they won't do anything to your natural hair. They last for about four to five weeks depending on how often you wash your hair . If you wash your hair every day, expect your toner to fade out faster.
Longevity of hair dyes
In general, permanent colour will remain on your hair until your hair grows, exposing the roots. Usually, this takes between four and six weeks before you need to go back and get your roots done. The four to six week period is also when the permanent color will begin to fade.
Vegetable hair dyes
Nowadays, hair products like dyes and colours seem to be filled with chemicals that give you great colour, but also cause serious damage to your hair. Consider vegetable hair dyes. They are much safer as they do not contain chemicals and other toxic substances that do not do any good to your tresses. They are especially excellent for people who are allergic to various chemicals. However vegetable hair dyes do tend to fade after about three weeks.
Current hair colour trends
Washed-out pastel shades
Natural roots
Gold Ombre
Balayage with fiber highlights
Platinum blondes
Guidelines toprotect your hair coloursand make them last longer
Wash your hair less often. Shampooing your hair every day can not only strip away its natural oils but the colour as well.
Use a shampoo for colour-treated hair. When you do wash your hair, its important to use the right product.
Use a conditioner for colour-treated hair. Just as you should use a shampoo for colour-treated hair, its important to use a conditioner designed to preserve colour.
When you do heat style, always apply a heat protectant product first. It will coat your hair so the heat doesnt dry out your hair too much.
Natural hair dyes
l Coffee: Coffee works great if you are looking to go darker, cover gray hairs, or add dimension to dark tresses. Brew a cup of strong coffee. Apply on clean hair and allow it to sit for about an hour. If you use apple cider vinegar to rinse it, it will help the colour last longer.
l Tea: Like coffee, black tea can help you go darker, and can also help cover gray hairs. Use the tea to dye your hair in the same process you did for the coffee.
l Beet and carrot juice: This one is easy. Simply apply about a cup of the juice to your hair. You can also mix in some coconut oil to condition hair at the same time. Work it through, wrap hair, and leave on for at least an hour.

Glorious uncertainties
The realignment of political forces continues in the aftermath of the failed motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with all eyes now on the much-expected Cabinet reshuffle, which is due shortly.
Ironically, even though the motion of no-confidence was aimed at destabilising the United National Party (UNP) by inviting dissent within the party and encouraging UNP Parliamentarians to vote against their leader, its net result has been the exact opposite, a destabilisation of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Parliamentarians of the SLFP are now scattered in three camps: those who remain loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena and remain in the Cabinet because they abstained from voting in support of the no-confidence motion, those who still profess loyalty to the President but voted in support of the no-confidence motion and will therefore now sit in the Opposition and those loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The first group has now dwindled to about twenty-five MPs. Most of them will be in line for Cabinet portfolios when the Cabinet is reshuffled. They would have to however first overcome resistance from the partys highest decision-making body, the Central Committee.
Failed no-confidence motion
When the SLFPs Central Committee met following the failed motion of no-confidence, there was a strong sentiment that the party should quit the government and then let the UNP form a minority government. Only a few opposed this but among them were party heavyweights President Sirisena and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
There has been growing speculation that the group of sixteen- SLFP ministers, deputy ministers, state ministers and the Deputy Speaker- who voted for the motion of no-confidence- will eventually join President Rajapaksas camp and the Joint Opposition (JO).
These MPs have in public refused to comment on such a plan and insist that they will function as an independent opposition group within Parliament while still maintaining their loyalty to the President. However, Rajapaksa has publicly declared that it is only a matter of time before they join the JO and has said that he would warmly welcome them because they are not strangers.
On Monday, SLFP veteran, former party General Secretary and former Minister S. B. Dissanayake said that the group of sixteen was trying to prevail upon the entire Central Committee of the SLFP to take a common stand to leave the government. If the President decides that the SLFP should leave, that will virtually be the decision of the Central Committee, Dissanayake said.
In fact, there have been moves by sections of the JO and the renegade SLFPers to try and wrest the post of Leader of the Opposition from Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan. The JOs rationale is that if a further sixteen SLFP MPs joining its ranks, it would become the single largest opposition group in Parliament- and therefore be entitled to nominate the Leader of the Opposition.
Unfortunately for the JO, this is an argument that has been mooted before. Even now, the JO, which is still an unofficial entity in Parliament, is the single largest opposition group in Parliament. However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has ruled that they are not entitled to nominate the Leader of the Opposition as the party they contested from, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), is still part and parcel of the government.
Cabinet portfolios
Thus for the JOs current plans to nominate the Leader of the Opposition to reach fruition, it must first ensure that all SLFPers leave the government. That, at this point in time, is a tough target to achieve as President Sirisena is quite insistent on carrying the remaining twenty-five SLFP members with him for the rest of the tenure of this government.
The feeling that the UNP should be allowed to form a minority government of its own is not confined to the SLFP. Backbenchers in the UNP too feel the same way and question the leadership as to why they have to burden themselves with the baggage of the SLFP while in government.
The answer to that is that both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are keen to have as many MPs as possible working with the government. It was said that the government lost its two-thirds majority when the sixteen SLFPers defected to the opposition, but the government is optimistic that, with about 130 MPs supporting it, it could even muster a two-thirds majority on an issue-by-issue basis, enlisting the support of the TNA as well as the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
In the coming days, there is a need for much give and take between the UNP and the SLFP in allocating Cabinet portfolios. While there is general agreement that the portfolios currently held by both parties will retain their status quo, some changes are likely with a few ministries changing parties. The Samurdhi Ministry and the Ministry of Public Administration have been earmarked for such changes.
While the government is busy finalising these plans, a declaration about the fate of the Executive Presidency from JO parliamentarian and former Minister Bandula Gunawardena has come under fire from within the JO itself.
Gunawardena, a former Minister of Education who once infamously proclaimed that a family of four could sustain itself on two thousand and five hundred rupees a month, has expressed his support for the abolition of the Executive Presidency- a move proposed by the JVP which is sponsoring a 20th Amendment to the Constitution to this effect- provided Parliament is dissolved immediately thereafter.
In reality, Gunawardenas support for the concept amounts to nothing because his precondition- that of dissolving Parliament immediately- will never be passed by the current Parliament which has a constitutional mandate to govern until August 2020. Nevertheless, his comments have raised a hornets nest with some sections of the JO opposing the idea.
In the extremely unlikely event that the abolition of the Executive Presidency becomes a reality before 2020, the JO would stand to gain, though. That is because there would then be no barrier for its leader, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead its campaign.
Next presidential election
At present, Rajapaksa cannot run for President again and there is speculation that his brother, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa will be the JO candidate at the next presidential election. The younger Rajapaksa would, of course, have to run as the nominee from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the newly set up political party of the JO which recently emerged victorious at the local government elections.
The SLPP is not the only party which has its sights set on the next presidential elections. General Secretary of the SLFP, Duminda Dissanayake was to proclaim last week that President Maithripala Sirisena would be the SLFPs candidate in the next presidential elections. President Sirisena is the one and the only politician who had the capability to win the 2020 Presidential election and therefore, he would be the indisputable Presidential candidate of the SLFP, Dissanayake said.
That statement is noteworthy because President Sirisena, during his presidential election campaign and on several occasions thereafter has pledged not to run for President again. However, it must also be noted that since those pledges were made, the political landscape in the country has undergone several seismic shifts, the most notable of which is the emergence of a new political entity, the SLPP, loyal to the Rajapaksas, as an alternative to the SLFP.
In such circumstances, it could be argued that the President feels an obligation to run for President, given that his first presidential election campaign was aimed at dislodging the Rajapaksas from power.
If political currents flow in their predicted direction, the presidential contest in 2020 could, for the first time in the countrys history will be a three-way contest- but the glorious uncertainties of politics in Sri Lanka are such that, with some twenty months more for the election, predictions are best avoided.

Good governance with a real meaning
The JVP has proposed a 20th Amendment to the constitution which will centre on the abolition of the executive presidency. In effect to remove the residual power assumed by the president after the 19th Amendment. This follows on the crisis in the government that appeared after the fall of the no-confidence motion in parliament against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The background to this was the open manifestation of a power struggle between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on the basis of different ideologies followed by each of them. This clear difference highlighted the problem of having dual centres of executive power. On the one hand, the president who is directly elected by the people enjoys the position of head of state and head of government. On the other hand, the prime minister who has the support of the substantial majority in parliament is also vested with executive powers.
When President Maithripala Sirisena came out of Mahinda regime, pro-democracy masses believed he came out of communal politics to support non-racist non-communal politics of the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. The possibility of conflict between the president and the prime minister increased when President Sirisena assumed the leadership of the SLFP without condemning the politics of Mahinda era. Thus they are from different political ideologies, as at present. The previous occasion such a situation arose was during the period 2001 to 2004 when President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were compelled to enter into a cohabitation arrangement due to peoples mandates being received by them at two separate elections. However, in the beginning, both of them had somewhat a common position on the Tamil national problem. This changed and Chandrika agreed to a coalition with the JVP that opposed any discussions on power sharing! On that occasion too, the relationship was never smooth and finally conflictual and culminated in the sudden dismissal of the Wickremesinghe government in 2004 by the President. On this occasion, President Sirisena was prevented from sacking Prime Minister Wickremesinghe due to the 19th Amendment which took away this presidential power.
Previous regime
Increasingly many are looking for whats the worst thing this Government has done With glittering eyes, one could make a long list and shake it many times, until getting the attention of the fascistic political centre led by Rajapaksa. One could also do a compare-and-contrast exercise with the first three years of the previous regime and play that familiar game of suppressing the good done by the Yahapalanaya, inflating the bad and expect attention of newly promoted great leader Gotabhaya. It would be hard to deny, however, that among the good things this Government has done the best is to turn Good Governance into a popular word with a real meaning. People saw with their eyes how fascistic attacks on Muslims were contained and rapidly confidence was build among communities. Muslims were critical at the beginning but supported Ranil Wickremesinghe in that moment of challenge.
In ten years time, how Yahapalanaya became a word in popular culture would be an excellent thesis topic for a political science postgraduate in any university. That unwritten thesis is known! The results of the recently concluded local government election proved that unlike in 83, this time, in spite of more organised Maha Sohon activities, Pohottuwa of Mahinda lost the racist credibility. The verdict was clear: not only are you people not serious about coming back, you are also utterly incompetent fascistic jokers. What happened next was a negative vote of no confidence if ever there was one. The incompetence, nepotism, corruption, abuse of state resources and buttressing of the system of political patronage of Mahinda regime, again became the popular topic and new anti-corruption laws were accepted by popular masses with cheers. This is all too evident. It has come to a point where it is utterly hilarious when diehard racists attack the regime of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Some talk about the dark days of the previous regime, knowing very well that many in this government were part of that regime or that some were part of regimes as bad or worse. However, all those bad things cannot be compared to racist fascistic actions of the Mahinda regime; which were condemned by the entire civilized world.
Peace agreement
It is also natural when some of those who take issue with the way things were before January 2015 were quite supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe for making a peace agreement with Velupillai Prabhakaran and even wanted to let the latter to rule Tamil homeland in a regional government appointed by the Lankan government. Only an idiot can say that is allowing bunch of terrorists to rule one-third of the island and control two-thirds of the coastline.
It is certainly not funny when Ranil Wickremesinghe supporters take umbrage at certain ministers supporting the vote of no confidence against the Prime Minister and invoke the notion of collective responsibility. It is serious that is why President Maithripala Sirisena made them resign and avoided further embarrassment.
If the majority party in the parliament has not got an overall majority in the parliament, there is a problem. It is natural to seek a combination with others, who are close in ideology. It is the tradition now for the new party to demand portfolios and this is the reality the Prime Minister has to face. They could put it all down to political culture, but they would be hard-pressed to deny that it was deliberate, to script a clause into the 19th Amendment to get around the limit to Cabinet size promised in manifesto and preamble in the amendment itself. Pragmatic actions cannot in any way cut across the faith and commitment to good governance.

Government fulfills 35% of  2018 budget proposals
The government has fulfilled nearly 35% of its 2017 Budget proposals (promises,) said Verit Research in their online platform created to monitor the budget promises.
Overall, compared to the first six months, the government has done relatively well, said Nilangika Fernando, an Assistant Analyst at Verite Research and that they have found that the government had kept about one-third of its budget promises.
Verite Research Director Subhashini Abeysinghe said it was important to keep track of budget implementation. Politicians make big promises every November, but its very difficult to track the actual progress of those commitments, she said.
We are allowing the government to deceive the public for political mileage, she said.
Speaking at a Press conference yesterday Verite Research Economic Research Head Subhashini Abeysinghe said that the 22% of proposals spelled out in the budget have made substantial progress.
In addition about a third of the promises were completed halfway or less, she said. While progress in implementation has been slow, disclosure of information on budget promises has improved.
As at June 2017, the progress of 51% of budget promises was unknown. By the end of 2017, however, this number had fallen to 11 percent. This drop is a significant improvement on the willingness of the government to share information on the budget.
Budgetpromises.org platform tracks both the governments implementation of 2017 budget promises and the availability of information on progress. It does this by asking two simple questions about the government budget: Are they doing what they are saying And are they saying what they are doing Every November, the government makes promises to the public in the form of budget proposals. These proposals are debated widely and given a lot of attention at the time and we trace them by this website .

Healthy skincare habits
We all want a glowing, healthy complexion, and now you dont have to go to a spa or change everything in your routine to get it. Follow these three mantras meticulously to find yourself sporting fresh, clean and healthy skin every day.
SLEEP WELL
Beauty sleep is real. When you are sleep-deprived, with less than 7-8 hours of sleep a day, you will need a team of make-up artists to look gorgeous. Dark circles under the eyes are just one of the effects of lack of sleep  raccoon eyes, or what they call periorbital hyperpigmentation.
EAT WELL
You truly are what you eat. Eating right and exercising regularly goes a long way in maintaining a healthy complexion. Clean eating habits are reflected in the most beautiful way on your clear radiant skin. Eating brightly-coloured fruits, vegetables, and other good foods like blueberries and pomegranates are a great way to help your skin exude health from within. Check out Foods that feed your skin for some really good foods to incorporate into your diet.
DESTRESS
Keeping stress at bay is an important form of protection for the health of your skin. Chronic tension and physical stress causes surges of cortisol in the body, a hormone that can break down collagen and elastin, ultimately leading to wrinkles.
Stress can also worsen certain skin conditions, so find your zen zone and relax.
EXFOLIATE
Exfoliation is extra important because it helps shed the dead skin cells that build on the surface, and helps your skin glow. Exfoliation also helps increase the absorption of any topical moisturisers or products you are applying to your skin, so that you can really feel the benefit, and are able to show it off too!

Healthy start for the day !
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, or so goes the old adage. Today in our fast-paced lives we are cutting corners at every turn to save some time and one of these often cut corners during the morning rush happens to be this mist important meal breakfast.
As we rush out of the doors with our kids to drop them off at school they tend to skip breakfast doing more damage to them than good. Research done in the country shows that most children are either breakfast skippers or they run off to school with just a cup of tea which cannot be taken as a meal.
Many cross-sectional findings have suggested that breakfast skipping is associated with a higher body weight. Breakfast gives kids the energy to start their day, and it improves learning and behavior as well. And now new research shows that it can also help keep them at a healthy weight. When your kids skip breakfast, they tend to be so hungry by snack or lunch time that they overeat which leads to obesity.
Studies in other countries also show that skipping breakfast could influence weight gain through increased appetite and the consumption of energy-dense foods. A 2013 study of 625 children, conducted by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic, found that the children who ate a bowl of cereal every morning were less likely to be obese or overweight than children who skipped breakfast. According to research published in the International Journal of Pediatric Obesity that was published in 2009, high meal frequency is correlated with a lower weight among children. A study published in Pediatric Obesity in March 2016 even found that children who skipped breakfast were twice as likely to be overweight than kids who ate two breakfasts.
So if you want to set your child up for a healthy future, make sure they eat breakfast every single day. It can be as simple as a bowl of cereal or a slice of toast with peanut butter as long as it's breakfast.
Here are some breakfast ideas
First, the traditional ones:
eggs
French toast, waffles, or pancakes (try wheat or whole-grain varieties)
cold cereal and milk
hot cereal, such as oatmeal or cream of wheat (try some dried fruit or
nuts on top)
whole-grain toast
yogurt with fruit or nuts
fruit smoothie
And now some weird (but yummy) ones:
banana dog (peanut butter, a banana, and raisins in a long
whole-grain bun)
breakfast taco (shredded cheese on a tortilla, folded in half and
microwaved)country cottage cheese (apple butter mixed with cottage
cheese)
fruit and cream cheese sandwich (use strawberries or other fresh fruit)
sandwich  grilled cheese, peanut butter and jelly, or another
favourite leftovers

India Coca-Cola beverage reported big sales jump in 2018 Q1
Beverages major Coca-Cola is witnessing a strong growth momentum in India, especially in the sparkling drinks segment, with a positive start to the year. The company, which released its global quarterly earnings on Tuesday, said that growth in India and China in the January-March period outpaced more developed markets such as Japan and Australia.
Talking about its performance in the Asia-Pacific region, Coca-Cola said, Unit case volume growth of 5 per cent for the quarter was driven by strong performance in China and India, (which was) partially offset by a low single-digit decline in South-East Asia.
Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners.
The US-based beverage major also said that the sparkling soft drink portfolio witnessed a double-digit volume growth in India. The company witnessed a favourable product mix in the Asia-Pacific region as sparkling soft drinks grew volume double digits in China and India, it said in a statement. James Quincey, President and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company, said: Were encouraged with our first quarter performance as we continue our evolution as a consumer-centric, total beverage company. On an investor call, he said India and China helped accelerate the companys topline growth. Coca-Cola India has been witnessing strong revenue and volume growth since the second half of 2017, after facing growth pangs for several quarters due to the challenging macro-economic conditions such as demonetisation, GST and lower rural demand.

Indonesia oil well explosion kills 15, dozens injured
INDONESIA: The death toll from an illegal oil well blaze in Indonesia has jumped to 15 with dozens injured, authorities said Wednesday, warning that there could be more victims of the explosion.
Images from the accident showed a towering flame shooting some 70 metres (230 feet) in the air above homes and palm trees dotting a small community in Sumatra islands Aceh province.
Firefighters on Wednesday afternoon were still battling the blaze sparked by an oil spill at about 1:30 am on Tuesday in a residential area. Several homes were also destroyed.
The number of fatalities now stands at 15 people, said Syahrizal Fauzi, head of the local disaster mitigation agency.
Were still unable to control the fire. We dont know if there are still victims because we cannot get any closer. Authorities initially said at least 10 people died and some 40 severely injured victims were being treated. The jump in the death toll was from the subsequent deaths of five victims who had been rushed to hospital, authorities said.
There was a group of people digging in the old well but suddenly a huge fire was sparked and it exploded, said national police spokesman Setyo Wasisto.
The victims were collecting oil from around the entrance of a wellbore when the blaze erupted, police said.
It was not known how much oil was spilled or what ignited the fire, but authorities suggested a lit cigarette as a possible cause.
There were many people there who were smoking, Wasisto said.
Its a village so many were scrambling to get oil and it was crowded, he added. East Aceh is dotted with numerous small-scale oil mining operations, which are often run illegally by local villagers. There are reportedly tens of thousands of such wells across the Southeast Asian archipelago. Abandoned oil wells are sometimes re-tapped while locals also drill into fresh sites to find new sources. - AFP

Industry leaders bullish on  the potential of LNG Market
The future outlook of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is a bullish one, according to industry leaders who spoke at the inaugural Sea Asia LNG Forum yesterday.
The leaders also shared a general consensus that Singapore, in particular, is set to benefit from the growth of this market.
The LNG Forum 2018 is a Sea Asia conference organised by UBM (Seatrade) and the Singapore Maritime Foundation.
Speakers at the forum noted the significant potential of the LNG market in the long-run. Some predicts that for Singapore, the city-state will flourish in is its role as a service centre for LNG, especially with a large number of LNG ships expected to go onstream and eventually requiring to drydocked each year. During the Shipping and Regasification Markets and Developments session, Mr Peter Fitzpatrick, Vice President, Global Marine at ABS commented, Singapore is a growth market because LNG ships require reliable, on-time delivery from drydocking, a service Singapore has been providing and will continue to do so. We see LNG overhaul as a growth area for Singapore, and not just drydocking, but major modifications work with a number of significant projects on LNG vessels being undertaken here in the yards.
When it comes to LNG as marine fuel, while the likes of CMA CGM, parent of Singapore-headquartered APL, have made a game-changing order for LNG-fuelled Ultra-Large Containerships, there is still work to be done on providing the bunkering infrastructure on a global scale.
Nicolas Sartini, Chief Executive Officer of APL (APL is a subsidiary of CMA CGM Group), highlighted during the Fireside Chat session: In order for the LNG market to grow across the region and elsewhere including China and the U.S., it is very important to have the proper bunkering infrastructure in place.
According to other speakers, this infrastructure includes having the appropriate bunkering facilities, a multi-user terminal that has open access to ensure the effective distribution of LNG, and proper risk and safety training for crew members. The launch of the seventh edition of Sea Asia also took place as part of the LNG Forum. Mr Chris Hayman, Chairman of Seatrade UBM EMEA, shared in his speech how discussions such as those that took place at the LNG Forum will be continued at next years Sea Asia.
Sea Asia 2019 will be the anchor event during Singapore Maritime Week next year.
Next years event will take place against the background of an industry in transformation. This includes the transformation in regulation as the industry prepares to meet an unprecedented wave of rule making, both global and regional, touching complex problems such as fuel quality and CO2 emissions.
We look forward to welcoming some of the bigger names in the industry at Sea Asia next year and once again, establish the event as the leading platform for debate and discussions on key industry issues, said Mr Hayman.

A land left behind
Something is stirring in Mullaitivu.
For years, this corner of northern Sri Lanka was a stronghold for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The LTTE had its own police here, its own courts. Its leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, had a house and a fortified bunker in Puthukkudiyiruppu, the areas bustling little commercial centre.
A whole generation of young people in the Mullaitivu district today lived for longer under the LTTE administration than the Sri Lankan governments.
Mullaitivu was also the site of the LTTEs last stand in its war against the armed forces in 2009. It was here that an estimated 100,000 civilians sought shelter from the fighting on a 3-square kilometre strip of sand in the middle of the crossfire. A UN report described the final months there as reminiscent of hell.
But nearly a decade since the end of the war, many scars have not healed.
Drive around Mullaitivu and you hear rumblings of discontent, not just with the government but with the Tamil National Alliance, the party that people here have traditionally supported overwhelmingly.
Theyre angry that promises like the release of lands from the military and answers about disappeared people remain unfulfilled, and they blame the politicians who are supposed to represent them.
This frustration showed in the February local elections when a new political force staged something of a small coup in Puthukkudiyiruppu.
Formed just 45 days before the vote, and completely independent of any political party, a group calling itself Mattathukkana Ilajooir Amaipu, or the Youth Movement for Change, won 4 seats on the 22-seat Pradeshiya Sabha.
The TNA has lost its way, said T. Nithiyananthan, the chairperson of the Youth Movement for Changes guiding committee. In the last election, the top-level leaders, they did not even come to Mullaitivu.
Mattathukkana Ilajooir Amaipu is now running its own candidate in the upcoming elections for the Northern Provincial Council.
And they think theyll win, hitting the same sorts of issues they ran on for the Puthukkudiyiruppu local council.
Its a small shift, in a small town in the countrys Northern Province, but it could be a sign of things to come.
We are quietly doing something here, Nithiyananthan said.
Brewing discontent
You cant miss the legacy of the war in Mullaitivu. Shattered houses still stand between Palmyrah trees, and caravans of soldiers bump along the roads, shuttling between the many military camps around the district.
According to a data analysis by the Adayalaam Centre for Policy Research, about 60,000 Sri Lankan Army troops are currently stationed in the Mullaitivu District. Thats about 25 percent of the active military personnel in the whole country.
In front of the Pilakkudijiruppu Air Force Base outside of Mullaitivu town, a group of families has set up a makeshift tent.
On a recent morning, Arumogam Velayuda Pillai, 51, said he had been protesting outside the military base for 411 days.
Were not asking for anything other than our own land, he said.
Pillai said he and his family fled their home on December 26, 2008, during the Armys final offensive. When they returned in 2012 from an IDP camp, they found the road to their home closed off by a gate, and their access blocked by military officers.
They were resettled on a small piece of land across the road. But Pillai said it doesnt compare to their ancestral home.
We had the lagoon on one side, and paddy fields on the other. We had coconuts and all other resources, he said, gesturing to the land beyond the gate. But here, we dont have anything  now we have to buy (coconuts) from the shop, while the Sri Lankan military is picking ours.
Pillai is angry at the military for occupying land that he says is rightfully his. But hes equally mad at the politicians who have promised to get it back for him, and havent delivered.
Almost all the members of the TNA weve talked to have given their promise to get these lands back, he said. They are saying we are talking with the government. But so far they didnt achieve anything, and they didnt give us anything.
He paused to let the point sink in.
So these days we are untrustworthy about our own representatives also, he said.
On the other side of town, in another protest tent, a group of women sits waiting for answers about their lost loved ones.
Mariyasuresh Isswary, 42, is the District Coordinator of the Association for the Enforced Disappeared Mullaitivu. She lost her husband in March 2009. She said the Red Cross told her that he was arrested by the Sri Lankan military, but she hasnt received any information since.
Ten years we dont know if our husbands are alive or not, she said. Only once we know can we move on and plan for our lives, to choose to re-marry or to move on in some way.
Like Pillai who is protesting for his land back, Isswary feels betrayed by her elected representatives.
She said that the recently established Office of Missing Persons, which is the governments solution to their problem and largely supported by the TNA, was inadequate.
Our own Tamil representatives may say that we can trust the OMP and work with that, she said. But she said the fact that the body doesnt have powers of prosecution, and that some of its members come from the Colombo elite and the military, makes her feel that its a play to the international community.
We trusted (the TNA), and thats why we voted for them, but nowadays they are not seriously addressing our aspirations in the Parliament, or in the international arena, she said.
Peter Illancheliyan, the Youth Head
of TNA Mullaitivu.
We are suffering a lot sitting here in this tent all the time, she added. Theres always dust. Even when we cook, there is dust in the food. But TNA members are our representatives, and they are travelling in AC vehicles and have a luxurious life.
They are not genuinely and truly addressing our issues, she said.
This growing wave of discontent is not lost on local TNA politicians.
Look, I dont say that the TNA is doing wonders, said Peter Illancheliyan, the Youth Head of TNA Mullaitivu. I accept that the TNA is not working properly in some areas.
But he largely defended the TNAs political manoeuvring, especially on issues related to the land release.
The army recently returned 133 acres of land in the Keppapulavu area, which Illancheliyan said the TNA was instrumental in securing.
We protested in Keppapulavu, and as a result, we got a victory, he said.
But he acknowledged the complaints like those of the families of the missing, who said they felt their voices werent heard.
We cant tell everything to the people, he said. We need to do some things technically. There may be some secrets. It doesnt mean that our leaders are not working properly for our people.
He said the nuances of deal-making, especially in Colombo, made it hard to be fully transparent.
Its not a good idea to oppose the government all the time, but rather we need to handle these matters in a soft manner, he said. He pointed out that the Joint Opposition criticizes the current government for being too close with the TNA, which energizes their base in the south.
We cant do everything in a straightforward way, he said.
Despite the independent groups recent electoral victory, Illancheliyan said he doesnt feel threatened by other Tamil political groups.
They are policy-less parties, he said. They can be a challenge in elections, but when it comes to a solution to the ethnic problem, there wont be a big challenge.
Organising a new opposition
They disagree.
The leaders of the Youth Movement for Change say they think the TNA is vastly underestimating how angry their base is.
We got around 4,500 votes without spending anything, said Nithiyananthan, the groups chairperson.
Before they formed the Youth Movement for Change, the individual members of the groups steering committee were part of a social media network that organised charity works around Mullaitivu. In the past, theyve raised money to donate sewing machines to war widows, and bicycles for children.
He said it was clear to them on the ground that the TNA was losing support.
Nowadays, theyre career politicians. They only think about their own future, he said. If anyone wants to come up from the ground, they try to undercut them.
So Nithiyananthan, a former TNA voter himself, said he decided it was time to take a new path.
The thought was that if a new party wasnt going to emerge for them, they might as well make one themselves, he said.
They campaigned on basic issues, like education, development, and clean drinking water, and offered party membership to anyone who was interested regardless of age or caste. They also spoke bluntly about drug abuse, military occupation, and past atrocities.
When they won four seats, for the community and the public, it was a surprise, he said. But it wasnt for us.
Nithiyananthan said they were now talking to Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran about forming a coalition to contest the provincial council elections. The TNA said recently that it would not nominate Wigneswaran, who they see as a renegade, for the post again.
For so many years, we have relied on one particular party, or one particular symbol, for our vote, said K A Aputharajah, 68, a former lawyer and the Youth Movement for Changes candidate for the upcoming provincial elections.
Its not easy to come away from that particular identity, he added. We hope that in the future, we will get even better results than this election.
To stay or to go
Yet even as the politicians strategize, the lives of the people in Mullaitivu go on. About three weeks ago some fishermen were arrested for protesting a Navy base that they say cut off their access to the Nanthi Kadal lagoon, their traditional fishing ground.
We are not against the ordinary business of the government, said R.B.S. Sanmugalingam, 51, one of the fishermen. But this lagoon is a great resource. If the military is going to disturb this fishing, then it will affect the whole economy.
If we cant access it, well just protest again and again, said S N Senthuirselvan, 42. Fishing is all we know.

Magic memories: An apple a day has never been easy
I had the good fortune to pick an apple in a verdant orchard in the Granite Belt in Australia on my sojourn there a few days ago.
The literature written on apples is vast. In our early days of language acquisition, we as children were parroting An apple a day keeps the doctor away. Now I often wonder, other than medicinal and curative powers of the apple whether our colonial masters were in an all-out attempt to establish the apple market in our tiny island in their usual subtle manner. Even though the very fruit has added much knowledge to our horizon in appealing proverbs like An apple never falls far from the tree., to mean a child usually behaves in a similar way to his or her parents. The apple of ones eye. It means a person or thing that is loved more than any other. When we find two people or things are quite different from each other we say Apples and oranges. Apple could be used to teach a very good idiom. Upset the apple cart is used to say in good English to describe a situation that causes problems for somebody or spoil their plans or arrangements. A well- versed teacher in a school classroom could always apply his or her knowledge of proverbs to arrest the downward trend of moral decay of the society in a very productive manner. The apple is a very delicious fruit that titillates the taste buds of the children. This round fruit with a shiny red or green skin with a firm white flesh is definitely a treat to our palates. Adams apple seems to have dropped from our modern teachers because of their lackadaisical approach to English teaching in an innovative way. It refers to the lump at the front of the throat that sticks out, particularly in men, and moves up and down when you swallow. I had the good fortune to taste an apple pie on my recent sojourn in Australia where apple is grown in abundance. An apple pie is a very palatable sweet made by baking apple in a dish with pastry on the bottom, sides and top. Yet, it is used as an idiom to represent an idea of perfect home life and comfort. In a nutshell, the teachers of English could exploit the childrens interest in apples to create interest in learning Queens Lingo with renewed interest by bringing an apple to the English teaching classroom.Dear English teachers, why dont you give a try
A sign board in the wine country of the Granite Belt in Australia says an apple a day has never been easy
That sign board caught my eye because my love for apple stirred my mind a lot. The excitement made by the above sentence on mewas soon on my childrens radar. Our carnival vehicle was stopped by my son in- law just behind a fruitful apple tree as you see in the picture. A red letter day in my life!
Apples fill the coffers in Australia and generate employment for the people there not in uncertain terms. The apple orchard that we stepped into was really a fruitful treat to the eye. I forgot everything as it stole my mind. In Australia one couldbuy a big boxful of very fresh apples just from the tree between 7-10 dollars.
Apple growers tale has not been rosy all the time. The climate changes, market behaviour, grave competition from the new competitors from other apple growing countries, dearth of labour, barrenness of the soil due to long term cultivation, diseases and other related problems have at times put them on the lurch. I met a badly affected apple grower in the WINE COUNTRY where apple is grown in abundance. His grievances were vey poignant. Unexpected rain had ruined his apple wealth. He had lost his bread and butter. He showed me a huge heap of rotten apples, a heart rendering scene. He was about to cry. Yet, the apple growing areas in Australia is a treat to the eye because of greenery and the huge fruit processing juice factories scattered in verdant cultivations. The mesmerizing sweetness of the fresh apples would make an everlasting impression in the visitor to an apple orchard, but the sweat of the apple grower is another diatribe to be listened to.

Elaborating on their trade Fazal said, In Sri Lanka most of the jewellery with stones are made of 14 or 16 karat gold but we are using only 18 karat soft gold and even 18+ since we are exporting to UK.
Moreover, we use palladium instead of yellowy for making white gold jewellery. Mineral Gem & Jewellery is currently exporting their products to high end markets such as London, Paris and Swiss. Fazal said, It is actually encouraging to have received such a prestigious award. It adds more light to our jewellery and satisfaction to our hard work.In addition to minerals gem & Jewellery they run the Place Vendome, Leyn Baan Villa and Cafe Hula Hula in Gall Fort.
Minerals Gem & Jewellery is moving forward as a tourist attraction not only because Sri Lankan gems are the best souvenirs for visitors to take home but because of the craftsmanship they exhibit in making finer exclusive unique designs.

Minister hails media restraint during Kandy incidents
There are inadequacies in the police force, but considering the huge tasks they are vested with, they are doing a great service to the country. Hence, they need the assistance of the media to give them feedback on their actions and the changes that need to be taken to improve themselves. The government increased the salaries of the police by 40 percent, said Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
Referring to the reports that there is tension between the police and the police commission, he said there are always differences of opinion, but there are specific functions that are assigned to each institution and despite the differences, these two institutions need to work together to provide the best service to the country.
He appealed to the media to report facts and refrain from reporting issues that cause friction and to refrain from sensationalising incidents. He appreciated the manner in which the media acted in connection with the incidents in Kandy recently. Therefore he called on the media to verify facts with the police prior to reporting, in order to take the right message to the people.
Joining the media briefing held last Tuesday, the Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara said the police and media alike are services to the nation. He said as such both need to work according to a national agenda and not our personal agendas. Similarly, he said if the media reports are based on the agendas of certain parties or groups, then we will not be able to meet this national duty.
He said that if a police officer commits an offence, then the media needs to point it out and criticise him, but it should not be done as a personal vendetta. The media have a responsibility to report, having studied the whole story, rather than highlighting a certain section that creates issues and tarnishes the image of the police as a whole. Every member of the police is an individual and the institution as a whole should not be brought down due to the actions of a handful.
The police force is a key institution that is responsible for the preservation of law and order in the country and it has a huge responsibility. Today the police have a huge responsibility in dealing with crimes, especially drug rings and the underworld. It is not an easy task and police officers put their lives on the line every single day. Hence, yes, the media should highlight the wrongdoings of the police if it happens, but not in a manner that would bring the whole police department to disrepute, he said.
However, he said there are certain weaknesses and failures of the police, but the police department is involved in every aspect of peoples lives from the birth certificate to the death certificate and every matter within. However, whether the police meet all these expectations is a matter to be questioned and I do admit that the performance of the police is not up to expected standards. However, I intend to rectify these deficiencies and make the police force more efficient, he assured. He said that in some areas the police officers have to work under very difficult conditions without even the most basic facilities. Under these circumstances, how can you expect them to perform at their best Hence, we have taken measures to provide the police officers with all facilities that are required in order to have them perform to their best by providing them training, facilities and measures needed for their personal development, said the IGP.

One-third of budget promises fulifilled in 2017 - Verit Research
The government kept about a third of its budget promises last year, an analysis by Colombo-based Verit Research found.
The private think tank said that the progress was a marked improvement over where budget implementation stood half a year ago.
Overall, compared to the first six months, the government has done relatively well, said, Verit Research Assistant Analyst Nilangika Fernando.
She was speaking at a press conference at the Sri Lanka Press Institute yesterday. But the general lack of implementation of signature budget promises is a persistent problem, she added. Its not an issue of one government.
Verit tracked 37 major budget promises over the course of 2017, amounting to about Rs. 117 billion.
According to official documents Verit obtained through correspondence and requests under the Right to Information Act, eight percent of those commitments have been fulfilled, and 22 percent have made substantial progress. Another 24 percent are partially completed, and 11 percent have made poor progress. Twenty-four percent, like the promise of establishing and Export-Import Bank, were broken.
In terms of transparency, Verit said the most responsive government agencies were the Information and Communication Technology Agency, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry, the National Budget Department, and the Presidential Secretariat. Verit Research Director Subhashini Abeysinghe said it was important to keep track of budget implementation. Politicians make big promises every November, but its very difficult to track the actual progress of those commitments, she said.

Remembering MJM Lafir on his 36th death anniversary
Sri Lanka's first world title winner M.J.M. Lafir will be remembered on his 36th death anniversary which falls today (April 26). Lafir won the first world title for the country with victory in the World Amateur Billiards Championship in Bombay, in November-December 1973.
He was victorious against all his opponents and also scored the highest break of 859. It is an achievement without parallel in the annals of sports in Sri Lanka. Prior to this pinnacle of his success, Lafir had participated in international championships in Billiards and Snooker in Edinburgh, Scotland, Malta, and Auckland since 1970, but had not won any of them.
At the World Snooker tournament in Edinburgh, Scotland, in Oct-Nov 1970, Lafir defeated I L Glozier (NZ), Paul Mifsud (Malta), John Clint (N Ireland), D Sneddon (Scotland), but lost to John Phillips (Scotland) and Sidney Hood (England).
At the World Amateur Billiards Championships in Valeta, Malta, in Nov 1971, Lafir finished fourth defeating D Sneddon (Scotland), Paul Mifsud (Malta), Lance Napper (New Zealand) and lost to Manuel Fransisco (South Africa) in the preliminary rounds.
In Nov-Dec 1972, at the World Open Billiards Championship, held in Auckland, New Zealand, in which professionals as well as amateurs participated, Lafir lost to Clark McConachy (New Zealand), Eddie Charlton (Australia), Paddy Morgan (Ireland), Satish Mohan (India), Leslie Driffield (England) and Michael Ferreira (India) but won against C Everton (Wales), Jim Fryer (England), Kinsley Kennerly (England) and Jack Karneham (England). He failed to qualify for the final round.
So, it was in 1973 that he finally reached the pinnacle of his career by winning the World Amateur Billiards Championship in Bombay. He defeated Clive Everton (Wales), Michael Ferreira (India), LU Demarco (Scotland), Alfred Nolan (England), Satish Mohan (India), Eric Simons (New Zealand), Brian Kirkness (New Zealand), Phil Tarrant (Australia), and Paul Mifsud (Malta) and wrote his name in world spot, especially billiards.
On his return to Sri Lanka, after winning the World Amateur Billiard Championship, he was given a red-carpet welcome on Dec 22 1973. He was received and garlanded at the airport by the Sports & Parliamentary Affairs Minister K.B Ratnayake, Minister of Finance Dr N.M Perera, Minister of Education Dr Badiuddin Mahmud, Minister of Transport Leslie Gunawardena, Deputy Speaker IA Cader, Sir Razik Fareed and officials of the Cue Association and members of MICH. Lafir and his wife, Misriya, were conducted in a long motorcade from the airport through the more populous streets of Colombo where large crowds gathered to welcome him home and cheer his victory. He was given a rousing welcome at the MICH Fort. He also paid a courtesy visit, and met Governor General William Gopallawa, and Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, both of whom received him with right royal cordiality. The Colombo Municipal Council accorded him a civic reception in his honor on Dec 31, 1973 with Mayor Vincent Perera.
In January 1974 he was given a grand welcome in Kandy, and an exhibition billiard game was played between him and MSU Mohideen at the Trinity College hall on the table borrowed from Kandy Garden Club. The people who organized this match were Chandra Wijenayake, A.M.I.N. Marikar, Dr. C.D.L. Fernando. M.E. Marikar, A.C.M. Faleel, E.W. Balasuriya and Simon Marawanagoda.
MJM Lafir was born on May 27, 1930 at St. Joseph's Street, Grandpas would have been lost in the "desert air" of Hulftsdorp but for two happenings. He joined MICH (Moors Islamic Cultural Home) in 1947 and played for them in their regular friendly games with other clubs and the founding of the Ceylon Amateur Billiards Association in 1948. Lafir was grateful to the MICH for discovering, nurturing and grooming him for big time billiards. He was well backed by late M.M. Thawfeeq, the first secretary of the Ceylon Amateur Billiards Association for providing the opportunity to play against visiting champions and to go overseas for international competitions. Though he was unafraid of facing the cue greats on the table he had one handicap that was his lack of adequate knowledge of the English Language, which would have helped him to familiarize and mix with the other players in tournaments. He however managed to master the language so well that he soon began to joke and nag his opponents on the international field and won their hearts. The launch pad for many of Lafir's triumphs overseas and boosting Sri Lanka's image overseas was provided by the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who presented him with a cheque for Rs. 100 which started the fund to send Lafir overseas to train and play with world champions.
Lafir reigned supreme for 24 years between 1949 and 1973, he annexed the National Billiards title of Sri Lanka 16 times and the National Snooker title on 15 separate occasions. He was not satisfied; he went across to India and won their National Snooker title on seven occasions from 1956 to 1976, defeating some of the best Indian stalwarts. Lafir's achievements were commendable to Sri Lanka at that time. The Colombo Municipal Council re-named Messenger Street, as M.J.M. Lafir Mawatha, as a tribute to his contribution to the cue game. He passed away on April 26 1981, a month before his 51st birthday.

Road to IELTS
British Council and Clarity English have collaborated to develop an online preparation and practice resource for the IELTS. This online tool was launched for the first time in Sri Lanka on April 14 exclusively through the British Council IELTS Registration centre network. The Road to IELTS programme is designed to enable test takers to perform to the best of their capabilities and can be accessed from anywhere using desktops, tablets and soon mobile phones as well.
Road to IELTS Institutional version is a comprehensive and up-to-date practice resource aimed at tackling the challenges faced by IELTS candidates. It comprises of four key resources for each skill area, beginning with an eBook which introduces each paper and explains task types. Further resources include advice and tutorial videos by experts, a practice zone, and test practice, where candidates simulate the test experience with mock tests.
IELTS is the International English Language Testing System, the worlds most popular English language proficiency test for higher education and global migration with over 3 million tests taken in the last year. Over 10,000 organisations trust and accept IELTS as a secure, valid and reliable indicator of true to life ability to communicate in English for education, immigration and professional accreditation. IELTS is jointly owned by British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and Cambridge English Language Assessment.
The British Council emphasises and understands the importance of IELTS for students aiming to study abroad. As explained by registered IELTS examiner and Managing Director of Clarity English, Andrew Stokes, Typically, overseas students accept an offer of a university place about six months before the academic year begins. However, most will not take their IELTS test until three months later, and inevitably a certain percentage fails to achieve the band score required for the course. Failing at the IELTS can drastically affect ones future.
Clarity English is a developer of tech-based learning materials for English and the recipient of the English-Speaking Union Innovation Award and the HKICT Award for Technical Excellence (Best Product) for Road to IELTS. Established in 1994, its relationship with British Council spans over 20 projects. British Council and ClarityEnglish also co-publish other IELTS support resources in addition to Road to IELTS.
With Road to IELTS, effective test preparation and teacher support extends beyond the classroom. The program is devised to mark students work and provide feedback on individual performance as well. According to Dr Victoria Clark of the British Council, Depending on motivation and talent, a student can raise their level of English by half to one IELTS band score in three months if they put in enough work.
Since its inception, Road to IELTS has concluded more than 4 million sessions and is utilized by more than 1,000 schools globally. A survey of 130,000 users of Road to IELTS determined that those who use it the most improve by as much as 52%.
Our IELTS Registration centre network, spans across the country. Many of them offer IELTS preparation support to test candidates and we are keen to support the partner network with quality tools for IELTS preparation. We understand that preparation is key to get desired results at the test, said Simon Creasey, Country Exams Manager British Council at the launch.
The resource comprises of more than 300 interactive exercises, 36 individual practice tests, and 24 advice videos. Road to IELTS has several features, including a countdown clock, an IELTS score calculator, a timer for exam practice, and downloadable study sheets. The My Progress function enables students to monitor performance, analyse their use of time, compare performance with other online users, and even predict band scores in the Reading and Listening tests using an interactive widget.
The Road to IELTS institutional version will enable IELTS teachers to prepare test candidates better. The tool will complement the class room and bring in further professionalism to the IELTS teachers who work with us through our partner network, said Dileepa Manawadu, Head of Business Development UK qualifications at the launch.
IELTS test is administered by the British Council in multiple locations in Colombo, Kandy, Jaffna, Galle, Matara, Negombo, Kurunegala and Batticaloa. IELTS candidates who takes the test at a British Council test centre receives a wide range of free preparation support from library access, seminars and practice books in addition to a 30-hour preparation course.

## Title: Shocks and surprises from the 2018 Cannes lineup

Shocks and surprises from the 2018 Cannes lineup
Love it or hate it, the Cannes Film Festival exists in a class of its own, and the newly announced 2018 program is no exception. The 10-day event on the cusp of the French Riviera finds thousands of people from the international film community crowding into a small strip of land known as the Croisette, where revered auteurs compete for attention in the majestic Palais des Festivals, while photographers crowd the red carpet alongside an ocean of tuxedos and sparkling gowns. This years program reflects that frenzied process. While many familiar names stand out, there are a few surprises as well.
Netflix isnt the onlyabsent distributor
Netflix faced a challenging proposition with Cannes, which demands that all films in its competition must receive a theatrical release in France. Whether or not that winds up the case for the 17 competition films unveiled so far, the bulk of this years titles face an uncertain future in U.S. theaters.
So far, there are only three films in competition with American distributors: A24s Under the Silver Lake from It Follows director David Robert Mitchell, Focus Features Spike Lee drama BlacKkKlansman, and Cold War, the latest from Oscar-winning Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski (Ida), which was acquired by Amazon Studios last year.
Two Americans could win the Palme
American movies usually dont dominate Cannes competition, and this years no exception. In a repeat of last years outcome, there are two American films in competition. Mitchells movie, Under the Silver Lake, runs a whopping two hours and 20 minutes and follows Andrew Garfield in a loopy detective story that has been described as equal parts Chinatown and Mulholland Drive. (Harmony Korines The Beach Bum wasnt ready.)
So where are the women
One of the biggest criticisms that Cannes has faced is the minimal presence of women in the lineup. In its 71-year history, only one woman has won the Palme dOr - Jane Campion, for The Piano in 1993 - and female filmmakers have never dominated the lineup. This year doesnt change that. Cannes has announced three women directors in this years competition, the exact same number as last years section. Fremaux and festival director Pierre Lescure will likely see an even stronger backlash this time around, as the momentum of the #MeToo and Times Up movements continue to highlight gender disparity in the industry.
Lebanese actress-turned-director Nadine Labaki will make her third appearance at Cannes with Capernaum, which explores the daily lives of migrants in Beirut. Italian director Alice Rohrwacher became a breakout filmmaker in Critics Week with her debut Corpo Celeste and followed that up with the irreverent rural drama The Wonders, about a family in the countryside that auditions for a reality show. The third woman in competition will emerge as one of its big discoveries. Eva Hussons sensual Bang Gang (A Modern Love Story) was a breakout at TIFFs Platform section that has gone on to find an international audience on Netflix.
Expect some last minute additions
Fremaux announced a mere 17 films in competition slots, leaving out a lot of major filmmakers who seemed like obvious locks just a matter of weeks ago. (The competition usually clocks in at around 20 titles.) The most anticipated Terry Gilliams The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, a movie that has endured decades of tortured production issues even as has finally been completed with help from Amazon Studios. Most recently, the films May release date was scrapped after former producer Paulo Branco claimed he still had rights to the movie. Fremaux suggested that Don Quixote might still find its way to Cannes.
Solo stands alone
Cannes previously announced that Solo: A Star Wars Story would play at the festival in an out-of-competition slot. That decision arrives after a year in which no big studios brought films to the festival. Some thought that Cannes would make a terrific platform for Oceans Eight, especially since previous Oceans films played at the festival - but the Warner Bros. film seems to be skipping the festival route. That means Solo will stand alone as the sole Hollywood blockbuster at Cannes.

Significant history and friends that matter....our code in the middle
History will record and proudly document another fabulous step up for our game in this standout year for rugby in Sri paradise.
Our intrepid journey to the Commonwealth Games, a stark and unforgettable reminder of the worlds best and where we are in this exclusive club. New Zealand blew the magical Fiji power out of the water and claimed the gold with clinical efficiency.
The Blacks denied Fiji good ball and intimidating defence that tested their spontaneous running skills max in the final.
The Olympic champions unable to express themselves freely and rely on those islanders skills that make them untouchable at times.
Survival against South Africa in the extra time semi ...was probably the energy sap that they didnt need.
Cecil Africa scoring a hat trick of mesmerizing tries that gasped at defending their title.....but not quite enough for the big world final.
The IRB must be grinning from ear to ear, in their big Corp armchairs, as they watch the lucrative numbers for TV viewers bubble up.
Little doubts and mighty compliments to the international Olympic committee for their faith in 7s and grand dimension for this remarkable skill set.
The game is in very good hands and needs islanders like Sri Lanka to really profile up. This is the magical story that has spurred Kenya to stride the world with driving uncontainable power...that makes them top 5 in our world.
What pride for the African continent and a lesson to all who ...like us in Sri ...worship the future with jealous adulation!
Our future is in firm good rugby hands ...but demand that Sri Lanka go wide with the net for natural resources that will make us a force to be counted.
In case the pundits and experts are recoiling in surprise and concern....Sri Lanka used to beat Kenya and Uruguay in 7s ....a testament to islanders natural born talent ...that needs to be genetically re-engineered and circuit linked with max efficiency.
The future for us is not discus and imagine...but to step up and invest big time.
Dreaming beyond our imagination is a grand pathway for us islanders to progress and stimulate that hallowed new dimension.
The future has to be pace strength skill endurance and relentless power.
School rugby is justifiably the most popular sport on this ocean bound island...and not likely to step down anytime soon.
Grab your senses and appreciate the impossible odds that separate the Bradby and places it on that mount of Olympus.
More significant this 2018 is the work ethic and simple efficiency that make Royal such a balanced force in the Singer league.
Trinity need re-thinking and heart to confront the boys in Kandy ...the 1st leg was all Royal and how patient they were for their points.
Opportunities for Trinity were not made easier...by their level of simple mistakes that dominated play for the entire Colombo leg.
For the sake of all fans that embrace this magnificent series that unite Sri Lankan islanders around the world ...we need an aggressive lion at home and silk skills that test Royal and push them in the middle...despite the odds and level of form
Big hand to Royal coaching format and team led by diligent Lewke. Grand indeed to chalk up their new history and raise that performance bar.
Mesmerizing for Peters, Patana, Joes to consider how to match up and raise their skill levels in the middle to challenge the Reid Avenue marauding machine.
Royal have firmly placed one strong hand on that league trophy ...and the Bradby.
Mighty indeed the challenger that contemplates their quest and plans to scale that summit.
All in all ...more magic, more pride and more heart to captivate us to the hilt ...its absolutely everything to look forward to and breathing those performance weekends, will raise our mortal consciousness to the best place possible.
All hail island rugby and max respect for our young gladiators to thrill beyond our adoring imaginations.
Bula bula Sri api!

SLFP to undergo party reforms
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said SLFPers within the government will wholeheartedly support any move to bring the 16 SLFPers back into government.
He said unity within the SLFP would always be given priority.We are still together. The party and the government are two different entities and they can support the party and not be in government.
The long awaited SLFP Central Committee (CC) meeting on Tuesday night however ended with the CC only taking up party reforms and the May Day programme in their agenda, Samarasinghe said yesterday.
They had not taken up the question of whether the SLFP should continue with the current unity government or not, he said.
The President had a series of meetings yesterday prior to that of the CC meeting scheduled for 8 pm. The eight SLFP ministers remaining in Cabinet had met the President after yesterdays Cabinet meeting to discuss their future while the 16 who left the government met the President at 5 pm to put forward their stance on the matter.
Thereafter the two groups together making up 39 SLFP Parliamentarians had met the President together at 7 pm.
No matter our stance, all 39 agreed to work under the leadership of President Sirisena. The 16 who left, are free to sit in opposition but they have said they will not be joining the SLPP or any other party, Samarasinghe told the media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters in Darley Road.
Discussions on party reforms had led to the appointment of a committee to gather views from grassroots members, local government members, party organisers and seniors on what the reform process should look like.
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama who was appointed to look into the way forward for the SLFP with the Unity Government had submitted his report to the President yesterday. He added that the Cabinet reshuffle process and party reforms would look into the recommendations made in that report.
It was expressed that though the SLFP remain with the government, they should not compromise on the ideals of the SLFP. And I think we have fought for that so far, the Minister said highlighting instances where the President stepped into ensure that the SLFP had its say in government.
The insistence of having no foreign judges being appointed to investigate allegations of war crimes, not allowing of the state banking sector to be open to the private sector, the removal of the former Central Bank Governor, the appointment of a commission to investigate the Bond issue and the abolishing of the cabinet sub committee on economic management were some of the examples highlighted by Samarasinghe to show where the SLFP had had initiated action.
Through the National Economic Council (NEC), the President is now playing a more assertive role in the economy along with the Prime Minister, he added.

Sri Lanka Tourism  launches certification for tourist friendly eating places
The tourists especially the FIT (Free Independent Travellers) have a genuine concern for the food and beverages they are consuming in various parts of the country. Complaints have been received in the past as to the quality, price of food and beverages, the cleanliness and facilities of the places they visit for a meal. This results in a poor image of overall tourism in the whole country. The travellers make various remarks on social media networks and also in print media.
Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority(SLTDA) has stepped in by certifying of Tourist friendly eating places to provide tourists with this need. In june 2017 SLTDA started visiting the eating houses in Colombo and the inspection teams consisted of the SLTDA officials, independent inspection officers assigned by the SLTDA and the municipal authorities. The eating places were classified into A and B categories. In the first phase of the scheme 66 eating places were categorized in the Colombo municipal area and in the second phase 18 were certified in the Kandy Municipal area.
The third phase was concluded recently in Galle area, to 18 eating places. SLTDA hopes to expand the network to other places of tourist interest, such as Negombo, Ella and other major towns tourists visit.
The objectives of this scheme include the following:
Food Safety
Hygiene
Service
Establishment of standards in par with international standards
Create competition among the accredited eating places
Encouraging them to reach higher standards
To encourage and increase the tourism revenue in keeping with the targets set by the state
To create a niche market for Sri Lanka in food and beverage industry for tourists.
Upgrade the overall quality of food and beverages served to the tourists at eating places.

The beneficiaries would be the tourists coming in groups as well as the Free Independent Travellers. The suppliers to the eating places and others in the area will find indirect employment right throughout the year. The suppliers include sea food, meat, dry rations, water, vegetables, fruitsc and economic conditions of these suppliers will rise to levels higher than the present levels. All in all a new economic cycle will be created boosting the income levels of the people of this country who are directly connected to tourism
by awarding the certification logo to the eating place which complied with basic guidelines of food hygiene and facilities for tourists and to create a competition among similar eating places in the area and encouraging them to upgrade facilities and to obtain the certification will be the prime objectives of the scheme
Parties involved in the certification scheme include:
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, the facilitator and the implementing authority
Ministry of Health contributing in formulating guidelines in keeping with the provisions of the Food Act and will actively involve in inspection process of the eating place, through the PHI of the respectice area.
Local Authority Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government involved in the process of formulating guidelines for eating places and an officer nominated by the respective local authority will be a member in the inspection team.
Certification process:
Stage 1 - identifying eating places in selected tourism zones, which has the capacity to be improved as per the guidelines by random visits by the inspection team members. Later the owners of such eating places will be able to submit an application to SLTDA to obtain the Tourism Friendly Eating Place certification.
Stage 2 - informing the short-comings to the owners of the eating places

Stage 3 - Re-inspect the places once the short-comings are rectified and marks are awarded by the inspection team

stage 4 - Awarding of certification Grade A or Grade B. To qualify for a Grade A certification more than 75% marks should be obtained at the final inspection.
To qualify for a Grade B certification 50% to 75% marks should be obtained at the final inspection.
Any eating place which fails to get 50% marks will not be classified under the scheme. They can improve the facilities and inform the SLTDA about same and to visit them for another inspection.
It is intended to implement the same certification scheme in all tourism zones in the country and to give publicity to the logo of Tourist Friendly Eating Places in local print and electronic media and in international magazines and websites.
Benefits to the Awardees:
Recognition as a Tourist friendly eating place with certified hygiene standards followed by four authorities.
Ability to display the signage with the Tourist Friendly Eating Place logo.
To use as a marketing tool in all publicity materials as a Tourist Friendly Eating Place
Publicity will be given by SLTDA for the logos recommending and encouraging tourists to have their meals at certified places
Guidelines for Tourist Friendly Eating Places
An establishment with minimum of eight covers and a maximum of 39 covers where food, drinks and desserts are served to customers on a commercial basis can apply for a certification. Eating places which are taken into consideration are the places that do not comply with gazetted registration guidelines for restaurants by SLTDA but similar places that cater to the domestic and foreign travellers mainly in tourist zones.

Minimum criteria for certification
1. Location
The locality and environment should be suitable for an eating place to be used by domestic and foreign travellers.
2. Access approach
Access and approach should be easy and convenient for the customers and service providers.
3. Building
The building should have proper shelter with a ceiling or equivalent that prevents dust and insects falling into the food. A dry, clean and a levelled floor should be available. The walls should be properly painted or done in a suitable manner befitting the purpose.
4. Maintenance
Maintenance of all areas of the eating place including the building (inside or outside), furniture, equipment, furnishings, fixtures and fittings should be of a standard that assures safety and sufficient hygienic conditions, befitting the purpose.
5. Number of covers
A minimum of eight covers upto a maximum of 39 covers should be available.
There are separate guidelines for the kitchen, cooking staff, supplying, storing of cooking ingredients, dining area, serving staff and guest wash rooms which match the international standards.

The following general guidelines will also apply to the eating places
1. Name boards should be fixed to identify the eating place.
2. A menu card should be available and a price list should be displayed in the premises
3. A valid bill should be issued for all transactions
4. All areas of the Eating Place should be well-lit with natural or artificial lighting
5. Water storage tanks should be closed with lids and cleaned on regular basis to ensure the quality of water.
In addition to the above guidelines, it is mandatory to comply with the provisions of the Food Act No 26 of 1980.
In addition to the foreign tourists, these eating places will also receive the patronage of a large number of local holiday makers and people in transit. Separate wash rooms for males and females is of importance, since guests always prefer privacy.
Sometimes, between two transit points in most of the provinces, we may not come across a single restaurant or food outlet or a coffee shop which matches the requirements of the customers with separate wash rooms for gents and ladies.
The setting up of these eating places is an excellent idea of the SLTDA to serve the foreign visitors and the locals as well. The visitors will be able to enjoy a meal or a tea break with all the conveniences we find in an overseas eating place.
The visitors will come across these eating places via the internet and other social media networks.
It is vital to develop these eating places not only in major Tourist Zones but also in all major cities of Sri Lanka to ensure good eating places in all parts of the country.
In time to come, these eating places will serve as a Franchise Chain of eating places for local families in addition to the visiting tourists.
It is up to the SLTDA officials to have thorough checks of the eating places already certified in Colombo, Kandy and Galle to ensure the compliance with the set guidelines before they embark on venturing into other tourist zones in the near future.
Accolades should go to SLTDA and their officials who masterminded the unique concept in providing these eating places which is a long felt need.

UNINTERRUPTED POWER AT HIGH COST - PUCSL
The Public Utilities Commission yesterday warned that power will have to be purchased from the private sector at a higher cost, and there is no issue in continuous power supply.
Refuting media reports of an impending power crisis as mentioned by the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU), Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe yesterday said power can be supplied through emergency power or various other mechanisms.
It is not an issue of power supply, but it is an issue of cost. We are looking at the possibility of using generators owned by the government and government owned entities in emergencies.
There are more than 150 MWs of government owned generators in various government institutions, the DG said.
He further said that they are looking at the possibility of running these generators as soon as possible.
The possibility is being explored and we will brief the government accordingly. he said.
The PUCSL is also preparing a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan for the utility sectors.
In 2016 and 2017 we had some natural calamities and there were some interruptions to these essential services. We have to be prepared for that, he added.
Responding to a question regarding the Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP), the DG said that the generation plan was approved on July 19, 2017.
Before the plan was approved, we conducted two public consultations and also held several discussions with the CEB and other relevant authorities. This plan has already been implemented and all the current CEB projects are done under this plan. But this plan has no solutions for the issues that came up in 2018 or later, he said.

Weliweriya Booms 6 clinches Red Bull Tuk It 2018 title
Freshers Weliweriya Boom 6 put up a gallant effort to outclass many seasoned campaigners and emerged champions of the Red Bull Tuk It second edition concluded at the Moonemale Estate at Kaluaggala recently.
Altogether 155 teams comprising of 465 participants lined up to test their strength and endurance where all teams were equally tested in a battled of fatigue, emotions and challenges on a tough Lankan terrain which has proven idel for the contest.
Stage one of this years Red Bull Tuk It put the participants through an initial obstacle course that was designed to mimic the conditions of the terrain that would follow through in the second stage. Lasting for more than 36 hours and crossing more than 15 cities over a distance of 200 kilometers from Kaluaggala to Negombo through a challenging route that involved hill climbs, river crossings, mud pits and extreme weather.
Many of the returning teams from 2017 knew what was to be expected of Red Bull Tuk It, and were very well prepared to get through more than 35 hours through Sri Lankas most extreme tuk-tuk challenge. Even though being a new team, Weliweriya Boom 6 got a hold of survival tips quickly by conversing with the returning teams, coupled with great round one points lead and patient navigational instructions created the winning formula to claim the top spot in the podium this year.
Team Nipun Baja from Negombo and Weliweriya Boom 3 also were able to end up with podium finishes at 2nd and 3rd places respectively. It is also a point to note that all three podium finishes this year were new teams.
The most creative tuk-tuk award was won by Team No. 067 from Nuwaraeliya for the most original design using the Red Bull can.
We were really excited to be a part of such a great event like Red Bull Tuk It. We had some ideas of what it would be like, from talking to last years teams. But in reality the route was tougher than we expected, but in the same time it also showed us how beautiful our country really is with all the views we got from the mountaintops until we hit the beach park in Negombo. We are definitely looking forward for next years Red Bull Tuk It in order to try and defend our champions title said Weliweriya Boom 6, the winning team of Red Bull Tuk It 2018.
Red Bull Tuk It is a rally style challenge that utilizes Sri Lankas most used form of transportation  the tuk-tuk, while allowing teams to experience the iconic beauty of Sri Lanka.
The course is not necessarily physical, but by accomplishing tasks, which are a combination of active adventure, getting to grips with tasks of local traditions and then the ultimate satisfaction of reaching the end brings the essence of what the project is about.
Latest information from the event is available in their Facebook Page  Red Bull Tuk It.

World Bank predicts oil price  to be up at $ 65 a barrel in 2018
Oil prices are forecast to average $65 a barrel in 2018, up from an average of $53 a barrel in 2017, on strong demand from consumers and restraint by oil producers, the World Bank said on Tuesday.
Metals prices are expected to rise 9 per cent this year, also on a pick-up in demand and supply constraints, according to it.
Prices for energy commodities  which include oil, natural gas, and coal -- are forecast to jump 20 per cent in 2018, a 16 percentage point upward revision from Octobers outlook, the World Bank said in its April Commodity Markets Outlook.
The metals index is expected to rise as a 9 per cent drop in iron ore prices is offset by increases in all base metals prices, led by nickel, which is forecast to rise 30 per cent.
Agricultural commodities, including food commodities and raw materials, are anticipated to see a price rise of over 2 per cent this year on diminished planting prospects.
Weather disruptions are expected to be minimal.
Accelerating global growth and rising demand are important factors behind broad-based price increases for most commodities and the forecast of higher commodities prices ahead, said Shantayanan Devarajan, World Bank Senior Director for Development Economics and acting Chief Economist. At the same time, policy actions currently under discussion add uncertainty to the outlook.
Oil prices are expected to average $65/bbl over 2019 as well. Although prices are projected to decline from April 2018 levels, they should be supported by continued production restraint by OPEC and non-OPEC producers and strong demand.
Oil prices have more than doubled since bottoming in early 2016, as the large overhang of inventories has been reduced significantly. (The Hindu)
