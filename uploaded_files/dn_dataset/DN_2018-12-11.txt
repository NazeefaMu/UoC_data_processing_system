N-E residents plead for their lands

Residents from several parts of the North and East including Keppavilu, Iranaitvu and Valikamam gathered before the Colombo Fort Railway station calling on President Maithripala Sirisena to take steps to return land now occupied by the armed forces to their owners before the end of the year.
Sasikala who hails from Keppavilu said the President made them a promise that he would return all lands held under the military back to the owners.
Instead of efforts to hand over the lands to the owners, we have noticed construction activity in some of these places. Even families who were resettled there fear for their lives due to the heighted presence of the forces who continue to surround the villages, Sasikala said.
Nearly 56 families are waiting to be resettled in Kepavilu. However, even the 35 families who were there have no sanitation facilities and 27 wells have been destroyed before the land was released to them. Gravel has been bulldozed into the soil in the released land, so crops cannot grow, she said. There are no housing projects either for these people.
Christopher from Mullikulam said that 1,650 acres were still occupied by the Navy and 216 families are waiting to be resettled. These people are fisherfolk whose livelihood depends on fishing, but the only a half-kilometre road that leads to the sea has been cut off and a gate has been built with road blocks throughout, he said.
Anne from Pallimunai said that there have been 32 hearings for a court case over the release of a 2.2 acre land which continues to be occupied by the Navy. Twenty-two families are waiting to be resettled in these areas, she said. We were displaced in 1990 even before the war ended, but we are yet to have our lands back. Over the last few years, six members of the 22 families have died.
Many more individuals and families from areas including Silwathurai where 36.5 acres of land are occupied by the Navy, from Pilakudiyirippu where 16 acres are to be returned, Iranathivu where even the land that was released is still being occupied by a Navy camp and Ashraf Nagar where 150 acres are still occupied by the Army, protested calling on the President to make good on his promise.
Residents of Paanama also called on the government to enact the Cabinet decision to release lands as there is still 1,200 acres to be released to owners.
The residents and families were gathered under the support of the National Fisheries Solidarity Movement which hosted an event at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. At the event, an interim report on an international fact finding mission on the Port City was released. A final report is to be published at the end of December.

never Old enough
It was a day in 1930. An eight-year boy was rummaging through the paper bales wrapped in used foreign newspapers. He developed a deep fascination with the printed matter  excerpts from the New York Times. The excerpts provided detailed insights into US politics. Access to any foreign source  let alone reading them free of charge - was out of the ordinary during this period.
There lay the seeds of Dr Edwin Ariyadasas enduring enthusiasm on the matters pertaining to the United States of America. That said, it comes as no surprise when Dr Ariyadasa, who turned 96 on December 3, launched his latest chronicle, a volume containing the United States Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, the first amendment and a tabulated series of presidential addresses on crucial occasions of the US political chronology. The volume is titled as Vimukthi Prakashana, the latest addition to Dr Ariyadasas long bibliography.
Ninety-six, yes thats a go figure! Even at 96, Dr Edwin Ariyadasa is a common sight at many events mostly delivering a guest lecture. Walking mostly unaided, the nonagenarian still maintains the time-honoured niche as walking encyclopaedia with the clarity of speech.
Born on December 3, 1922, in Unawatuna, to V K Abraham Appuhamy and Sisiliana Hamine, Edwin was the youngest in a family of five. Following secondary education at Mahinda College, Galle, Edwin entered the University of Ceylon in 1945 to read for his Bachelors in Sinhala and English.
I was never interested in postgraduate studies, Ariyadasa muses today, I was passionate about teaching. But that choice did not favour Ariyadasa for long. Strange and strong memory power coupled with bilingualism was a marked trait of Dr Edwin Ariyadasa evident to this date. That extraordinary attribute installed him in a cynosure position among various strata, be it academic and otherwise.
The then Chairperson of Lake House, Esmond Wickremesinghe, offered me a choice between Daily News and Dinamina. It was Dinamina Editor, Piyasena Nissanka, who wanted me in. I naturally opted for Sinhala journalism. But I contributed to the English press as well occasionally, Ariyadasa elaborates the genesis of his career well established in the fourth estate. He was a staff member of Divaina, Daily News, Sunday Observer, Silumina, Janatha and went on to become the editor in chief of Nawayugaya.
And today, on this day of December 11, 2018, Dr Edwin Ariyadasa remains the oldest living journalist and writer.
Dr Edwin Ariyadasa has his own reasoning to introduce the US Constitution to the local audience.
There is a constant dialogue about the Constitution today. Most countries do not have written constitutions. The US Constitution is the oldest written constitution still in use today among nations. It offers us many lessons to ponder, Dr Ariyadasa explains.
The presidential addresses begin with George Washington and end with Richard Nixon. The addresses, Dr Ariyadasa believes, indicate the strength of the political thinking even way back in the 17th and 18th centuries.
I translated these speeches from time to time. I recently assembled them for the publishing purpose. All this is available in the public domain, and I wonder why no one was bothered to translate them into Sinhala.
Dr Ariyadasa who belongs to the yesteryear generation is not techno-savvy. But the techno-savvy crowd depends on him for knowledge of yore. I am a qualified vegetarian, Ariyadasa states in reference to his lifestyle.
Qualified in the sense there are limitations to my vegetarianism. I eat fish, but not meat. This has no religious reason. It is simply because meat does not agree with my body system. I gave up on liquor and smoking a long time ago. On the other hand, I always make it a point not to get tense or anxious.
Dr Edwin Ariyadasa never gets fed up with studying how the US political machinery works. His current reading list includes What Happened authored by Hillary Rodham Clinton elaborating why she lost to Donald Trump at the 2016 Presidential Election. Ariyadasa is fond of British politics as well especially owing to its monarchy element fused with frugal parliamentary structure.
I have not visited that Parliament. But I have seen it on television. It is considered the mother of all Parliaments. It is very much visible as the Prime Minister has to sit with other MPs on a long bench. That humility is touching especially as it is the institution that ensures justice of the common people. And their deference to monarchy is simply unbelievable.
Sri Lanka had done better under the monarchy, Ariyadasa maintains. When the politicians voted into power try to establish an unlawful monarchy, why not let a traditional monarchy resume control of the country, Ariyadasa questions.
Vimukthi Prakasha, a Sarasavi publication, will be a good manual for the local politicians to shape their thinking processes, Dr Ariyadasa remarks.

Dinesh Selvaraj, a former assistant of Mani Ratnam, is the director of the film. The trailer for Thuppaki Munai was released in September by director Gautham Menon. Velu Ramamoorthy and MS Bhaskar also featured in the trailer, which was dominated by high-speed car chases and action sequences.
Hansika Motwani plays the female lead in the movie. Before beginning shoot for the film, she reportedly told DC that her role was a different one. I am doing a character which I have not tried so far.
Its not the routine heroine that you see in every commercial film. It is something quirky and interesting, she said.

Thuppaki Munais tagline reads  Each bullet has a story, and producer Thanu had said that this best described the film. The bullets that are fired from Vikram Prabhus gun have a purpose.

NZs Patel wins battle  for spinners role  against Sri Lanka
WELLINGTON, Monday: New Zealand left-arm spinner Ajaz Patels form against Pakistan in the UAE has earned him the chance to impress in local conditions after selectors on Monday named him as the only slow bowler in the squad for two tests against Sri Lanka. 
The 30-year-old produced a man-of-the-match performance on debut in their four-run win over Pakistan in the first test in Abu Dhabi last month. He also finished with 13 wickets in the series, the most by a New Zealand bowler.
Despite his impressive performances, he had been in competition with offspinner Will Somerville and legspinner Ish Sodhi for the one slow bowling position in the squad with New Zealand returning to play on pitches less conducive to turn.
Coach Gary Stead had said on the teams return home on Sunday that he would need to drop two of the spinners as they resorted to a three-pronged pace attack for the first test starting on Saturday at the Basin Reserve.
Ajaz certainly grabbed his opportunity on the UAE tour and hes a proven performer in New Zealand conditions, team selector Gavin Larsen said.
Theres a real swell of support for the test team following their efforts in the UAE, so were hoping to transition that momentum into a big home summer.
Somerville, who took seven wickets on debut in the third test victory in Abu Dhabi, and Sodhi were released to play first-class cricket.
Will Somerville was an obvious stand-out on debut in the Abu Dhabi decider and its great to know weve got quality spin bowlers who can create competition for places, Larsen added.
Uncapped batsman Will Young has also been added to the squad as batting cover after strong performances in domestic cricket and for the New Zealand A side.
He has scored 664 runs, including three centuries and a half century, at an average of 60.36 in 12 innings across all forms of cricket for the A side in the last six weeks, including a century in their one-day clash with India A on Sunday.
Im over the moon to be part of the test squad but nothing changes, Young said. Im just keep enjoying my cricket and hopefully the chance will come.
Ive had a few A chances before and it didnt go to plan ... but I have managed to put together some performances and the selectors have taken notice of that.

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for January 31 the delivering of its order regarding the preliminary objections raised by former Northern Province Chief Minister and former Supreme Court Justice C.V. Wigneswaran regarding a contempt of court action filed against him by Provincial Council Minister B. Denishwaran.
The Court of Appeal made this order as a part of contempt of court proceedings filed by B. Denishwaran alleging that former Northern Province Chief Minister Wigneswaran, Ananthi Sasitharan and K. Sivanesan willfully acted in contempt of the Court of Appeal order since they prevented him from acting as a Northern Province Minister.
Denishwaran stated that the first respondent, Justice Wigneswaran has, by his conduct and statements, acted in contumacious and willful disobedience of the order of Court of Appeal and thus committed an act of contempt against the authority and dignity of the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal on June 29 issued an Interim Order preventing the decision of former Northern Province Chief Minister Wigneswaran to expel Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the Province.
The petitioner Denishwaran had challenged the former Northern Province Chief Minister in the Court of Appeal, complaining that the Chief Minister had no power to appoint or remove any Provincial Council Minister.
Former Chief Minister Wigneswaran had also filed an appeal in Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeals Interim Order to prevent his decision to remove Denishwaran from functioning as the Fisheries and Transport Minister in the Province.
Counsel Suren Fernando appeared for the petitioner Denishwaran. Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-Iswaran appeared for former Chief Minister Wigneswaran. M.A. Sumanthiran, PC, appeared for the fifth respondent.

Parliamentary and Majority Supremacy
This law that compels the innocent public to waste their valuable time almost five years and ruin their lives, has become an unbearable and burdening torture, which even frustrates the future of their unborn children. It is high time that this stupidity should stop. Years after years, they were in total obedience to this law and that too in the name of democracy. People of these countries had enough. To rule a country for the full period the constitution allows, the ruling team must officially and ethically deserve it.
What is the criterion to determine that merit of deserving Every ruling party comes to people with an election manifesto. The document contains the list of promises to be fulfilled in order to make the life of the people comfortable, happy and peaceful. Have they fulfilled the promises If yes ok. If not And on the other way round, if the lives of the people have become relatively much worse than what it was before, such ruling crowds have no ethical rights to rule.
In the name of democracy, it is not the duty and responsibility of people, to knowingly and intentionally allow more couple of years to such ethically unfit crowd with broken political promises, with day-light deceptions and corruptions, to increase their own agony and destroy the innocent future of their born and unborn children. The people must have the rights to finish the rule which disappointed them, which plundered their wealth, which took billions of bribes to stay in one party and again, billions of bribes to defect and cross to another party and form the parliamentary majority and the rule, which made of them fools and enjoyed a gala life with tax, paid by the people as a whole.
Thus, the availability of parliamentarian majority, should not and cannot serve as the right foundation, to recapture the lost power, to continue the captured power and to ensnare people in the trap of the deception of Parliamentarian majority in the name of democracy.
Supremacy foundation
Yes, the Parliament by itself is not supreme, but, it can be supreme. In which circumstances When the Parliament members are democratically elected by/in an impartial election and such elected members represent the true interest of the people, who elected them, the Parliament can be said to be supreme. When the Parliament efficiently manages the economic, cultural and scientific progress of the country in the best interest of the majority, it can be termed to be supreme.
When the Parliament enacts the laws that profit the people as a whole and does everything to maintain the rule of law, without interfering in to affairs of the judiciary it can be construed to be supreme. When the Parliament incorporates legal norms to net and catch those, joyfully engaged in the blood suction of mega project corruption and in law-manipulated bank robberies and to recover the plundered wealth, it can be expounded to be supreme. If the parliamentarians do not over-spend the funds of innocent majority, paid as tax and lead a simple and ethically acceptable life, such Parliament can be commended to be supreme.
Absence of supremacy ground
The legal validity of the election and the constitutional appropriateness of the member election and the number cannot serve as the basis of Parliamentary supremacy. What is required is not only the validity of election and member electing and their number, but also the true and empirical representation of the interest of public by the members of Parliament.
In many Asian countries, what really happens is, subsequent to the election of members for the Parliament, they, the MPs, forget their right duties and responsibilities, they were called for and self-engage in nepotism, in robbing public wealth, in the improvement of their own privileges by means of increasing diversified taxes, in the structuring of blood suction of huge commissions via macro-projects, in the sale of valuable and strategically significant properties to alien agents and in ruining the well-established self-sufficiency of the motherland and depositing in and subjecting it to the dependence of world market so that the country will be compelled to import many items and the play of the game of commissions shall be put in to absolute ease. Besides, there may be dangerous designs to divide the country in subservience to conspiracies of the so-called international elements of vested interest.
Now, if the democratically elected Parliamentarians are involved in such brutal acts, contravening the constitution, such Parliament cannot be supreme. The presence of Parliamentary majority does not grant rights to parliamentarians to delightfully continue and enjoy above treacherous betrayals. The constitutional validity of Parliamentarians does not serve as the right foundation of Parliament Supremacy. Such supremacy is not only questionable, but also debatable.
Supremacy majority relativity
Hence, the Parliamentary supremacy is not an absolute phenomenon. Nor is the parliamentary majority. They are always relative. The supremacy and the majority must be determined in relation to something. In respect of Parliament, its supremacy and the majority components should be measured relating them to the truth of the best interest of and the best service to people.
If the people are not profited, if their interests are wrongly represented, if their hopes are brutally disappointed, if their innocent dreams are painfully frustrated, they have inalienable rights to finish the rule, which politically betrayed them. In this regard, the Executive is an asset for people. That is to say, if the Parliamentary rule betrays the dreams of the people, if their action infringes the territorial integrity of the country, if those, who are active in the bifurcation of the country dominate the Parliamentarians, by various instructions and orders, which facilitates the division of the country, if they conspire traps to ensnare war heroes of the nation who saved the country from the animalism of terrorism to satisfy the international diasporic elements of vested interest, if the economic prosperity of the people is being castrated by means of gigantic mega corruptions, if the country is being used as the dustbin to throw the health-destroying wastes of other countries, the Executive, as the Head of the State can and must dissolve such Parliament and call for general election, granting the people their right to elect a politico-administrative team to run their affairs.
In this case, the majority aspect cannot serve as the basis to stay in power. The executive is elected directly by the people. He has a duty. His official designation involves a tremendous responsibility. He is answerable to people. His duty is not watching, lamenting and shedding tears, looking at what is happening to people. He cannot be paralyzed and dead. He is a strong political and executive and living figure of action in the best interest of all people.

PMs functions curtailed temporarily-GL

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said the Court of Appeal Interim Order restraining the functions of the office of the Prime Minister had given a wrong opinion to the people.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna office at Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla yesterday morning.
Prof. Peiris further told the media that after issuing the order, the people are under the impression that currently, the country has no Prime Minister or a Cabinet of Ministers which is not the fact.
The position of the Prime Minister still prevails and it is only his functions that have been curtailed till the final judgement is delivered, Prof. Peiris said.
Prof. Peiris further said that Member of Parliament Mahinda Rajapaksas post as the Prime Minister still prevails, but the functions and powers relegated to his position is curtailed by the Interim Order.
He also revealed that they will accept the judgement which is to be given by the Suprime Court relating to the dissolution of Parliament.
Prof. Peiris further said the prevailing political situation is something new, not only to Sri Lanka, but to the world.
This is not a good situation. Ultimately, it is the public which has to suffer. Therefore, the only solution to overcome the current political impasse is to go for a General Election, Prof. Peiris said.
He further emphasized that MP Mahinda Rajapaksa is a politician who had risen from the grassroots before reaching the zenith of his political career. Therefore, he has no need to fight for positions. He accepted the Prime Ministers post on the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena to ensure the wellbeing of the country.
Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Chairman Kanchana Jayaratne also spoke.

## Title: Potential of coastal  and marine  tourism
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, December 11, 2018 - 01:00
Potential of coastal  and marine  tourism
Sri Lanka is blessed with plentiful and diverse coastal and marine resources having a high potential value for tourism. Around 1,000 miles of coastal area in the country are extensively utilised for tourism product development. About 75 percent of the graded hotels in Sri Lanka and 80 percent of the hotel rooms are located in coastal areas. The waters around the coastline are filled with valuable aquatic resources including over 1,000 varieties of fish.
With such an inventory of world-class resources, we should have by now gained a big stake in the growing global market for coastal and marine tourism, with significant potential for further growth. However, in spite of the comparatively high resource base, our earnings from coastal and marine tourism still remains below true potential. Of course, the beach holiday in Sri Lanka is popular among the predominantly Western European winter season tourists. It is evident from the high occupancies in the beach-oriented hotels in winter. Yet, more could be done.

Sustainability 
The majority of our tourists tend to fall into one of three market segments based on their needs and motivations: on shore, off-shore and inland. Coastal and marine tourism covers the first two segments. In other words, if we view through a broader sense of tourism, coastal and marine forms part of a tourists experience rather than offering a separate experience of itself. Thats important to understand and to accept it before examining the elements of an appropriate development agenda.
But we also want tourism sector -on shore, off-shore or inland - to grow on a sustainable basis. For that reason, we need to concern ourselves with four sets of conditions:
(1) Contented visitors  leaving Sri Lanka with expectations met or exceeded and coming again or recommending the country to others, (2) Profitable enterprises  large and small, capable of satisfying our tourists competitively but at a profit to sustain operations and to reinvest in the business, (3) A nurtured environment  sensitively develop and manage our natural environment, (4) Engaged communities  sustainable tourism proactively engages with local communities for economic benefit and through its actions should enhance a location as a place to live as well as a place to visit.
Our whole tourism policy must align with satisfying these four conditions.
Coastal and marine tourism is big business. Its common knowledge that most of our tourists are concentrated along our coastline. When we geo plot the places in which tourists actually visit, we find that over 70% of Sri Lankas tourism is concentrated within a small segment of our landmass  west coast and east coast.
To quote the numbers, however, we do not have official statistics for tourism in coastal and marine areas, but estimates indicate is probably two third of the tourist income comes from coastal tourism. When considered with the associated employment both direct and indirect sustained locally in hospitality, the dividend is significant but theres also considerable potential for further growth from international markets in particular. Within an international coastal and marine tourism context, Sri Lanka is part of a mature South Asian market with growth rates well behind those of the new and emerging Asian markets.
Most of our business today actually comes from within the West European and Asian market and in reality, for the foreseeable future most of our business will come from there. This means Sri Lanka should seek to develop a foothold in the newer growth markets in Australia, Africa, East Europe and Middle East. In reality, that will take time.

New ways 
Dependent as we are on mature markets, this means if we are to grow steadily, we need to capture part of the competitors markets. Not an easy task! As an initial step, we need a thorough understanding of our competitors markets and specifically about the consumer segments who are looking for what we have to offer.
What can we really offer To answer this question, we have to re-segment our tourist arrivals in a different angle. (1) Urban tourism experience or city-breaks. These tourists spend few days in major cities and hotels and maybe take couple of day tours and leave. (2) Great Escapers. Theyre often young families. interested in rural holidays and travel to remote places. They want to connect with the landscape and feel the country. They take part in exploration on land, on-shore and off-shore but not strenuous ones. (3) Culturally Curious. Theyre slightly older, 50 and over. They travel to broaden their minds and expand their experience by exploring new landscapes and seascapes, history and culture. They are independent active sightseers. They are unlikely to return home for some time. They travel as couples, maybe with grownup children. With the resources we have we can satisfy the needs of the last two groups needs by leveraging our areas of comparative advantage. Coast and sea would be added highlights for them.
With the sea surrounding the country all our activities should be based around water. The greater territorial waters having a larger area than the land itself, the potential for water-based activities are greater.The areas that could be further developed along these coastal lines would be whale and dolphin watching, surfing, sailing, kayaking, sport fishing and a variety of water sports.
We also have an untapped market potential for more yacht marinas.There was a proposal of creating one in Galle harbour but it became the focus of criticism from some interested parties, claiming it would damage the harbour and Rumassala Mountain. With the availability of Marinas, the geo-strategic location of Sri Lanka can provide an advantage when attempting to entice cruise ships and other vessels, to include Sri Lanka as a destination or stop-over point. This will open another potential market of having activities for cruise passengers such as excursions, cultural shows etc.
With the region promoting regattas and other activities could bring in higher quality of tourists. It is obvious Sri Lanka can increase its coastal and marine tourism earnings, by using appropriate strategies with the focus on the long-term potential.

Challenges 
From a broader coastal tourism perspective this writer wishes to identify some broad areas for improvement:
We need improved access to our shoreline, particularly using existing infrastructure or even through new ways of working so that public resources such as ports, harbours, piers, marinas etc, are shared with private enterprises.
Secondly, there is a need to move away from a focus on the delivery of hard infrastructure alone as a mechanism for generating coastal tourism demand. We must also focus on developing supports for communities, particularly, who play a key role in the visitor experiences and in their engagement with the visitor. Towns and villages which are picturesque and welcoming are nice places to live, and somewhere that is nice to live is somewhere that is nice to visit.
Thirdly, we need to provide for a complete visitor experience and not just of an activity or a product. Visitors who come here want a fully immersive experience. If the tourism sector is to provide this experience then more activities, attractions, our unique cultural experiences, pubs, restaurants, hotels etc, need to be working together to deliver this, and need to reconnect to each other.
We maybe a small island but we have a rich and authentic culture unique which is warm, welcoming and engaging. If all the interested parties involved work harmoniously and together, there is no reason why we cannot enjoy significant growth in tourism within coastal and marine areas within the next ten years.

President recalls death penalty  against convicted drug traffickers


President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday reiterated the importance of implementing capital punishment for convicted drug traffickers who carry out drug smuggling operations while in detention, considering the well-being of the country, nation and the future generation.
The President said carrying out the decision on death penalty has been delayed due to delays in submitting relevant documents by authorities.
The President said he plans to order an investigation into such delays in the future..
The President made these observations during a discussion with relevant authorities at the Presidential Secretariat about amending existing laws to minimise crimes and drug trafficking.
The President stressed on the importance of strengthening laws and closing loopholes in order to deal more effectively with those involved in drug trafficking.
He said the Excise Department and other stakeholders should work in close coordination when taking decisions which benefit the people.
Laws related to prevention of crime and drug trafficking, amending Articles 46 and 47 of the Excise Ordinance, amending the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, mobilizing the STF for security at Prisons and transferring inmates at Welikada to Boosa prison were discussed at length, the Presidents media unit said.
Solving issues faced by Police personnel engaged in combating drug related cases too were discussed.
The President who inquired into the progress of operations carried out against drug trafficking also said a special programme will be implemented through ministries to encourage officers engaged in drug operations.
President Sirisena who called for a report on officers who lost their lives during drug combat operations said a programme will be initiated to ensure the wellbeing of their families. Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, Secretary to the President Udaya R.Seneviratne, Defence Ministry Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, IGP Pujith Jayasundera, Excise Commissioner General, Ministry Secretaries and other government officials participated.

Railway introduces hotline for alert
The Railway Department yesterday introduced a hotline for the public and Railway employees to give information regarding the movements of the elephants in close proximity to the railway track.
The hotline 070  444 54 54 is operational round the clock and information received will be shared with the locomotive drivers, guards, stationmasters, and CGR employees working in those areas through the ElephantALT special alert service. A special operations office has been set up to receive the information.
This alert would include details such as the number of elephants, place where they were seen, between which stations, the time, and the line.
This hotline was introduced as one of the recommendations made through the report prepared by the Railway Department and the Wildlife Department regarding elephanttrain collisions, Railway Department GM Dilantha Fernando said.
This year 13 elephants lost their lives due to elephanttrain collisions on the Northern and Eastern lines. The Railway Department has identified over 600km along the Northern, Trincomalee and the Batticoloa lines beyond the Maho junction as the vulnerable areas.
According to the General Manager, the other recommendation made by the report is the building of overpasses and underpasses at the identified elephant corridors. This is expected to be implemented though the Road Development Authority with Asian Development Bank funds, he said.
These measures would not fully resolve the issue, but would minimise the possible tragedies to a certain level, he said.

REFLECTIONS ON CURRENT  CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE






There is apparently a multitude of views particularly among lawyers as regards the action of the President of Sri Lanka to sack the Prime Minister and dissolve Parliament. There are broadly two schools of thought one strongly opposing the presidential course of action, while the other maintaining that the President has acted within his limits of power.
The bane of contention among the opposing faction of the Presidential action is that notwithstanding the inherent flaws and serious errors of inconsistency the procedure set forth in the 19th Amendment to the constitution should be upheld. Further the appointment of a new prime minister, the sacking of the former prime minister and the dissolution of Parliament are contended to be a breach of the fundamental provisions of the constitution.
The other group who approves Presidential action maintains that the Presidential action is well within the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution despite the ridiculously flawed, erroneous and utterly inconsistent procedures engulfed in the clauses of the 19th Amendment to the constitution. These two rival camps could well argue the legality or otherwise of the Presidential action for the next one and a half years at least.
Political convictions 
However what seems to be abundantly clear in the debate is that the majority of the divide is biased one way or the other based on their political convictions. There are leading lawyers and academics representing the divide. They write lucidly on their convictions with perhaps a stint of bias. The UNP parliamentarians and their diehards are opposing the Presidential action not necessarily on legal grounds but merely because they have to protest the sacking of their prime minister and ensure maintenance of the existed status quo. It was revealed in newspapers and over the air that at least two of the ardent supporters of the opposing camp had been on the pay list of the UNP, one a vociferous Buddhist monk and the other a leading academic who was connected with the drafting of the good governance policy.
The TNA with only 14 members comprised the main opposition and held the post of the leader of the Opposition in the previous government. Although one would expect them to be watchdogs in parliament they appear to be pussy cats agreeing with all what the previous government says. It is apparent that they have a hidden agenda to work on. The JVP on the other hand has turned out to be a set of jokers contradicting their own statements and providing light entertainment by shouting from the top of their voices. It is hoped that the voters will respond appropriately on their tom foolery at a future election.
Presidential action 
On the other hand it is evident that quite a large number of the clergy and the general public have endorsed the Presidential action. Further people who have been economically adversely affected by the economic policies of the previous government are up in arms against that government which has caused them undue suffering. It would be seen that the previous government spent lavishly on enhanced allowances for their parliamentary colleagues in addition to their normal dues while even the childrens savings accounts were subject to tax. It is indeed a shame that the previous government should advise foreign funding sources to suspend foreign aid to the country very well knowing that these funds were meant to benefit the people of this country and not their political rivals.
As a student of Political Science and Public Administration I wish to present a view with due regard to the legal implications of the Presidential action. The President according to the Constitution is the head of State and head of government. He has been elected by majority vote with the participation of all the voters of the country on a national basis to serve as an impartial agent of society for making the societys conception of justice prevail in the justifiable sphere of social life depicting the sovereignty of the people.
Further the President is endowed with supreme legal authority on conditions of exercising it in strict conformity to the moral standards of society which has to be ensured by satisfactory consultation of public opinion. In this context it is important to realize that a mechanical legal order cannot explain the moral validity of justification of such an order. As Charles Dickens has observed the law is an ass as many innocent victims have found to their horror.
It would be rather interesting to critically examine the conduct of the organs of the government, namely the President, Prime Minister and Cabinet of Ministers prior to October 26, 2018. It is on record that the Prime Minister (PM) not only exercised his powers but increasingly made inroads to Presidential powers without discretion. It was also revealed that Cabinet decisions were made by a few and the Cabinet in general was unaware of most decisions.
The case in point is the Singapore Sri Lanka trade agreement where a majority of the ministers were at sea. This agreement was in line with the Laissez faire theory of 1776 Britain which was abandoned within a few years of its functioning. Going by these outdated economic policies the sustainability of locally produced goods was completely neglected. The lack of transparency in policy matters even within the Cabinet has been a regular feature. In terms of the socio-political and juridical norms Article 70(1) is a pious wish hanging on its own boot straps and has no influence on Article 33 (2).
In conclusion, given all the circumstances it would seem appropriate that the most sensible option is to go for a general election irrespective of all other considerations which will establish the will of the people and ensure social justice.

Rohan Wijesinghe the brilliant Sri Lanka Schools batsman in the late seventies could have been a part of the Sri Lanka Cricket team, but it was not to be due to his banking commitments overseas.He learned the rudiments of the game under the watchful eye of Late B.R.Heyn at the BRC nets. He was so gifted that he captained the St Josephs under 14 side at the age of 10.
From 1973 to 1977 he blazed a trail as an attacking opening batsman at Darley Road. He played under late Gary Melder in 1973.At the age of 17 years he was picked to represent Ceylon Schools under the captaincy of late Anura Ransinghe, they played against Pakistan Schools under the captaincy of Javed Miandad. Yohan Gunasekera,Tilan Wijesighe,Ranjan Madugalle and D.L.S. De Silva also took part.
Rohan was a success on that Pakistan tour and as a result was picked for the Sri Lanka national squad.They were to play against the touring Englishmen under the captaincy of late Tony Greig, Rohan was only 21 years of age then.
Rohan opened batting for NCC under the captaincy of Ranjith Fernando they won the Sara Trophy that year, he THEN switched teams and joined CCC played under Michael and they too won the Plum Trophy.
He joined HSBC and took his bat along with him and scored heavily not at the teller but at cricket.Rohans pleasing personality was his forte. The higher ups at the bank gave due recognition to the various talents of the smart, nattily dressed young man and he was seconded for service at British Bank of the Middle East Sultanate of Oman, a member of Hong Kong Bank Group.He captained the Sri Lankan cricket club team in Oman.
His love for cricket never deserted him and after his retirement from banking he unlocked his other talent as a cricket writer. In my book Rohan Wijesinghe is in the Scyld Berry class, easily the best cricket writer in England.
SCYLD BERRY
As of interest to the readers, he was born not a mile from the citys old cricket ground of Bramall Lane, he was christened Scyld, pronounced shild by a father who was Professor of English at a university.The name taken from the poem BEOWOLF, is the first recorded in English. Since 1976 he has written about cricket for The Observer. On Sundays in summer he played village cricket in Somerset, and once was good enough and bad enough to have dropped Ian Chappel off his own bowling.(courtesy-Cricket Wallah SCYLD BERRY).
Rohan got the wet rag treatment in some of the local newspapers and the gentleman that he was he took it in his stride. Ultimately his talent was spotted by an English writer when Rohan was writing articles for the Sri Lankan cricket carnival souvenir.This tournament was played by old boys of different schools in Sri Lanka.
With the help of this English guy he has published a top notch cricket book called Legends of Cricket.
If you have a sense of humour you will be chuckling throughout as you read this splendid book; if you havent well it could help you to develop one.Time and again the poet in Rohan comes out in the pages.
His style of writing will be a breath of fresh air for the readers because our scribes although they do a fine job some how there reporting is mundane and rigid, Rohan has been brave enough to write out of the box and his article on Buddhi Kunderam is well worth the price of the book. Rohan had practically gone through all the legends without stepping on their toes, its a pity that he was not offered a public relations post at the SLC,
This book has class written all over it.

Setting the  record straight
President Maithripala Sirisena has set the record straight when he attributed the present political crisis as stemming from differences in political ideology and not a problem that cropped up over personal differences between himself and Ranil Wickremesinghe. Speaking at an event in Polonnaruwa, President Sirisena described the clash as one between two disparate political entities, one which had an indigenous outlook and the other wedded to a neo-liberal ideology. True, the crisis had its origins in the clash of views between indigenous and foreign philosophy and as explained by the President, when one implemented the philosophy of rising up independently through self-reliance without succumbing to foreign pressure, foreign forces would naturally become a challenge.
The President was apparently responding to the accusations made by the UNP that the current crisis was of the Presidents own making due to his alleged personality clashes with UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. The President is not off the mark in this respect. Born and bred in the rural outback, and a follower of a political party which has its ethos in indigenous culture, rooted in the village and revolving round the farmer and the peasantry, the whole outlook of the UNP, which is wedded to capitalism and hinged on Western culture certainly would have been alien to the President. Of this, the kowtowing and open subservience to the Western powers by Wickremesinghe who wanted to steer the countrys economy according to the dictates of the West would have been too much to take for the President who has always been guided by the philosophy of the SLFP.
It was clear to all that the end had to come sooner rather than later. The constant bickering in Cabinet, the open clashes between the UNP and SLFP ministers in the Unity Government over policy and the frequent barbs thrown at each other, the public spats etc. had to end one way or the other. It would have certainly been all too obvious to the President, who had a ringside view of the goings on, that things cannot proceed in the way they were heading. A decision had to be made.
President Sirisena would also not have taken too kindly to the fact that he was not kept in the loop by Wickremesinghe. It was the constant complaint of the President, even in the best days of the Unity Government, that he was not kept informed of the happenings and that more often than not he learnt of developments only when they appeared in the newspapers. Philosophy and ideological differences apart, the numerous acts of big time corruption and arbitrary actions taken bypassing the President certainly must have made the President think that enough is enough. Chief among this is the Central Bank Bond scam the consequences of which no doubt are still haemorrhaging the economy.
Here too, the UNP leader acted arbitrarily by appointing a crony to head the Central Bank amidst stiff opposition from the President and even Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. It goes without saying that for a coalition Government to function efficiently, there should be harmony and a good understanding between leaders of the coalition. Especial under a Presidential system of Governance, the President and Prime Minister should jell if the country is to benefit by such an arrangement.
It is only under the shot-lived Presidency of D.B. Wijetunga that such a scenario was possible, when DBW and Chandrika acted in concert. The same could not be said for the subsequent occasion when the President and the Prime Minister were from different political parties. Chandrika and Ranil failed to hit it off during the latters tenure as PM between 2002-2004 when Cabinet meetings were marked by hostility which eventually led to the premature termination of that Government. Although President Sirisena was elected as Common Candidate with the assistance of the UNP the marriage was always shaky from the outset, and, as subsequent events proved, was heading for a breakup. There is no guarantee that the status quo would change in the future as well. Hence, the best course would be to do away with the Presidency and revert to the pre-78 system of Government for the sake of stability.
Meanwhile, President Sirisena has assured the nation that he would abide by the Supreme Court ruling on the dissolution of Parliament, either way. This attitude of the President no doubt will come in for praise from all right thinking citizens who wish for a quick return to normality. Earlier too, the President accepted the verdict with equanimity when the Stay Order was issued on the dissolution. On that occasion the President issued a statement drawing public attention to the independence of the judiciary under his Presidency.
This is the first occasion since the introduction of the Presidential form of Government that the country is being ruled sans a Prime Minister or a Cabinet of Ministers. The President said he is not happy with the situation of a country with strong democratic traditions being Governed by a single individual. Hopefully things will sort themselves out positively following the court ruling.

STAX Head of Research reaches finals of Bracken Bower Prize
STAX has long been known to attract top talent from some of the worlds most prestigious universities and corporates. Its Head of Research Piyumi Kapugeekiyana is a testament to this.
Piyumi was recently selected as one of three finalists across the world for the prestigious and coveted Bracken Bower Prize. The Bracken Bower Prize, organized yearly by The Financial Times and McKinsey, awards 15,000 for the best business book proposal by an author under 35. Its a dream come true for any budding business writer looking to get off their feet. Apart from the attractive cash prize, the organizers conduct a masterclass for all finalists in London, where leading publishers provide guidance and advice on how to take an idea from proposal to shelf.
The finalists are selected through a rigorous process where each proposal is reviewed by executives from The Financial Times and McKinsey and passed on to the judges only when a green light is received from both parties.
Piyumis proposed book One Billion in Reserve makes a case for rethinking both work and workplaces with a view to including the global talent pool of people with disabilities and the neurodivergent (people with learning and cognitive differences).
Commenting on her journey, Piyumi said, Im thrilled to have made it to the top 3 of the Bracken Bower Prize  its such an excellent platform for aspiring authors. Im especially grateful to my colleagues and mentors at STAX. Ours is a company with a rich history of advising and cultivating double-bottom line companiesones with both economic and social impactand Ive long enjoyed a wide berth to explore and test new ideas. Looking forward, Im hopeful about the prospect of mainstreaming disability and neurodivergence inclusion in workplaces worldwide. For the most part, this is an area that gets little attention in the broader discourse on diversity and inclusion, where race and gender diversity almost always get pre-eminence.
Ruwindhu Peiris, Managing Director and head of the Colombo office said We are truly proud of and delighted by Piyumis significant global achievement. This is a true testament to our STAX purpose statement of Freedom to Dream, Power to Make It Happen! What an exciting time for Piyumi. I cannot wait to see her dream unfold and am happy we are able to give her the power to make it happen.
STAX is driven by a leadership team that encourages a culture of social responsibility. As Rafi Musher, STAX Founder and CEO emphasizes, I dont think you need to wait to be innovative in driving social benefit<U+200A><U+200A>in fact<U+200A><U+200A>you need to be impatient, rather than patient.
STAX DevCorp, the social arm of STAX, embodies this spirit by creating and supporting new startup companies and joint ventures to address significant needs identified by the companys strategy consulting practice.
A case in point is STAX DevCorps role in supporting ULTRA Testinga New York-based provider of software testing services whose competitive advantage stems from employing teams of individuals on the Autism Spectrum. Through a research-driven approach, STAX DevCorp guided ULTRA to successfully launch, secure customers and secure funding.
In 2017, Piyumi also reached the finals of the Peter Drucker Challenge organized by the Global Peter Drucker Forum for her essay on inclusive prosperity Navigating the Battlefield of the Mind.

Tulip- shaped tower
One of Londons most recognizable buildings - the Gherkin - is about to get an equally eye-catching neighbour. The Tulip is a new cultural and tourist attraction designed by the firm that brought the famed Gherkin to the City of London in 2004. The collaboration between owners J. Safra Group and architects Foster + Partners calls for a 1,000-foot-high (305-meter-high) piece of contemporary architecture based on the form of a flower bud.
The structure uses its slender shape, which rounds out at the top, to leave a minimal building footprint as it aims to enhance the Culture Mile that has been built up in the city since the Millennium. A pocket park and a two-story pavilion that provides public access to the rooftop gardens are just part of the firms plan to create a functional yet sustainable piece of architecture. Additionally, the use of green walls increases the Tulips green surface area by 8.5 times.
Located at 30 St Mary Axe, the building itself will act as a new center for learning thanks to a facility that will offer 20,000 free classroom seats per year to Londons school children. Tourists and locals will also be able to enjoy panoramic views of the city from an observation gallery filled with interactive features like a sky bridge, gondola pod rides, and internal glass slides.
The Tulip will also be available to host cultural, educational, and technology events that J. Safra and Foster + Partners hope will add to the social and economic value of the area. Continuing the pioneering design of 30 St Mary Axe, the Tulip is in the spirit of London as a progressive, forward-thinking city, shares Norman Foster, Founder and Executive Chairman of Foster + Partner. It offers significant benefits to Londoners and visitors as a cultural and social landmark with unmatched educational resources for future generations.
Plans for the Tulip have been submitted and, if approved, construction could start in 2020 with an opening in 2025.

Jana Bala Meheyuma protest rally to register opposition to arbitrary decisions of the Executive will be held next week after the Supreme Court decision on petitions against the dissolution of Parliament, former Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing a gathering of UNP Provincial Councillors at Temple Trees yesterday. He said this rally would be more than a UNP rally as it would see the participation of non-partisan civil society members, professionals and artistes in large numbers.
A peoples movement has begun against the Presidents anti-democratic acts. We have been informed by our lawyers that the Supreme Court decision may be delivered after Wednesday and before Friday. The civil society requested us to delay the protest rally till the court ruling is given, he said. The UNP Leader, while admitting that their governance had shortcomings and that they were yet to keep some promises given to the people, however argued that it is up to the people to assess the performance of a Government at a future election.
Some of the protests in the past few days did not see the participation of politicians. There are Sathyagraha campaigns and meetings taking place regularly at places like Independence Square and the Vihara Maha Devi Park without the politicians attendance.
All those forces need to come together to make the Jana Bala Meheyuma a success, he said.
He also underlined the need to correct their former mistakes and commit to uphold the Parliamentary tradition and media culture that the people aspire.

Kataragama wastewater management project
No facilities for implementation
Not a single shop or business in the Kataragama town has been provided with facilities to discharge wastewater to the newly-constructed wastewater management project although contractors were ready to leave the country, the Kataragama Ekamuthu Traders Association said.
Kataragama Ekamuthu Traders Association President H.R.K. Sampath said that the project was completed at a cost of 11 million Euros (Rs.2.1 billion). The project had been completed after laying wastewater management pipes at all locations except Gotaimbara Mawatha, Abaya Mawatha, Saddathissa Mawatha and Kandula Mawatha.
The project, which was implemented under the Water Supply and Drainage Board, was provided with funds during the tenure of former Uva Province Chief Minister Shashindra Rajapaksa. The project was implemented during the past few years and completed recently.
Although the project was proposed to facilitate all hotels and houses of which 90 percent have separate rooms to lend for the pilgrims, it has not been accomplished.
The Kataragama Ekamuthu Traders Association President said there are around 280 hotels in the area, but only few have been facilitated. He added that those house owners earn their living by renting out rooms in their houses, and they still face of disposing the wastewater from their houses.
However, he added that the authorities had called for applications to provide facilities. The people applied after paying their dues, but the answer they received was rejected. They said that the answer was unfair as people had paid a large amount of money for it.
Queried by the media, the engineer in-charge of the project, Manjula Priyankara, said that he was transferred to Colombo following a promotion that he received. He added that another sum of Rs.20 million is needed to complete the project.
He also added that the money had to be taken by way of a Cabinet paper and that the project had to be completed.

President has taken a bold decision
President Maithirpala Sirisena should be commended and thanked for taking a bold decision to show that he is a leader with a strong backbone since the so-called yahapalana government failed to deliver its promises, said Ven. Bendiwewa Diyasena Thera.
It was because former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes government was engaged in measures opposing yahapalana norms that the President was forced to sack him and appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa in his place, he said.
Ven. Diyasena Thera was speaking at a press conference held by a collective of all religious leaders at the Niladiya Jevanaloka Deva Sabha premises recently.
Ven. Diyasena Thera said at times he failed to understand as to why the President exercised patience for such a long period as three-and-a-half years without taking this measure earlier. If people were asked to name a government that had reneged on the most number of promises made, they would naturally select the yahapalana government led by the UNF.
He said at a time when this issue had gone to court for a solution, they had observed certain Parliamentarians making various statements which may even prejudice the court verdict.
Since sovereignty finally rests with the people, all religious leaders considered a general election as the best option to solve burning issues, he said.
The others who participated in the press conference were Kurukkal B.S. Thyagarajah of the Nilandiya Sri Muththumari Amman Kovil, Rev. G.G. Krishtan of the Deva Sabha, and Mowlavi H.H. Ashraf Ali of the Niladiya Mosque.

It boasts the same team that managed to create the incredibly complex Lord of the Rings franchise, but there was still one key element that made Mortal Engines really difficult to film.
The $AU137 million adaptation of Philip Reeves book is Oscar-winning director Peter Jacksons first major film since Lord of the Rings.
Speaking to news.com.au, Jackson - who worked as a screenwriter and producer for Mortal Engines  admitted that despite finding a way to bring Tolkiens Middle Earth to the big screen, there were parts of this production which proved surprisingly tricky.
Mortal Engines follows the story of mysterious young woman Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) - whos hellbent on revenge for her mothers death - in a world set hundreds of years after civilisation was destroyed by a cataclysmic event, where gigantic moving cities now roam the Earth, ruthlessly preying upon smaller traction towns.

When stars get bigger, stories disappear
What if a two-year-old toddler gets trapped at home, alone The thought is enough to send shivers down the spine of any parent. National Award winning Director Vinod Kapri has created a feature film out of this claustrophobic idea.
Featuring little Myra Vishwakarma as the titular Pihu, the film explore every parents worst nightmare. Releasing on November 16, Pihu has received much critical acclaim in Indian and international film festivals. Kapri shares the journey of Pihu from a one line idea to the silver-screen.
When you search for a new story, you try to understand all that is happening around you. A small incident happened some years ago. My friends fired their maid because she left their toddler kid alone in the house for 2 to 3 hours to do shopping for herself. They were angry at her irresponsible behaviour, he said.
Every child deserve a parent, but not every parent deserve a child, is the message of this film, Kapri said.
Speaking about the lack of famous names in his movie Kapri adds, When we see a person on 70mm and connect with him or her, that is when they become a star. Either known or unknown, love of audience for a person seen on the silver-screen makes him or her a star. We can say that Pihu is a non-star film but when the trailer of such a film gets 80 lakh views, that means a star is already born. Also, if a viewer connects with the girl within five minutes, it means you have a star. There are some misconceptions regarding stardom. Why a Badhaai Ho is getting more love from audiences than a Thugs of Hindostan which had a bigger star-cast Ultimately, it all comes down to that fact whether viewers are able to connect with characters and story of a film. If that is achieved than everyone associated with the film is a star.

Winds of change
Sanskrit storm band Whirlwind has as its foundation a powerful message conveyed through Sanskrit (Magadhi) words and it is  Manusang Dehang Devakayang Paripuressanthi - A pure conscience reflects godlike features within and completes your divinity. Melodies speaks to Misha of Whirlwind, a Sri Metal band whose music is like a storm that brings change, cleansing, purging and restoring balance.
Misha points out that Sri Metal is the official sub-genre exclusive to the band Whirlwind. The genre has a much deeper meaning than just Sri Lankan Metal or Sinhalese Metal Music. It becomes Sri Metal simply because of the content and message it carries to the world from a third world perspective and experience, and it is not just because it contains Sinhala Lyrics, thats only one aspect. Sri Metal is a multilingual genre that contains Sinhala lyrics and supporting lyrics from various other languages.
The name of the band came about through the idea of a storm bringing change. A storm brings cleansing, a storm will purge and restore balance. Our genre is Sri Metal, over time weve perfected our sound into a unique flavour of metal. Sinhala language originated from Sanskrit, which is the oldest known language to mankind. It has been both a gateway and an inspiration for many other languages to originate and evolve. So when observed carefully with other languages and dialects, you are bound to find many resemblances in both vocabulary and meaning that goes hand in hand. Which is why Sinhalese or Sinhala is the main ingredient of Sri Metal, said Misha.
When it comes to inspiration, Misha pointed out that the list keeps growing every day since the four band members come from slightly different backgrounds of musical and social inspirations. Some of the bands that inspire them are Black Sabbath, Dio, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slayer, Arch Enemy, Death, Iced Earth, Nevermore, Black Label Society, Dream Theather, Opeth, Children of Bodom, Devildriver, Dimmu Borgir and Behemoth.
Misha commented that the feeling the band members get when the crowd loves their music is very gratifying saying that it is an inspiring feeling, both mixed with a sense of accomplishment.
Misha stressed that we create our own demons, conditioning the minds of our children to look at the world through our own perspectives which resulted in them making the same mistakes that we make. The 30 year old civil war is one example where we invited doom. Our disaster was of our own making.
Whirlwind carries a unifying, uplifting message that ascends from dark emotions. It is a cry out for liberation from the shackles of social conditioning. As a band hailing from a country that had faced and understood the repercussions of senseless war brought upon humanity by their own making through the illusion of Race, Religion, Culture, and Politics, the only message we wish to convey is Manusang Dehang Devakayang Paripuressanthi - A pure conscience reflects godlike features within and completes your divinity, explained Misha.
Without a shadow of doubt Whirlwind creates powerful music. The intensity and passion within them is channeled through their music. They have been through a lot in life and collaborate and work well as a team. They are very strong as a unit able to adapt to change.
It all starts with a concept that drives into emotion and expression. When youve been through as much as we have you only become stronger and better. Team effort goes a long way, being able to collaborate and accept change as you expand has always been our strength, added Misha.
When it comes to writing their lyrics, Misha say they feel very strongly about social conditioning, attributing much of the evil in the world to social conditioning. We prune the thoughts of our children and turn them into copies of ourselves. In his words  the majority of the present society remains blind to the very nature of their imprisonment. Misha says that Whirlwind is about exposing the frailties of society.
The first inspiration arises as you realize that the majority of the present society remains blind to the very nature of their imprisonment, ignorantly embracing social conditioning and everything else that comes with it. We are all about exposing the verity of this matrix either it may be religious, political or social, pointed out Misha.
Up to now the band have released 2 full-length albums each containing 11 tracks. They have released up to 4 singles and 3 music videos.
Misha says their passion for music comes from the belief that it is not a coincidence that they have been brought together. This would make one think they maybe Misha is hinting that they have been brought together by fate or a higher power. Music to them is the one true international language that everyone on earth can appreciate.
We are all beings of vibration, and if it wasnt for vibration we would not exist. Music is the only common language that translates through every living being on this earth. We are all grateful for each other as a band and we strongly believe that it is not a coincidence that the four of us are doing this together, and thats the source of our passion for music, said Misha.
The Music Industry in Sri Lanka is not easy to thrive in and one needs to be assertive and forceful. As Misha says, Sri Lanka is still growing, and we still dont have a proper music industry, to begin with, but none the less you require a consciously creative yet determined personality to survive in this jungle of a so-called music industry.
If you take the industry for our type of music, it is really tough for any band that pursues pure originality in our category of music. Especially for us, as we speak of very uncommercial and dark topics, the mainstream media often tries to neglect content filled works of art whether it may be audio or visual, explained Misha.
Mishas last word are very powerful  We project a very aggressive image, and as for the theme, the main core concept lies behind these ancient Sanskrit (Magadhi) words, A pure conscience reflects godlike features within and completes your divinity.

365  days of miniature paper  birds
India-based artists Nayan Shrimali and Vaishali Chudasama create tiny bird illustrations out of hand-cut paper. The incredible paper sparrows, doves, owls, and more are all part of an going paper art project titled 365 Days of Miniature.
For this self-appointed creative challenge, the creative duo have set themselves the ambitious goal of creating one mini paper bird every day for an entire year.
To create each feathery friend, Shrimali and Chudasama hand-cut various layers from watercolor paper before assembling them into the final 2.5 dimensional look. Taking around 4 to 6 hours to finish, each piece is then hand-painted with lifelike colours and intricate details.
Their portfolio of miniatures include exotic, vibrant birds such as a parrot and a pink Roseate Spoonbill, as well as common woodland birds such as a Barn Swallow and a Gold Finch. Theyve even created a series of adorable, extra-tiny chicks!
The artists say, We enjoyed each bird everyday and learned a lot about birds and their nature while making them. Each paper bird is photographed either perching on a twig, walking in sand, or held up to look as if theyre swooping through the air - just as if they were really living in the wild.
Keep up to date with Shrimali and Chudasamas daily paper bird creations on Instagram, where the artists post interesting facts about each bird alongside their illustrations.

Aquatic plants disrupt freshwater fishing

Freshwater fisherfolk in Hambantota have been left high and dry as most tanks in the district have been overrun by aquatic plants.
Fisherfolk said that they found it impossible to use fishing nets because they get entangled in the plants. Hambantota National Aquaculture Development Authority Officer Gayan Chandrasena said that the phenomenon has hindered the breeding of freshwater fish as well.
Hambantota Irrigation Engineer Buddika Wijesekera said that although aquatic plants had spread at an alarming rate in Ridiyagama, the Irrigation Department did not have the proper equipment to remove them.

Bangladeshs NPLs hit all-time high at BDT 1 trillion
The amount of classified loans in the banking sector of Bangladesh reached an all-time high of nearly BDT 1.0 trillion in September ahead of the upcoming national polls.
The volume of non-performing loans (NPLs) jumped by nearly 34 per cent to BDT 993.70 billion as on September 30, from BDT 743.03 billion as on December 31, 2017 despite close monitoring of the central bank. It was BDT 803.07 billion a year ago,
However, the amount of NPLs increased by more than 11 per cent or BDT 100.30 billion to BDT 993.70 billion during the third quarter (Q3) of this calendar year from BDT 893.40 billion in the preceding quarter (Q2).
The share of classified loans also rose to 11.45 per cent of the total outstanding loans during the period under review from 9.31 per cent nine months ago, according to the central banks latest statistics.
The default loans include substandard, doubtful and bad/loss of total outstanding credits, which stood at BDT 8,680.07 billion as on September 30, 2018, from BDT 7,981.96 billion as on December 31, 2017. It was BDT 7,527.30 billion as on September 2017.
Senior bankers as well as experts said the amount of classified loans in the banking system has increased during the period under review, as some borrowers did not make repayment of installments against their rescheduled loans.
They also said a portion of restructured large loans has already turned into classified ones that also pushed up the overall volume of NPLs in the banking system.
The central bank cleared proposals of 11 business groups for restructuring their large loans amounting to around Tk 153.26 billion. A total of 22 commercial banks had earlier forwarded the proposals to the Bangladesh Bank (BB) for approving the loan restructuring on behalf of their clients.
A senior executive of a leading private commercial bank (PCB) indentified that political intervention has worsened the corporate governance in the banking sector, suggesting that the government should promptly take action to restore discipline in the financial sector. He also said legal complexities are one of the impediments to recovering the default loans from habitual defaulters.

Beast Yours eyes !
A Disney superfan has spent 30 hours creating a Beauty And The Beast-inspired Christmas tree.
Sian Teesdale, 29, from Swansea, spent eight hours every day for three days handcrafting red and yellow decorations for her magical tree. As well as hand-painting baubles to get them the same shade of yellow as Belles iconic ball gown, Sian made rose baubles, red and yellow silk satin bows and a scarlet skirt to sit under the tree.
After perfecting her decorations and forking out around 120 on some official Disney ornaments, professional princess Sian then devoted six hours to dressing the 7ft snow-dusted artificial fir.
Sian, a mum-of-one, said, Last Christmas was the first time I decided to look into having a Beauty And The Beast themed tree but this year I wanted it to be bigger and better. I couldnt find any yellow baubles so I had to paint loads of baubles myself to get them the same shade as Belles dress. I stuck red roses to some baubles and glitter on others and made all the yellow and red bows. It didnt cost me a lot but it took me about 24 hours over three days to get all the decorations perfect. The Disney ornaments on the tree were quite expensive. I have ten in total and they cost about 10 to 12 each. Some of them are from Disneyland. I would love to have more. Im collecting them as I go along. It then took me six hours to dress the tree so its had a lot of time dedicated to it but Im so happy with how its turned out, she said.
I love it. I want to keep it up all year. I love how the yellow and red look. I think theyre really Christmassy colours. This years tree is Belle themed but it would be nice next year to do a blue and yellow tree as well for Beast.
Sian is a professional princess and dresses up for childrens parties
My little girl is too young to appreciate the tree just yet. She loves all the lights. Im sure when shes a bit older she will be like wow mummy, Sian said.
Sian, who lives with her husband Lee Teesdale, 34, and their little girl Arabelle Teesdale, one, has adored Belle since she was four.Sian, who even named her daughter after the Disney princess, has turned her obsession into a career dressing as Disney princesses for kids parties, events and to visit childrens hospitals.All the children in her community know Belle lives in Sians house which is filled with Sians ever-growing collection of Beauty And The Beast trinkets.
She added, I just love Beauty And The Beast - its story and its message. Belle is so kind and she changes the Beast to be more kind. I love the message of not judging a book by its cover and how beauty is found on the inside. Belle is a really big part of my life. My daughter Arabelle is even named after her. And all the kids in our community know Belle lives in our house. Getting to be Belle and other Disney princesses as my job is incredible. I have met so many amazing people. I love teaching children the message from Beauty and the Beast. One time a little girl walked up to Beast and told him he was beautiful. It was so sweet. The Sun

Bowling action of Akila  Dananjaya found to be illegal


The International Cricket Council on Monday announced that an independent assessment has found the bowling action of Sri Lankas off-spinner Akila Dananjaya to be illegal and, as such he has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect.
The assessment revealed that his deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations.
In accordance with Article 11.1 of the ICC Regulations For The Review of Bowlers Reported with Suspect Illegal Bowling Actions, Dananjayas international suspension will also be recognised and enforced by all National Cricket Federations for domestic cricket events played in their own jurisdiction.
However, according to Article 11.5 of the Regulations and with the consent of the Sri Lanka Cricket, Dananjaya may be able to bowl in domestic cricket events played under the auspices of the SLC.

Bribery Commission  made 48 arrests this year
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption has made 48 arrests this year during raids conducted for accepting bribes, the Commission said in a press statement on Sunday.
The statement was issued to brief the Commissions progress.
The statement highlighted that convictions in 62 trials have been achieved as a result of the successful prosecution by the Commission this year. Last year, that number was 57. This has to be compared with the statistics of the period between 2005 and 2010. In most instances, the number of convictions ranged from 15 to 20. In light of this, it is submitted that Bribery Commission officers conducted prosecutions with an aim to achieve convictions, rather than merely filing cases, the statement added.
The Commission observed that high ranking officials, such as the Import and Exports Controller, Timber Corporation Chairman, Animal Production and Health Department Chairman, Senior Assessor and Inspector of Police, were among those arrested during this year.
The Commission had received 3,081 complaints by November 30, and of them it has decided to conduct further investigations into 1,863 complaints.
In 2017, 2,768 complaints were received with investigations conducted into 1,652 cases, the statement added.
The statement also reveals that 13,000 applications were received for 250 vacancies advertised by the Bribery Commission. Two hundred individuals will be recruited as specialized investigators and another 50 individuals will be recruited as prevention officers.
The Commission reiterated that private sector bribery, sexual bribery, sports bribery, bribery pertaining to foreign diplomats have been included into the new Bribery Act, which is being drafted by the Legal Draftsmans Department.
The Commission will also launch a five-year National Policy in combating bribery and corruption in the country.
Formulation of this action plan has already been completed and contains four strategies. It will be launched with proposed guidelines on accepting gifts, proposed guidelines on conflict of interests, handbook pertaining to integrity of public officials and proposals with regard to asset declaration law, CIABOC Act, Bribery Act, election campaigns finance law, proceeds of crimes law and whistle-blower protection law, the statement explained.
During this year, the Commission has conducted 54 awareness programmes among school children, youth and public officials across Sri Lanka.
It identifies the lack of adequate office space and the inadequate salary regime which renders the Commission unable to attract talented lawyers as legal officers as main challenges it has faced.

Business INDEX UP DESPITE TURMOIL
The latest edition of LMD magazine reports that the LMD-Nielsen Business Confidence Index (BCI) moved up from 85 in October to 110 in November, representing the highest jump by 25 basis points.
Although this proved to be a flash in the pan with a reversal of 46 basis points a month later.
Political instability remains one of the biggest national and business concerns; but businesses feel that there would be measures towards improving the ease of doing business by whichever regime assumes power next, says Nielsens Managing Director Sharang Pant.
According to the magazine, the seismic shift in power or attempt to establish such a changeover on the political platform with a new administration being sworn in, even as the incumbent steadfastly refused to cede what it claimed was its rightful position in parliament, has certainly had a ripple effect on multiple fronts.
While some stopped at describing the goings on as a constitutional crisis, others charged that what transpired was in fact a constitutional coup albeit sans the use of weapons or widespread bloodshed.
It may come as a surprise therefore, that amid the constitutional impasse and ugly political wrangling at the time, business confidence has been restored in no uncertain terms  although importantly, it should be noted that the latest LMD-Nielsen Business Confidence Index (BCI) survey was conducted during the first week of November, which was in the immediate aftermath of the presidents appointment of a new prime minister on October 26 but before the dissolution of parliament on November 9 and what has transpired since then, LMD revealed.

## Supertitle: World Soil  Day 2018
## Section: Features

World Soil  Day 2018
call for  solution to soil pollution
World Soil Day fell on December 5. The International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS), in 2002, adopted a resolution proposing December 5 as World Soil Day to raise awareness on the importance of soil as a critical component of the natural system and as a vital contributor to human well-being.
Within the framework of the Global Soil Partnership, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has supported the formal establishment of World Soil Day as a global awareness-raising platform.
Soil is a finite natural resource and on a human time-scale it is non-renewable. However, despite the essential role that soil plays in human livelihoods, there is a worldwide increase in degradation of soil resources due to inappropriate management practices, population pressure driving unsustainable intensification of soil and land use, and inadequate governance. Therefore, the objectives of World Soil Day are to address these issues and conserve soil resources through global and national campaigns.
This year, the theme of World Soil Day is Be the solution for soil pollution and attention has been focused on pollution, one of the most serious issues in soil degradation. In Sri Lanka too, various programmes were organised to raise awareness of soil pollution. The main programme was held in the Dambugasagala micro watershed in Welimada. The event was organised by the Rehabilitation of Degraded Agricultural Lands Project (RDALP) of the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry, Agriculture Department and Uva Provincial Council. The RDALP project is implemented in the Kandy, Badulla and Nuwara Eliya districts in the central highlands, where soil degradation has become a serious issue today and the project is co-financed by Global Environment Facility (GEF), FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka.
According to the National Report on Desertification/Land Degradation in Sri Lanka - 2000, land degradation in the central highlands is a severe problem where steep slopes, high intensity of rainfall and inappropriate land use have led to high rate of soil erosion and landslides.
According to the Agriculture Department, the major source of land degradation is associated with agriculture. At present, the problem of soil erosion exists in 44 percent of agricultural lands in the country.
RDALP Project Manager Nimal Gunasena said that land degradation has emerged as a serious problem in Sri Lanka. It has been estimated that nearly one-third of the land in the country is subjected to soil erosion. Soil erosion and soil fertility decline are the two main types of land degradation observed in the central highlands. About 50 percent of agricultural lands in the central highlands has already been degraded. Comparative studies of soil erosion by zones have shown that, out of 25 administrative districts in the country, the districts which represent the central highlands, including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla, have the highest levels of land degradation, he said.
Severe erosion takes place on sloping lands under market gardens (vegetables and potatoes), tobacco, poorly managed seedling tea and chena (slash and burn) cultivation. Land degradation in the central highlands has been threatening the ability of agro-ecosystems in the area to provide global environmental benefits and to sustain the economic activities and livelihoods of the people depending on ecosystem goods and services, Gunasena said.
The RDALP is introducing and promoting sustainable land management (SLM) practices among farmers and the public to reduce soil degradation. The RDALP campaign has also focused on attitudes change, skill development, and community participation in SLM.
RDALP has also initiated knowledge sharing and awareness programmes on SLM for schoolchildren together with the Provincial Education Department of the Central and Uva Provinces.
Under this programme, schoolchildren are encouraged to learn about land degradation through outdoor learning activities. The objectives of the programme are to create a pleasing learning environment in the school applying SLM techniques, to develop a sense of responsibility for the land and other natural resources, and to inculcate the habit of protecting the environment from a young age.
Soil degradation creates economic and social issues as well. Decline in soil fertility leads to low yield and low income to farmers. Therefore SLM can increase soil fertility, yield and farmer income. For instance, yield in the potatoes cultivation in Welimada and Nuwara Eliya areas has now declined significantly. Therefore the RDALP campaign directly targets the increase of farmer income through introducing SLM practices, Gunasena said.
Soil pollution is also a major issue in Sri Lanka. One of the main factors for soil pollution is use of agrochemicals such as inorganic fertilizer and pesticides and weedicides. According to the FAO, since the late 1950s, Sri Lankan farmers are applying inorganic fertilizer to enhance crop yields. Productivity increase programmes and fertilizer subsidy schemes in the country paved the way for dramatic increase of agrochemical usage. During the last 15 years, importation of fertilizer to the country shows a positive trend. The SLM practices introduced by the RDALP include limiting inorganic fertilizer usage to soil and crop requirements, promoting organic fertilizer, and integrating animal husbandry and crop cultivation.
The FAO has recognised soil pollution as a hidden reality. A report published by the FAO recently titled Soil Pollution a Hidden Reality said soil pollution often cannot be directly assessed or visually perceived, making it a hidden danger. The status of the Worlds Soil Resources Report (SWSR) identified soil pollution as one of the main soil threats affecting global soils and the ecosystem services provided by them.
According to the report, soil pollution refers to the presence in the soil of a chemical or substance out of place and/or present at a higher than normal concentration that has adverse effects on any non-targeted organism.
Concerns about soil pollution are growing in every region. Recently, the United Nations Environmental Assembly (UNEA-3) adopted a resolution calling for accelerated actions and collaboration to address and manage soil pollution. This consensus, achieved by more than 170 countries, is a clear sign of the global relevance of soil pollution and of the willingness of these countries to develop concrete solutions to address the causes and impacts of this major threat.
The main anthropogenic sources of soil pollution are the chemicals used in or produced as byproducts of industrial activities, domestic, livestock and municipal wastes (including wastewater), agrochemicals, and petroleum-derived products.
New concerns are being raised about emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, hormones and toxins, among others, and biological pollutants, such as micropollutants in soils, which include bacteria and viruses. Based on scientific evidence, soil pollution can severely degrade the major ecosystem services provided by soil.
Soil pollution reduces food security by both reducing crop yields due to toxic levels of contaminants and by causing crops produced from polluted soils to be unsafe for consumption by animals and humans.
Scientific research demonstrates that soil pollution directly affects human health. Risks to human health arise from contamination from elements such as arsenic, lead, and cadmium, organic chemicals such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics.
Governments are also urged to facilitate remediation of contaminated soils that exceed levels established to protect the health of humans and the environment. It is also essential to limit pollution from agricultural sources by the global implementation of sustainable soil management practices, the report said.

China to overtake US as worlds biggest fashion market
China is expected to overtake the United States as the largest fashion market in 2019, according to a report by McKinsey & Company and media outlet The Business of Fashion.
The wealth of Chinas nearly 1.4 billion people saw rapid increase, creating new consumer groups who have capacity to spend on sports, entertainment, clothes and shoes, news website Quartz reported, adding its shaping the way the fashion industry operates.
For example, Italian brand Ermenegildo Zegna now looks to China, instead of the US, as the place for testing new products, before deciding whether to promote them globally.
The website said many luxury brands already depend heavily on Chinese customers, who have for some time been the worlds biggest buyers of luxury goods.
Thanks to the ascendance of Chinas younger shoppers, as well as policies unveiled by the government to encourage domestic consumption, much of that spending is moving back inside the country.
Meanwhile, more Chinese are now embracing homegrown brands. International brands established in the market look to be cooling off, the website said quoting Achim Berg, who leads McKinseys global apparel, fashion, and luxury practice.
We also see that local brands are now coming up and becoming players, he said. I think this desire to only buy international brands in the mid-markets is also waning a bit.
Over the past year, the global fashion industry has reached new heights. The report predicts growth of 4 to 5 percent in 2018, slightly ahead of earlier projections for 2018.

Epoch-making speech of Anura Bandaranaike
Ransacking my old collection of books, periodicals and paper clippings, I came across a very interesting speech of the then Speaker to the House of Representatives Anura Bandaranaike made on June 20, 2001 on the standing of the Speaker, the Parliament vis-a-vis the Judiciary, which I consider is relevant today with the no confidence motion proposed by the government members in Parliament. Given below are some excerpts from that lengthy speech.
In his open address he says Hon. Members, I wish on this occasion, to make a statement concerning an issue which is of utmost importance and vital concern to all members of this House, which has been occasioned by an unprecedented event which occurred two weeks ago, namely, the issue of two orders by the Supreme Court seeking to restrain me, as your Speaker, from appointing a Select Committee of Parliament .
The further orders contemplated in the two applications made to the Court, are very far-reaching nature and if granted would entail a stoppage of the contemplated proceedings under Standing Order 78A, which Hon. Members would please to see, is a complete and decisive intervention, amounting to interference, with the internal affairs of this House, over which the House alone is complete master and in sole control. This is a right and privilege which elected Legislatures of this country have long enjoyed and claimed to possess without it ever being challenged by any Court or other authority and unbridled by the laws and the Constitutions that have governed our affairs.
I am also deeply conscious of my responsibility.These rights and privileges are considered to be essential to the proper performance of the functions and duties of this House, and they constitute the collective inheritance of Parliament empowered by the law of the State that neither the Speaker nor any single member of the House can renounce or surrender or otherwise abrogate. Any such right, privilege, immunity or power does not cease unless it be by legislative amendment of the current law.
Then he goes on to quote extensively from British House of Commons and also Erskine May over the supremacy of the Legislature  Parliament over the Judiciary and finally quotes our local judges H.N.G. Fernando and Attorney General v Samarakkody- As was observed by an eminent judge of our own Court H.N.G. Fernando J[as he was then] in Attorney-General v Samarakkody [1955] NLR Section 3 of the Parliamentary [Powers and Privileges] Act of 1953 is an adaptation of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights. In that case in proceedings taken under Section 23 [1] of the Act, on an Application made to the Supreme Court, on an allegation that the Respondents were guilty of an offence triable by the Supreme Court, it was held that the conduct within the scope of the Respondent, even if it was disrespectful was not justifiable by the Supreme Court. It was considered to be conduct within the scope of Section 3 and 4 of the said act and therefore be questioned or impeached in proceedings taken before the Supreme Court. The jurisdiction to take cognizance of such conduct was accordingly deemed to be exclusively vested in the House of Representatives.
There are more important and urgent matters which our parliamentarians have to focus their attention for socio-economic development of this country rather than petty personal and party differences, which have brought disgrace to the nation, locally and internationally and it is best for sanity to prevail and not make the Parliament a garbage dump.

70th International  Human Rights Day
Civil Society groups,TUs call for upholding democracy
Civil Society groups and trade unions celebrating the 70th International Human Rights Day called on all progressive groups to band together to uphold democracy in the country.
A commemoration organized by the group Right to Life at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday had a Intellectual Discourse with speakers from various civil society groups, Human Rights Activist, Nimalka Fernando, TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran, Attorney-at-Law and Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna and National Trade Unions Front President Saman Rathnapriya.
Our country is facing a coup right now and as far as we know it, there are only two parties in this struggle; those who are against it and those who support it- there is none in between. So we need to defeat this, said Right to Life, Executive Director, Philip Disanayaka.
He explained that civil society member, trade unions and activists had met on November 24 and lent their unconditional support to the UNP and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to defeat the coup.
Dasanayaka also commended all groups for having coming together despite their differences at this time to defeat a common enemy.
Today we have been able to defeat 80 percent of this coup, just a little more to go, he said.
The Civil Society activist who also called for legal action to be taken against those who instigated the current political crisis also mentioned that they needed to put pressure for reforms to prevent such a disaster in future. Dasanayake also observed that it was necessary for a civil society movement devoid of political interests to be formed, so that they could push for reforms regardless of whichever government was in power.
Sumanthiran in the meantime said that human rights in this country have been violated on various occasions in the country and that the Executive Presidency since its inception in 1978 has been party to it.
Further the three decade war too contributed to many violations unchecked, he said.
The MP stressed that with the recent political changes, many feared that the relative political freedom they had enjoyed in the last four years would disappear and an environment of terror which they fought to change prior to January 8 would return.
We have to take all possible steps to defeat this. We are awaiting a final verdict from the courts but if we lose this, human rights in this country would take a major step back and we would lose all the progress we made overnight.
He also stated that a persistent majoritarian thinking in the country was also once again raising its head within the current political crisis, with many stating that the TNA should not get itself involved in the current crisis as it does not concern them.
We have to move away from this, and until this happens, human rights would always be a question in the country.
Fernando meanwhile stressed on not supporting any one individual or party but coming together to defeat undemocratic moves. As a member of the Office of the Missing Persons, she explained that the truth could only be found in an environment which is free, devoid of fear and where an independent judiciary functioned. Whilst clarifying that human rights cannot be seen within an international or national spectrum, she stated this time, they would have to join the political powers to defeat the attack against democracy, Development, democracy and human rights have to go together.
Member of some civil society groups are also currently engaged in a silent protest against the government at the Viharamahadevi Park for the last 20 days.

Attempt to intimidate Ministry Secretaries
Dayasiri lashes out at Patali
Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekera yesterday blamed UNF Parliamentarian Patali Champaka Ranawaka for attempting to cripple public service by intimidating Ministry Secretaries.
Jayasekera added Ranawaka said that several Ministry Secretaries would be summoned before Parliamentary Committees for questioning on the basis of recent decisions taken by them.
He asked Ranawaka as to how these officials can be summoned before Parliamentary Committees, when Parliament has not appointed these Committees yet.
Parliament has not appointed a Committee on Public Accounts, Committee on Public Enterprise of Priviledge Committee. How can Ranawaka summon them before these committees under this situation, he queried.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, Jayasekera requested all Ministry Secretaries not to show hesitation in discharging their service to the public.
He said that the public service should function efficiently as the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers have been temporarily prevented from discharging their duties.
Public servants should take the country forward at this point of time. Nobody can think where this country would be, if the public servants were not in a position to discharge their duties, Jayasekera said
He said that they are ready to stand up for the public servants.
We will extend our fullest cooperation to all public servants in the country, he said.
He commended the Government officials for discharging their duties despite the political instability in the country. The public service continues unabated because of public servants, he said.
Jayasekera added that President Maithripala Sirisena has become the most powerful leader in the country since 1802 with the temporary Court of Appeal order preventing the Cabinet of Ministers holding office.
A king is now ruling country and his order has come into force in every nook and corner of the country, he said.
Jayasekera added that the previous government harassed public servants who worked tirelessly for the well-being of the public by establishing the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).
Public officials showed hesitation in discharging their service to the public during the previous regime. Honest government servants were afraid of discharging their duties because of these type of institutions established by the previous government.

Our mother passed away 16 yeas ago on December 13, 2002, having lived up to the age of 92.
She was the mother of three sons, two daughters, three daughters-in-law and one son-in-law, as well as a grandmother of nine. She was an accomplished and gracious lady who helped those who sought her assistanceand was loved by all. She brought us up as useful citizens in society.
Our gratitude to her is beyond all boundaries and today we pay homage with Mathupadan Namamahan.
She was the loving wife of A.D. Benjamin of Wadduwa, and as a devoted wife, she fulfilled all duties.
Their family life was excellent. She was a devout Buddhist and worked for the development of Sri Lankaramaya temple in Wadduwa.
She was a wonderful, devoted, loving and kind personality who endeavoured to keep everybody happy. She is immortalised in our memories as a source of pride to our family. She was a simple, unassuming, upright, calm and honest person. Aggression was never in her vocabulary; she was a a loving personality with a beautiful heart.
The flower blossoms and fades, the sun rises and descends; but the memories dignified and gracious deeds and accomplishments of our mother, would linger on never to fade away.
It is the fervent hope of all that her journey through Sansara be swift and short until she attains the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.

## Section: Finance
## Date: Tuesday, December 11, 2018 - 01:00
So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 14
Dotting the is and crossing the ts in start-up tasks is your remit
As the main stakeholder of your company,it is your responsibility to perform all your start-ups chores, or at least personally see to it that they get done. But you need to personally take care of all-important tasks at least - those responsibilities that will, down the road, either make or break your enterprise if they arent done correctly.
In this instalment, we walk you through the many hats you must wear as you navigate these sometimes-mundane details.
By this time, you should have completed your start-up tasks like writing a business plan, determining the legal entity that works best for you, locating financing, and selecting the product or service, many of which we discussed in previous instalments. Now you have to dive into the nitty-gritty details.
Buying insurance
One of the first things you need to do is to purchase insurance. Were talking about insurance for vehicles, fire, theft etc, as well as workers health and compensation insurance.
Unfortunately, insurance is an expense that never goes away and generally increases every year. Making things worse is the fact that, if youre like most entrepreneurs, after you sign the original policies, youll file them away and wont consider shopping around to get a better price for long periods of time. Dont even think about entrusting the creation and negotiation of your initial insurance package to anyone else. You need to take care of this important task.
Theft insurance: Sooner or later, someone is going to steal something of value from you. If youre in the high-ticket retail or wholesale business, you should purchase theft insurance. You dont need to purchase enough theft insurance to cover all your inventory; just buy enough to cover what one person or two could reasonably steal.
Property (including inventory) insurance: In addition to the physical property you own, rent, or lease, property damage insurance covers your inventory. Similar to homeowners insurance, property damage insurance is oftenrequired by the terms of a lease or bank loan. Fire Insurance, vehicle insurance, cash-in-transit insurance, stock-in-trade insurance, workers compensation insurance including medical, disability and death are other insurance needs.
It is advisable to obtain the services of an experience insurance agent/consultant for necessary advice and also to get the advantage of pricing.
Pay Government and local taxes
These taxes come in a mind-boggling array, depending on your industry. Your accountant or the selected auditor will advise you. When youre short on cash, make sure that you pay any taxes you owe the government first, even if you have to put off paying your private vendors. Government, especially the central government, has an enormous array of collection tools at their disposal, and they have the right to extract a dear price (in the form of onerous penalties and interest rates) from those who dont follow the letter of the law.
Negotiate leases
When youre leasing space for a start-up, aim for three years as an absolute maximum. If you think you may want thespace for a longer term, consider negotiating and adding to your lease agreement an escalation clause that stipulates upfront how much the rental rate will increase should you choose to extend the lease for a subsequent year or multiyear period.
Long-term leases are a no-win situation for the small- business owner: If your business grows, it will outgrow the long-term lease and youll pay a higher price for its cancellation; if your business doesnt grow, youll pay an even greater price to get out of the lease.
Maintain employee records
The day you hire your first employee is the same day you must create and begin maintaining your first employee-personnel folder. Be sure to maintain a written record for every employee, covering such issues as employment agreements (including salary history), performance reviews, business goals, commendations, and, of course, reprimands.
These records come in handy as you manage and motivate your employees. Such key managerial and motivational tools as goal-setting and performance reviews require that you keep detailed employee records for them to work. (We are going to cover this subject in detail in subsequent instalments).
Sooner or later, you might have a conflict with one or more of your employees - a conflict that in the worst case, is likely to end up in Labour Department. When a legal battle occurs, the party who can back up his or her claims with the most information usually prevails. Dont be the one whos handicapped by poor record-keeping and documentation.
Get licenses and permits
Almost all businesses require filing certain licenses and obtaining particular permits. Your accountant, auditor or company secretary (if you have one) will advise you.
Signing the cheques
Checks represent cash. From the day you hang out your nameboard until the day you close your doors, cash and cheques will be the lifeblood of your business. The annals of small business are filledwith stories of accounting officers who helped themselves to a hardworking entrepreneurs cash.
If your spouse is your accountant, you canrest easy. But what do you do when it is not You need to guard your cash like its your life. Schedule an audit twice every year. It doesnt have to be a full- fledged, expensive, cover-every-detail audit. Simply ask your auditor to spend a day reviewing your books. He (or she) knows the sensitive areas to focus on.
Outsourcing
We define outsourcing as delegating services you dont want to do, or dont have time to do, to someone outside your company, who can usually do them better and faster. The term outsourcing is a buzzword that has surfaced more in the past decade, but the concept itself isnt new. Businesses have been outsourcing, in one form or another, for many years.
The following list tells you which small-business functions are most frequently outsourced. You need to determine which out- sourcing options make the most sense for you.
Accounting and book-keeping
Accounting (the beginning-to-end process of collecting financial data, generating financial statements, and preparing tax forms) and bookkeeping (the collecting-of-financial-data function only) provide the gamut of outsourcing opportunities. You can, for example, hire someone to do all your accounting and bookkeeping, or you can recruit someone to do only your payroll, only your financial statements, or only your tax returns.
Because you, as typical entrepreneur, usually isnt well versed in accounting and bookkeeping skills, it may be a better idea that these functions be among the first you consider for outsourcing.
Human resources
As your company grows, the various functions of human resources should be next in line for outsourcing consideration. Human resources include a wide variety of non-product, non-customer, and non-sales-related issues, such as new-employee hiring procedures,policies and procedure manuals for employees,payroll and related information-gathering systems,employee training on human resource issues. Employee training includes on a wide variety of sensitive issues, such as ethics and sexual harassment
Manufacturing
If you are a small manufacturing company, you would know that the manufacturing processis expensive, time-consuming, and extremely detail oriented. For many entrepreneurs, especially the creative and/or sales types who typically gravitate to this career, outsourcing the manufacturing function makes a lot of sense. Even if your core business is manufacturing, some elements of your product may lend themselves to outsourcing their manufacture to sub-contractors. Dont worry, even Apple subcontract a good deal of their work.
Sales
Outsourcing sales is certainly the most potentially dangerous of the outsourcing options, but some businesses, including those that employ manufacturers representatives, do use it. We say potentially dangerous because its difficult to impart to outside sales people the enthusiasm and knowledge necessary to effectively sell your businesss product or service. Sales is definitely the last of the responsibilities to consider out-sourcing, although doing so works well for some small businesses.
Figuring out what to outsource
Heres the million-rupee question: How do you determine which services to outsource and which ones to retain in-house Business ownersare different in thinking and may have different views, but answering the following questions can help you make the best decision for your situation:
Can I better manage my available cash if I outsource The answer here primarily depends on how much cash you have. For example, by outsourcing the manufacturing process, you avoid the costs associated with maintaining an inventory of raw materials and hiring manufacturing employees. By outsourcing your sales functions, you avoid the costs associated with maintaining a sales force.
Like it or not, accounting is one of the most important functions of running your business. Whether you intend to eventually outsource your accounting or do all the work yourself, at the start-up stage, accounting demands your undivided attention. One of the most common mistakes we see entrepreneurs make in the start-up stage is to not learn how basic accounting works or how it applies to their business. Take it from us: Learn the basics early, or youll never take the time.
Common systems
You have three options to consider when determining which accounting system to employ:
An outside accounting services, An in-house manual bookkeeping system, An in-house computer-based accounting system
If you decide to go the outsourcing route (using an outside accounting service), you need to make that decision before you open your businesss doors. If you decide to use an in-house computer-based accounting system, you have to find out more about the manual and computer-based options.
We will talk about them next week.

Fairfirst Insurance reaches out to schools
With 2018 coming to a close Fairfirst has touched a new milestone of reaching out to over 1,000 schoolsand connecting with over 50,000 students as part of their community agenda.
For years Fairfirst Insurance have taken a prime standpoint in educating and building awareness among school children and the general public on the importance of road rules and regulations. This project has continued to be exercised in partnership with the Sri Lanka Traffic Police Headquarters since Fairfirsts operations under its former brand name.
According to statistics revealed by the Traffic Police Headquarters, an estimated 3,150 people have died last year owing to road accidents. In Sri Lanka, most of these accidents can be attributed to the blatant disregard for road rules by drivers and the lack of secure infrastructure and stringent laws.
A vital part of this initiative is the traffic warden program which focuses on growing and training the number of traffic wardens in the country. Attested within the Sri Lanka Motor Traffic Act  Section 162, a traffic warden is empowered with the authority of a traffic police officer. Children from schools all over the island usually take on this responsibility. The role centers on ensuring smoother traffic flow, reduced accidents and most importantly ensuring the safety of the school children.
In this regard Fairfirst carrys out tailor made training programs with hands on traininng sessions and live demonstrations from the Traffic Police personnel as to how traffic can be regulated near schools. To appraise the efforts and as a monitoring mechanism, participating students are issued a certificate by Sri Lanka Traffic Police where they are endorced as certifed Traffic Wardens.
What we aim to accomplish through these programs is to safeguard our countrys future generations stated Indika Hapugoda- Director Traffic Admin at the Sri Lanka Traffic Police Headquarters.
We have been working with Fairfirst for a long time now. Its a relationship that has moved from strength to strength and one that will continue in the years to come
Our hope is that, when these children themselves become the vehicle owners/drivers of tomorrow they will change this risky driving culture to one thats a lot safer. It may be a long shot, but for us this is what giving back to the community means. We are trying to make a difference, just like these children are stated Sasith Bambaradeniya Head of Marketing and Digital Solutions.

Flash and dash of snap-happy invaders
Ever since Federico Fellini, Italian film director and scriptwriter coined the term paparazzi in his film La Dolce Vita in 1960, the term stuck. The paparazzi are the bounty hunters of the media and some term them as the guerrilla photographers. No wonder the celebrities or whoever was in their viewfinder looked shocked.
The West until today has remained incapable of legally separating freedom of the press and the public icons private sanctity which is always subject to monitoring, criticizing, judging and sometimes even mocking. Princess Diana, who was killed in a car accident as result of paparazzi pursuit, is the most famous of victims. In 1997, that seemed horrifically true. Though French courts ruled that the photographers, who chased Princess Dianas car, were not to blame for her death, the paparazzis stunts would rarely seem so light-hearted again.
Certainly we had a pretty good pack of boisterously invasive snappers during our time at the House by the Lake. Some distinguished themselves from the pack with their astonishing instinct for taking the right picture at the right time. But they were babies compared to the paparazzi in Europe particularly because most our national newspapers had a decent outlook and could hardly be called scandal rags.
There were the aces such as the late Hector Sumathipala who was able to photograph people from any angle with great visual effect. He would seem to sneak up on his subjects from behind and capture them vividly with lightning fast snapshots. In those days, style was born of pure necessity. The cameras used were old Rolleiflexes with flashes that took an age to recharge. Photographers knew they would only get one chance, and that they had to be gunslinger fast.
More astonishing was the fact that Hector possessed the ability to focus faster than the eye to capture a split-second slice of real life. He was already a legend by the time I entered the tournament of the press.
Even as primary school students we were entranced by Hectors classic photograph of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike gazing at the sea from the old Parliament entrance. Directly in front of him was the statue of the countrys first Prime Minister Don Stephen Senanayake aligned in the same direction. If memory serves me right, the brilliant caption read something like: Two prime ministers with different perspectives gaze at the same horizon.
I was directly involved in an incident when my colleagues and I were accused of being in the same mould as the paparazzi. It was when the Australia national cricket team toured Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) and India in the last three months of 1969. The tour started with a whistle stop in Ceylon, where the Australians played three non-limited-over one-dayers and an unofficial Test.
The Old Observer then was conducting its music and singing talent search in collaboration with the countrys leading show-band The Jetliners. The Galle Face Hotels Coconut Grove was the weekend venue for the contests which were interspersed with dancing.
Colombos jet set frequented the popular shows and The Grove was the in place to be seen at on a Sunday night. It was certainly Colombos ultimate buzzing social scene. Everyone who needed to get into the fashionable swing of things never failed to Groove out at the Grove. The Observer team conducting the event included staff members Eustace Rulach, yours truly and photographers Rienzie Wijeratne and Chandra Weerawardena.
There was a set of young women who seemed to be camp followers of all visiting cricket squads. They spoke about casual relationships in the same way that the rest of us talked about high calorie counts. They considered themselves to be sexually liberated at a time when conservative Sri Lankan girls were never allowed to attend such functions unless accompanied by trusted chaperones.
These minxes preferred the company of mostly foreign celebrities and appeared to revel in wanton abandon on the dance floor. But strangely they did not seem liberated enough to have their pictures taken while dancing with members of the Aussie cricket squad. Now that was when the trouble began.
The women began bitching to their dancing partners about being snapped by Rienzie.
Our sole intention was to gather sufficient shots for a special photographic feature page of the Aussie squad unwinding. The diminutive Aussie wicket-keeper Brian Taber charged up to Rienzie and pointing to his camera asked him to: Bury the b.....d.
I edged between the adversaries and yelled some extremely innovative choice epithets into Tabers ear. The slanging match continued while we both raised our voices lest they be drowned by the music. Taber said he was going to do something to me too if we didnt stop taking pictures. I fired back reminding him that he was too short to do anything to anybody.
He then turned around and called on his pace bowling buddy, the towering Graham McKenzie for back up. By then Eustace Rulach who almost matched McKenzie in height waded into the fray. There was a scuffle as we protected the camera and the matter was finally settled without a serious breach of the peace. Besides it could have become a full-blown international incident.
There were more serious incidents such as when Kirthie Abeyesekera and photographer Chandra Weerawardena covered one of the most sensational murder cases at the time. Alfred de Zoysa, a powerful entrepreneur, the chief suspect in the Kalattawa murders was being escorted out of the Anuradhapura Magistrates court. Chandra kept snapping his picture as he was being frog-marched outside the court. The suspect, dubbed the Terror of Raja Rata suddenly elbowed aside his prison warders charged Chandra and kicked his camera smashing it beyond repair.
Alfred de Zoysa was subsequently found guilty of and hanged  not for damaging Chandras camera  but for a series of murders in the dark heartland of Anuradhapura. There were other lighter-hearted incidents such as when photographer W. Piyadasa and senior reporter Peter Balasooriya were forced to run for their lives, when chased by a clergyman murder suspect they attempted to snap outside the church rectory. It appeared to be a scene from a circus as the two elderly pressmen scooted down Kynsey Road pursued by the priest with flowing, grizzled beard wielding a murderous pole.
To add colour to the cameo the clergyman was dressed in brief pink shorts and a skinny to match. The scene was further enhanced by the flushed faces of the pursued as the pursuer bellowed threats in the vilest language ever heard from a man of the pulpit.
There were no camerawomen at the time. But I do recall just a single woman photographer we worked with. She was snappy, rebellious, argumentative and un-cooperative. She once insisted that we publish an offensive picture of a male athlete which bordered on the obscene. Her request was turned down by a crusty news editor who fired back at her: Theres no way we will use this obscenity. You snap-happy Mamarazzi!

Gammanpila tells opposition: Do not threaten senior public officers
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila urged the opposition not to drag senior public officers into their current political power struggle. He said these officers have been working under the UNP government and they have worked under the UPFA and would also continue to work under any forthcoming government. He urged the opposition not to threaten them with thuggery or any other means and let them function independently.
Addressing a media conference yesterday, Gammanpila said, MP-PC Ranawaka threatened the ministerial secretaries that they would punish them for the failure to comply with the resolution passed by the opposition suspending expenditure heads of certain ministries. He attempted to the instilled fear in public officers with a monstrous face. In a way I am glad that he did not threaten them that they would disappear like Ekneligoda, that they would be subjected to electric shock treatment like Suki Thillakasiri or they would be disabled forever like Sandeep or be subjected to thuggery by Marasinghe.
However, he reiterated that there is no legal basis for this motion passed in Parliament. We can explain and analyze the law, but unfortunately we cannot provide a brain for MP Ranawaka to understand the legal situation. For the benefit of the public I will repeat the legal effect of this resolution. All ministries have been allocated funds for the year 2018 by the Appropriation Act 30 of 2017.
If somebody wants to suspend or reduce any funds allocated to these ministries they should bring in an Amending Act for the Act no.30 of 2017. Without doing that just by bringing motions they cannot make any impact on the funds that are allocated, added Gammanpila.
On the other hand, he said in terms Article 152 of the Constitution, financial motions can only be brought by ministers with the approval of the Cabinet.
Therefore, he noted that the opposition cant bring a financial motion and such motions have no legal effect whatsoever. Its null and void before the law.
Educated public officers, being aware of this fact have decided to ignore this resolution passed. Hence there is no point in going after these officers after having passed an illegal null and void motion in parliament, Gammanpila said.

The edible glitter is first mixed into the espresso, which then rises as the hot milk and foam is added. The photogenic beverage costs 200 Indian Rupees, which converts to a very reasonable $3.
Those who have tried it say it tastes no different from normal cappuccinos, with the only difference being that the glitter clings to the drinkers lips. But hey - maybe some people love a sparkly mustache.

Ananda Padmasiri is a man for all seasons. Taking the life serenely, this remarkable man evolves with time naturally to constantly be in the limelight. Being a senior journalist and a lyricist Ananda over the decades has bequeathed the field of art with valuable material.
As the editor of Sathsara tabloid he has offered a helping hand to a gamut of budding singers and musicians to consolidate themselves in the sphere. Yet he never has asked anything in return from them except for warmth and long lasting friendship.
Gala musical event, Gee Anande 39 was held at the New Town hall, Colombo to felicitate Padmasiri on his 39 years stint in the art field.
The event was organized by Facebook friends of Ananda Padmasiri. Heartthrob of 1970s, Tissa Wijesurendra graced the occasion as the Chief Guest. The show was compeered by Mahesh Nissanka of SLRCs Sihinayaki Rae fame.
To mark the event, Gee Anande CD containing a non-stop version of songs penned by Ananda Padmasiri was launched along with a book dedicated to Anandas lifelong friend H R Jothipla.
The book Jothi Mathaka Ru contains 72 rare pictures of Jothipala with interesting stories revolving around them.
A host of popular artistes sang 39 songs penned by Padmasiri and the musical event was backed by veteran musician Sarath de Alwis and his band. The musical show began with the song Sanda Obai Piyanani written by Ananda to pay his gratitude to his demised father.
Speaking to the Daily News, TnC Ananda Padmasiri said, I once visited H R Jothipala as a fan and told him, I want to become a lyricist. He offered me a chance to pen the song Ape Adaraye Rasa Geethika in 1979. This was the very first lyric I wrote. This song voiced by Jothi and Latha came in the film Yugayen Yugayata. Vijaya Kumarathunga performed for the song in the film.
He continued, I have compiled this book on Jothipala as a mark of gratitude. I wanted to present it to Presidents Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya, who was Jothis brother-in-law, at this event. On his sudden demise, we decided to present the book today to his beloved wife, Irangani.
Being a senior lyricist and a journalist Padmasiri felicitating his friend at his own felicitation was a rare happening and a touching one. The serious looking and light hearted lyric composer now works closely with the new generation of singers.

Rains that began last Saturday in Ampara have inundated several low-lying areas and if it were to continue, a majority of the districts roads would be inaccessible.
Hundreds of houses in Akkaraipattu, Aalayadivembu, Thirukkovkil, Pottuvil, Addaicheniai, Kalmunai, Nintavur, and Kalnmunai have so far been submerged. Many roads in the Alayadivembu too, are under water. Meanwhile, a number of main roads in the Akkaraipattu municipality have been inundated as well.
The Ampara district had experienced severe droughts over the past few months and as a result, several thousand acres of paddy fields had been abandoned.
However, due to the prevailing inclement weather, the water levels of the Senenayake Samudra, the main irrigation tank in the district, is also increasing.
Meanwhile, the Pottuvil Meteorological Department had recorded that 24 hours after the rains began, 86mm of rainfall had been calculated on December 9, at 8.30 am.
If the inclement weather were to persist, more people would have to evacuate their homes.

Increased soil contamination puts food safety and food security at risk
FAO marks World Soil day with call for urgent action to reduce release of pollutants into soils
5 December 2018, Rome - Urgent action is needed to address soil pollution and contain the multiple threats it poses to global food safety and food security, said FAO today marking World Soil Day.
Thousands of chemicals, which are commercially produced on a large scale, plastic and electronic waste, non-treated wastewater can all become a source of soil pollution, paving the way for the pollutants to enter the food chain with serious consequences for the health and wellbeing of people and planet.
About 33 percent of all soils are degraded - and soils continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate, said Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo at the World Soil Day Ceremony at FAOs Rome headquarters. Soil acts as a filter for contaminants. But when its buffering capacity is exceeded, contaminants can enter the environment and the food chain. This undermines food security by making crops risky and unsafe for consumption.
Human activities are the main source of soil pollution. It is in our hands to adopt sustainable soil management practices, she added.
She called for greater political support and significantly increased investment towards healthy soils. Maintaining healthy soils helps ensure safe and nutritious foods and is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Zero Hunger.
Reuse, recycle and reduce
This year the World Soil Day theme is Be the solution to soil pollution, and FAO offers a number of recommendations on how to reduce the soil contamination at the state, industrial and consumer level.
For example, growing cities are producing mounds of garbage that end up in landfills and enter the soil, up to 80 percent of which could be recycled.
As technological progress accelerates, electronic waste is considered as a new emerging threat to soils. Fifty million tons of e-waste are generated every year, making it one of the worlds fastest growing pollution problems affecting our soils. FAO encourages people to donate or recycle old devices rather than throwing them away.
While agrochemicals can help meet the worlds growing demand for food, they leave a legacy of soil pollution and degraded agroecosystems. Nearly 60 percent of the top agricultural soils in 11 European countries contain residues of multiple persistent pesticides. FAO urges governments to promote the responsible and sustainable management of agrochemicals.
One third of the plastic produced globally ends up in our soils with plastic particles then entering the food chain and the environment. Stronger environmental policies and regulations are needed to prevent the use of excessive packaging and chemicals by industry. However, each and every person can also contribute to solving the problem by simply carrying a reusable bottle and grocery bag, and buying products with reduced or recycled packaging.
Economic impact of soil loss in Malawi - new study
FAO today also presented the key results of its first ever economic assessment of the impact of soil erosion and soil nutrient loss. The study which was conducted under a pilot project in Malawi funded by the UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment initiative, allows for a better understanding of the economic damages incurred by soil loss.
According to the study, a 25 percent increase in soil loss in Malawi would result in a reduction of GDP by 0.64 percent, which is the equivalent of about $40 million per year.
Soil degradation has high economic costs: loss of soil health leads to reduced crop yields, Semedo said. Preventing soil pollution must be a top priority worldwide, she concluded.The Glinka World Soil Prize winner announced
During the World Soil Day ceremony, the Glinka World Soil Prize 2018 was awarded to Professor Rattan Lal, the President of the International Union of Soil Science (IUSS), for his outstanding contribution to sustainable soil management.
Professor Lal has been listed among the Worlds Most Influential Scientific Minds (2012) and among the top one percent of all researchers in agriculture. His scientific work has notably contributed to soil organic carbon restoration and improvement of soil structure but also played a major role in converting science into policy and decision-making.
The Glinka World Soil Prize, named after the pioneering Russian scientist Konstantin D. Glinka, was established by the Global Soil Partnership with the support of the Russian Federation in 2016 and honours individuals and organizations whose leadership and activities have contributed to the promotion of sustainable soil management and the protection of soil resources.
This year the Russian Federation has also approved the financial contribution of $2 million to support the activities of the Global Soil Partnership in its second phase (2018-2020).
Today, the first World Soil Day Award was also delivered to Practical Action Bangladesh for organizing the best World Soil Day celebration in 2017. The new FAO-established award is funded by the Kingdom of Thailand.

The countrys manufacturing sector activity improved in November and touched an 11-month high as new order flows encouraged companies to lift production amid strong demand conditions, a monthly survey said.
The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index strengthened from 53.1 in October to 54.0 in November, signalling the strongest improvement in the health of the sector in almost one year.
This is the 16th consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI remained above the 50-point mark. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.
Manufacturers increased production at the second-quickest pace since October 2016, buoyed by stronger demand conditions and greater sales.
The Indian manufacturing sector continued to recover from ground lost in August, with November seeing the headline PMI climb to an 11-month high, said Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.
The expansion in total new orders was supported by greater sales to international markets as producers reportedly received bulk orders from clients in key export destinations.
Signs of rising confidence in the upturn were also provided by the trend for employment, which continued to grow at one of the quickest rates seen in six years, Lima added.
On the employment front, goods producers created jobs in November. Though the increase in employment softened slightly since October, but was among the fastest seen in six years, the survey noted.
Going ahead, business sentiment improved from Octobers 20-month low, with Indian manufacturers forecasting better market conditions in the coming 12 months.
Lima further noted that the relatively weak demand environment seen earlier in the year showed signs of abating, as clients are placing more work orders regardless of rise in output prices.
Manufacturers further drew down their finished goods stocks to meet demand.
This, coupled with improved business sentiment, should ensure that production continues to rise at a robust clip as we head towards 2019, Lima added.

India end 10-year win drought in Australia
ADELAIDE: India won their first Test on Australian soil in a decade Monday, bowling out the home side in a nail-biting finale to clinch the opening match of the series at Adelaide Oval with Rishabh Pant equalling a world-record along the way.
The hosts were set an improbable target of 323, which would have been a record run chase at the ground but gallantly battled to 291 before Josh Hazlewood became the last man to fall to Ravichandran Ashwin, who finished with 3-92. Shaun Marsh made 62 and Tim Paine 41.
It was a huge breakthrough for Virat Kohlis men, with Australia always proving a tough hunting ground.
The last Test they won in Australia was at the WACA Ground in Perth in 2008, and the last one in Adelaide was 2003, with just six victories now in more than 70 years -- and never one in the first match of a series Down Under.
Another blot on Indian cricket history is that they have never won a series in Australia.
But with the home team missing the banned Steve Smith and David Warner, Kohli and his team sensed ahead of the tour that this could be their opportunity to make history.
They now take the momentum into the second Test in Perth starting Friday, with Melbourne and Sydney to follow.
Australia resumed the final day needing another 219 for victory with four wickets down, but lost their last two specialist batsmen before lunch, shifting the odds heavily in Indias favour.
Marsh and Travis Head had started cautiously, grinding out 11 runs in the opening seven overs before seamer Ishant Sharma struck with the score on 115, bowling a bouncer that caught Heads bat as he tried to fend it off and Ajinkya Rahane took the catch at gully.
Paine joined Marsh and they upped the ante, capitalising on some loose balls from Shami to chip away steadily and close the gap.
Marsh brought up a valuable 50 -- his 10th in Tests -- with a boundary from a pull shot off spinner Ashwin.
It was a much-needed knock for the left-hander, who was on a run of six consecutive single-figure Test scores, although he has been in scintillating form in domestic cricket. But he didnt last much longer with Jasprit Bumrah getting the big breakthrough as Marsh pushed at a perfectly angled delivery, getting a faint edge to Pant behind the stumps.
By lunch Australia had fought to 186 for 6, still needing a further 137 runs for victory, with Paine not out 40 and Pat Cummins on five.
But in the second over after they resumed Paine top edged a pull shot from Bumrah and Pant easily took a catch.
Cummins, who survived two big reviews within four balls, with the technology both times going in his favour, showed fantastic application with Mitchell Starc in a 41-run eighth wicket stand. And when the runs needed dropped below 100, the crowd dared to dream before Starc fell to Shami for 28. It brought Nathan Lyon to the crease and he got the pulses racing with a quick 38 to set up a tense finale before Hazlewood departed.

India to remain at top position in remittances with $80 bn -World Bank
India will retain its position as the worlds top recipient of remittances this year with its diaspora sending a whopping US$80 billion back home, World Bank said in a report.
India is followed by China (US$67 billion), Mexico and the Philippines (US$34 billion each) and Egypt (US$26 billion), according to the global lender.
With this, India has retained its top spot on remittances, according to the latest edition of the World Banks Migration and Development Brief. The bank estimates that officially recorded remittances to developing countries will increase by 10.8% to reach US$528 billion in 2018. This new record level follows a robust growth of 7.8% in 2017.
Global remittances, which include flows to high-income countries, are projected to grow by 10.3% to US$689 billion, it said.
Over the last three years, India has registered a significant flow of remittances from US$62.7 billion in 2016 to US$65.3 billion 2017. In 2017, remittances constituted 2.7 %of Indias GDP, it said.
The WB said remittances to South Asia are projected to increase by 13.5% to US$132 billion in 2018, a stronger pace than the 5.7% growth seen in 2017.
The upsurge is driven by stronger economic conditions in advanced economies, particularly the US, and the increase in oil prices having a positive impact on outflows from some GCC countries such as the UAE which reported a 13% growth in outflows for the first half of 2018.
Bangladesh and Pakistan both experienced strong upticks of 17.9% and 6.2% in 2018. For 2019, it is projected that remittances growth for the region will slow to 4.3% due to a moderation of growth in advanced economies, lower migration to GCC and benefits from oil price spurt dissipating.
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a regional intergovernmental political and economic bloc of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
As global growth is projected to moderate, future remittances to low- and middle-income countries are expected to grow moderately by 4% to reach USD 549 billion in 2019. Global remittances are expected to grow 3.7% to US$715 billion in 2019.
The Brief notes that the global average cost of sending US$200 remains high at 6.9% in the third quarter of 2018. Reducing remittance flows to three per cent by 2030 is a global target under sustainable development goal 10.7.
Increasing the volume of remittances is also a global goal under the proposals for raising financing for the SDGs, it said.
Even with technological advances, remittances fees remain too high, double the SDG target of 3%. Opening up markets to competition and promoting the use of low-cost technologies will ease the burden on poorer customers, said Mahmoud Mohieldin, senior vice -president for the 2030 Development Agenda, United Nations Relations, and Partnerships at WB.

Indian SC dismisses petition challenging  decision to dissolve J&K assembly
New Delhi: The Supreme Court of India on Monday dismissed a petition filed by former BJP MLA Gagan Bhagat which sought to challenge the decision to dissolve Jammu and Kashmir assembly.
The decision to dissolve the assembly was taken by Governor Satya Pal Malik on November 21, a move that was challenged by Bhagat. The apex court however said there was no merit in the petition, before dismissing it.
Last week, Bhagat had challenged Governor Maliks decision to dissolve the state assembly, calling it undemocratic. Its the biggest joke in democracy that you keep assembly suspended for five months and
when a party stakes claim to form the government, you dissolve it. This policy is incorrect and undemocratic, he had told news agency ANI.
Governor Maliks sudden move to dissolve the assembly had been questioned by many. PDPs Mehbooba Mufti, at the time, had sent that she had sent a fax to the Governors office in which she had staked claim to form the government along with National Conference and Congress. She also claimed that she had been trying to get in touch with him on phone, but he was not available. She took to Twitter to make this known. Governor Malik had subsequently defended his decision in a way that hinted he was under pressure from the BJP-led NDA. Had I looked at Delhi, I would have had to invite Sajad Lone to form the government. But I did not want to go down in the history as a dishonest man. I dont bother about the abuses now, he had said. BJP ally Sajid Lone of the Peoples Conference too had staked claim to form the government. Governor Malik however said that he had dissolved the assembly due to the impossibility of the formation of a stable government.- NDTV

India's central bank governor Urjit Patel has resigned from his post citing "personal reasons".His resignation comes amid reports of a rift between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.This marks a rare case of a serving governor leaving his job midway through his three-year term.Correspondents say the move is likely to undermine confidence in the economy and cause the rupee to fall.Although India's economy has recently been boosted by a strong performance in consumer spending and manufacturing, the rupee has already fallen significantly against the surging dollar so far this year, private investment remains slack and there are doubts on whether the economy will accelerate further, says the BBC's Soutik Biswas in Delhi.

Injured batting phenomenon Shaw resumes running
Adelaide, Monday: Young Indian batting phenomenon Prithvi Shaw resumed running Monday in his battle to be fit for the second Test against Australia after a nasty ligament injury sidelined him late last month.
The 19-year-old, who scored a sparkling debut century against the West Indies in October and has been compared to Sachin Tendulkar, landed awkwardly attempting a catch in a Sydney warm-up match, ruling him out of the opening Test. His left ankle was heavily strapped as he limped around the Adelaide Oval late last week.
But on Monday he was spotted jogging around the sidelines, although still wearing a protective brace.
The Indian camp still rate him an unlikely starter for the second Test in Perth starting on Friday, with a return in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne more likely.
With youth on his side there might just be a case where he might recover quicker, Indian coach Ravi Shastri said last week.
Well make a call as and when we get closer to Perth.
Shaw was set to open the batting alongside either KL Rahul or Murali Vijay in Adelaide. In his absence, those two were paired together. Rahul made 2 and 44 while Vijay could only manage 11 and 18. AFP

Yatharthaya Organization yesterday requested the Supreme Court to issue its pending judgment as regards the continuing Executive-Legislative tussle in the country before the year-end court vacation.

The masses are affected by the awkwardness of recent
manifestation of events that has called into question the conduct of Parliament, the rejection of Presidential orders by the legislature, the suspension of the functionality of the government among other things, said Vijitha Thera.
This has enervated people to the point of being collapse. They are the worst hit by the situation, he said.
They breathed a sigh of relief with some burdens being released from their shoulders by the newly appointed government. But they have lost all these benefits at the drop of a hat because of a rift between legislators and the President, he explained.Ven.Viijitha Thera was speaking at a press conference at the Sri Sudarshanarama Temple in Grandpas, Colombo.
It is from the people that both legislators and the executive derive power. The judiciary too derives its power form them. Therefore It is our view and the expectation that the judiciary will put more weight on the people in passing its judgement, he said.
We all respect the highest Court and at all times accept its decisions, he said.
Let it be a decision taken on behalf of the country, he added.

Jesus baptism site de-mined
ISRAEL: Efforts to clear thousands of landmines and other ordnance around the site where many believe Jesus was baptised have reached a milestone and officials allowed a rare glimpse Sunday of abandoned churches there.
The church grounds around the site in the occupied West Bank have sat empty and decaying for around 50 years, though pilgrims have been able to visit a nearby restricted area at the traditional baptismal spot on the banks of the River Jordan.
Work at the site just north of the Dead Sea is being overseen by Israels Defence Ministry, de-mining charity Halo Trust and Israeli firm 4CI.
According to the ministry, the project covers around one square kilometre (250 acres) as well as some 3,000 mines and other explosive remnants.
It is expected to cost 20 million shekels ($5.3 million, 4.7 million euros).
The work began in March and would require another eight months to a year to complete, said Moshe Hilman of Israels Defence Ministry.
Mines and other ordnance have been cleared from Ethiopian and Greek Orthodox monastery sites as well as a Franciscan chapel, organisers said.
Other grounds belonging to Russian, Syrian, Romanian and Coptic Orthodox churches are yet to be cleared.
The plan once complete is to return the plots to the various church denominations and allow visits. At the crumbling, brick-and-concrete Ethiopian monastery on Sunday, a fading fresco of Jesus being baptised by John the Baptist could still be seen inside.
Signs hung on the walls with notifications that the location had been cleared of explosives.
A collection of pieces of mortars and other explosive remnants sat alongside a nearby roadside as a demonstration of some of what had been found.
The Halo Trust has reached a pivotal point in our work to clear the baptism site of landmines and other remnants of war, the charitys CEO James Cowan said in a statement.
He added that we have completed clearance of the Ethiopian, Greek and Franciscan churches. The majority of the mines were laid by Israeli forces after the country seized control of the West Bank in 1967 from Jordanian troops.
Other unexploded ordnance from both Israel and Jordan has remained lodged in the ground, including around the churches, which were evacuated by Israel in the 1970s.
Israels control of the West Bank has never been recognised by the international community, which considers the land occupied Palestinian territory. - AFP

Kenyan men take first 17  places in Singapore marathon
SINGAPORE: Kenyans finished in the first 17 spots of the mens Singapore marathon -- with winner Joshua Kipkorir completing the race about half an hour quicker than the fastest non-Kenyan.
Kipkorir -- 24, and competing in the Singapore marathon for the first time -- finished Sundays race in two hours, 12 minutes and 20 seconds, the second-fastest time in the events history, according to organisers.
Felix Kirwa was second, a minute behind Kipkorir, while Andrew Kimtai was third.
The fastest non-Kenyan was Singaporean runner Soh Rui Yong, lagging far behind the winner, with a time of two hours, 41 minutes and 49 seconds.
Kenyan runners also dominated the womens event, bagging the top five spots. Around 13,000 people took part in the 42-kilometre (26-mile) race.
The astonishing results underlined the dominance of Kenyans in marathons, with even Singapores tropical heat and humidity proving no barrier to success for runners who typically train at high altitudes.
Last week Kenyan athlete Eliud Kipchoge -- who has been acclaimed as the greatest marathon runner of the modern era -- won the International Association of Athletics Federations mens 2018 award.
He has dominated marathon racing since making his debut in Hamburg in 2013.

Kohli savours very special victory over Australia
ADELAIDE: Virat Kohli said Monday it was very special to captain India to their first Test win in Australia for a decade and gave his side crucial momentum in their bid for a maiden series victory.
The visitors won a tightly-contested opening Test in Adelaide by 31 runs on the fifth day after setting Australia a target of 323, which would have been a record run chase at the ground.
It was a big breakthrough for Kohlis men, with their last triumph on Australian soil at the WACA Ground in Perth in 2008. In Adelaide, their sole previous win was in 2003.
Obviously its a great feeling. Weve never taken a lead in a series in Australia, something that for us is a huge boost, he said.
And its given us the right momentum that we needed to play a big series like this and its something that weve had to work hard for.
Any Test victory is special because you work hard over five days, and then the physical and the mental toil and the emotion of it all comes together in a result is a very special feeling. Kohli, who has long led Indias batting charge with admirable consistency across all three formats but failed to fire in Adelaide, said he believed his team collectively were better than Australia and deserved to win.
The victory was built on Cheteshwar Pujaras first innings 123 and his second innings 71, while wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant took a world record-equalling 11 catches.
It was priceless from Pujara, we were down and out at lunch on day one. His grit and determination brought us back in it, said Kohli.
We always knew that runs on the board would make the home side tentative. Any lead was gold and we got 15. In the second innings again, he and Rahane batted well. Asked if thought 323 would be enough to win, Kohli said his middle and lower order could have done better after a 5-25 collapse at the end of the second innings.
We could have added another 30-35 runs more which could have taken the game totally beyond Australia, he said.
So these are things that we have to think about going to Perth, but if someone had told me before the series that I would be 1-0 up as soon we started the series, I would have taken it with both hands. The second Test starts on Friday in Perth, with Melbourne and Sydney to follow.

Fantastic Beasts: the Crimes of Grindelwald
A malediction  of obscurity
In the latest Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts: the Crimes of Grindelwald directed by Potters David Yates, J.K. Rowling adapts the magical textbook to teach us a few things about the non-magical world.
Newt Scamander is here as a stand-in for Albus Dumbledores (Jude Law) ultimate philosophy of tolerance, to take down the evil Gellert Grindelwald, played with typical panache by Johnny Depp. Grindelwald certainly portrays a striking parallel to the wizards who hate muggles which were found in previous movies, although it does not establish a clash between characters.
The central conflict of the movie is also this complex relationship between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald. Unfortunately, The Crimes of Grindelwald lacks the wizarding worlds power to process a layered conflict through its storyline to create a compelling villain.
Quest for the Chosen One (Sub Head)
The deal this time is that its 1927 and the coldly malevolent Grindelwald, has escaped from a magic prison and is rallying his pureblood followers with the aim of reigning over all non- and semi-magic people. Its implied at one point that if hed been permitted to carry out his plan, it would have prevented World War II.
Grindelwald wants to find Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), one of the orphans from the last movie because he believes Credence is some kind of Chosen One. Credence, who is working for/possibly enslaved by a magic freak show in Paris, feels the same way and is looking for his birth mother to find out who he really is.
Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), the quivering autistic man who collects fantastic beasts, is also looking for Credence, acting on orders from Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). Ministry of Magic auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) too has joined the hunt.
The bridge between the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts movies, that tries to connect the parallel timelines, can be ruined easily. After all, it takes only one match to start a forest fire. Overall, the story lumbers without any form of urgency. Yates and Rowling earned their audiences loyalty just by using the Harry Potter fonts in the title and petty as it may seem, the new details they keep dropping to set up three more movies on the cycle will hopefully burn the bridge from an insignificant sequel. Even something as small as a lighter could bring down a big structure like the wizarding world.
Lackluster plot (Sub Head)
That is not to say the diversions cant be exciting, and the flashbacks to Hogwarts during Newts younger years are emotional and thrilling. Even visits to the Ministry of Magic come with the special frisson of discovery relished in the Harry Potter films. There are new creatures to discover, new family secrets, and enough winks to the Rowling-created universe to keep Potterheads pleased. Yet some of the most anticipated revelations fall flat, including Newts previous bond with Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz) to a deeper exploration of young Dumbledore and Grindelwalds relationship. Rowling seems to be playing to the fans in the thinnest way possible, building stories that require foreknowledge to appreciate them fully. The unindoctrinated will be confused; the admirers, disappointed.
While calling Crimes of Grindelwald a filler would perhaps be unfair, on any view, it is a film which scrapes by on the good name of its forebears - like an indolent child born of a prestigious family. There is a definite sense that the lacklustre plot is held together by little more than the audiences collective anticipation of what is to come: the greatest wizarding duel of all time, the famed clash between Dumbledore and Grindelwald.
This story is about the far more personal and heartbreaking battle between both sides who have different beliefs about what will achieve the solution, and it is revealed from the history stated in Harry Potter that Dumbledore will end up defeating an incarcerating Grindelwald in a duel in 1945, the same year that World War II ends and Hitlers fascism and genocide are brought down.
With that said, however, for those who enjoyed Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, this sequel is indubitably essential viewing. While it is not a wholly-satisfying film in its own right, theres enough of the old magic for it to be enjoyable, and it does what it needs to do to further the series, laying the foundations on which the subsequent installments will stand.
