UNP granted citizenship to plantation community
The UNP has fostered development in plantation areas in tandem with other parts of the country whenever it was in power, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Inaugurating a UNP membership drive in the Maskeliya electorate the Prime Minister said the Sirima-Shastri pact decided that plantation Tamil Community were people of Sri Lanka.
However, they had no Sri Lankan citizenship. Neither did they have voting rights. The UNP offered them Sri Lankan citizenship.
The last batch of plantation Tamil received citizenship during his tenure as Prime Minister in 2003. In 1977 there was a single Tamil parliamentarian from the plantations since plantation Tami9ls did not have voting rights. But today a majority of parliamentarians from plantations were Tamils.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said during his foreign visits some people who met him tagged Sinhalese as communalists.
He told them that it was not so. Only a small section were communal minded. He silenced those critics by asking as to how the Nuwara Eliya district had a majority of Tamil parliamentarians if the Sinhalese were communal minded.
As Minister Digambaram pointed out Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people lived in unity and harmony in the Nuwara Eliya district. It was a district which portrayed Sri Lankan identity.
The Prime Minister said the plantations received electricity when the UNP built the Laxapana hydro power station.
Thereafter with the launching of Victoria, Randenigala and other reservoir projects the highway system in the plantations were developed.
This brought development to the area and boosted the tourism industry. The education sector was also developed in both Sinhala and Tamil media.
A College of Education was also launched to train Tamil teachers.
The Prime Minister said the Tamils in plantations areas cannot be merely contented with voting rights.
They needed villages and housing for a decent living. Now a housing project was in progress by obtaining land from the plantation areas.
There was a need for a large number of houses. Minister Digambaram and Parliamentarian K. K.Piyadasa have offered valuable counsel regarding the housing construction programme.
Minister Digambaram was appointed Estate Infrastructure Facilities Minister and Navin Dissanayake was appointed Plantation Industries Minister to ensure development in the plantation areas.
Education State Minister Radhakrishnan had been entrusted with the task of developing education in the plantation sector for the benefit of the children of the plantation community.
The government had paid attention towards resolving the unemployment problem and increase peoples incomes to create and economically strong middle class.
The government would introduce new strategies to develop the plantation sector in consultation with plantation companies and trade unions.
Plantation companies should contribute towards the improvement of the living standards of the workers.
The government would also implement a programme to grant title deeds to people who had lived in a state land continuously for a period of 10 years.
The UNP is a party which thought and planned for the future.
All communities could join hands and work together with the UNP to develop the country.

SLFP stands above all for party members: Ex-Mayor
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) stands above all for the party members. Local Government level representatives would not allow to divide it, said former Kotte Mayor Janaka Ranawaka yesterday.
He made theses observations at a press conference organised by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Kotte Central Organisation in Rajagiriya yesterday. Ranawaka said more than 2,000 participants will go to Maligapitiya in Kurunegala on September 4 for the 65th anniversary of the party.
He said: Although we have been instructed to bring two buses we would take at least 25 buses to the anniversary.
He said there are 14 UPFA Local Government members in the Kotte Municipal Council and 11 of them stand with President Maithripala Sirisena.
Some attempt to divide the SLFP although the election is to be held in 2021. The objective is to protect a family from being taken before the FCID, Ranawaka said.
During the previous regime we were not allowed to exhibit a poster of ours depicting projects implemented by us during the previous regime. Those posters were removed using the forces and Police, he said.
He said there were leaders who attempted to get petty jobs done by War Heroes. He said previous rulers used the security forces to make Pradeep Ekneligoda and assault Upali Thennakoon disappear. He said the former President should not betray the SLFP to protect his brothers. SLFP former local government representative Rajika Kodithuwakku said that it is not the SLFPers who attempt to divide the SLFP.
