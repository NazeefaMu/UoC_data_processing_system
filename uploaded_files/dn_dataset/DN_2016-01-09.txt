Bowlers who sledge are cowards: Andy Roberts
As the elevator of a five-star hotel rushed from zero to the 23rd floor, it was sort of ironical to hear the hotel's guests talking about the speed of the lift, without realizing they had Sir Andy Roberts for company.
The legendary West Indian fast bowler too enjoyed the moment away from public attention that he has been used to getting since 41 years of him as a cricketer.
Roberts, 64, was in Pune to visit cricket museum Blades of Glory, and the former right-arm pacer, who was part of the famous West Indian quartet along with Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft, spoke to TOI about contemporary cricket.
Like his bowling, his replies to all the questions were as sharp as they could.
Excerpts:
Q: You were part of world cricket's most feared bowling attack. Have you seen a pace attack like that in any of the present teams
AR: No I haven't seen it and I am not going to see it. I am not saying it won't happen, but I don't think I will live to see it because that 'quartet' was different. Today you can't put four different bowlers like that together. We were all different in everything you could think of. We were different in height, we were different in mannerism, we were different in temperament and we were different in skills. I think that's what made the combination so good.
Q: You must be good friends off the field to share a bond like that while playing
AR: Not all four were good friends. I am still friends with Michael (Holding), but with the others (Garner and Croft) I never socialised while we were playing.
We were friends, but to say we were close won't be right. But on the field everyone was for everyone.
We had a common thing: we all hated losing.
Q: A lot of aggression was expressed through the eyes of the bowlers in your era. How do you see young fast bowlers indulging in sledging to heat the contest up
AR: Sledging has always been there. I don't think they sledge half of as much now as they did in the past. One more thing about sledging is that the bowlers who sledge are cowards. Why do you have to get in someone's face You have the ball in hand, let the ball do the talking.
Q: When West Indies, England and Australia boasted of fast bowlers, India had their quartet of spinners. Down the line, do you think India has the same level of quality spinners
AR: No. I don't think India has stuck to their strength that was spin bowling. Now they are dependent more on doctored pitches to suit the spinners. So the Indian spinners don't get much juice outside India because they don't get the assistance as they get at home.
Q: Are you referring it to the Nagpur Test
AR: It isn't about just Nagpur Test, it is about all the Tests. Home advantage should be avoided.
Q: How do you see India's progress as a Test team
AR: I see India have decided to play a couple of fast bowlers and that makes the difference in Test cricket. I think they need to develop a programme where they have bowlers who can consistently bowl at 90-95mph. Until they do that, they will not be able to compete outside India. And if you want to be world champions, you need to do well outside your territory.
Q: So what should they do to bowl consistently
AR: Indian bowlers need to bowl as much as they can because people say they shouldn't over bowl in practice. But it is difficult for me to play a Test match after bowling four overs in the practice and then expect me to bowl 20 overs in a day. That is why I believe so many injuries occur, because bowlers get tired in the match.
Q: West Indies cricket is nowhere close to where you had left.
AR: There is so much wrong with West Indies cricket that it will take me two days to complete the answer, so I don't even want to start. Priorities are changing and most of it started right here in India. West Indies are the only team that suffered because the players are not prepared to go back for international commitments. I don't agree with their thinking. Some of them may tell you that they don't owe anything to West Indies cricket, but they some gratitude towards the West Indies cricket board and public, because they didn't come up by themselves. They came up through a system provided by their territories and the cricket board. If I had anything to do with the board, none of them would be playing it (for the clubs) because I wouldn't be signing any NOCs. You have to commit yourself to represent your territory if required. If your best players consistently take part in domestic cricket, your team cannot come up.
Q: You had openly expressed your displeasure about a LBW decision that went against you while bowling to England's Peter Willey. In today's context, do you think the review system is a good technology
AR: There are so many things that are flawed. But if there is some technology that assists the umpires, why not use it. My only problem with the technology is the ball tracking system. According to the technology, everything goes above the stumps. Even though you hit the ball below the knee, it goes over the stumps and that is my biggest problem (with DRS).
The cameras I believe are up high and you are trying to judge the height of the ball from up high. When you see it with the naked eyes, you know it is not going high.. But having said that, I believe DRS should be continued. It takes a lot of pressure off the umpires, because even today the umpires make a signal, they don't have guts to say whether you are out or not out. - TNN

A day to remember for township boy from Cape Town Temba Bavuma
As a township boy growing up in Cape Town, Temba Bavuma never dreamed of becoming the first black African to score a Test century for South Africa, let alone a role model for aspiring young cricketers.
The 25-year-old, born a short distance from the Newlands ground, is just the fifth black African to follow trailblazer Makhaya Ntini, who won 101 caps.
Bavuma came under scrutiny before the game as South Africa's commitment to an ethnically balanced side resulted in some awkward questions about selection policy. But his answer at the crease was emphatic and he is fully aware of the significance.
He said: 'I understand what it means but I'm struggling to find the words. I'm quite relieved, full of emotion and very satisfied from a personal and team point of view.
'I've been wanting to cross off that first Test hundred and to do it at my favourite ground was extra special.'
He added: 'At first cricket was a passion, I just played for the love of it. When I made the SA Schools side, that's when I realised cricket could be more than a passion, something I can use to inspire other people.
'When I made my debut for South Africa I came to be a bit more aware and realise the significance behind it all. It was not about me making my debut, it was about being a role model, an inspiration for other kids, black African kids. Achieving this kind of milestone will strengthen that example.'

## Title: Hashim Amla made a brave call to resign as Proteas captain after hitting 201

Hashim Amla made a brave call to resign as Proteas captain after hitting 201
Usually it's the England captain who resigns during a series with South Africa... not the other way around!
Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and I all stepped down after Tests against the Proteas, and I think Hashim Amla's decision to do the same has come as a surprise to us all.
But there are three things you have to consider when you're in that position. First, is it doing you any good as a person Second, how is it affecting your batting And most importantly, would your team be better off if you stood down
Those were the questions I wrestled with in 2003 before I resigned as England captain.
It wasn't doing me any good - either as a person or a player - and I felt I had taken the team as far as I could. I had absolutely nothing left in the tank.
I also knew that Michael Vaughan, who was one-day captain at the time, would take them on and the team would be in a better place for it.
They needed a leader with energy and plenty to prove, not an angry old captain. I'd shouted at them for long enough!
People might be wondering why Amla resigned now, straight after making a double hundred, but he might well have made his mind up after defeat in Durban.
They had lost four of their last five Tests, he couldn't buy a run and he was getting slated in the media. He probably wanted to quit on the spot, but with just two days in between the two Tests he possibly felt it wouldn't leave enough time to appoint a new captain.
I think it was actually quite brave of him to go now after doing so well with the bat at Newlands and almost pulling off a remarkable victory. He could have thought to himself: 'Actually, this isn't so bad! I might just stick it out for a bit longer.'
But I think Amla realised captaincy just wasn't for him - it didn't sit comfortably on his shoulders.
People say it wasn't something he ever actively sought and he wasn't a natural leader.
So if he isn't contributing much as captain, why not give someone else a go and let Amla concentrate on his batting
In fact, his impressive showing with the bat in this match might owe something to the fact that he knew he was about to resign, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
It's certainly not a decision you take lightly, though.
It's hard to take in when you wake up the next morning and you are no longer captain of your country.
But you've got to do what's best for your team. Taking South Africa into a new era will require a lot of energy.
It will be a rollercoaster ride for AB de Villiers, or whoever takes over in the long term, and be a lot more draining than being the captain of a great side.
Quitting during a series is a bigger decision to make than waiting until the end of one. You feel like you are turning your back on your team-mates and jumping ship, but when you know you are done you are actually letting them down by carrying on. In many respects, this reflects well on Alastair Cook and his decision to fight for the captaincy when England were struggling. He was copping most of the blame and the burden of leadership was affecting his batting. He could have walked away after his side were whitewashed in the 2013-14 Ashes, but he found the energy and strength of character to stay on and prove everyone wrong.
People often ask me whether I could have done the job for one Test longer and I say no, not one day longer, not to the standard I had set myself. This is something Amla will ask himself in the years to come.
But for now, Hashim Amla is a popular person in South Africa and around the world. Johannesburg is sure to give him the rousing ovation he deserves. - Daily Mail
PROTEAS' CURSE ON ENGLAND CAPTAINS BROKEN
England's last three long-serving Test captain's have been brought unstuck by South Africa, with their final Tests in charge coming after series against the Proteas during Graeme Smith run as skipper. Amla's departure appears to break the pattern.
Nasser Hussain: Stepped down as England captain after drawn 2-2 series at home to the Proteas in 2003.
Michael Vaughan: Quit as captain after two Test defeats and a draw at home against the Proteas in 2008. He missed the fourth Test, which England won.
Andrew Strauss: Quit after losing three-Test series at home 2-0 against the country of his birth in 2012.

India lifts ban on controversial bull run festival
INDIA: India has lifted a ban on a popular but controversial bull running festival, angering animal rights activists who say it is cruel and abusive.
A government order said the event, held every January to mark the winter harvest in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, would be allowed to go ahead this year after it was cancelled in 2015.
"Bulls may... continue to be exhibited or trained as a performing animal at events such as Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu," said the order published by the environment ministry on Thursday, using the local name for the event.
In the centuries-old festival of Jallikattu, which means "bull-taming", bulls are let loose and young men compete to subdue them.
The event was cancelled last year for the first time after the previous government imposed a ban citing cruelty.
Unlike in the popular Spanish traditional of bull-fighting, the aim is not to kill the animals. But critics say they are fed liquor and have chili powder thrown into their eyes before they are released from a holding pen and chased by revellers.
There have also been reports of bulls having their horns sharpened with broken glass, while the "taming" can lead to serious injury and a painful death for the animals.
Over the years, dozens of people have also been killed and hundreds more wounded in the event.
The government ordered a ban in 2011 but it was not implemented until 2015 after the Supreme Court had dismissed a slew of legal challenges.
Poorva Joshipura, chief executive of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in India, said the group would challenge the move.
"We are horrified and aghast over the lifting of ban on Jallikattu when the same government is fighting to protect cows," she told AFP, referring to measures to protect the animals revered by Hindus.
"Terrified bulls are deliberately disoriented through substances like alcohol, stabbed and jabbed by sickles, spears, knives or sticks, punched, jumped on and dragged to the ground in the so-called sport."
The government's decision to lift the ban reportedly followed pressure from local politicians including Tamil Nadu's controversial Chief Minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram ahead of planned protests.
Local media reports said it may have been motivated by upcoming state elections.

KANDY SPORTS ROUNDUP
Dharmaraja College in good form for 2016
Dharmaraja College is one of the oldest Buddhist schools in the game and are in good form to give of their best in the 2016 cricket season. They are led by all-rounder Weluka Galahetiyawa and Old Rajan Senaka Dissanayake is once again their coach. They have a cricketer who has been selected for the Under 18 World cup Lahiru Samarakoon, who is a steady paceman.
Their main game will be the annual school cricket match against Kingswood College, known as Kandy's Battle of the Maroons and played since 1914. It is considered as one of the oldest annual school cricket encounters.
In the 2016 season they have a tremendous task ahead of them and are making a determined effort to maintain their reputation in the rest of the matches. They began the 2015 term with matches against Dharmasoka College, Dharmapala College, Aloysius College, Zahira College, all these matches ended in no decisions some were due to bad weather. The match against St. Sylvester(tm)s College was not played due to rain and they beat St. Benedict's College. This year they played their first match on January 7 and 8 against S. Anthony(tm)s College Wattala which was a draw and the next game is on Jan 11-12 v St. Anthony(tm)s College at Katugastota, Jan 18-19 v Bandaranayake College at Lake View, Jan 22-23 v Trinity College at Lake View, Jan 29-30 v Nalanda College in Colombo, February 5-6 v Ananda College at Lake View, Feb 12-13 v Sri Rahula College Matara at Lake View, Feb 15-16 v Mahinda College Galle, Feb 19-20 v Royal College at Lake View, March 16-17 Big match v Kingswood College at Pallekelle and on Feb 27 one day v Kingswood at the same venue.
Kandy's cricket lovers
Kandy(tm)s cricket lovers are expecting a lot from the newly elected Sri Lanka Cricket chief Thilanga Sumathipala. Today club cricket in Kandy at domestic level is nil. Now the KDCA and CPCA have got up from their sleep due to the AGM of the controlling body, KDCA supported one side and CPCA supported the other. The AGM is over, what Kandy needs is good organizing of domestic tournaments. In the good old days there was a six-a-side tournament for the Dr. J.C. Blok trophy, a double wicket tournament for the Dr. C.D.L. Fernando and Z.M. Jahufer trophy, and Hemachandra trophy one-day cricket, Dr. Anthony(tm)s trophy inter-club tournament (the oldest). Where has all these tournaments gone Everyone is expecting the club cricket standard to improve. It is said that the Kandy C.C.is now housed in Colombo and only the name is used to play matches. The club was handed over to a famous school coach, on contract, and he ran it with players from outside.
Kandy MC wins at TT
Kandy Municipal Council play grounds department, which is headed by Kelum Shanthasiri and assisted by G.D. Darmaratne, pocketed the State Services Table Tennis championship with 30 points, second was the strong Colombo Municipal Council with 26 points. The tournament was held in Jaffna. In the team championship Kandy Municipal Council won the ‘A(tm) division title. The game of Table Tennis in the good old days was promoted at the Kandy Municipal Council through the Playgrounds due to the efforts of then commissioner and a top class cricketer late D.H, de Silva with the full backing of the Mayor late Tilak Ratnayake, where all the Community Centers were provided with Table Tennis tables and equipments. That is how they game was promoted and today Kandy is doing well in the sport.
Trinity College starts Cricket Academy
Trinity College has launched an academy called the Center of Excellence Cricket Academy for their students. The main aim is to give the best for the youngsters to do well in the game. This academy is headed by their main cricket sponsor Bilal Fasey, who is the chairman and Prefect of Games, Shane de Silva is the manager. The coaches involved are Kavinda Jayasooriya, Lahiru Seneviratne, Dilka Panagoda, Chandima Abeyakoon, Palitha Tilakasiri and Vishanga Vithanage. The classes are held on Sundays, and nearly 190 young cricketers from 8 to 14 years attend them.
Cricket Carnival at Asgiriya today
Center of Excellence Academy will be having their inaugural cricket carnival today at Asgiriya International Cricket Stadium. It will be held under the distinguished patronage of former Sri Lankan cricket captain Hashan Tillakeratne. The event will start at 8.30 a.m. where under 11 and 13 cricketers will be seen in action. They are grouped into four teams, Titans, Patriots, Warriors and Gladiators.
Clifford Cup Rugby
Will the Clifford Cup rugby knockouts like in the good old days played in Kandy this time. It was during the presidency of Y.C.Chang that the Clifford cup knockouts tournament was brought to Kandy and all matches were played over here. Later only Kandy Sports Club involved matches were played in Kandy. SLRFU gave the green light to the CPRFU to do the tournament and in one year they failed to give the best, and the tournament was shifted back to Colombo.
Sports bodies lack organization
Most of the sports bodies, over here are not in a position to organize tournaments because, people who come to high office, promising everything before the AGM but nothing happens afterwards and the organization has to incur heavy expenditure to conduct tournaments as there are no sponsors. So, people who take up office, should be able to do the needful not come into office, and have their name promoted. What they do is they invite a politician as chief guest and in the speech come out to say no sponsors, no venue, no office, please help us. How can one promote sports like this In the good old days, people who take up office were good sportsman and promoters and they knew how to run tournaments. It is lacking today.

Kandy won't have it easy against Navy
Absorbing rugby is in store for the rugby fans when the unbeaten defending Dialog League champions Kandy Sports Club takes a Navy Sports Club in their Dialog League inter Club rugby tournament match to be played at the Nittawela Rugby Stadium, Kandy on Sunday, January 10th with the kick off at 4 pm.
Kandy Sports Club started off the season well scoring heavily against Sri Lanka Air Force, CH and FC, Police and Sri Lanka Army and at one time averaged nearly 50 points per match. But in their last two matches this has been not the same as in their matches against CR and FC and Havelocks Sports Club they won by small margins. Both matches were played in Colombo. Does this mean that Kandy Sports Club had reached peak too early or that the opposition were equally strong or was it complacency. This will be known after this game.
Kandy-Navy match has always been a thriller since the sailors turned around some six years ago wining both the League and Knock out titles. Last year Kandy came back into reckoning winning both the League and knock out titles. The Dialog League knock out finals for the Clifford Cup against Police Sports Club was a lop sided one as Kandy won 77-7.
Kandy has an old score to settle with Navy as they lost the final match of the League 11-12 but yet squeezed through to win the League title on bonus points. It would have been a different story had Navy scored a try. Kandy made many mistakes in this match including the spot kicking. They cannot afford to make mistakes of this nature in this game as it cold end up their unbeaten record for the season.
Kandy Sports Club are a strong force in their home territory at Nittawela where they reign supreme and they have lost only a handful of matches during the past two decades. Having a record like this and playing before their home crowd with plenty of ground support Kandy Sports Club should ramp home winners unless the sailors could utilise their torpedoes effectively in their firing line.

Libya truck bomb kills 60 policemen
LIBYA: A massive truck bomb exploded near a police base in the western Libyan town of Zliten on Thursday, killing at least 60 policemen and wounding around 200 others, officials said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but a local Islamic State affiliate has been trying to gain a foothold in Zliten, spreading westward from its central stronghold in the city of Sirte along the North African country's coast.
The UN special envoy to Libya, Martin Kobler, denounced the attack and urged Libyans to "put their differences aside and unite to confront the scourge of terrorism." UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack as well as ongoing attacks by the Islamic State group on oil facilities near Sidra and called for a national unity government as "the best way for Libyans to confront terrorism in all its forms."
The bombing was yet another reminder for Libyans that "urgent progress is required" toward empowering a unity government and rebuilding state bodies, Kobler said in a statement.
Hours after the blast, rescue crews at the scene had only managed to extract 60 bodies out of the wreckage, said a hospital spokesman, Moamar Kaddi. Libyan officials said they believed there might be dozens more dead.
The police base, where about 400 recruits were training, was used by Libya's border police, a Zliten security official said. Border police foiled numerous human smuggling attempts off the coast of Zliten last year. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that the U.S. has not yet determined who is responsible for carrying out a "cowardly act of terrorism" and extended condolences to the victims and the families of those who were killed, and to the Libyan people. Earnest said the U.S. remains "deeply concerned" about Islamic State-inspired militants carrying out acts of violence in Libya.
Smugglers operating in Libya are notorious for responding with violence to any attempt to disrupt their lucrative operations, but there have been no reported incidents in which they used car bombs, suggesting that Islamic militant are more likely to have been behind Thursday's attack. Also, it was not immediately clear whether the attack was a suicide bombing, a hallmark method of Islamic militants.
In recent years, thousands of migrants seeking a better life in Europe sailed from Libya on rickety, overcrowded boats. Hundreds have drowned in those crossings.
Libya slid into chaos following the 2011 toppling and killing of long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The oil-rich country is torn between an Islamist government based in the capital, Tripoli, and a rival, internationally recognized administration in the east. Meanwhile, a UN-supported unity government sits in neighbouring Tunisia.
Residents in Libyan coastal cities have long expressed fears of the variety of smugglers and traffickers who run lucrative operations along the Mediterranean Sea. Authorities have echoed the same concerns, claiming they are unable to fully tackle these networks without international assistance.

Pakistan-China Davis Cup tie moved to Sri Lanka over security concerns
KARACHI, FRIDAY: Pakistan will host its Asia Oceania Group I Davis Cup tennis tie in Sri Lanka after opponents China refused to visit the violence-hit country over security fears, officials said Friday.
The Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) said they had hoped that the country's strong economic links with China would help convince officials to bring the competition to Lahore.
"It's disappointing to note that International Tennis Federation has rejected our appeal of playing the tie in Pakistan and we are now forced to host it in Sri Lanka," PTF secretary Khalid Rehmani told AFP.
The tie will be played from March 4-6. The PTF had invoked the foreign ministry's aid in the bid to hold the match at home but to no avail, said Rehmani.
Pakistan have not hosted a home tie since 2005.
Pakistan are back in Group I for the tournament for the first time since 2006, while China clung onto their place with a relegation play-off win over Thailand in September last year. This will be the sixth head-to-head meeting between the two teams, with China winning their last one 5-0 back in 2006. The winner will face seeded Uzbekistan for a chance to reach the World Group play-offs.

Sri Lanka to participate at inaugural visually handicapped T20 Asia Cup
Sri Lanka's visually handicapped national cricket team will participate in the inaugural T20 Asia Cup tournament for visually handicapped which will be held from January 17 to 24 in Kochi, India.
The Cricket Association for the Blind in India (CABI) is organizing the tournament and around 10 nations will take part in this first edition. Five nations, namely India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh will take part.
Visually Handicapped cricket captain Chandana Deshapriya
The Sri Lankan contingent comprises 17 players and three officials. Chandana Deshapriya is the captain of Sri Lanka team and Y.S.G. Sumanaweera is the coach. Ravi Perera will join the team as an umpire.
Even though cricket for visually handicapped applies many standard cricket rules there are adapted rules as well. A team will have players of three categories, according to their visual abilities. Players of B-1 category are totally blind and a team must have four B-1 players, three B-2 (partially blind) players and four B-3 (partially blind) players.
The national team, although almost oblivious to the Sri Lankan cricket lovers had garnered commendable accolades with their outstanding performance in previous international events. Sri Lanka took part in four Word Cups and they emerged third in 2014 when the World Cup was held in South Africa.
Sri Lanka Cricket Association of the Visually Handicapped (SLCAVH) is striving all these years to bring the sport to the attention of the masses while uplifting the standard to international level. They have entered a sponsorship agreement with one of the biggest multi-national companies, Regus as their clothing partner for the first ever T20 Asia Cup.
Commenting on the sponsorship, the Country Manager of Regus Sri Lanka Dr Nimal de Silva said, "We considered this initiative when the team reached out to us through the dynamic SLCAVH president Norbert Silva. We decided to extend necessary support in order to ensure that they will make it to India and have the opportunity to make Sri Lanka proud. We would like to extend our fullest support in their future endevours as well and I wish them all the best."
Norbert Silva appreciated the support rendered by Regus Sri Lanka and said even though cricket is very popular here, they found hard to attract sponsors when it comes to cricket for visually handicapped.
"But a big thank you goes to Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara who made quick arrangements to buy our air tickets. Without his generous support this tour will not be possible for these youngsters. He also arranged us lodging at Sports Ministry during the team's comprehensive practices.
We are greatly affected by two main problems over the years. We do not have a ground with a turf to carry out practices and also desperately in need of a national sponsor. If these requirements fulfilled, our players will surely perform better. I must also thank athe Foundation of Goodwill for their great support to SLCAVH," Norbert said.
"I have asked SLC to make SLCAVH an affiliated body, but they have turned a blind eye for a long time. But we have made it to the international level and are proud to be a member of the World Blind Cricket Association. In other countries, the national cricket governing bodies have given sanction to their Visually Handicapped Cricket Associations under them. I hope the new SLC management will consider our plea," the SLCAVH president added.
The national coach Y.G.A. Sumanaweera who has 20 years of experience working with visually handicapped personnel is confident of local the team's performance in India. "Our lads are very talented and brave, so they are capable of fighting against any country. We are in need of umpires, coaches, scorers and officials. If the sport gets sufficient local exposure, then people will be get interested. I think this first ever regional tournament will be a great opportunity to popularize cricket for visually handicapped," Sumanaweera pointed out.

Tiger Woods is 40 this week and can barely walk properly
If turning 40 is a moment in life where most people pause and reflect, imagine what must be going through the mind of Tiger Woods upon reaching that landmark on Wednesday.
Barely able to walk properly and with no immediate prospect of resuming the trade that brought him untold fame and fortune, he has, by his own admission, been spending far too much of his time playing video games, surely the saddest fate of all since he used to be the face of so many of them.
His years to this point have unfolded like a Faustian pact. A man who had everything and achieved all that was humanly possible in his chosen pursuit at the age of 32, only to have every vestige stripped away slowly and agonisingly thereafter.
Right now he's looking at the most uncertain of futures and, in a couple of unusually frank interviews at the start of this month, came across as fearful of what it might hold. There seemed to be an acceptance that not even men as driven as himself return from three back operations to reclaim their place at the summit.
The gift of hindsight is probably the superpower we would all choose if granted one wish, but imagine if Woods had it If only he could go back and curb the obsessional zeal for fitness that is exacting such a heavy price now.
Less excusably, imagine if he had been able to control the urge to sleep with so many dodgy women that cost him his marriage, and the aura that was such a part of his psyche.
It's still a stretch to say that even with those changes he would have overtaken the most daunting record in all of sport - Jack Nicklaus's total of 18 majors. He would still have had to have won as many majors that players as great as Seve Ballesteros or Phil Mickelson managed in their entire careers.
But does anyone who witnessed him at the peak of his powers seriously doubt he would have made it by the time he reached today's milestone Certainly not this observer.
Yet let's hope this day is not filled with too many regrets. After all, in every other major sport, even the best would give their eye teeth to be the dominant figure from the age of 21 to 32.
During that time he achieved so many records and stupendous feats that he moved the television broadcaster David Feherty to proclaim: 'He seems intent on replacing every great highlight reel I've ever had with one of his own.'
On a personal level, I count it among the great privileges of my working life to have been present at all 14 of his major championship victories, and many other remarkable moments besides.
Even the deep mists of time cannot diminish what it felt like to be there at his first major championship as a pro at Augusta National in 1997, when he went to the turn in 40 strokes on the first morning of the Masters and yet still ended up winning the tournament by an unfathomable 12 strokes.
A month later, we all descended on the Byron Nelson tournament in Texas to be greeted by sights that must have brought a sense of bewilderment to the ageing host.
More than 500,000 people showed up to see what all the fuss was about; from young kids taking a break from cheering on baseball and football heroes to brassy women swooning at the sight of the young and handsome star, but who soon discovered a golf course was no place to be wearing stiletto heels.
The record books show Nicklaus as the all-time No 1 because the number of majors won will always be the means by which greatness is defined. But is there anyone who was around during the Tiger era who would dispute he took the game to new heights
I honestly don't think there has ever been a golfer at his best who compares with Tiger in his prime. No golfer in history, for example, has come close to matching the preposterous 15 shots by which he won the 2000 US Open at Pebble Beach - and even then he still mustered a triple bogey!
Not in my lifetime has there been a major staged like The Open that followed a month later at St Andrews where everyone, from his fellow competitors to administrators to the world's media, knew who was going to win. This, remember, is the sport where majors are routinely held where you have as much chance of forecasting the winner by sticking a pin blindfolded in a list of the field as coming up with a supposedly expert prediction.
Yet here was Tiger, turning the most evocative major of all - an Open staged at the Home of Golf - into effectively a one-horse race.
There ought to be a stewards' inquiry if he doesn't win,' observed Sir Michael Bonallack, the former secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, to continue the equine metaphor. There was, of course, no need for any such inquiry. He duly won by eight shots.
He was unbeatable all summer, as it turned out, winning the USPGA Championship as well a month later. On to Augusta the following April, where he won the Masters to become the only man ever to hold all four majors at the same time.

US missile disappears, turns up in Cuba: WSJ
CUBA: A US Hellfire missile has turned up in Cuba after going missing in a fiasco that has left American officials worried the technology may be shared with China, Russia or North Korea, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
Though the missile was not carrying a warhead, the alarming diversion while it was in transit from Europe has spurred US investigators to probe whether its arrival on the communist island was the result of criminal activity or merely a series of mistakes, according to the newspaper.
And despite a historic thaw in ties with Cuba over the past year, Washington has been unsuccessful in its push to get the missile back, the WSJ said, citing unnamed sources.
It reported that American officials were not concerned that Cuba would take apart the Hellfire -- an air-to-ground missile often carried by helicopters -- but were worried that Havana would share the technology with US rivals China and Russia, as well as North Korea.
The missile's far-flung journey began in early 2014 when it was sent from Orlando International Airport by arms firm Lockheed Martin to Spain, where it was used in a NATO military exercise.
From Spain it began a journey that was supposed to see it arrive back in the United States, and was passed between several shipping firms on the first leg of its trip.
Officials loading a flight that was to carry the missile out of Madrid first noticed that it was missing, the Journal said.
They then determined that it had been put on a truck operated by Air France, which took it to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where it was loaded onto one of the company's flights to Cuba.
By the time the missile was tracked down, it was already en route to Havana where an official noticed the labeling on its crate and seized it.
Lockheed Martin notified the State Department of the incident when it realized the missile was missing around June 2014, the WSJ said.
The US Justice Department is investigating the matter.
If the missile was purposefully diverted to Havana, the incident could be a violation of the Arms Export Control Act and even sanction laws against Cuba, the Journal said.
The bungled missile delivery comes with Washington and Havana working to build on their restoration of full diplomatic relations, a move first announced in December 2014.
The United States and Cuba formally restored diplomatic relations in July and re-opened embassies in each other's capitals. Obama said he had made the decision because he concluded that 50 years of trying to encourage democratic and economic change in Cuba through isolation had failed.
It also comes with the US pushing for greater pressure on North Korea over an alleged hydrogen bomb test this month, and with Washington at loggerheads with Moscow and Beijing over a litany of issues ranging from the civil war in Syria and the conflict in Ukraine to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.

What does the Chris Gayle Row Reveal
A West Indies cricketer has sparked a sexism row after asking a TV reporter for a date live on air. But what does this reveal about the challenges facing female sports journalists
Chris Gayle has faced a barrage of criticism after his comments to Mel McLaughlin during a Big Bash League match in Australia. "To see your eyes for the first time is nice," he said, in response to a question about his innings. "Hopefully we can have a drink afterwards. Don't blush baby."
His behaviour has provoked strong reactions online. Some have supported him, saying tht his comments were clearly a joke. Others have condemned him as a sexist. Gayle has apologised since the incident with McLaughlin but also said that he thought the backlash had been "out of proportion".
Others argue that his attitude is just another example of the types of problems faced by female sports reporters on a daily basis. They say that in the male-dominated world of sport, difficult interviews with players are common.
"They're not listening to you, which is the ultimate disrespect," says author and LBC presenter Beverley Turner who worked as a sports reporter for ITV. She remembers a particularly awkward interview in the locker room with now-retired basketball player Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.
"I'm there with my microphone, I'm trying to string together a decent interview, that sort of environment was already quite intimidating," she says. But O'Neal was more interested in her than in answering the questions.
"Forget the game. Let's talk about our marriage - me and you," he replied. Turner says that at the time she tried to make light of it. "But when I watched it recently I just felt so sorry for my 26-year-old self."
The result is a no-win situation for a female presenter, she says. She would have been criticised for playing along with him and "if I'd have been offended I would have been accused of being po-faced".
There is also pressure put on female journalists to look a certain way when they are reporting. "I once did a job where I had my hair up in a ponytail," says sports presenter Charlie Webster. "I was told that I should take it down for the television and that I needed to look more feminine and more glamorous."
She says that the environment can often be intimidating and that this is not acceptable. "Just because it's on television, it doesn't make it any different to any other workplace," she says.
The locker room interview has often caused problems for female reporters. But it's not always the players who are to blame. Three female journalists were denied access to a NFL locker room last year. "This guy was an usher and apparently not aware that women cover sports," tweeted journalist Graham Watson after the incident.
The press box can be as male-dominated as the locker room. Journalist Russell Jackson has written about his shock at seeing another reporter switching between his match report and pornography on a computer in full view of other reporters.
Tennis player Eugenie Bouchard was asked to give a twirl during an on-court interview at the Australian Open a year ago. And John Inverdale was taken to task for his comments about Marion Bartoli's appearance at Wimbledon in 2013. In 2011, Richard Keys resigned as a Sky presenter after he made sexist comments about female referee Sian Massey.
"I'm quite used to being the only woman in the press box at a match but sometimes it has been a battle past both blatant and inadvertent sexism to get there," says BBC sports journalist Sonia Oxley.
Waiting to go through the door marked "Press Entrance" at one rugby stadium club, she was once asked "which bar are you working at" while at a Premier League training ground she was told: "If you're waiting for autographs, love, you need to go and stand over there."
Oxley says that she has never encountered sexism from players themselves. "One even helpfully ordered the group of reporters who were crushing me against a barrier in the 'mixed zone' to step back." But she was surprised when - at a match in Moscow 10 years ago - she was greeted by a fellow reporter with the words: "Why have they sent a woman to cover this"
She says she has never felt angry or even particularly offended by this kind of comment. "I suppose I just wonder why female sports reporters are still seen as slightly out of place."
Despite experiences such as this, Turner says that most of the journalists she has worked with have been extremely supportive. "I think the male journalists could often see the position that the women are in."
The behaviour of fans varies considerably. The BBC's Natalie Pirks has written about her experiences of football fans chanting sexually obscene questions at her during live broadcasts.
Cricket writer and broadcaster Lizzy Ammon says that a lot of the abuse comes through social media. She has had threats of violence, rape and even one threat against her son.
"You become a little bit immune to it because it's almost sadly predictable.. The fact that it's there all the time does have an effect - it does make you sometimes think 'I'm not going to tweet that or say that on air' because I know inevitably what will come back at me."
But Ammon says that things are changing. There are a lot more women involved in cricket than there used to be. When working on her first international match, she says she saw three women - one other journalist and an England and Wales Cricket Board official - and more than one hundred men.
Today women are more visible in leadership positions in sport. There are also more men who are willing to call out inappropriate behaviour, Ammon adds..
"There have been some pretty strong pieces by men saying 'this is completely unacceptable and it's the responsibility of men to do something about this'."
Turner agrees that the situation has improved, thanks to female journalists who have blazed a trail.
"These people have done a really good job of taking the novelty value out of female presenters in sport."
Despite the changes, there are those who argue that more needs to be done. "It has changed but I still think there is a long way to go," says Webster. "One of the things I'm really proud about is that people are now speaking out about it."
Gayle himself continues to have many defenders. It's been pointed out that tennis player Maria Sharapova flirted in a similar fashion with a male journalist without drawing any criticism.
But this week's episode is not the first time that Gayle has been in trouble over his behaviour to female journalists.
During a press conference ahead of a match he was asked by a female journalist: "How does the pitch feel so far in terms of the training and the weather" He responded: "Well, I haven't touched yours yet so I don't know how it feels."
He'll be expected to be more strait-laced in his interview responses from now on.
