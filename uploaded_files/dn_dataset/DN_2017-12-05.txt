Sri Lankas first Digital Entertainment and Technology Expo
Play Expo Sri Lanka is the first Digital Entertainment & Technology expo in Sri Lanka, being held on December 8 to 10 at the SLECC. The exhibition is organised by Gamer.LK, the leader in eSports and Digital Entertainment experiences, and powered by Dialog Gaming. Play Expo is being organised with the goal of showcasing the latest technology and experiences available for digital entertainment enthusiasts. The expo caters to anyone interested in audio, video, music, movies, gaming and their related technologies. Technology and entertainment brands from around the world will be showcasing their products in experience zones for attendees to come and get hands-on time with the products they love.
Play Expo is poised to be unlike any other technology event held in the country to-date. With activities, competitions, panels and interactive engagements happening throughout the three-day event, Play Expo will also play host to Sri Lankas largest eSports and Video Game Championship  the Sri Lanka Cyber Games which returns for its 10th edition, alongside the Colombo Comic Expo which will feature Sri Lankas largest Cosplay competition and artist showcase. This brings a unique blend of technology, competition, and content creation/consumption to Play Expo which ensures an action packed 3 days for everyone attending.
As Digital Entertainment enthusiasts, we identified a significant void in Sri Lankas exposure to the latest digital entertainment technology. While events like E3 and CES are held to large audiences in the United States, the South Asian region lacks initiatives that promote digital entertainment. We at Gamer.LK are taking the initiative to position Sri Lanka as a digital entertainment hub for South Asia, with the first step being Play Expo Sri Lanka. Were happy to have Dialog Gaming partnered with us on this journey, as they have been a driving force in enabling digital entertainment service providers and products in Sri Lanka said Raveen Wijayatilake of In Game Entertainment.
Leading multinational companies have come forward to support Play Expo Sri Lanka.
Dialog Gaming who brings fast, low latency connections to users in Sri Lanka has stepped in to power Play Expo. Dialog will also showcase their entire lineup of digital entertainment products and services available at the Dialog experience zones at Play Expo

Sri Lanka must protect national carrier from anti-competitive behaviour - Minister
Sri Lanka must liberalize its aviation policy while protecting its national airline from anti-competitive behaviour, Minister of Transport & Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala De Silva said Monday.
He was speaking at the International Civil Aviation Organizations Conference at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall.
The reduction of states controls within the air transport industry, which is popularly termed as liberalization or deregulation, has brought in good results and fostered competition between air carriers, he said.
But, he added, heightened competition can lead to the risk of anti-competitive behavior between airlines. Sometimes the governments have to step in and lend support to their national airlines through means that could deny the airlines of other states a fair and equal opportunity to compete, he said.
That control set of chain reactions between countries, he said, which is one of the key constraints that Sri Lanka is currently faced with, in the implementation of its desire of moving towards liberalized market access.
Sri Lanka is a small island nation and therefore has to rely so much on aviation to reach its socioeconomic development goals, De Silva added.

Sri Lanka vs. India 3rd Test: Sri Lanka scores 373 runs at first innings

The Sri Lankan team scored 373 runs at the first innings of the fourth day of the 3rd Test against India today.
India secured a 163-run first innings lead after taking remaining Sri Lankan wicket in the sixth over.
Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's captain, was the last man out, having extended his overnight 147 to his highest Test score of 164.
Chandimal added 30 for the last wicket with Lakshan Sandakan, who ended up unbeaten on 0 off 20 balls. The No. 11 was beaten multiple times by Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami, but defended stoutly when the line was on the stumps.
At the other end, Chandimal went for his shots, and picked up three fours in the morning, two of them with cuts and uppercuts. That shot, in the end, cost him his wicket, as he sliced Ishant straight to Shikhar Dhawan at third man.

Sri Lankan cricket needs the gumption of Yorkshire
(Continued from last week)
The road to doom continues as Sri Lanka flounders in Indias winter city of Nagpur, sooner than later our cricketers will be frozen on thin ice. Kholi and Co are playing marbles with our guys, are we witnessing the bleakest period of Sri Lanka cricket, we see Chandika Hathurusinghas shadow looming large behind the higher ups at Sri Lanka Cricket. Thilan Samaraweera (with whom I had the good fortune of interviewing at his Berwick residence in Melbourne last year) has stated that there is no quick fix to succeed against Jadeja and Ashwin and he will need to study two tours down the road to correct whatever the kinks in our batsmens techniques. If one can reminisce Samaraweera was one of the best back foot players going around when our two greats Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene were showing the cricketing world that we were no nincompoops. Let Chandika Hathurusingha, one of the highest paid coaches going around and Samaraweera come into the mix. One cannot expect quick fix solutions, let them dive deep and get to the bottom of the shortcomings in our players techniques, fitness issues and whatever and give them time to sort out the muck.
Back to reminiscing and Kilburns Overthrows stated that any claim to a Yorkshire gift for cricket is tenable only on the same terms as Welshmen are granted a gift, or flair for rugby football. There is nothing in Yorkshire air or Yorkshire turf that made a cricketer. Yorkshire men had no superiority of eye sight or muscle; they were neither freaks of nature or descended from Olympus. There tradition of cricketing dexterity was probably derived more from the by-products of economic development rather than any other single factor. Kilburn recalls that sheep and steel and coal were the basic ingredients of Yorkshire cricketing skills that emerged from the Industrial Revolution.
Rapid growth of population in a small area produced more players and keener competition in play. Sport in various forms was a natural reaction to the exacting labour of daily life; without the safety valve of cricket or football, the economic grind might have proved unendurable and anarchic. Kilburn noted that in the course of generations mine and mill created strengths and dexterities that were applicable to sport. The saying that if you want a fast bowler shout down the pit has a basis in reality, it would perhaps make an interesting metaphor between Moratuwa and Yorkshire where similarities are obvious, e.g. the furniture industry and the culture of the people (famous for baila, etc) of Moratuwa and the pits and mines of Yorkshire, both these communities consisted of hard working people. Sir Geoffrey Boycott was a Yorkshire product and our own Duleep Mendis and Romesh Kaluwitharana were Moratuwa born and bred, however the similarities end when it comes to their respective approaches. Boycott was dour in his approach, where Mendis and Kalu were flamboyant.
This book by Kilburn unearthed another interesting factor about Yorkshiremen - it stated that cloth making and engineering gave both delicacy of touch and the development of the left hand. Years and life times of piece work inculcated a spirit of determination and endurance - these two factors are clearly lacking in our batsmen who are pathetic in their approach to say the least and are showcasing there inabilities in India. A clear example is Mathews and Chandimal after getting into their fifties they close shop as if they were in a hurry to avoid the hostilities of the crowds and their opponents. Endurance is certainly lacking in them, whereas Virat Kholi and Co gets big hundreds and doubles as if its a normal day in office. Endurance is the name of the game.
Kilburn stated that man power resources alone would not necessarily create a cricketing community. Additionally, there must be a cricketing interest and a cricketing opportunity. The Yorkshire interest presumably devolved from the widening national interest during crickets nineteenth century development and opportunity came because improvised implements were readily obtainable and people were available for a game during breaks in working hours. Cricket was a convenient and a rewarding past time.
Kilburn also noted that cricket was rewarding not only through intrinsic pleasures but as a means to social distinction. The good cricketers were local somebodies and the best cricketers could use cricket to escape the mine and the mill. Although the industrial south and the west Yorkshire spread far, the communities within the general area were small and closely knit. Centres of interest tended to be in a specific pit or foundry or workshop, inducting a sort of family loyalty and a competitive urge between unit and unit, as between brother and brother. Kilburn recalls that the playing representative was invested with responsibility made all the more evident by a close contact in work and play. If one dropped a vital catch or failed with the bat at a critical moment you were likely to be reminded of your short comings through the next weeks working hours.
The composite character attributed to Yorkshire cricket derived from geographical as well as human factors. Yorkshire is a northern county and the soft turning pitch was a common place or was before the days of compulsory covering. Spin bowling was rewarded, if spin bowling was accurate; defensive batting skills had to be learned if long innings were to be played. In such conditions bowlers and batsmen taught themselves to wait, to persevere and to concentrate. The decisive point of a match could occur in an hour, in an over, and the successful side or individual was the one ready to grasp and hold the fleeting opportunity.
Kilburn concludes by stating that the essence of hardness characterising Yorkshire cricket in its minor and major presentations. At its best, it is illustrated in determination to redeem lost causes, to face difficulties with unflinching resolution, to acknowledge defeat only when the last ball has been bowled. At its worst, it becomes an attitude of arrogance, blinkered view of an irritable reaction. In the one form of expression Yorkshire cricket, has won the respect and admiration of the cricketing world; in the other it has incurred dislike.

UAE upbeat on trade prospects with Lanka
The two countries have to consolidate the already strong bilateral relations. A number of joint venture trade projects are being implemented between both countries, announced Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Sri Lanka Abdulhamid Abdulfattah Kazim Al- Mulla on December 1 addressing the 76th National Day Celebrations of UAE in Colombo on 1 December at Shangri-La Hotel.
There are over 122,000 Sri Lankans living and working in the UAE. The total trade turnover was US$ 1.3 billion in 2016 and US$ 1.18 billion in the first half of 2017. There is great potential for us to export higher volumes and high value added products to the UAE, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen.
Tea, apparel, and natural rubber were the three major export commodities from Sri Lanka to UAE last year. At a quarter of all exports (at $73 mn), tea was Sri Lankas major export to UAE. Petroleum oil was the biggest import from UAE taking 46% of all imports (at US $ 489 mn) followed by gold (at 13.4% of all imports).
Sri Lanka has keen interest in inviting the UAE investors to invest in Sri Lanka especially in infrastructure projects as Sri Lanka is transforming itself as a hub in the Indian Ocean.
In the World Economic Forums latest Global Competitiveness Report 2017-18 UAE topped the Arab world and ranked 17th in Global Competitiveness Ranking. UAE has been one of the largest investors in Sri Lanka among Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies, investing over US$ 385 Mn in FDI since 2012.
A number of joint venture trade projects are being implemented between both countries and they will strengthen relations between both countries even more, said Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Sri Lanka Abdulhamid Abdulfattah Kazim Al- Mulla.

Walkers Colombo Shipyard secures US$ 4 mn from ADB
Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Private) Limited, a subsidiary of MTD Walkers PLC secured a US$ 4 million loan from the Asian Development Bank to be utilized for the development of the Shipyard of Walkers Colombo Shipyard featuring a state of the art Shiplift and Transfer System which will accommodate vessels up to 70 metres in length and 1,250 tonnes.
The proposed loan will be the first ADB non-sovereign infrastructure loan in Sri Lanka since 2000. ADB is filling a critical market gap by funding a project the first to cater to smaller vessels up to 1,250 tonnes to serve the shipping industry of Sri Lanka and the region.
Jehan Amaratunga, Group Executive Deputy Chairman of MTD Walkers PLC, expressed his sentiments on the transaction saying We have driven the diversification strategy of the Group over the past few years and this is one of the many initiatives underway that has come to fruition.
He further added, We are keen to invest further in the marine engineering sector and enhance our Dollar income streams. We could have no better demonstration of the potential of the project and sector than having the ADB support us.
Mahesh Yogarajan, Executive Director of Walkers Colombo Shipyard said Funds raised from the MTD Walkers PLC debenture of Rs 3 billion in September 2015 were invested into this forex earning project. The continual forex receipts will bring down the cost of funding with minimal risk as we have a natural hedge.
The project is in line with ADBs Sustainable Transport Initiative, which recognizes regional cooperation and integration as an emerging need and challenge that should receive more ADB support. This is to be done by addressing constraints to trade growth, such as the indirect costs associated with unreliable transport times, border-crossing delays, and handling and storage costs that result from poor terminal infrastructure.

Warriors extinguish Heat, 123-95
Los Angeles: The NBA champion Golden State Warriors rode a dominant third quarter to a decisive 123-95 victory over the Heat in Miami on Sunday.
Miami took a 36-33 first-quarter lead despite 16 points in the period from Stephen Curry.
When they smell blood, they go for it, said Miami coach Erik Spoelstra. So many of their guys just come alive when they start to get it rolling -- each one of them becomes ignitable.
They start foaming at the mouth when the game starts to turn.
The Warriors saw forward Shaun Livingston ejected in the second quarter after making contact with a game official while arguing a non-call. But they roared ahead in the third quarter, opening the second half with a dunk from Kevin Durant en route to a 12-2 scoring run. The Warriors outscored the Heat 37-17 in the third to take a 99-77 lead into the final frame.
Curry finished with 30 points as the Warriors improved to 3-0 on their current road trip.Durant added 24 and Klay Thompson scored 19.
The Warriors seemed fired up by the ejection of Livingston, who thought he was fouled on a shot attempt and leaned in to argue with the referee. He bumped heads with the official, who also appeared to be moving forward, and was instantly sent to the locker room.
The Oklahoma City Thunder held off the depleted San Antonio Spurs 90-87, aided by Russell Westbrooks seventh triple-double of the season.
Westbrook scored 22 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Thunder, who led 90-82 before failing to score in the final 3:34.
A turnover in the closing seconds gave San Antonio a chance to tie the game, but Brandon Paul missed a three-pointer and Oklahoma Citys Raymond Felton grabbed the rebound to seal it.
Steven Adams added 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, whose 20 turnovers made it closer than was comfortable against a Spurs team missing Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. AFP

Writ petition filed seeking legal action against KP dismissed
A writ petition filed by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath seeking an order to institute legal proceedings against LTTE's former Leader of International Wing Shanmugam Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP was dismissed by Court of Appeal.
While refusing to issue notices on the respondents, Court of Appeal (President) L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne decided to dismiss the writ petition citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the petition.
The Attorney General had earlier informed Court that the Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) has commenced a comprehensive investigation against KP under three Acts including Prevention of Terrorism Act, Penal Code and Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act over his alleged terrorist involvements.
In his petition, JVP MP Vijitha Herath sought an order for KPs arrest and the institution of legal proceedings against KP who was appointed LTTE leader in 2009.
The Court was informed that there are about 193 serious allegations against KP in the writ petition including arms procurement and money laundering charges.
The Court of Appeal had asked the AG to announce what kind of legal action had been taken against former LTTE arms procurer.
The Police Chief, the Defence Secretary, the Controller of Immigration and Emigration, the Army Commander, the Kilinochchi Security Forces Commander, the TID Director, the Attorney General and Kumaran Pathmanathan were cited as respondents.
The petitioner sought an interim order directing the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to prevent KP from leaving the country until the final determination of this application.
Herath said KP also known as Kutti Master was the chief international arms procurer for the Tamil Tigers and was appointed as the head of the LTTE by its elusive leader Velupillai Prabhakaran just before he was killed by army troops in 2009.
He said Indias Central Bureau of Investigations (CIB) had named KP as a key suspect in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by a Sri Lankan Tamil suicide bomber during an election rally in Tamil Nadu.
Mr. Herath said KP was responsible for equipping the LTTE with modern-day arsenal which enabled them to challenge the Sri Lankan military and to fight an intensive war.
He said he had learnt that KP was operating a social service organisation  the North East Rehabilitation and Development Organisation (NERDO) and the Sencholai Childrens Home while being under protection of the Sri Lankan Army.
Herath said in terms of the information provided to the public by the Sri Lankan Government, KP has committed offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Penal Code, Prevention of Money Laundering Act and Emigrants and Immigrants Ordinance.
Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana PC appeared on behalf of the Attorney General. Senior Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma with counsel Sunil Watagala appeared for the petitioner.

Countrys aviation policy must be further liberalized
Sri Lankas aviation policy must be further liberalized to promote tourism, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau Chairman Udaya Nanayakkara said Monday.
Speaking at the International Civil Aviation Organizations annual conference at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, Nanayakkara said years of inconsistent and protectionist policies had hurt Sri Lankas economy.
Even though the island is blessed with natural beauty, culture, and a strategic geographic location on major trade routes, we have not made use to this gift to us, he said.
(This is) mainly because our aviation policy, and our shipping policy, among other policies, have not been consistent, he added. Im glad now that I understand the aviation policy is going to be further liberalized.
Right now, the third largest foreign exchange earner to this island, for its economy, is tourism. But he said it should be the single largest foreign exchange earner.
The governments vision is to make Sri Lanka an aviation, shipping, financial, banking, and entertainment hub of South Asia, he said. To that end, he said it was the state and tourism sectors goal to increase plane arrivals to the island from 2,000 to 5,000.
11 major airlines, including SriLankan Airlines, Emirates, and Qatar Airlines, carried over 80 percent of tourist traffic to Sri Lanka last year, Sri Lankan Tourism Development Authority data shows. Nanayakkara said the government needed to make it easier for more planes to land at both of Sri Lankas international airports.

According to Dr.Aluthge, the GMOA has already informed Dr. Harsha De Silva (the Chairman of the Presidential Committee) in writing about the GMOA's stand on the facts observed.
"The GMOA will also communicate all new negative developments to the Chairman of the committee and to the other officials," he said.
"Setting up a non profit medical college is not a solution for the SAITM issue and it will create more complications than now.
No non profit university in the world have a success story. In the US, there are about 1000 such institutes and 2.7 million students enter into them but only 55 percent of them become graduates.
No non profit medical faculty in Sri Lanka will be able to meet the minimum standards of medical education," Dr.Aluthge added.

We want to be end-to-end solution provider for SL telecom industry
I think right now the industry is going through a very interesting time, said Suresh Sidhu, Chief Executive Officer of edotco Group, the first regional and integrated telecommunications infrastructure services company in Asia. Slightly different impacts from country to country in the region, but overall Id say the industry is in a good place. It has a huge opportunity coming up with 4G and 5G data. However, one concern is that the industry needs to realize that one size doesnt fit all. You see a consistent theme across all countries in the Asian regions right now, but what works for one country may not work for another. I think a simple way to put it perhaps is that the industry needs to reshape itself to serving the future specific to the needs of the individual nation.
Sidhu continues to speaks of the groups projects in Sri Lanka.
Q: What do you see as some of the bottlenecks for the industry to reach the potential that it has
A: I think the first thing is to have an open eco-system approach to doing things. The industry still likes to do everything themselves, whether its a question of partnerships, or the question of what they do or what they outsource. The most important thing the industry has to change is its mindset.
Today I think if you ask the average consumer of mobile telephony its not uncommon to find people saying I think my mobile provider is Google or Facebook. I think for the operator to be relevant theyre going to have to take digital very seriously. This is the first mindset change.
I think the second mindset change has to be partnerships. If you have to do everything by yourself should you not be partnering more extensively and this is where something like edotco I think would be a real benefit to the operator. You can spend your time much more effectively on transforming to a digital company if you outsource with the right partners.
Q: What kind of impact has edotco created regionally coming in as a partner to telecom networks
A: There has been a lot of impact and we have seen different things in different countries. I think the first impact is weve managed to help a lot of our customers much faster than before. The reason for that is just that were specialized and focused on what we do. The second part is actually something perhaps which happened today in Colombo, innovation.
Weve also driven the fact that just because a tower is called a tower it doesnt has to look like a tower. Whether lamp poles or whether its a water tank or its even minarets in Malaysia, I think theres an ability to innovate. The third one is that we take our job of operating towers very seriously.
In our country the big issue is energy and up time and all our countries in the Asian regions tend to suffer from problems with power fluctuations, etc. And theres a lot of inefficiency in how energy is used. I think edotco has probably reduced energy costs for all of our customers by at least 10% over the last year and thats a big number. That doesnt come from doing any one thing but is a result of doing a few small things.
Q: What are your views on the telecommunication industry in Sri Lanka after the research that youve done and also in comparison to some of our neighbors, how do you see the industry here
A: Its a very very interesting country for a telecommunication industry and you have very sophisticated customer base in the urban centers like in Colombo. In many ways its also on par with the customer base in Malaysia or Singapore. The big challenge for the industry here is that price point is extremely low. Its great for customers but not so good for operators. So I think operators need to be more innovative. I believe they are all very open to thinking outside the box about these things. A customers digital experience should be great. And I think thats what Sri Lankan operators need to focus more. I think the operators need to build the eco-system that has more power and stronger corporation among them.
Q: We have about 7,000 towers at the moment in Sri Lanka shared among different networks. What is edotcos roll out plan to increase it to the capacity that we need right now
A: I think we need to do couple of things for that. We need to of course make sure the industry coordinates and works together. Hopefully they will partner with us saving time and resources for everyone. I think we should also move to other areas like hosting.
Q: If you can just give us a little bit more information on the project that commenced today and the specifics of these lamp poles and what they are going to offering apart from being a connectivity tower
A: I think the opportunity for communities, cities and countries as we move in to structures like lamp poles is going to be very interesting. Structures like lamp poles are not only meant for communications but also for other services there are relevant for all the communities. For example, the lamp post we are promoting can also be used for traffic management, weather management, safety and security. These solutions can also be used as digital advertising. We could provide a range of support services like emergency access services.
Q: What is the first phase of the project Now I know Marine Drive is the location but how many lamp poles are we looking at And what would be the completion date of this particular phase
A: There would be no stop date because it depends on the demand from operators. When the requirement comes up we will keep on adding. So the start of the project would be based on the demand and we will just keep adding on to it.
Q: Have you identified other areas of Colombo as well
A: We are looking all around the country. We believe the initial potential over two years is up to thousand of these types of multi-purpose poles in different locations across the country. We are first working with the RDA and we are looking for other partners to work with.
Q: Are these lamp poles going to be powered by solar power
A: It will be in future. But right now it will be powered through the grid. Wherever we can bring the technology to power through solar obviously we are going to present cheaper solutions to our customers.
Q: What are edotcos long-term plans and goals for Sri Lanka
A: We want to be an end-to-end solution provider for the telecommunications industry. That will mostly be for the near term in this area of towers and poles. We are very committed and this business is what we call a Forever Business. We want to build a business that is sensitive to the countrys needs and supports national development of the country.
Q: What kind of job opportunities you are creating for Sri Lankans in terms of setting up operations here
A: If you look at our own operation its an engineering centric organization where we need expertise in civil structure like engineering and energy. In terms of opportunities beyond our own company there will always be the labour force required to put up structures as well. We have also found that Sri Lanka possesses a wealth of energy engineers and some civil engineers who have the knowledge and expertise to work on our projects overseas in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Myanmar. A few of them are already working at these sites and we see great potential for many as our work continues in Sri Lanka and the region.

Accenture files lawsuit on similar trademark
Accenture Global Services Limited filed a plaint alleging trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition and passing off, in the Commercial High Court of the Western Province in Colombo on October 2017.
Accenture, the Plaintiff, a well known global management consultancy, technology services and outsourcing company is one of the worlds largest consulting firms. It states that it pioneered systems integration and business integration and has established itself as a leader in todays global marketplace. It has a significant business presence in Sri Lanka through its local affiliate Accenture Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
Accenture claims that a similar company, Ascenture Systems Limited, which is engaged in software development services, software solutions and enterprise resource planning solutions in the clothing industry, is using a trademark and name identical to that of Accenture.
Accenture who is represented by Manoj Bandara with Dhanushka Dissanayake instructed by Sudath Perera Associates claimed that the Defendants Company, Ascenture Systems, intentionally and deliberately adopted the similar trademark and name of Accenture by changing only one letter to Ascenture with the purpose of trading on the good will and reputation of its world-renowned mark.
In addition, the global company stated, customers are likely to be deceived and confused into believing that the Defendant and its products and services and business have some connection associated or affiliation with the Plaintiff, when there is no such connection whatsoever. The use of Ascenture would further give them an unfair advantage and cause damage to the Plaintiff by way of loss of reputation and goodwill and dilution of their internationally acclaimed and recognized trade mark Accenture.
Accenture has applied for a Court order that would declare that the Defendants trademark constitutes an infringement of Plaintiffs rights as owners of the tradename Accenture and any use of Ascenture would be unlawful and unfair competition against the Plaintiff. They further requested that the Court issue a permanent injunction restraining the Defendants from further use of the infringing mark as well as a decree for damages. Accordingly, the Plaintiff supported for a notice of an interim injunction together with summons. Having satisfied the submissions of the Counsel for the Plaintiff, the Court issued notice of the interim injunction together with summons, returnable on the 5th of December of 2017.
It was disclosed that there has been a number of successful actions against other companies in Sri Lanka as well as India, by the global company Accenture, with the similar trade name that has been successfully concluded.

Activists snub mendacious TV
Independent media activists snubbed a local television network which wanted them to criticise Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for his hard-hitting speech directed at vested interests within privately-owned media.
Panellist at yesterdays UNESCO-sponsored seminar on ending impunity for crimes against journalists, Sanjana Hattotuwa, said he turned down a request from the private channel to comment on the Premiers speech.
Open critic of, dont often agree with and not card carrying fan of @RW_UNP. But when a leading TV station that attacks and demonises him incessantly, with little or no reason, asks me to comment on speech he made, I will refuse, Hattotuwa said on twitter.
He said he believed another activist, Nalaka Gunawardene, who moderated a session at the UNESCO seminar had also declined to comment.
Senior journalist Amantha Perera too joined the debate saying the private channel was guilty of pretty lousy journalism.
... tv station had a very specific question on @RW_UNP (Ranil Wickremesinghe) statement, why do you think he is wrong, Pretty lousy journalism, Perera said copying the conversation to former president Mahinda Rajapaksas twitter account too.

Beyonce teaming up with Ed Sheeran for perfect remix
Ed Sheeran has recruited Beyonce for a remix of his single Perfect.
The Thinking Out Loud singer teased last week (ends26Nov17) that he had a remix for his love song featuring a huge collaborator coming out on Friday. And on Thursday, he announced it was Beyonce by sharing the artwork for the remix, which featured both their names, on Instagram. Got Beyonce to duet with me on Perfect, comes out today at 7pm ET / 4pm PT / midnight GMT, he wrote in the caption.
Speaking ahead of the release, Ed told Channel 4 Radio in the United Arab Emirates, Ive got something dropping next Friday. Its a really f**king big deal.
When asked what it will sound like, he replied, The vibe is that its a remix to Perfect. Im just basically going to Despacito Perfect.
The British star was referring to the Spanish-language track Despacito by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, which became a crossover chart smash around the world after Justin Bieber recorded verses for the remix.
Ed, 26, has worked with Beyonce before - they performed together at a Grammy tribute concert for Stevie Wonder and at Global Citizen Festival in 2015. He told People magazine in March that she is the top of his list of artists to collaborate with in the studio.
After having sung with Beyonce, Id say shes always top of my list, he said. Even just standing near her onstage makes me look better - just because shes really that amazing. She has this aura around her of just talent.
Rehearsing with her, hearing her sing up close is just a thing to marvel. Even if my career ended tomorrow, Ill still be able to tell my grandkids that I got to sing with Beyonce. She will be remembered as one of the greats.
Beyonce has featured on a few tracks this year (17) - most notably Eminems recent single Walk on Water and on a remix of J Balvins Latin hit Mi Gente. The original Perfect is currently in the top five in both the U.K. and U.S. singles charts. Music News

Boom times last with a joyful blast from the past!
My last two columns on Baby Boomers certainly appear to have sparked a good deal of hot deliberation among readers, if the written responses I received are anything to go by. Both columns for some reason prompted an unprecedented deluge of mail. Among the first to respond was my brother Denis who usually introduces himself and me, his journalist sibling as: Hi! Im Denis and this is my brother the menace!
Denis teasingly claims that he buys this newspaper on Tuesdays mostly for the Crossword. But now that the crossword has not appeared for a considerable period his excuse is that he buys it through habit. He states in his latest missive which I quote verbatim: Your last two columns would certainly have given the reader a real feel for what daily life was like for all Sri Lankans living in that decade, especially for kids growing up then.
Thanks so much for bringing up memories of our crazy past world that seems to have disappeared. It astonishes me how much has changed. In all, your pieces were a delightfully therapeutic blast from the past.
My old schoolmate Andrew, who we nicknamed AndyPandy had this to say: Thank you Gaston, old buddy, for taking us on a journey back in time which will touch each and every member of the post-war baby-boomer generation and remind them of their own journey through life. I thoroughly enjoyed both columns as they brought back so many fun memories of an earlier time and place in our country. Those times in our lives were so free and easy. You captured this freedom with vivid descriptions and wonderful wit.
Heres another from a lovely lifelong family friend, Yves: Dear Gasto, I must express my appreciation for your enchanting recent columns providing a stroll down memory lane. Thank you for allowing us to escape to a gentler time, a simpler place. As usual I loved the content, loved the writing style.
It is possible that I may have been overwhelmed by nostalgia by penning some nostalgic cameos of the past.
After all, we all know that feeling when those spacious times seemed beautiful and there is an uncontrollable longing to belong to an era that has already passed. Most of us romance our carefree childhood and want to relive those special moments every now and then. There is no gainsaying the fact that this nation, its politics, its economy and our whole way of life have changed beyond recognition and there is no going back. But we need to remember the past and learn from it. Kids today have grown up never knowing what things were like before modern technology changed our lives forever. But we do remember when these everyday things were the latest and the greatest.
Do you remember the time when little boys wore navy blue tussore shorts and white socks all year round and little girls wore white uniforms with the school initials and logo embossed on them complemented with the popular white tennis shoes or sneakers. Only girls had pierced ears then. Much to the annoyance of the girls I uncharitably called the girls shoes Sloppy Tennisuns. We learned to write decent cursive sentences with G-nib pens stuck on wooden holders which we dipped in ink wells and learned from The Royal Copy Book. That is obviously why we can string sentences together, spell and have proper conversations now because of a solid three Rs education.Many of us remember our first primers, The Radiant Way, a series of four books, written in a novel way to develop in the child a liking towards what he or she was learning. It had mellowed the various approaches to teaching the English language speech sounds for proper pronunciation, short sentences to understand language conceptualism through illustrations and exercise. Stories and tales had been selected bearing in mind the child's very limited vocabulary so as not to irk the student of this level.
Not long ago I was invited to my grand-daughter Moyas school to talk to her class and parallel classes about what school and life were like when I was growing up in the 50s and 60s. The presentation was for a hall-full of eight-year-olds. What caught the childrens attention most was that we never had computers, the internet, iPads, iPhones or any digital devices and back then, if you were naughty at school, you got the cane. I was reluctant to be too specific about the sort of punishment we Baby Boomers copped as kids. It was the sort of treatment that would now constitute a criminal offence. Back in the day though the cane was considered an important tool to maintain discipline, and discipline and the fear of the Almighty were the two things the Christian Brothers belted into us without fear or favour.
It was my belief then, that education came in a poor third. Discipline was strict. It was quite common for a disruptive child to be rapped over the knuckles, on the buttocks or on the palm of the hand with a wooden foot ruler. In boys schools our teachers hit us with rattan canes and threw the blackboard duster or a chunk of chalk at us if they thought we werent concentrating.
It is true that there was not much margin for error in that time and place and corporal punishment even for the slightest infraction was the norm.
British-style formal caning was fully lawful in Ceylon schools then and strongly supported by the government. Most of the countrys secondary schools used the cane, which was a significant element in the disciplinary system. But such punishment rarely fitted the crime and provided a free rein for appalling abuse by many tyrannical pedagogues.
In retrospect, on the surface the boomers may have appeared to be a frivolous lot living in a perpetual state of prolonged adolescence clinging to the things that connected us to our youth, like our classic rock music, and weird fads. Perhaps our fixation with the past is what keeps us young at heart and inspires us to defy time and age so we can, as we used to say, Keep on Rockin.
Sure, sometimes our actions were misguided, and we often lost our way taking dark roads of excess that led to pain, ruin and some monstrously horrible fashions. But for a time, we stood together as one and discovered the power of unity and for better or worse, changed the status quo. And while some may argue with our generations grandiose view of itself, others will join us in saluting our cherished legacy with our ostentatious cry, Say it loud: Im a boomer and Im proud!

Budget 2018 displays commitment to healthcare: Prime Minister
The 2018 Budget outlines our commitment to boosting healthcare in Sri Lanka. We have allocated over Rs. 200 billion for the health sector and we hope to increase this, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the inauguration of the National Health Research Symposium - 2017 at the BMICH in Colombo, yesterday.
According to the Prime Minister, the government will be using these funds to develop new healthcare facilities, improving hospitals and relevant infrastructure to reduce congestion and improve access, preventing the spread of diseases and enhancing medical training facilities.
The Prime Minister said the government has promised to build a strong economy that will benefit us all, through better services. We are delivering this. The health and well-being of the people is a priority of this government. We will not stand idle while people suffer like they did earlier. Since we came to power, public spending on healthcare is up by 55 percent, the Premier said.
The government has invested in building our medical capabilities through the state-of-the-art upgrades to medical faculties, other facilities such as the National Blood Centre and the National Cancer Institute. We are also building our medical skills through colleges and training facilities such as the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, Emergency and Accident Centre Project and the construction of an eight-storey ward complex at the Borella Ayurvedic Teaching Hospital in Colombo, he said.
This government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where both foreign and local companies will invest. Steps taken by the Health Ministry to develop a culture in our healthcare system to support better service delivery, demonstrates this government's commitment to the people's well-being, he added.
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said Sri Lanka still has an unfinished health agenda with the need to address Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and non standing and emerging communicable diseases, especially dengue and issues related to the aging population and malnutrition particularly among children. Over 70 percent of mortality and morbidity is due to NCDs such as heart disease, diabetes, strokes etc.
The NCDs are accountable for over 40 percent of the deaths in the country.
The keynote address was delivered by Prof. Alan Lopez. The Deputy Director General of Education Training and Research of the Health Ministry Dr. Sunil De Alwis and others also spoke.

Catering to the labour market
The Cabinet recently decided to appoint a subcommittee, comprising the Ministers of Education, Higher Education, Vocational Training and Skills Development and Science Technology and Research to prepare a Strategic Plan for promoting STEM education in Sri Lanka.
A timely move, indeed!
STEM is more than just an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. STEM is an approach and a way of thinking for educators  and to a certain extent parents  to help students integrate knowledge across subjects by incorporating flipped learning. By flipped learning its meant a type of blended learning that reverses the traditional environment by delivering instructional content outside of the classroom. It also encourages students to think in a more logical and holistic way in order to be equipped with 21st Century skills.
Experiences from many other countries reveal that a vibrant capacity in STEM education is pivotal to increasing a nations productivity. During the last two decades, STEM has become a central preoccupation of education policymakers across the world. In fact, in some developed countries, the system is now upgraded to STREAM adding robotics and arts as fields.
Suggestions
This writer has studied how a number of countries have successfully implemented STEM education system and the corresponding benefits they have reaped. With that background, he wishes to point our few issues which might have to be addressed by the sub-committee.
(1) How STEM enrolments can be introduced in three domains of our educational activities: (a) Cognitive: mental skills (knowledge), (b) Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas (attitude or self), (c) Psychomotor: manual or physical skills (skills). Most countries have allocated this as number one priority.
(2) Extent of access and absorption of STEM graduates to the labour market according to the estimated human requirements needed for projected economic growth in the next two decades.
(3) The perceived relevance of STEM to social growth and well-being of citizens.
(4) A detailed study of other countries how they have successfully increased STEM uptake with an analysis of its impact on their workforces, and lifting national performance. Study should also analyse what strategies, policies and programmes they have used to enhance STEM at all levels of education.
(5) Are measures put into effect in other countries and cultures successful and how has this been evaluated
(6) Could such measures be applied in the Sri Lankan context, taking into account our typical racial, religious and cultural diversity
(7) If not, how should the policy framework be modified to accommodate the application of appropriate measures which are acceptable to all sectors.
The country comparisons are needed for us to draw out lessons and ideas from them for introducing STEM policy and strategy in Sri Lanka. To this end, the support of a team of professionals with relevant experience (including foreign experts) can be utilized.
In global terms, Sri Lanka has so far lacked the national urgency found in the United States, East Asia and much of Western Europe, and runs the risk of being left behind.
Basics of STEM
The countries which are strong in STEM may be diverse in their economic policies, political, social and religious cultures and traditions but in their educational policies, certain features recur in common.
First, school teachers enjoy high esteem, are better paid and work within more meritocratic career structures. In China, STEM teachers receive salary increases not on the basis of seniority but via continuing professional development programmes, specific to the discipline. To be promoted Chinas teachers must demonstrate an improving standard of work.
Secondly, these countries have a solid commitment to disciplinary content knowledge. They do not equate teaching with class management and credentials alone. They focus on content knowledge, experiences and skills related to the content and critical thinking in a way that is meaningful within the content area. This contrasts sharply with our country where academic and professional development is primarily focused exclusively on the content knowledge rather than generic programmes.
Thirdly, these countries have instituted active programmes of reform in curriculum that are focused on making science and mathematics more engaging and practical, through problem-based and inquiry-based learning, and emphases on creativity and critical thinking.
Fourthly, these countries have developed strategic national policy frameworks for STEM which provide favourable conditions for a range of activities: Government funded programmes, including curriculum reform and new teaching standards, world class university programmes, the recruitment of foreign science and mathematics talent, decentralised programme initiatives and partnerships and engagement that link STEM activities in schools, vocational and higher education with industry, business and the professional organisations.
Designed-backed tasks
The integrated STEM instruction is typically accomplished through research - the use of problem or design-based tasks to engage students in addressing complex contexts that reflect real-world situations. For example, students might be invited to build an oven that is environmentally friendly or functional in settings where people do not use or not have access to electricity.
The students would use the engineering process to create a solar oven and in doing so investigate a wide range of STEM concepts such as the thermal properties of materials and how density affects a materials performance as a thermal insulator. They might use mathematics for measuring, and for graphing and interpreting data, and even develop a mathematical model of device behaviour to inform the process of design.
Malaysia
A classic example of success in STEM education is Malaysia. The importance of Mathematics, Science and Technology education has always been a priority in Malaysia.
This can be seen as far back as 1970 with the implementation of the first National Science and Technology Enrolment Policy of 60:40, which guaranteed that 60 percent of students would be enrolled in science and technology with the remaining 40 percent in arts.
In 1991, Vision 2020 was implemented and one of the goals was to establish a scientific and innovative society. As a result, the government has since established 69 science secondary schools and 51 Junior Science Colleges.
To move a step closer in achieving the goal, the Malaysia Education Blueprint was initiated in 2011. One of the priorities identified in the blueprint was STEM.
In August last year, Prime Minister Haji Mohammad Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak announced that computational thinking skills will be integrated into the countrys school curriculum in January 2017 starting with students in Year One, Forms One and Four. Why computational thinking That is because computational thinking and STEM go hand-in-hand.
In other words, computational thinking is the ability to think in a structured and logical way. This type of thought process is a methodical approach to solve problems and is used by engineers and programmers.
With 2020 just on the horizon, Malaysia is moving closer to the realisation of the goal to establish a scientific and innovative society.
Skill training
In the writers opinion, STEM education is a must for our country and should be introduced soon, at least for three good reasons.
STEM education makes students learn the skills together and study information (investigative skills of science), evaluate and make sense of information (analytical skills of mathematics) and determine how the information can solve a problem (inventive skills of engineering) using the technology available to them today.
STEM provides students with the opportunity to investigate information provided to them in order to understand it based on their own experiences; also known as contextual learning. By allowing students to construct their own meaning and understanding of an area of study strengthens their learning.
STEM also makes learning more relevant as students are exposed to the concept of what they learn based on current and real-world situations. By facilitating and asking the right questions, educators can stimulate students to incorporate identifying, comparing, predicting and testing activities in their investigation thus nurturing problem-solving skills.

How did Met Dept miss Cyclone Ockhi
Most international weather sites warned of downpours in Sri Lanka and South India this week. Some said it may lead to flooding. Accuweather.com gave the warning titled downpours return on November 23, 2017, saying rains will come to Sri Lanka and South India the following week. In fact Weather-forecast.com showed the expected path day-by-day of a depression. It currently shows another smaller depression east of Jaffna which is expected to move towards Chennai and disappear by December 5, 2017.
By Monday November 27, there were many messages and emails about an impending storm and floods this week. However, on Tuesday, November 28, a daily newspaper carried an article that the Department of Meteorology says these foreign forecasts cannot be substantiated with the data available to the Meteorological Department. People accepted that and relaxed.
The deep depression intensified into a cyclone named Ockhi, there was heavy rain and strong winds, and people were caught by surprise. Now there is more fake news spreading, because the Met Department has a credibility gap. Now more people will rely on foreign weather sites. All the warnings given by the Met Department up to that time were of no avail because seeing the statement published in the newspaper, people did not expect such bad weather.
Our Met Department is doing its best. It must be further strengthened with the equipment and personnel they need. It must be guided to have a working website which people could easily access. A ten day forecast is essential.
I often speak to a very efficient lady in the Department who has substantially educated me on weather patterns and provides me information whenever I seek. They have the expertise and knowledge. It is better if such useful information is on their new website, and educates people on the weather probably using more illustrations. Their old website was old style but far easier to access.

Comprehensive drug prevention programme soon - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said a comprehensive drug prevention programme would be initiated, adding that the government does not intend to increase state income through cigarette and alcohol sales, adding that based on the governments drug policy, it is not suitable to grant concessions to any form of alcohol, cigarette or any other intoxicant.
He said as a government all possible measures would be taken to uplift the free health service, free education and agricultural sectors.
The President made this statement in Parliament yesterday joining the Committee Stage debate on the financial heads of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and Housing and Construction Ministry.
He said the people of this country do not have to bear the burden of health and education as it is provided free. During the past few years we have made great strides in the Health and Education sectors. Hence. As a nation we can be proud of this achievement.
As a former Health Minister I know the pressure I was under, but today the Health Minister is lucky to be able to work freely without any pressure, as I have given him the space to carry out his duties as the Health Minister. He has also done a commendable job during the past three years, to uplift the health sector, the President said.
While commending the Health Minister for giving proper leadership to the Health Ministry to achieve unprecedented progress, President Sirisena said during his tenure as the Health Minister, Cancer patients were only given Rs. 1.5 million as treatment allocations.
But today, there is no limit put on the value of a life and nowhere has a limit been imposed. Cancer patients can now get the best treatment without having to worry about the costs. We are fortunate to have good doctors, nurses and other support staff in the health sector. It is due to their commitment that we have been able to gain praise even from the WHO, the President said.
The President said work is to commence on the construction of a kidney hospital in Polonnaruwa with Chinese aid at a cost of $ 12000 million. The Chinese government had pledged to construct this hospital during President Sirisenas first official visit to China as the President.
Further, during my official visit to Australia last year, I observed the great success Australia has gained in the health sphere through nuclear technology and requested their expertise for Sri Lanka, which they obliged. Hence we signed an agreement and the benefits of this effort will also be seen in the near future, he said.
He said two hostels are currently being constructed in Kandy and Anuradhapura for the guardians of cancer patients to be accommodated while the patients are undergoing treatment.Further, water purification units have been set up in many parts of the country, courtesy of the Navy and other donors.
Meanwhile, the President also commended the Housing and Construction Minister for implementing an excellent programme in providing housing facilities for the homeless in the country.

Country to get automatic rain gauge network soon
The Government yesterday told Parliament that an automatic rain gauge network would soon be installed to develop weather forecasting system.
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella was responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena over the poor early warning on the storm that lashed the island on November 29.
Minister Kiriella pointed out that it is hard to cope with the nature even with modern technology. He said the USA, even with its latest technological equipment, was unable to predict accurately the recent natural disaster it faced.
MP Gunawardena pointed out the Met Department had failed to adequately warn the general public on the impending disaster.
Why dont you resolve the main problems that crippled the work at these institutions The Met Chief had stated that he could not issue weather alerts in Tamil as his department does not have a translator. I am sure if the Prime Minister was made aware of it, he would have taken prompt action to recruit somebody. He understands the gravity of these problems. The country is prone to more and more weather related disasters in the future, he said.
The MP, alleging that the international warnings on impending disaster were ignored, queried whether the Government is ready to face another storm. He reminded that the people affected by the floods are still awaiting compensation.
Minister Kiriella reading out the reply on behalf of the Prime Minister said the Met Department had issued warnings for the fisheries and naval communities and added that those helped to save many lives and equipment of the fishing community. He pointed out that the Oki Cyclone developed when it was 400km away from Sri Lanka. The strong winds lashed the country were a result of the depression prior to the cyclone, he said.
He said the Cabinet approval was given to evacuate 14,860 families from landslide prone areas, and 1,122 families in flood high risk zones and resettle them in safer locations. Under the NITF insurance scheme, compensation to a maximum limit of Rs. 2.5 million is being paid for damages to houses and small and medium scale enterprises, he said.
The damages to domestic appliances are compensated to a maximum limit of Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 100,000 is paid for a death, he said.
Deputy Ministers Ajith P. Perera and Dr. Harsha de Silva joining in the conversation pointed out that the Grama Niladari Officers and Divisional Secretaries were not adequately aware of the compensation payment of the NITF.
These officers who have no proper knowledge on assessment method are assessing as if the money is given from their own pocket or a donation. This compensation is a citizens right that the Government has secured by paying a premium to the NITF. The authorities must be made aware of the process, Ajith P. Perera said.
Dr. Harsha de Silva said several Divisional Secretaries had refused to pay compensations for the damages less than Rs. 10,000.
He added that those people are entitled to receive the compensation. He noted stern action should be taken against the technical officers who failed to report to duty on the long weekend the disaster occurred.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya advised the Government to streamline the disaster management mechanism to resolve the issues.

Creating meaningful music!
Mintaka, is the westernmost star on the belt of Orion. It is a very bright and blue star and associated with very positive qualities. It also happens to be an ancient Arabic name for that star. It is a fitting name for such a talented band that is very versatile. Melodies speaks to Chris Dhason about Mintaka and its rise to glory.
It had been a long time dream of mine to play in a band that concentrates predominantly on Soul, R&B, Blues and Funk for a long time. These genres were missing in the repertoires of all the Sri Lankan bands I had been hearing as most bands were concentrating on the accepted dance songs common to paradise, said Dhason.
At the moment the band is Sheaam Dean and Terry Bertus on vocals, Viraj perera on keyboards, Nilantha Coba Ariyaratne on bass, veteran Revel Crake on guitar and myself on drums.
Right now, we play together exclusively at the Kingsbury and that too only on Mondays. The reason being that Terry and Viraj (Both original members) now have their own band  Rock This Country, Nilantha and I have as our main gig, Wildfire. Revel is a freelance jazz musician and Sheaam runs his own studio, stated Dhason.
Chris Dhason
Playing in Mintaka has been a phenomenal experience for all involved. It pretty much carved out their destinies. It set them on the path to stardom. Now they are successful musicians who have all benefited from playing alongside each other.
Success is a subjective word. We started in March 2014 at The Qbaa Club. None of these musicians had experience with these genres before. I virtually handpicked them (Ramesh Nonis was the original guitarist) and threw them into the deep end. They were totally out of their comfort zone. They not only survived, but also dug deep and pulled out a facet of their talent they would never have realized was there, until they were challenged in this manner. Today I can proudly say that they all are better musicians because of the Mintaka experience, explained Dhason.
Like the star Mintaka, Dhason and his band shine in the music industry. They have fast made a name for themselves as gifted musicians. Some of the songs he has done have made a huge impact on society.
Most of my music is unreleased. However the 2002 Cricket championship trophy theme, A rainbow out of sight was written by me and performed live at the opening ceremony by Wildfire. I have also written the corporate theme song for Sri Lankan Airlines. In the aftermath of the Tsunami in December 2004, We are Sri Lankan was subsequently re-recorded as a tri-lingual version in January 2005. This was with the full support of many Sri Lankan musicians who appeared free. And the resulting DVD was sold on board Sri Lankan airlines and the entire proceeds went towards a Sri Lankan Cares Project to help children affected by the disaster, said Dhason.
Dhason has got used to the pressure over the years. His personal brilliance and the top quality of the band make it easier to perform. Dhason has said that over the years, you tend to get used to it. Dhason just enjoy life and enjoys his music. Pitfalls can be avoided due to the bands experience and the bands strength as team. There is nothing to fear. Their star has been on the rise for a long time now.
When writing lyrics I need to have a theme, a story to trigger me off. Or just a nice idea. Lyrics are really interesting to write when you have a story to tell or a message to get across, said Dhason. Mintaka is all about Soul, R&B, Funk and of course the blues. Their repertoire ranges from Motown classics such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and John Mayer to Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield and Al Jarreau. This incarnation also embraces jazz in its repertoire mainly because of Revels experience in the field as Sri Lankas foremost jazz guitarist. Dhason admires hard work and he admires greatness. Dhason who can immediately identify potential and talent in a musician appreciates good music. Music is this mans life and music is meaningful to him.
I love so many artistes that it is impossible to name them all. However those that proved to be pathfinders and/or overcame many hardships to become the great musicians they did become have a special place in my heart, said Dhason.
Dhason and his band have entered the music industry because of this single minded devotion and love for music. They are committed because this is what makes them who they are. Music is what defines them.
If you are a genuine artiste, there is an inner compulsion. You have no choice in the matter. You must then follow your passion. There are those who dont for whatever reason and they end up being very frustrated and unhappy beings. When I started, there was no one to teach me and I had to find out things on my own. Those days we did not have access to the Internet or even videos and DVDs and I never even had access to a teacher, as I didnt own an instrument, pointed out Dhason.
Dhason has a powerful message to give out to a young guy or girl who wants to make it in the music industry
To make a career in music is to start a journey that never really stops until YOU do! Formal education in music is actually a must today. Never stop learning and evolving as a musician. Follow your dreams and your passion but it is also important to study the roots and those who came before you. This is one of the reasons I continue with Mintaka. I wanted to give younger musicians an opportunity to do just that in a suitable environment, summed up Dhason.
A special mention has to be made of our second guitarist young Milinda Perera who is now in the USA. Mintaka was the very first band he had played using an electric guitar and he improved tremendously in the period he was with us. One thing he did was to listen extensively to the old Blues guitarists and practice.

From crisis to resilience  Part 6: Do they have any idea how valuable I am to the company
When you begin to think of your career advancement, the two biggest questions you have to ask yourself are - What is my value to the organization What am I doing to contribute to the bottom line
Remember, as one of the executives of the company, (senior or junior) youre supposed to be an investment. Your company pays you a salary and other perks and they expect a good return. The more value you contribute, the better the investment and the more likely they are to continue investing in your future - and potentially invest in a bigger way. That means raises, promotions and job security for you.
Your actions in the workplace have an impact, whether you realize it or not. The more you can create measurable, positive, powerful outcomes through your actions, the more people will sit up and take notice. The more theyll want to keep you happy and acknowledge you for your efforts.
Improve value
Take for example, you are an administrative professional whose role is to purchase office supplies. Sure, you could simply follow the standard procedure, place orders for items requested from approved vendors, and ensure the purchased products are received in time.
Or, you could find simple ways to improve your value like, (1) Researching vendors to find more competitive pricing and making informed recommendations to decision-makers. (2) Aggressively negotiating with existing vendors for better pricing. (3) Creating an office supply sharing program between departments so inventory doesnt pile up in one area while another is always in need. (4) Purchasing in bulk when appropriate to increase savings. (5) Strategically purchasing to take advantage of sales, rebates and discounts. (6) Offering tips to help staff members reduce waste of supply inventory, and planning to start a competition or reward system to inspire participation.
These value-add tactics arent defined anywhere in your job description. It takes a few extra hours of thought and a little imagination, but using these strategies, you could save your company (say) over Hundred Thousand per month.
And think about it: If you track your cost-saving initiatives and measure the positive results, you could certainly make a compelling case for a raise in the future. Perhaps higher management maybe already aware of it. If your actions have a positive impact on the organizations bottom line, your value is higher than that of your peers who are simply going through the motions status quo. Every Rupee your company chooses to spend employing therefore becomes a superior investment. Who wouldnt be willing to pay a little more for an employee like that
Tips
Dont expect your bosses to notice your extra work, staying late at work, working weekends, or additional training, creative ideas, and special projects. You may be enthusiastic and intelligent, communicate effectively, exhibit strong leadership skills, embrace change, work efficiently, and possess technical competence and strong interpersonal skills - yet still find yourself struggling, simply because you fail to persuade the skills, ideas, and commitment that are vital to Team Success.
Follow these few tips to ensure that you have a good chance of proving that you are an executive worth positive consideration.
Help generate revenue:
If your organization is committed to making a profit by providing top-quality products/services along with extra value to its customers, then you must show how you contributes to that pursuit. The customer ultimately determines the ability to make a profit.
As Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, American multinational retail corporation, said: There is only one bossthe customer. And he can fire everybody, by spending his money elsewhere. You must bring added value in the form of profits by focusing on the impact on customers.
When you are helping in the success of the company financially, you prove your value. Companies want to make sure they are getting a return on their investment, so if you can focus your time on adding financial value to the company by excelling at your assignments and projects, then it shows that they made a good investment in you as a professional person.
Help save money:
You can also help increase profits by saving money. Leaders seek to save in five ways: 1) reduce staff (downsizing), 2) cut benefits, 3) lower salaries, 4) decrease products or services (cutbacks), or 5) increase productivity. Since you arent interested in the first four options, think of ways to increase your productivity by working smarter and producing more to maintain your earnings and benefits. If you are worried about your job security and frustrated by the extra work and fewer resources, you cant let this affect your job performance. If you can spot money-wasting activities and then come up with a solution to remedy the situation, youll prove your sincerity, commitment and added value.
Standout in a Positive Way:
Many people argue, whine, and complain about their jobs, duties, customers, equipment, and co-workers. If you attract attention by being negative, dont be surprised when you lose focus on goal, results and ultimately your opportunity! Negative attention does not help. People should associate your name, face, and expertise with positive feelings about your work, your teamwork, your customer commitment, and the value you bring.
Stay away from trolls:
The single most detrimental thing for a thriving and productive team is negativity. In order to show your value, be that positive influence in a team or group, and encourage your peers to be the same. If you come across someone who is essentially trolling, be honest with them that their negativity is not welcome. Encourage them to change their attitude and try to look for ways to help them. If they persist, then they should be removed from a project.
Invest in yourself as a professional person. Take time out of your life to treat yourself like a shiny, new product ready to be marketed to the world. Invest in yourself through blogging, participating in networking events, attending lectures, talking to new people, and sharing new ideas. By doing this, companies see that you take the time to build yourself up as a professional, and help boost the company by representing them well in the industry.
Get smart!
Staying on top of new and interesting developments in the industry keeps ideas and conversations fresh. Reading, learning, and discussing these topics shows that you are flexible and interested in the future. It makes for some fun discussion with peers at the next company outing.
Be reliable and dependable: Make sure you work all the hours you have agreed to and more. Arrive early and leave late. Dont tend to be clock watchers; shop the bosses that you are willing to go the extra mile and work hard. Confirm that the time you take your lunch break is convenient and be back with time to spare. Let your bosses know that you are available to work when and where needed  be as flexible as possible with your scheduling.
Look the part: Make sure you dress according to the company culture and that you appear well groomed and neat. Pay attention to all aspects, from your hair to your shoes. If you wear a uniform, make sure it is clean and pressed, even if it means washing and ironing at night!
Have a positive attitude:
Show confidence, enthusiasm and a strong work ethic. Be a problem-solver rather than the employee who moans and finds fault. Show that you are self-motivated and proactive. Take care of problems and deal with issues as they arise. Speak up if you have a good idea. Dont miss an opportunity to show your ability to take initiative.
Volunteer for extra duties:
Show that you are not just there to work the bare minimum and make some holiday cash, but that you are a committed and enthusiastic worker. Prove your value and versatility by going above and beyond what is asked of you. Be the first to volunteer for extra work. Pay close attention to everything and be prepared to learn new tasks. Be proactive bout developing new skills and gaining pertinent knowledge.
Be careful what you say:
Avoid spending time gossiping with colleagues, especially about other workers, the leaders or the company. This is always notices by employers and is not the responsible behaviour they want from future employees. Do not engage in personal conversations with other employees with earshot of customers. Be friendly, but keep your discussions positive and work-related as much as possible.
Remain calm under pressure:
Demonstrate a cool head in busy and stressful situations. Try not to panic if you start to feel overloaded; just keep working steadily through whatever comes your way. This will help you stand out from other holiday employees as a professional and calm employee.
Note for new executives
If you are a newly promoted or recruited leader, then your action plan should be Stretch and learn. Start by taking on responsibilities and duties associated with your position. Get to know what is required of the person doing the job, to acquire those necessary skills and knowledge.
Be willing to attend company-provided training, or take the initiative to strike out on your own to find educational and skill-building courses that make you the best possible candidate for the promotion. Examples abound of leaders who started at the lowest position in the leadership profile in a company only to rise to a position of prominence by following this simple action plan. Find your inspiration by looking up a few of them and then do what they've done to get what you want.
Remember: those who are highly valued are most likely to be the first to be considered for career advancement or some of the companys best new assignments. And during tough times, those who are highly valued will most likely not be the first targets in a corporate downsizing. In addition, increasing and improving value to an organization can increase self-satisfaction, thereby decreasing stress.

A dark era in Sri Lankan history
One of the biggest burdens the Yahapalana Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had to bear apart from saving the Country from the debt trap, was to clear the stigma attached to the Country for alleged human rights abuses left over by the previous regime.
A spate of abductions and killings of high profile journalists, rights defenders and innocent civilians brought an international discredit to the Country due to the failure on the part of the government headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to probe the crimes.
The present government has now successfully set about the task of undoing the damage and clearing the Countrys international image by instituting legal action against these past misdeeds and enhancing democracy, freedom and human rights in the country.
Attacks on media

Divine, yet Worldly Harmony..!
Just a Tuesday ago, seventy-three voices and an orchestra of thirty-one raised their voices, violins, violas, cellos, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, french horns, trumpets, trombones, and a timpani,making glorious music! There must have been a smile on Mozarts face somewhere in the heavens as he heard Indians from Mumbai and Chennai, HarinAmirthanathan and Johann Peiris from Sri Lanka, and musicians from the former states of the Soviet Union, soloists from Italy, all blending their talents together to form melodious harmony!
Not once did a tenor from India turn to another from Sri Lanka, or a soprano from Mumbai to one from Chennai, or soloist from India to an Italian and say, Hey, thats not how we sing here!
Instead, together they produced divine harmony!
Music from around the world sounded the same: Voices sang same notes, same way!Music scores had same print, similar notations, quite often same numbered page.
How unifying, the power of music!
And as my ears still hear the awesome voices singing Mozarts Requiem and his Coronation Mass, the instruments sensationally resounding in the auditorium, as my eyes still see the petite figure of conductor CoomiWadia, producing divine harmony with such a diverse group, I ask but one question, Why cant it be so with the world
Mozart composed, with his mind filled with pictures of magnificence. He drew from those images of peace, of love, and with quill and ink made the divine, worldly for us.
Cant we who look for differences amongst our fellow men, raise our vision, and instead of seeing dissimilarities with our neighbor, differencesof colour, unfamiliarity of language, and variation in worship, instead raise our glances like Mozart did, and feel same abiding peace and love, and gathering those grand emotional passions, raise our thoughts to a blending of glorious harmony
Today, our world needs the harmony of Mozart. As presidents talk of building walls to shut others out, as leaders plant discord in the minds of communities, as men and women with bombs strapped on themselves or carrying sharp edged stones inflict injury, physical and mental on innocents, it is time to lift our eyes, so that, instead of producing screams of agony, shouts of vengeance, cries of anger, those same sounds will change, voices soften, tones sweeten, and divine music fill the worlds air!
Twas just a Tuesday ago, seventy-three voices and an orchestra of thirty-one raised their voices, violins, violas, cellos, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, french horns, trumpets, trombones, and a timpani and made glorious music! All blending to form melodious harmony!
Let us, like them, raise our eyes, our minds, and in this the month of Christmas, feel the strains of glorious thought, flowing, blending, balancing, and producing a divine blend of worldly harmony..!

Non-competing products enjoy duty concessions under FTAs between the countries and have less trade restrictions than for competing products.

England hit back as Australia build 268-run lead
Adelaide: Australia wrestled with a seaming pink ball under floodlights to build a 268-run lead with six wickets in hand over England in an engrossing second Ashes Test in Adelaide on Monday.
In testing batting conditions the Australians struggled against the moving ball in the final twilight session as England roared back after trailing by 215 runs on the first innings.
In a fast-moving third day, England were dismissed for 227 but the Australians found it difficult to score against the hooping ball under the lights, in the first-ever Ashes day/night match.
At the close, Australia were 53 for four with Peter Handscomb on three and nightwatchman Nathan Lyon not out three.
We know the night sessions are the toughest but to be four down we still have a 268-run lead and day sessions to come. Were still very much in the driving seat, said fast bowler Mitchell Starc.
The Australians lost the wickets of Cameron Bancroft (4) and Usman Khawaja (20) to James Anderson and that of a restrained David Warner (14) to Chris Woakes in the final session.
Skipper Steve Smith survived a desperately close leg before wicket review off Anderson before he had scored. But he missed out in another tight lbw review, dismissed by Woakes for six.
Holders England were fighting to stay in the Test as Australia chased a potentially decisive 2-0 lead in the five-Test series after winning last weeks Brisbane opener by 10 wickets.
Weve fought back well, weve pushed Australia back tonight and we can take some positive stuff from that, Woakes said.
Obviously, were behind in the game, but at the same time its really good that weve fought back and showed some good character to get ourselves back and put some pressure on Australia.
Lyon and Starc brought off spectacular catches as Australia put England under pressure in the first two sessions Monday.
Off-spinner Lyon pulled off a blinding one-handed catch to dismiss Moeen Ali off his own bowling in the second over after the first break.
Moeen chipped to the left of Lyon, who flung himself across the pitch in a split-second reaction to take the catch.
It was another sublime display of skill from Lyon, nicknamed GOAT (Greatest Of All Time), following his laser-like throw to run out James Vince in the first Test.
Moeen had scored 25 off 57 balls in a 30-run stand with Jonny Bairstow.
Five overs later Bairstow was on his way for 21 after Starc juggled the return catch and finally accepted it behind his back.
Woakes and Craig Overton dug in to put on 66 for the eighth wicket before Woakes fell to a short-pitched Starc delivery, spooning a catch back to the bowler for 36. Overton remained unbeaten on 41.
Stuart Broad and Anderson were dismissed shortly after the dinner break, both off Lyon, to end the England innings.
Lyon finished with four for 60 and took over from South Africas Kagiso Rabada (54) as the worlds leading wicket-taker this year with 55, while paceman Starc claimed three for 49.
Australia had grabbed four wickets in the first session, including key batsmen Joe Root and Alastair Cook.
Root shaped to drive Pat Cummins, only to send a thick edge to Cameron Bancroft at third slip for just nine.
Root, third in the Test batting rankings, only faced 10 balls while Cook, Englands other big hope, was deceived by Lyons flight and edged to Steve Smith at slip for 37 off 90 balls.
The former captain, who plundered 766 runs when England won in Australia seven years ago, has scores of two, seven and 37 in his three innings in the current series.
Vince went in the days second over to a poor shot, edging Josh Hazlewood outside off-stump to wicketkeeper Tim Paine for two. Dawid Malan was the other wicket to fall in the first session off an inside edge caught behind off Cummins for 19. AFP

Facebook creates 800 jobs as it opens new London office
By the end of next year about 2,300 people will work for the social media company in the UK.
The office will be Facebook's biggest engineering hub outside the US, and opens during its tenth year in the UK.
Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's Europe, Middle East and Asia vice-president, said the company was more committed than ever to the UK.
She said Britain's entrepreneurial ecosystem and engineering excellence made it an ideal location for technology firms.
The seven-floor building at Rathbone Place, near Oxford Circus in central London, was designed by Frank Gehry, the architect best known for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.
It will accommodate engineers and developers as well as marketing and sales teams. The building will also house a dedicated incubator space for start-ups, called LDN-LAB.
UK-based start-ups will be invited to take part in three month programmes designed to help kickstart their businesses.
Facebook experts from disciplines including engineering, product and partnerships will work with the companies as part of the initiative. Julian David of techUK, which represents 950 technology firms in the UK, welcomed a world-leading company such as Facebook investing in London despite the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.
Chancellor Philip Hammond said Facebook's decision to expand in London was a sign of confidence in Britain.
The UK is not only the best place to start a new business, it's also the best place to grow one, he added. (BBC)

Fear is (not) the key
Gota Apey (Gota is Ours) proclaims a poster that has recently appeared on Colombos hoardings. Although we have no idea exactly who is described by the word ours in the poster, it appears to be part of a campaign by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to signal that he might make a political bid. This is not as easy as it sounds, because Gotabhaya is an American citizen for all intents and purposes. The recent Geetha Kumarasinghe case clearly proves that there is no place in local politics for dual or foreign nationals from both a legal and moral perspective.
Gotabhaya, or Gota as he is widely known, actually left the Army at the height of the war. Then he left for the USA while his compatriots including Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Wijaya Wimalaratna and Sarath Fonseka bravely fought the enemy on the battlefields in the North and the East. Gotabhaya became a US citizen, got down his extended family to the USA and returned to Sri Lanka only after his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected President in 2005.
So far there is no evidence that Gotabhaya intends to revoke US citizenship. His campaign, which has seemingly come from nowhere with no Presidential or General election in sight till 2020, looks more like an attempt to drive the message of fear into the hearts of voters on the presumption that he might play a bigger political role. After all, fear is what the Rajapaksa regime specialized in.
Gotabhaya has been waging a different kind of war than the one portrayed in the book Gotas War. This war was not against the defeated LTTE  it was against political opponents of the Rajapaksa regime, journalists, civil society activists, trade unionists, university students, intellectuals, the judiciary and of course, ordinary people who dared to rise against the injustices perpetrated by the Rajapaksa regime. The regime had a weapon that terrorized everyone who dared to challenge the Rajapaksas  the White Van. Those who criticized the Rajapaksa family were abducted in white vans, beaten to a pulp or murdered in cold blood and some were made to disappear.
Today, many who praise the virtues of the Rajapaksas seem to suffer from collective amnesia, having forgotten the many atrocities committed during the Rajapaksa regime. Who in his right mind can forget the brutal killing of Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunga, who fearlessly exposed the MiG procurement scandal He was killed with military precision in broad daylight by men who rode black motorcycles. Several other journalists including Poddala Jayantha, Keith Noyahr and Upali Tennakoon barely survived after being white vanned. There is still no trace of cartoonist Pradeep Ekneligoda. The offices of Siyatha TV and Sirasa were razed to the ground. Sri Lanka was then rated as the worst place to work if you were a journalist. In sharp contrast, this year Sri Lanka has exited Global Impunity Index for crimes against Journalists.
We thus have one question for those who advocate a return to the Rajapaksa era - where are the much feared White Vans today The very fact that white vans have totally disappeared under the Yahapalana Government proves that they were very much an instrument of the Rajapaksas used to intimidate and silence political opponents.
Among the many other incidents reported under Gotabhayas watch as defence secretary were the killings of FTZ worker Roshen Chanaka; fisherman Jude Anthony; three Rathupaswala water protestors; national rugby player Wasim Thajudeen and 27 prisoners of the Welikada jail. Gotabhaya was also behind the infamous expulsion of Tamil lodgers in Colombo to Vavuniya which was declared illegal by the Supreme Court. The public can also remember how former Chief Justice Shiranee Bandaranayake was hounded out of office virtually overnight.
These are among the many reasons why the public returned a decisive verdict on January 8, 2015, reaffirmed on August 17, 2015 to comprehensively defeat the Rajapaksa regime. The Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has once again upheld the rule of law, restored the independence of the judiciary and ensured the supremacy of democracy. To cite two examples that illustrate the difference between the two administrations, President Sirisenas own brother was recently remanded over a traffic accident and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was called to give evidence before the Treasury Bond Commission. These would have been unthinkable under the Rajapaksa Government  leave alone the Premier, not even a Pradeshiya Sabha member had to go before a court of law then.
With a campaign on to bring Gotabhaya to the limelight, the time has come to ask some tough questions. He has sworn allegiance to defend the Constitution of a foreign country and shown no sign of annulling that citizenship. Sri Lanka needs leaders who uphold our Constitution, democratic traditions and moral values. Fear has no place in our psyche anymore. The people have tasted real democracy and freedom for nearly three years  there is no way that Gotabhaya or anyone else can take them away now or in the future.

Ferrell finds unlikely co-star in Mel Gibson
This family reunion comes with a dose of holiday hijinks  and some extra baggage.
Will Ferrells new comedy, Daddys Home 2, centers around his overly earnest character Brad Whitaker co-existing with his wifes rough-and-tough ex-husband Dusty Mayron (played by Mark Wahlberg), until drama ensues when their respective fathers come to town for Christmas.
The film features a controversial cast addition in Mel Gibson, who stars in his first family comedy in over a decade after his infamous 2006 drunk-driving arrest and anti-Semitic rant, followed by audio of hateful tirades against an ex-girlfriend that was released four years later.
Gibson, who plays Dustys bad-boy father Kurt in the new film, has slowly returned to Hollywood after a lengthy hiatus from mainstream moviemaking, notably starring in the 2014 thriller The Expendables 3 and directing the Oscar-nominated war drama Hacksaw Ridge last year. Ferrell believes viewers will embrace seeing Gibson, 61, in a different type of role.
Hes going to open audiences eyes with how great he is in comedy, Ferrell told the Daily News.
I think this was kind of a fun thing for him to step outside, be on camera after having an absence for a while, and also (doing) a family, PG-13 comedy was something he hasnt really done, he said. I think if he chooses to do more of that, hes going to be more than back.

Fortune favours New Zealand as Windies crash to innings defeat
WELLINGTON: Fortune favoured New Zealand, according to captain Kane Williamson after they cleaned up the first Test against the West Indies by an innings and 67 runs on day four in Wellington on Monday.
The West Indies collapsed spectacularly in their second innings to be all out for 319.
After a strong start, when they reached 231 for two, they lost their last eight wickets for 88 runs as they chased a monumental 386 to make New Zealand bat again.
New Zealand's keeper Tom Blundell appeals for a LBW call on West Indies' Kraigg Brathwaite off Mitchell Santer, during day four of the first Test cricket match between New Zealand and the West Indies at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on AFP
But the real damage was done when Williamson won the toss and made the West Indies bat first on a green surface.
They were rolled for 134 and as the pitch flattened out New Zealand took charge with a monumental 520 for nine declared.
I thought in the first innings we were fairly fortunate as well as bowling very well in exploiting the bounce in the surface, Williamson said.
So we knew in the second innings, when the wicket became a little flatter, it was going to be a tough job to bowl them out.
I thought the bowlers were exceptional to change their type of thought to play the long game, be patient with the way they operated and we saw the rewards in the second session today. After resuming Monday at 214 for two, needing a further 172 runs to make New Zealand bat again, the West Indies innings unravelled when Kraigg Brathwaite went for 91.
If was the first of three wickets before lunch and the last five fell for just 33 runs in nine overs after the interval.
But captain Jason Holder rejected suggestions they had caved in, saying the plan was to play positively.
We said there's two days left in the game and we had to knock off the deficit and the only way to do that was staying positive. I don't think anyone was reckless at any stage, he said.
Unfortunately we lost Kraigg and we never gathered momentum afterwards.
Near unplayable
After Brathwaite's dismissal, lbw to spinner Mitchell Santer, New Zealand took the new ball and removed Shai Hope (37)and Ronson Chase (18) before lunch.
Sunil Ambris went on the first ball after the resumption of play and the tail followed quickly.
Matt Henry took three for 57 and Neil Wanger two for 102 to finish with nine for the match.
Wagner, who was near unplayable in the first innings as he took a career best seven for 39 with his short-pitched deliveries, was named man-of-the-match.
His ability to bowl that short-pitched bowling as accurately as he does, is not an easy thing to do.
We don't see many bowlers able to do that, that accurately, and for that long a period of time, Williamson said.
Holder put it down to indecisive batting which he believed would be rectified before the second and final Test starts in Hamilton on Saturday. We lost the first Test match obviously but there's a chance to put things right in the second Test, he said.

FR filed seeking order staying Election Commission holding elections to three Pradeshiya Sabhas
A Fundamental Rights petition was yesterday filed in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking steps to hold elections for the election of members to three Pradeshiya Sabhas, including the Ambagamuwa Pradehiya Sabha established by Gazette Notification dated November 2, 2017 until the final determination of this petition.
The petitioner, H.D.D. Nandaraja, a former member of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha also seeking an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette issued by the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Governments dated 2.11.2017 in respect of these Pradeshiya Sabhas until the final determination of this application.
The petitioner stated that Minister Faiszer Musthapa, by order published in the Gazette No.2043/57 of 2.11.2017 dissolved the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha with effect from the 14th day of February 2018 in order to constitute new Pradeshiya Sabhas, namely the Maskeliya Pradesh Sabha, Norwood Pradeshiya Sabha and Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha.
The Petitioner states that the Local Government Minister in declaring the dissolution of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba and constituting the aforesaid three Pradeshiya Sabas has inter alia-
(1) Effected the sub-division of the local government areas of the Former Ambagaumwa Pradeshiya Saba solely on an ethnic basis;
(2) Failed to consider the historical importance, significance and sacred value of the Sri Pada for the Buddhists, which is located within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(3) Failed to consider the identity and the rights of the historical inhabitants residing within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(4) Failed to assure due protection and fostering of Buddha Sasana (guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution) by placing the Sri Pada, the most Sacred Place of worship of Buddhists and the sanctuary forming part and parcel thereof in immense danger of mismanagement and ill-treatment by non-Buddhists;
(5) Failed to consider the historical and social reasons and requirements for the demarcation of the existing boundaries of the Ambagauwa Pradeshiya Saba and the need to correspond to the limits of the Assistant Government Agents Division (Divisional Secretary);
(6) Failed to consider the equal right for effective participation of the people in local government and development of the people living in the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba limits and right for equal distribution of the revenue, wealth and natural resources therein;
(7) Acted ultra-vires, arbitrary, capricious and violate the principle of natural Justice and Rule of law.
The petitioner said though there has been no date fixed by the Election Commission to call for nominations with regard to the elections of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba, he has made public announcements that such nominations would be called for Local Government bodies of the entire country together. Nominations for some of the Local Government institutions have already been called for by the Chairman of the Commissioner of Elections.
The Petitioner is seeking permission of Your Lordships Court to seek an interim relief by way of a stay order staying or restraining the Election Commission from taking steps to hold such elections for the Pradehiya Sabas established by said gazette until the final determination of this Application; which if implemented shall cause detrimental and irreparable violations of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner and the people of Sri Lanka.

Horizon Campus partners with Government of Sri Lanka
With more than 80% of academically well prepared Sri Lankan students being deprived each year of entering state universities due to capacity constraints in the universities, Horizon Campus has taken the initiative to expand access to higher education at their campus through the launch of an Interest-Free Student Loan Scheme in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka.
This is offered for Advanced Level students who have qualified for university entrance but have not been able to secure a seat in a state university to pursue a Degree of their choice.
In this endeavor, Horizon as a campus recognized by the Ministry of Higher Education will provide opportunities to those students who are unable to bear the cost of course fees of their degrees affiliated with foreign universities, the opportunity to finance their higher education after they complete their studies and enter employment.
Minister Grero State Minister of Higher Education and Highways,who was present at the launch of this program said that this was a historical day of the Sri Lankan education sector, where all students in the country will have access to higher education degrees of their choice.
Also present at this function were D. M. GunasekaraGeneral Manager - Bank of Ceylon, Upul Daranagama (Chairman Horizon Group), Ajitha Wanainghe/CEO Horizon Campus, Dr. Ruwan Perera (Acting Vice chancellor Horizon Campus), Prof. T. Thanaraj Dean, Faculty of Education, Horizon Campus, Dr. Amal Rajapakse, Dean, Faculty of Information Technology Horizon Campus, Terence Kahapolarachchi Dean, Faculty of Management Horizon Campus and Thilina Rajapakse Project Director, B.Ed, Horizon Campus.
Upul Daranagama, Chairman of Horizon Campus said, By partnering in this loan scheme with the Government , we can expect to produce a pool of high level human capital, which is essential for the economic and human development of the country and is therefore of central importance to its future development .In line with the Budget Proposal of 2017 that suggested to provide opportunities to students who are qualified in G.C.E (A/L) but miss out university entrance, this student loan scheme, will offer a maximum loan amount of Rs.800,000.00per student for the entire course of study.
Programs offered at Horizon campus for this loan scheme include the Bachelor of Science in Business Management (HRM), Bachelor of Management Honors in Marketing, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Bachelor of Information Technology in Networking and Mobile Computing (Honors) and Bachelor of Education.
The students who sat for G.C.E (A/L) in 2015 are eligible for this scheme. Each student will be given any number of preferences for the degree programs based on their personal interest.
An online system hosted under www.studentloans.mohe.gov.lk can be used to submit the application by the qualified applicants with a payment of Rs.200/.
Selected students need to enter into a loan agreement with the Bank of Ceylon which provides these loan facilities. Students who are selected for the 4 years Degree program will be given a total period of 12 years as loan repayment period, whilst students who selected for the 3 years Degree program will be given a total period of 10 years as loan repayment period.
Daranagama added, Any country risks falling behind in the knowledge-driven global economy if it doesnt expand its higher education sector. As such, Government-backed student credit is a financial instrument well suited to funding higher education.Such a scheme eliminates the financial barriers to higher education. If managed correctly, it could deliver increased access and academic excellence more effectively than other funding options.
I personally believe that this well-designed student loan scheme is the solution to Sri Lankas higher education funding crisis and this is the reason that we at Horizon Campus endorse this move and have also partnered in this initiative.

ICAN air transport confab opens in Colombo
The 10th ICAN (ICAO Air Services Management Negotiation Event) conference began in Colombo yesterday and will conclude on November 8 at the Hilton Colombo.
Around 500 delegates from more than 75 states are participating in this event. The conference also will provide Sri Lanka the opportunity to meet nearly 30 states with a view of liberalizing air services agreements and expanding the existing provisions.
Chief Guest, Minister of Transport and Civil AviationNimal Siripala de Silva, said thatair travel which was considered a luxury in the past have become an indispensable mode of travel for promotion of commerce, trade and travel. It is fast becoming affordable to a greater section of the average community.
We know that a strong and affordable global air transport network goes beyond continents, greatly expands local access to foreign supplies and markets, provides invaluable opportunities for cultural and social exchange and enhances emergency and humanitarian response capabilities during crises and public health emergencies.
Air transport has over the past few years shown a prominent and promising growth both in terms of demand and supply in capacity. Since of late, the global airline industry has started making positive financial results, whilst consumers are continuing to enjoy lowering air fares.
It is inspiring to note that amidst growing traffic, the air transport sector has been able to maintain an impressive safety record thanks to tireless efforts and work done by all involved. As per ICAO statistics this year there have been only three accidents resulting in 47 fatalities. It is a significant achievement compared to past consecutive years.

Indias first post-GST budget likely on February 1
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is likely to present India's first post-GST and the current government's last full Budget on February 1 next year.
The Budget session of Parliament may begin on January 30 with President Ram Nath Kovind addressing the Joint Session of both the Houses of Parliament, a senior government official said.
The Economic Survey, detailing the state of the economy, is likely to be tabled on January 31 and the Union Budget may be presented the following day, he said.
Scrapping the colonial-era tradition of presenting the Budget at the end of February, Jaitley had for the first time presented the annual accounts on February 1 this year.
The Budget presentation was advanced by a month to ensure that proposals take effect from April 1, the beginning of the new financial year.
Also, the nearly century old tradition of having a separate budget for the railways was scrapped and merged with the general budget.
The tentative schedule being drawn up for the Budget Session means that there would be less than a month's gap between two sessions of Parliament. The Winter Session, which begins on December 15, will end on January 5.
The official said that at least on one occasion in the past in 1976, when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister, had the winter session spilled into January. But in those days, the Budget was presented on the last day of February and so there was one-month gap between the two sessions.
The Union Budget 2018-19 would be the last full Budget of the BJP-led NDA government before the 2019 General Elections. As per the practice, a vote-on-account or approval for essential government spending for a limited period is taken in the election year and a full-fledged budget presented by the new government.
While P Chidambaram had presented the previous UPA government's vote-on-account in February 2014, Jaitley had presented a full budget in July that year.
The official said this will be the first budget post implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.
Even though independent India's biggest tax reform of GST was implemented from July 1, the Budget for 2017-18 (April- March), had followed the practice of tax revenue projections under the heads of customs duty, central excise and service tax alongside direct tax numbers.
With excise duty and service tax being subsumed in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the classifications in the forthcoming budget may undergo change, he said.
While a new classification for revenues to be accrued from GST will be included in the Budget for next fiscal, for the current year two sets of accounting may be presented - one for actual accruals during April-June for excise, customs and service tax, and the other for July-March period for GST and customs duty.
The official said that since the GST rates are decided by a GST Council, headed by Union Finance Minister and comprising of representatives of all states, the Budget for 2018-19 may not have any tax proposals concerning excise and service tax levies.
Only proposals for changes in direct taxes, both personal income tax and corporate tax, besides customs duty, are likely to be presented in the Budget along with new schemes and programmes of the government. This will be Jaitley's 5th Budget in a row. With the preponement of Budget, ministries are now allocated their budgeted funds from the start of the financial year beginning April. This gives government departments more leeway to spend as well as allow companies time to adapt to business and taxation plans.
Previously, when the Budget was presented at the end of February, the three-stage Parliament approval process used to get completed some time in mid-May, weeks ahead of onset of monsoon rains. This meant government departments would start spending on projects only from August-end or September, after the monsoon season ended.
Besides advancing the presentation date, the Budget scrapped the Plan and non-Plan distinction as well.

Journalists murder probe still a long way to go - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday noted that as a country it was very significant for Sri Lanka to be chosen as the venue to hold the UNESCO Regional Conference in Reinforcing Regional Cooperation to Promote Freedom of Expression and the Rule of Law in Asia through Ending Impunity for Crimes against Journalists.
Sri Lanka which was once one of the most dangerous places to be a journalist was now a safe space required for freedom of expression.
We must keep on working hard to sustain and safeguard this space, and that we still have a long way to go in terms of completing investigations into past crimes, including the murder of journalists in the past, added Minister Samaraweera.
It is also an occasion for us in Sri Lanka to recognize and acknowledge that justice is crucial and essential, because impunity will leave open the danger of the recurrence of the heinous crimes that occurred in the past, the minister continued.
The seminar, Minister Samaraweera noted was also important platform to bring together regional stakeholders, National Human Rights Commissions as well as civil society and media in the challenge of combating impunity for crimes against journalists in the region.
It will be an invaluable opportunity for sharing experiences and best practice in this important area. This will help Sri Lanka learn from others as well as share our own experiences, he added.
The role of the state is to guarantee and further the rights to freedom of expression, said the Minister as he emphasised that Sri Lanka remained firm in its commitment to work with the international community, including UNESCO, to work towards ending impunity for crimes against journalists, and to uphold the rights of journalists around the world who place themselves at risk every day, to give voice to the voiceless.

LG polls before February 17 - Deshapriya
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday expressed confidence that they will be able to hold Local Government Polls on or before February 17, 2018.
He said the LG Election Day will most probably fall between February 4, 2018 and February 17, 2018. Deshapriya said all political parties and other organisations have requested the Election Commission to hold the coming election on a Saturday and added that the election date will also not fall on a Sunday or a Public Holiday.
Accordingly, Deshapriya said there is only a limited choice to decide on a specific date. He also pointed out that the authority to announce the exact date of an election is vested with the returning officers and stressed that politicians will have no say in the matter. The election period for the coming LG poll commenced from yesterday and will continue for 75 days.
The Returning Officers yesterday issued the nomination notice for the 248 councils and the balance 93 was already issued last November 27. The nominations are called for at two periods, from December 11 to 14 and December 18 to 21, 2017. However, the election will be held on a single day.
Deshapriya added that when accepting nominations, the Election Commission will inquire if the all candidates on the nomination lists are citizens of Sri Lanka.
The Election Commission also issued two Gazettes yesterday on Media Guidelines and on the misuse of public property for election propaganda.
The Commission will also be receiving postal vote applications for all these councils as well. The Election Commission will send 15 million poll cards to electors which will reach them by the third week of January, Deshapriya added.
Chairman Deshapriya observed that this is the first time in Sri Lankas history that an LG poll is held island wide on the same day.
It will also be the largest election ever held in the country, he added.
He also pointed out that the challenge ahead for the Election Commission is a daunting one which requires 300,000 officers including police and other support forces to be deployed for election duty at 14,000 polling stations.
More than 8000 candidates will be competing in the election as well, he said.
The estimated election expenses, Deshapriya said, will be below Rs. 4000 million. The election expense estimation as at mid 2017 was Rs.3500 million, he explained.
Since the election will be held in early 2018, the estimation may vary, Deshapriya said.
There will be some allowance increases for government workers by the beginning of 2018, which will most definitely affect the election expenses. We might have to allocate generators for each polling station, since counting will also take place at the same venue. However, we will do our best to save public money, Deshapriya added.
Stressing the importance of vote counting at the polling station itself,an Election Commission member, the former editor of the Department of Legal Draftsman President Counsel Nalin J.Abeysekara pointed out that the arrangement will allow for the announcing of the election results sooner than was on previous occasions.
Deshapriya highlighted that strict legal action will be taken against any election campaign related activity,such as, processions, demonstrations and parades that will disturb the school students who will be sitting for the GCE Ordinary Level Examination during the same dates where nominations have been called for for all 341 councils from yesterday.
He said the Election Commission has directed the Police to take persons involved in such activity into Police custody and added that they will have a special discussion with the Police with regards to the matter on December 7.
Deshapriya also mentioned that the Election Commission has requested all political parties to refrain from using religious institutions for election propaganda as it is prohibited by the law.
These religious institutes include Buddhist temples,churches, mosques and any Hindu temple or Kovil and propaganda can be any rally or discussion or anything relating to propaganda. Say if a politician participated in an event inside a religious institute and addressed media outside the premises, we will consider that also as an offense, he said. We have also requested from government institutions not to allow any public property to be used for propaganda work of any election campaign. The public property includes logistics as well as public officers, he added.
Deshapriya expressed his confidence that the Election Commission will be able to conduct a free, fair and credible election this time with the support of all government and other responsible parties involved in the election, including political parties, the public and media.
Chairman Deshapriya also said a special unit will be appointed next week alongside the Permanent Committee to Investigate on Election Complains, to monitor and prevent violence against female candidates who will be running for office at the coming LG poll.
He said the special unit will be headed by the Commission member, President Counsel Nalin J. Abeysekara and will work with representatives from observer groups, civil organizations and other interested parties.
Speaking of election delays, Chairman Deshapriya said Sri Lanka needs to have an election calendar which will enable to have scheduled elections and prevent future delays. There may be snap elections due to legal or other matters. But, we need to have a fixed election calendar. There is no policy requirement to conduct all LG and provincial elections on the same day. All these steps should be taken by Parliament. The public must also realise that politics is not just for the politicians, but that it belongs to the public as well. Therefore, we need to have awareness campaigns as well, Deshapriya said.

Like most actors who have done projects that they might have wished they have never shown their face on screen on, Larson too might have had a few regrets. One of the movie skeletons in her closet is Basmati Blues. The film comes onto the screen nearly four years from when it was made.
The movie is a traditional Ron-com of a relationship which builds up between a westerner and an Indian. A brilliant scientist named Linda is sent away from her company lab to sell genetically modified rice to the native farmers. She manages to win them over by her cheerful manners and carefree nature but she too is unaware that the seeds she sells will destroy them.
Enter Rajit, a handsome and young farmer who has a mind of his own. He is attracted to Linda immediately and their chemistry is so obliviously evident for all to see. Then follows a string of stereotyped events in which Linda bonds with the natives and learns about their culture. After the ploy to trick the farmers have been revealed Linda and Rajit turn saviours and join hands to save their crop. The movie ends with a big fat Indian wedding.
With every scene he has shot portraying the scenes in India, director Dan Baron seems to display his ignorance towards the rich culture and traditions which have prevailed throughout the years in India. It is no surprise that the project has won the fury of the Indian audience. It is so clich and portrays the stereotyped picture that the Western aristocrats embody about India.
A few good points to note about the movie is the light humour which runs in certain scenes. The songs included in the movie too are catchy and infectious. At its heart, this film is about two people who reach across cultures, fight against corporate greed, and find love. Other sub themes in the film explored our responsibility for our actions and for each other, and attempts to do it in a disarming way, using music, comedy and romance.
Though this must have been the intention behind the project, the big picture that the filmmakers paint does not go down well with the audience  especially if they happen to be Indians or Asians.
I have no doubt the filmmakers had the best possible intentions with this film. Youll be able to decide for yourself if this is just a case of bad marketing when and if Basmati Blues sees the light of day. Theres still no release date yet, although Shout! Fa ctorys Shout! Studios recently acquired distribution rights.

Malnutrition on the rise in North Central Province
The malnutrition among mothers and children in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts is on the rise. North Central Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena told the Daily News.
The districts have 15,000 children under the age of five years suffering from acute malnutrition complications, recent surveys revealed. The majority of low-income families are unable to afford balanced meals, and are unaware that their children are suffering from malnutrition.
The parents who battle to earn their livelihood don't have time to spare for caring about the ill health symptoms appearing on their children, and neither medical care nor attention is sought, Bandulasena further added.
He said that he has requested the Provincial Council to allocate a minimum of Rs. 25 million from the 2018 budget to enhance the living conditions, especially concerning dietary habits of children under five years belonging to 1,000 families, who fall prey to malnutrition, as an initiative of a provincial anti-malnutrition campaign.
The programme will be implemented under the auspices of the National Nourishment Programme.
In the meantime, it was learnt that plans meant for identifying households where mothers and children are suffering from malnutrition at a district level through district nourishment committees, has been a failure due to lack of funds, proper guidance, and less interest over the issue.
Also the training programmes aimed at making pre-school students and teachers aware of the gravity of malnutrition, the solutions to be adopted, coordination aspects, finding resources to battle against the menace, etc., are not developing and achieving the planned targets.
As revealed at the August committee session, after holding 23 training and awareness programmes concerning malnutrition, only a sum of Rs. 250,000 had been allocated.

India 536/7 decl.; Sri Lanka 356/9
Mathews, Chandimal blunt India with best batting of series
Monday  It took the Delhi air pollution to bring about a change to Sri Lankas batting woes as they put up their best performance of the series to dent the Indian bowling to the extent that they finished the third day of the third and final cricket Test on 356 for nine wickets in reply to Indias 536-7 declared at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium on Monday.
For Sri Lanka to make a turnaround in their fortunes they required their two best batters Angelo Mathews and skipper Dinesh Chandimal to produce something big which they had not done so far in the series.

Mathews till yesterday had scored only one fifty in four innings and Chandimal two in as many, but as the former captain said at Kolkata fifties are not going to bring you victories.
So yesterday this pair rose to the occasion to bring the smiles back on the Lankan supporters who have been passionately following them through thick and thin with each of them scoring contrasting centuries and figuring in a fourth wicket partnership of 181 off 477 balls that eventually made it a contest.
There were many firsts in the partnership as it was the first time two Lankan batsmen had put together a century stand in the series and also batted throughout a session (morning) without losing a wicket.
Mathews without a Test hundred for two years broke the drought finally reaching it off 231 balls with 12 fours and two sixes but it was easily not his best innings.
He had to graft for the runs and was fortunate to be dropped at 98 when he edged a delivery from Ishant Sharma only to see the other Sharma in the side Rohith spill an easy chance at second slip. Soon after completing his hundred (104) he was again missed at mid-off by substitute fielder Vijay Shankar off Jadeja.
Overall, Mathews had three lucky escapes with Kohli having dropped him at six on the second day. Cricket they say is a game of luck and Mathews deserved every bit of luck that came his way to score this eighth Test hundred (third against India) which would have lifted a heavy burden off his shoulders. Being the most senior batsman in the side he was under a lot of pressure to deliver.
Mathews dismissal brought Sadeera Samarawickrama who was medically cleared to play in the morning. But after helping his captain to raise a stand of 61 for the fifth wicket he went fishing and edged a catch behind the wicket to be dismissed for 33.
India came back strongly when Ashwin made short work of debutant Roshen Silva and Niroshan Dickwella scalping them before they could get off the mark. Silva made a third ball duck on his Test debut and Dickwella played a rash shot attempting to cut a straight ball even before he had settled down. Shami got rid of Suranga Lakmal for five forcing an edge to give Saha his fourth catch of the innings and Jadeja accounted for Lahiru Gamage for one.
Chandimal could only watch helplessly at the other end as all the hard work done with Mathews becoming undone.
The Lankan captain played a flawless innings in comparison to Mathews patchy knock - full of concentration mixed with moments of caution and aggression that took him to his tenth Test hundred off 265 balls (13 fours) and second against India. He stayed long enough to take Sri Lanka past the follow-on score of 337 and remain unconquered at the close on 147 scored off 341 balls with 18 fours and a six. Sri Lanka trail India by 180 runs with one wicket standing and two days of the match left. India leads the three-match series 1-0.

Mathews thanks batting coach for ending century drought
Monday  Former captain Angelo Mathews thanked former team mate and current batting coach Thilan Samaraweera after he had broken the drought of not scoring a Test hundred for two years by making 111 on the third day of the third Test against India at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here on Monday.
I should thank our batting coach Thilan Samaraweera for reminding me a few things that I have been doing right in the past couple of years or so and which I have not been doing in recent times. Samaraweera has been working very hard with us. Glad that two of us could get a couple of hundreds today, said a relieved Mathews.
Mathews was without a Test century for two years since scoring 110 against India at the SSC in August 2015 and with Sri Lankas batting in shambles in the ongoing series he was under pressure to deliver as the most senior batsmen in the side.
If you take the last few years, I have been in and out of the side due to injuries. Inconsistency of not being in the team can affect you, but no excuses. It is what it is and we are here to do a job. Not a single game where I have played without any pressure. From my debut up to now, I feel the same pressure. But when you get slightly older, you face more pressure, said Mathews.
But yesterday with the help of his captain Dinesh Chandimal, Mathews laboured his way to his eighth Test hundred sharing a fourth wicket stand of 181 to enable Sri Lanka reach 356-9 by the close.
I was very pleased and a big relief as well. I knew I was hitting the ball well in the nets. After the Calcutta Test, where I scored a fifty, I was disappointed that I couldnt capitalize on it, said Mathews at the end of the day.
I wanted to badly get that hundred. I was waiting for an opportunity. They were bowling extremely well and we had to grind and work hard. Chandi was batting so well. His knock was a flowing one. He was so fluent. For me not the more fluent innings, but one where I had to work extremely hard. I am glad that I worked hard and ultimately it paid off, he said.
I had the confidence within myself as I was hitting the ball well in the nets. Once I had a start, I wanted to capitalize on it. Little bit of luck as well. It all happens in the game and I am pleased to cross three figures. But then again, I could have gone onto get a bigger one. Credit to the Indian bowlers they kept at it. We had to work extremely hard for the runs.
We know that we are up against the number one ranked team in the world. All four of their bowlers keep coming at you. Virat (Kohli) is rotating them nicely. Pressure is on you all the time. We have to work extremely hard. You dont get many loose balls. The innings of Chandi and I, we had to grind. We were waiting to score off the loose balls, Mathews said.
Very few Sri Lankan batsmen have made Test hundreds in India and Mathews became the eighth when he crossed the mark. He was later joined by his captain Chandimal as the ninth. Duleep Mendis, Aravinda de Silva, Marvan Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Prasanna Jayawardene were the other Lankan batsmen to score Test hundreds before them.
When approaching his century the big giant screen at the stadium flashed Mathews previous attempt to score a hundred in India in 2009. He was run out going for his 100th run for an agonising 99.
Thank to the television crew, I saw it on the big screen when I was in the 90s. I am bit more matured nowadays. I played a bit of cricket. I understood the possibilities. Once again, I didnt try to think about it too much although to be very frank I wanted to badly get it, Mathews said.
Following the Mathews-Chandimal liaison the Lankan innings went into a slide when they lost five wickets for 26 runs.
A bit disappointed with the way we ended up the days play. We could have ended up with a few more wickets in hand especially going into the fourth day. We had made the bowlers to work extremely hard. Towards the end we gave away too many wickets. We have to sort of do well tomorrow and take the grip back by striking early and taking a couple of early wickets which will help us.
When questioned of the pollution level that made the headlines on Sunday, Mathews said, It is always the same. Look, it is up to the match referee and the umpires to take a decision. We are here to play cricket and we want to get out to the park. It is pretty much the same or a bit worse probably. You have got to deal with what you have for the next two days.

More gusty winds, heavy rains expected
The country will experience gusty winds over the next few days, Meteorology Department Research Director Sarath Premalal said.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the Ministry of Disaster Management yesterday. The low pressure area in the South-East Bay of Bengal is likely to develop into a depression within the next 24 hours. It is now located 1300 km away from the Sri Lanka. Therefore, wind speeds over the island and the surrounding sea areas can increase tomorrow, Premalal said.
Wind speeds of 90-100 kmph can be expected in the Southern Coastal areas and fairly strong gusty winds up to 50-70 kmph can be expected in the deep sea areas. A wind speed of 50 kmph can be predicted all over the island, especially in the Amapara, Sabaragamuwa districts and the Western Province.
Meanwhile, moderate heavy showers above 75 mm can be expected in the Northern, North-Central and Eastern Provinces, particularly in the Mulathivu, Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Vavuniya, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Ampara districts.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said, fishermen have been adviced to avoid going to sea and ships near the Bengal Bay are told to move to the Bangladesh sea area as strong winds is expected to move through India.
Immigration and Emigration Department officials has been directed to inform the SAARC Emergency Units to grant permission for ships to enter the Bangladesh martitime area.
Furthermore, showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Northern, North-Central, Eastern and Uva Provinces. There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers.
The public is kindly requested to be vigilant and take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry Engineer A.D.S. Gunewardena said the water level of the Gin Ganga and Kalu Gangas have now receded from the mild flood level.

North Korea crisis: UN political chief in rare visit to Pyongyang
The United Nations political affairs chief is due to arrive in Pyongyang on Tuesday for a rare visit.
The trip by Jeffrey Feltman is the first by a senior UN official in six years.
North Korea had extended an invitation to the UN in September to visit for a "policy dialogue".
It comes after last week's launch of what North Korea called its "most powerful" intercontinental ballistic missile, claiming it could hit the US.
Feltman, a former US diplomat and the highest ranking American in the UN, will be in Pyongyang until Friday. His visit comes as South Korea and the US conduct their largest ever round of aerial drills.
A UN spokesman told reporters that Feltman will be meeting senior officials including foreign minister Ri Yong-ho. He is not scheduled to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The invitation, first informally issued in September, was confirmed on 30 November - the day after North Korea launched its most recent missile.
The BBC's Paul Adams in Seoul says in the absence of any other meaningful diplomatic channels, the UN clearly believes it's important to pursue whatever opportunities exist for dialogue.
The last visit by a senior UN official was when Valerie Amos, then the UN's aid chief, travelled there in October 2011. Feltman's predecessor Lynn Pascoe also visited in 2010.
The trip by Feltman comes during a period of high tensions following North Korea's test launch of a missile which drew another round of international condemnation.
The US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley had said last week that if war broke out, the North Korean regime would be "utterly destroyed".
On Monday South Korea and the US began a five-day air combat exercise, their largest ever involving more than 200 aeroplanes and thousands of troops.
North Korea, which routinely condemns such drills, has called it a "provocation".

## Title: NUWARA-ELIYA, A LOST HORIZON
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, December 5, 2017 - 01:00
NUWARA-ELIYA, A LOST HORIZON
Nuwara-Eliya is a pretense.
Holding out as a little England or a miniature Switzerland, the place is a groundless boast, a show long way from getting on the road.
What immediately hit the visitor to the township in the hills are the dissimilarities with old blighty; the noisy, the confusion and the inescapable dereliction of the place contradict the claim emphatically. There is nothing English about the place, only irregular remnants of a planting era on which the page has permanently turned; a golf club, a post office, small rose gardens, a store and a few bungalows to show for a time, gone-by.
These have now been overwhelmed by intrusions of the last three or four decades. Ugly, incongruous structures dominate, giving it a distinct shanty town appearance. These too, have seen better days, now coated with grime from fumes, smoke and incessant human activity. Interspersed here and there, are a few newer buildings, with ornate facades, inappropriate and gaudy against the lush majesty of the surrounding terrain. There is a sparkling new hotel, Araliya, with huge statues of elephants greeting the tourists at the entrance.
As to the relevance to Nuwara-Eliya, of either the name of the hotel or the elephant statues, no explanation is offered. For most things in Nuwara-Eliya now, there is no explanation possible; it seems things have just happened. A need is met with an answer; with no awareness of the past, present or the future.
In the township there is no escaping the garbage, thrown out to collect at every street corner. The fruit, vegetable and meat markets, usually drawing the mid-day throng, stink and are insanitary. Men seem to gather in Nuwara-Eliya only to attend to various needs in a very basic sense, with no heed to the aesthetic or even the dignity of life. Shabby and heedless looking crowds, with little affection for, leave alone pride in the place, possessing it. This is not a town with an ownership, only a convenient locality to use and abuse. The atmosphere is of a place which has gone down in the world, and nobody seems to care.
Nature has been bounteous, bestowing an impressive setting and a pleasant alpine climate on the hill station. It is man who has degraded and debased a rich gift.
Our tour of Nuwara-Eliya began with a mid-day visit to the Hakgala Botanical Gardens, a popular destination, particularly among the local visitors. We had to leave the car outside the gardens, in the care of a local tough. There was little choice in the matter as he curtly reminded us, in that area, he represented the local authority. An entrance fee to the garden for a local visitor is about Rs. 50, but foreigners have to pay about twenty times that!
We learnt from the ticketing counter that the park was about 70 acres in size. This would make it much smaller than the average sized park in most countries. But by obtaining from different countries and climes a wide range of large trees and flowering plants the early curators had managed to create quite an enchanting garden, inspiring for seekers of beauty and often a haven for lovers. The Japanese garden and the rose garden are not to be missed.
While enjoying the tranquility of the surroundings our reverie was rudely disturbed by a shrill whistle. Marching towards us was a gaggle of young schoolgirls led by a uniformed security guard tirelessly blowing a whistle. On inquiring the meaning of his conduct the security guard enlightened us that it was a warning to the ever-present lovers in various embraces and poses to move away from the oncoming young innocents.
Little England
According to this security guard he was employed by a private company for a monthly salary of less than Rs. 15,000. His main function was to protect the flora from callous human hands during the day, and in the night to keep away the wild animals. The latter duties called for night patrolling, no mean task in the cold wet nights. Apparently, the ubiquitous lovers too every so often posed problems for the security guards. Sometimes their embraces lead to other things, and the girls fearing dishonour attempt suicide, requiring the security guards to attend endless investigations thereafter. Often the lovers leave behind more than broken hearts, he said pointing to left over plastic bottles and wrappers under a lush tree, obviously the remnants of a leisurely picnic.
Almost all writings about Nuwara-Eliya will refer to the Hakgala Gardens, Pidurutalagala, the April season and the so-called bracing climate. Few write about the filth, indifference and the corruption in front of their faces. It is only by ignoring the reality, that little England can assert itself.
One afternoon, we decided on a walk around the man-made Lake Gregory. Despite years of misuse and neglect this famous landmark, dating back to the 1870s, still retains a bleak charm. To its once pristine water now flows the effluence from the drains and stinking sewers of the surrounding human settlements.
Local tourists
On the lakes muddy banks small herds of cattle and packs of stray dogs wander about, targeting the half eaten rice packets left behind by local tourist.
Near the town end of the lake there is recent development (I believe Japanese funded), aimed at creating a small park like area with short walks (maybe 2-300 yards) and small flower beds. There seems to be an attempt at introducing water sports on the lake, mainly small jet boats. Here again, I noticed a number of security guards hovering about, taking away from the idea of the serenity and the freedom of a true park. It appears that the park charges an entrance. And as it happens, when only an isolated section is improved, the effort of creating a small park here has ended up only emphasizing the shabbiness of the rest.
Along the Badulla road side of the lake there is a broken and uneven pavement, perhaps an effort to create a longer walking area. In fact almost all the pavements in Nuwara-Eliya have been laid so poorly that walking on them is dangerous, especially at night. But whatever time you decide to walk, it is not possible to avoid the dung, horse and perhaps cow. Nuwara-Eliya has no answer to the problem.
I found the air quality in Nuwara-Eliya, especially on the busy main roads, particularly bad. The heavy vehicles, buses and trucks, struggle along letting off noxious fumes that perhaps due to the otherwise cleanliness of the air, cling to the roads. Again, we see no effort by the authorities to minimize vehicle pollution.
The holiday-makers getting away from the noise and the pollution of Colombo envision an escape to a Shangri La named Nuwara-Eliya. In truth, particularly the town centre of their Shangri La is as ugly, congested and perhaps more polluted than Colombos Pettah. After a drive that takes a good five hours on a narrow and congested road, the holiday- makers will not be denied their illusion. So they imagine they are in a little England, dress up in warm clothes and go about doing things that would, to their minds, be more appropriate in those climes.
According to local lore, many, many moons ago when gods inhabited this earth, Ravana the fearsome King of the Ramayana, having stolen Ramas wife Sita from their abode in north India, hid her in a cave near Nuwara - Eliya. The unfortunate victim of the amorous Ravana, despite her terrifying situation, would have felt the invigorating nip in the air. Like all epics, Ramayana too is deficient in concrete detail, leaving it to the imagination of the various narrators to fill the deficiencies.
Todays traveller to Nuwara-Eliya too must be very fanciful to imagine in this lost horizon, a little England.

One dead in lorry-bowser collision at Mulleriyawa

Opening of Lak Jaya Head Office in Pannipitiya
Lak Jaya Micro Finance Limited opened its head office at High Level Road, Pannipitiya recently.
Keerthi Wijetunga, Director, Department of Supervision of Micro Finance Institutions of the Central bank was the Chief Guest.
Dirk Brouwer, Chairman of the company, members of the Board of Directors, senior management, long serving employees and some long-time customers also attended the opening ceremony.
Lak Jaya Micro Finance Limited commenced operations in March 2002 on the basis of group guarantee with the objective of providing credit facilities to the economically active poor, the entrepreneurial poor and vulnerable non-poor who cannot access credit from formal sources of finance.
Catalyst Microfinance Investors (CMI), a leading international investor in microfinance business in the world, invested US$ 1.6 million in Lak Jaya shares through a locally incorporated company called CMI Lanka Holding (Private) Limited. The injection of capital and the adoption of ASA methodology marked a turning point in evolution of the company and the number of branches increased from 6 to 46 within little over one year.
Lak Jaya is a micro finance institution with a considerable exposure in the field of microfinance in Sri Lanka. At present, around 60,000 micro-entrepreneurs benefit from the loan programmes of the company and the amount of loans outstanding is around Rs. 1.2 billion. The average loan size of Rs. 23,000 indicates that the poorer segments of the population are reached.
Dirk Brouwer, addressing the gathering highlighted the achievements of the company and the role played by Catalyst Microfinance Investors, and ASA International which is dedicated to promote ASA methodology in supporting micro finance sector in the world.
While addressing the gathering Wijetunga of the Central Bank highlighted the significance of regulation and the types of regulation that would be effected under the Micro Finance Act introduced in 2016. In addition he emphasized the significance of client protection, responsible finance, deposit insurance schemes and the role of credit information bureau for minimizing loan risks.
Delivering the key note address, Dr. R.M.K. Ratnayake, former Secretary of the Ministries of Samurdhi, Land, and Trade, analysed the policy towards pro-poor development in Sri Lanka and concluded that the apparent inadequacy of policies of the state to address income inequality led the government to pursue the concept of 'pro poor' growth as an effective measure to reduce the inequality during the process of growth. The extent to which growth is pro poor depends on how much a chosen measure of poverty changes as the result of implementing of such policies.

Islands first-ever Nursing Faculty opens on December 20: Rajitha
The first-ever Nursing Faculty will be opened affiliated to the University of Colombo on December 20 by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister responded so when JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa pointed out that the country needs 42,000 nurses more.
The Faculty comprises a 19 storey fully-fledged building, and 14 storey building for hostel facilities. The Government spent Rs. 14,500 million on the Faculty, Minister Kiriella said.
The country now has 32,000 nurses but it needs 74,000 nurses, MP Jayatissa said.
He was opening the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when the Finance Heads of the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry were taken up for debate.
He commended the move to allocate Rs. 1,250 million to construct three new medical faculties and requested to further upgrade the teaching hospitals. The Minister said the Government has decided to double the student intake for the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital from 130 to 300. Dr. Senaratne said the fund has already been allocated for the purpose.
The JVP MP brought the attention of the Minister that the Suraksha Insurance Scheme does not cover the illnesses commonly seen among the children. The scheme covers cancer, third stage kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, transplant of organs, blindness, among others, but not the malnutrition, hearing and eyesight problems. These should also be included, he said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya commended the constructive engagement of MP Jayatissa and Minister Senaratne stating that it was a good example of healthy Parliamentary debate. This is how Parliamentary debate must happen. I congratulate the two members, he said.
As many as 2.5 m people lack houses: Sajith
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said 2.5 million people in the country lack houses.
The government has spent Rs. 17.5041 billion to build houses during the past three years, but the previous regime had allocated only Rs. 5.629 billion to resolve the issue between 2010-2014, he said.
He was speaking in Parliament yesterday during the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget Proposal for financial year 2018 under the finance heads of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and the Housing and Construction Ministry.
Our Ministry recorded a historical milestone in 2016. Having been elected in 2015, we were able to conduct a proper census by 2016. According to its statistics, 2.5 million families are suffering without shelters. About 840,000 houses were not plastered, 440,000 houses have tin roofs, 216,000 families lack a land or house, and 278,000 live in temporary housing, he said and added that the government has drawn up a comprehensive housing policy, and it would be passed in Parliament and implemented very soon.
Minister Premadasa said the government would establish 500 reawakened villages by the year end and by 2020 another 2,000 villages totalling 2,500 villages. We will exceed these figures and building 504 reawakened villages are in progress. We intend to resolve the housing issues from Devundara to Point Pedro, he said.
The government has commenced a programme to shelter over 2,500 families of war victims in the north. Rs. 3 billion will be allocated to resolve housing issues of the people of the North and East irrespective of their race and religion. The government has allocated Rs. 500 million for the housing projects in the East as well, he said.
The Minister thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Indias Rs. 600 million contribution to resolve the housing issues in Sri Lanka.
He said Rs. 12,000 million was allocated to the Housing and Construction Ministry in the budget.
He said 99 percent of the allocation was used and every penny of it would be used to facilitate the people.
Sajith slams Wimal, Jayantha
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday in Parliament fired salvoes at MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Jayantha Samaraweera exposing a long line of corruption and fraud allegations against them.
The Minister brought to the limelight with facts and figures, the large scale corruption and fraud in the Ministry under former Minister Wimal Weerawansa and when MP Samaraweera was the Chairman of National Housing Development Authority (NHDA).
The Minister was responding to a speech by NFF MP Samaraweera during the Committee stage debate of Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Housing and Construction Ministry were taken up for debate.
Starting from the allegations of distributing housing units of the NHDA projects to family members and close associates of Weerawansa, Minister Premadasa went on to elaborate on the corruption, fraud and waste behind printing diaries, relaunching Sevana lottery and spending millions of public money on the wedding ceremony of a family member of Weerawansa in the guise of holding a workshop for journalists at the Golden Rose hotel.
The Minister highlighted the unsolicited proposals given by the Ministry during the time of his predecessor, adding that not a single house were constructed with some of those projects. Where had this money gone This is how you robbed the nation under the cover of patriotic slogans. You are a set of rogues. Shame on you. You all looted lands and robbed housing projects and made your own fortune from that money, the Minister charged.
While dismissing the allegations directed at him by MP Samaraweera as utter lies, the Minister cleared the doubts on projects carried out by the Ministry under his guidance. I was not to make these comments in the House, I was forced to do so because you threw false allegations. Why couldnt MP Weerawansa come to the House instead of sending second-hand players Ask him to come, he challenged.
The Minister quoted sections of Dhammapadaya and went on to advise the MP, Be correct and then try to correct others, (Owa Denu Parahata Thama Sammathehi Pihita Hida).
Healthy population by 2025: Health Minister
The Health Ministry would reduce the deaths caused by non-contagious diseases by 25 percent, alcohol consumption by 10 percent, salt consumption by 30 percent, smoking by 30 percent, high blood pressure by 30 percent, improve physical fitness by 10 percent, and rid the population of obesity and diabetes by 2025, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was participating in the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget Proposal for financial year 2018 under the finance heads of the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and the Housing and Construction Ministry in Parliament yesterday.
He said that around 1,500 dengue control officers were deployed countrywide, 54 fogging machines were imported from Germany, 50 vehicles were provided to the Western Province to eradicate dengue and was able to reduced over 40,000 monthly dengue cases to around 7,000.
The Minister said the government had increased the taxes on tobacco by 90 percent - the highest in the world - to reduce smoking.
As a result, we faced many issues and even the officials of tobacco companies from Britain came to Sri Lanka and held discussions with government representatives, but we did not budge. Even WHO had commended Sri Lankas stand. As a result, the sale of cigarettes had reduced by around one million, the Minister said.
The President had decided that tobacco cultivation would be banned from 2020 and growers would be given alternatives, he said.
Senaratne said the government was able to reduce the sugar content in sweetened beverages through the traffic light system and educate the public. He said measures would be taken soon to introduce the same system for salty and fatty foods and drinks.
Today we have created a truly free health system. In the past, only Rs. 1.5 million was allocated to treat cancer patients, but today it is limitless and the government is committed to saving cancer patients irrespective of the cost it takes. So far this year, we have spent Rs. 4,727 million on 1,285 cancer patients. Of them, 1,019 have received treatment worth over Rs. 1.5 million. In the past, cancer patients died since they lacked medication. They were given only painkillers since cancer medicines were very expensive. The patients had no idea that they were dying without medication, he said and added that in the past, a huge drug mafia was operative and a few pharmaceutical companies were manipulating the drug market. Now the government had broken the monopoly and made drugs freely available for all at affordable prices, the Minister said.
Stents for heart patients and lenses for eye diseases are provided free. It costs the government Rs. 324 million, he said. Minister Senaratne said the largest kidney hospital in Asia would be established in Sri Lanka. The countrys health sector will see a great improvement under President Maithripala Sirisena. We will bring in an efficient health system that provides one doctor for every 5,000, the Minister said.
Parliamentary chit-chat causes concern
Plantations Minister Navin Dissanayake was seen in the back bench seats of the Opposition yesterday in Parliament chatting with UNP MPs.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekera sent parliament messengers to the Minister and reminded him that he should be sitting on the other side.
Minister Dissanayake entered the main Chamber from the opposition side entrance and was seen seated next to UNP MP Sandith Samarasinghe and speaking to him. UNP MPs Chaminda Wijesiri, Ashoka Priyantha and Heshan Withanage were listening to the Minister. The Minister continued his conversation even after he received the message.
The Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 was in progress and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was presiding. Parliament sources said the Cabinet Ministers are not sitting in the Opposition side as per the tradition. However, it does not amount to any violation of the Standing Orders, the sources said.

Path to better governance
The Colombo School of Business and Management (CSBM) organised the Second International Conference on Social Entrepreneurship'-Innovations in Social Enterprise for Development (ICSE 2017) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute recently. The Conference Partners were the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Bangkok and the Colombo Plan. The Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu was the Chief Guest at ICSE 2017.
Colombo Plan Secretary General Kinley Dorji, Colombo School of Business & Management Chairman Dian Gomes, Colombo School of Business & Management Head Prof. Ranjith Bandara, Yunus Centre Director Dr. Faiz Shah and Sarvodaya Development Finance Ltd Chairman Channa De Silva were also present at the inaugural session.
In his inaugural address, the Indian High Commissioner spoke about the several initiatives and policy measures instituted by Government of India to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in India. He added that Sri Lanka also has a strong tradition of innovation, and that there is a lot that we can learn from each other. He also spoke about technology as a great leveller, and social entrepreneur has the potential to offer small solutions to big problems. He noted that innovation and entrepreneurship are critical for development, not just because they enhance productivity but they also address social issues in a novel manner. He urged Sri Lankan youth to make use of the varied learning opportunities provided by Government of India under Indian Technical & Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, various scholarship programmes and S&T research innovation programmes.
Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhus Address at the second Annual International Conference on Social Entrepreneurship:
How do we ensure that nobody walks barefoot on this planet How do we ensure waste-to-wealth transformation at all levels How do we ensure that our urban spaces remain clean and green, while addressing our quest for development How do we incentivise people to take public transport in megacities
I do not have answers for any of them, but I presume, you would have answers for some. You are social entrepreneurs. You think out of the box. You offer small solutions to big problems. You ideate. You breathe innovation. Simply, you create a better life around..
As you are aware, innovation and entrepreneurship are critical for development. They enhance productivity by leaps and bounds. Thats not the only reason why it is important. They address social issues in a novel manner. They have the prowess to make societies more inclusive. They craft social empowerment. The theme of this years Conference, Building an Intellectual Economy to Foster Socially Innovative Enterprise Development is apt in every sense.
In todays day and age, technology is a great leveller. As Prime Minister Modi has said, today there is an app for filling every gap! A farmer can today find out the best farming methods, thanks to his mobile phone. A fisherman can tie up the best price for his days catch while still at sea. Students can access online courses from the best Institutes in the world, sitting in the comfort of their homes. Today, we see and speak with friends and relatives spread across continents almost daily, that too almost free. Behind all these sea changes, is not just technology, it is someone who found out the best use of technology to contribute to the society, a social entrepreneur who thinks differently.
As human life expectancy increases, we may not be able to survive with learning just one trade to last a lifetime. We need to learn multiple trades spread over our life cycle. We need to learn, unlearn and relearn. Some of the trades which were relevant perhaps till yesterday are no longer relevant today. Wikipedia replaced Encyclopaedia Britannica. A Smart phone has replaced calculator, camera, computer and what not! Disruptive innovations have forced us to rethink on existing strategies and business models.
As you may be aware, the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) which India co-hosted with the United States concluded just yesterday in our tech-capital, Hyderabad. The US delegation was led by Advisor to the US President, Ivanka Trump. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi spoke at the inaugural session. This was the first time GES was hosted in South Asia. This years theme was Women First, Prosperity for All. The event highlighted Indias enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship. There have been participants from over 150 countries at the Conference, including Sri Lanka. Interestingly, over 31 percent of entrepreneurs at GES were 30 years old or younger. The youngest entrepreneur was just 13.
Spirit of enterprise and innovation
We have been able to create Brand India, known for its spirit of enterprise and innovation, thanks to our youth. The demographic profile is set to make India the worlds youngest country, with 64% of its population in the working age group. With Western Europe, the US, South Korea, Japan, Russia and even China all aging, this demographic profile offers India an unprecedented opportunity for growth. We are, of course, conscious that demography only provides the potential; it is in our hands to transform it into reality.
The motto of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to reform, perform and transform. In fact, Prime Minister himself crowdsources ideas for better governance.
The Government of India has recently undertaken several initiatives and instituted policy measures to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in the country. Flagship programmes, such as Digital India and Start Up India are aimed at creating virtuous cycles of innovation, economic development and social empowerment.
India has currently the largest, financial inclusion programme (Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana), in the world.
Adhaar, the unique identification system, has become the largest and most successful IT project ever undertaken in the world. As of 2016, 1.1 billion people (95% of the population) have a digital proof of identity. To understand the scale of what India has achieved with Aadhaar, you have to understand that India accounts for 17.2% of the entire worlds population!
The JAM- Jan Dhan Aadhar Mobile- technology trinity- has enabled direct transfer of subsidies to intended beneficiaries and, therefore, has eliminated middlemen and leakages in the system, and checked corruption, touching upon the lives of millions of Indian citizens.
We have launched AIMtoInnovate with over 900 Atal Tinkering Labs to promote a culture of innovation among children. Numerous incubation centres have been set up in various universities in India to nurture innovative start up ventures.
Our recent World Food India initiative, which also saw Ministerial participation from Sri Lanka, focussed on entrepreneurs in the food processing industry and agricultural waste sectors.
S&T research and innovation programmes
Innovation, as we know of it today, may be novel in its approach and use. But, Indias culture of innovation is not new. I do not know if you are familiar with the Hindi word, Jugaad, sometimes used pejoratively though, which means finding low-cost solutions in an intelligent way, in an Indian way, if I may say so.
India currently has the third-largest scientific and technical manpower in the world with 162 universities awarding over 4,000 doctorates degrees and 35,000 post graduate degrees annually. India is ranked as the 3rd largest tech-based start-up hub in the world. More than one-third of the top 1,000 global R&D spenders have centres in India. The Tech start ups in Bengaluru and Hyderabad have changed the face of modern India.
Sri Lanka also has a strong tradition of innovation. The magnificent rock fortress in Sigiriya is a stellar example of this tradition. The traditional irrigation systems in Sri Lanka are another example. Basawakkulama reservoir, which is used even now, was built as early as 5th century BC by King Pandukabaya. It is also interesting to note that futurists like Arthur C. Clarke made Sri Lanka their home. There is a lot that we can achieve from each other.
India and Sri Lanka have been jointly funding S&T research and innovation programmes. This has further strengthened innovation and techno-commercial partnerships.
In addition, India has been providing fully-funded training opportunities to Sri Lanka, under Indian Technical & Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme over the last several decades. A large number of ITEC slots are for entrepreneurship and innovation related subjects.
Government of India also offers 700 scholarships annually to the Sri Lankan students. A number of these Scholarships are meant for undergraduate studies, Postgraduate studies etc.
A long journey starts with a small step. All of us may not be social entrepreneurs; but we can be socially responsible in our own way.
When we switch off lights in our office and homes when not needed; when we use cloth and paper bags to buy grocery instead of new polythene bags every time we visit a supermarket; when we grow vegetables and fruits in our home garden; when we contribute to recycling and upcycling in our own way; when we realize that every small individual action counts in making a global change; we not only make the difference, we are the difference.

Pathfinder Foundation's Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives (CILI) has moved to MMBL Pathfinder head office premises ''River Point", located at Peliyagoda Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage Director CILI ceremonially declared open the center. Milinda Moragoda, founder of the Pathfinder Foundation was present on this occasion.
Despite historical, cultural and religious relations that shaped the history of the island and relations with India for over two millennia, lack of understanding on modern day dynamics that play a crucial role in shaping relations between the two countries has been a shortcoming that has not been adequately addressed. With the establishment of CILI, PF believes that this center could go a long way in addressing this shortcoming. In order to achieve this objective, CILI expects to have Indian experts and scholars working on side by side with Sri Lankan experts focusing on political, economic, strategic, cultural, religious and people to people relations between the two countries and make policy recommendations to both governments.
Bernard Goonetilleke, Chairman, PF, Lalith Weerathunge, Senior Fellow PF, Luxman Siriwardena Executive Director PF, Nandana Devge, Director MMBL Pathfinder and K. D. Liyanage, Director Legal, MMBL participated at the event.

PickMe introduces pricing structure for three-wheelers
In a strategic move to bring greater benefits for drivers and patrons, homegrown taxi hailing service PickMe reduced its three-wheeler fares to Rs.33 per kilometer, from a previous fare of Rs.35 per kilometer.
The decision was made following a comprehensive study done on the trip patterns of local tuk-tuk (three-wheelers) passengers which brought to light the reason for most taxi-riding grievances of both driver and passenger. While some passengers needed to get from A to B as soon as possible, others used taxis for more accommodating needs such as to get their shopping done or for sightseeing.
When calculating the new fare, we also considered a drivers opportunity cost -that is the potential amount a driver could earn while he spends his time on a ride than staying idle - and on this account we increased the waiting time fare from Rs.2/= per km to Rs.3.50/= per km so that a driver would be fairly compensated for the time spent waiting for a passenger while on a hire said Jiffry Zulfer, Chief Executive Officer of PickMe.
Expressing his views on the price revision PickMe Chairman Ajit Gunewardene said, At PickMe, With prices much lower than a common metered three-wheeler in the streets now, PickMe is now more affordable and convenient for our users. Drivers will also benefit from the lower fares because when the demand increases there will be less idle time between trips, meaning that the drivers have a better chance in converting their time into income.

Pink proved her record label wrong with comeback single
Pink is glad she proved record label executives wrong by getting her single What About Us played on the radio.
The Get the Party Started singer released Beautiful Trauma, her first album in five years, in October (17) and she was warned by record company executives that her music probably wouldnt get played because she was a female singer aged older than 35.
However, the 38-year-old proved them wrong when the albums lead single What About Us dropped in August and became a radio favourite and chart hit.
When I came back, the record company sat me down and told me that once you are over 35 and a female popstar, radio probably wont play you. Im so glad I proved them wrong. Its nice, she said on The Graham Norton Show.
Pink, real name Alecia Moore, was even asked to perform the song at the recent American Music Awards (AMAs) in Los Angeles and she shocked viewers by singing it while doing an aerial routine on the side of the skyscraper. She also landed a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance when the shortlist was announced on Monday (27Nov17).
During the interview, Pink was asked what she was getting up to in between albums, and she replied, I didnt realise it had been so long. I was doing bake sales and kindergarten.
Pink also admitted that her daughter Willow, six, and son Jameson, who will celebrate his first birthday later this month (Dec17), arent particularly excited by her music.
My son used to cry when I sang and now hes a little older he just looks away. And my daughter prefers Sia! she joked.
The singer was joined on the sofa by Elton John, Carey Mulligan, Robbie Williams and Stephen Fry. The interview airs in the U.K. on Friday night.

Police to prioritize cases on freedom of expression- Sagala
Law, Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka yesterday assured that the government was committed to taking action on crimes committed against journalists in the past.
Speaking at the the UNESCO Regional Conference in Reinforcing Regional Cooperation to Promote Freedom of Expression and the Rule of Law in Asia through Ending Impunity for Crimes against Journalists held at the Taj Samudra, Colombo, Minister Ratnayaka said he had asked the Police to prioritize cases on freedom of expression.
When we started most of these cases we were started below zero, the evidence had been destroyed, many years had lapsed and it was difficult to recreate some of the evidence. Most of the institutions did not hold this data for long and even Police books were missing, explained Ratnayaka adding that he commended the police and CID for doing a fantastic job in keeping these cases moving forward.
Commenting on the more prominent cases, the Minister explained the current situations in each:
With the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda: We are in a debate. The CID says they want to go the whole way but the Attorney General (AG) says that we should go with what we have now, an indictment on a kidnapping charge. The CID feels we might be able to go for a murder charge, there has been precedence abroad where they convicted suspects for murder, despite not finding the body. They have asked for a little more time, Ratnayaka said.
Speaking on the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunga, he noted, Its a complex case. We have come to a stage where we need to identify the users of six telephone numbers. We know the institutions that used these numbers but there are few technicalities within our agencies which we need to sort out, he said.
The government he said was also looking for ways to bring in new legislation to take cases forward. In the case of the assault on Keith Noyahr, legislation which would allow evidence to be taken via video conferencing has been suggested. The case has been hindered by Noyahr being unwilling to come to the country to submit evidence.
The Minister however stressed that the government was committed to go ahead with all the cases and would ensure that justice was served.

Suspects with heroin arrested

Raigam commends tele talent
The 14th edition of Raigam Telees, a tele-awards ceremony, is set to be held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre on March 24, 2018. As the only tele/film award ceremony in the region held within the first quarter of the year, the organisers will face numerous challenges with only a few months to finalise everything.
According to Raigam Chairman, Dr Ravi Liyanage, no other international festival  Oscar and Grammy included  has achieved this target. That said, the festival reaches closer to international standards with a new move.
Continuation of an award ceremony at the highest level for 14 consecutive years, overcoming many challenges is a special victory for us. We are pleased to see that today the Raigam Telees has become a special event of all stakeholders of the industry. We share that happiness and the strength we have thus gained with the media and the general public, Raigam Kingdom Managing Director Ganaka Amarasinghe said.
An occasion can retain its value and currency only if it evolves with the passage of time while maintaining its core values. If, in an award ceremony, award winners are queued up and given awards just for the sake of holding an award ceremony. That event will not generate any interest. At least not for very long. With the Raigam ceremony, however, the organisers are always committed to provide a new experience to the audience while maintaining the values of the event. Raigam has established that set of norms strictly adhered to in all aspects of the event.
The 14th encounter of the festival has seen a slight change in the panel of judges. Professor Patrick Ratnayake, who had been the panel chairman, has been replaced by Jayasumana Dissanayake. The panel comprises Professor Ariyaratne Kaluarachchi, Professor Ajantha Hapuarachchi, Gunasiri Silva, Hansamala Ritigahapola, Ranga Dasanayake, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Aruna Gunaratne and Dr Arundathi Sriranganathan. Although Raigam initiated the festival to recognise the talents of the tele-drama industry, later on the horizons were expanded into other television programmes such as sports, childrens, political, news, documentary, reality and so on.
The SMS voting will be open from February 23 to March 23, 2018. About 25 participants from the SMS voting will be selected to receive two invitations each to witness the Raigam Telees 2017. The winners who will receive a message from the Raigam Telees Secretariat through the elephone number used to send the SMS will be entitled to receive printed invitations by forwarding the message at the gate. The telephone numbers for SMS are 0772 522522 and 0702722722.
The entries for Raigam Telees 2017 are now accepted by the Raigam Telees Secretariat and will be closed on January 15, 2018.
Creations eligible for evaluation for awards at the Raigam Telees 2017:
1. Teledramas telecast within 2017.
2. Other creations telecast within 2017.
3. Any production telecast over Cable TV or any other paid channel or any dubbed production (other than for best dubbing programme) are not eligible for awards.
4. News Reader and Programme Presenters may send their application through their TV channel or independently.
5. Award winners under News reader and Programme Presenter are not eligible to re-apply for the same award in the three immediate succeeding years.

Attempts to revive Rajapaksa ghosts
Ranil exposes private media conspiracy
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday lambasted unnamed private media organisations of undermining democracy and attempting to push the country back to the Rajapaksa-era when they made easy money through corrupt deals.
The Prime Minister told an international gathering in Colombo that private media organisation heads and their editors were conspicuously absent from a UNESCO-sponsored seminar calling for an end to impunity for attacks against journalists.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe asked if upholding press freedom had now fallen solely on his administration and a few civil society organisations while private media bosses remained silent.
He stressed that Sri Lankas media should be questioning him and his administration about the progress in the Lasantha Wickrematunga murder investigation. The Prime Minister vowed that he will not allow a handful of private media moguls to take the country back to the Rajapaksa-era when nine journalists, including the Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga were assassinated.
Courts have been told that there was a huge cover-up of Wickrematungas January 2009 assassination which drew massive international condemnation of the Rajapaksa administration.
The new government which came to power in January 2015 has reopened the case, exhumed the body and ordered a fresh autopsy to establish the actual cause of death in order to ensure a credible investigation.
Fresh evidence showed that there had been a massive cover-up by the police and the judicial medical officer who carried out the first autopsy. The case is pending.
The Prime Minister said that private media had not pursued the attacks on their own colleagues during the former regime.
There was hardly any media interest in the disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda, the attacks on Keith Noyahr and Upali Tennakoon and the gun attacks on the Udayan newspaper where media workers were killed, the Premier said.
The lack of coverage shows that the media is not interested in these cases. Are they trying to say they dont need media freedom the Prime Minister asked. Are they saying they want to go back to the Rajapaksa-era and allow journalists to be killed
This silence (of the private media) will affect all media personnel.
This is not something that will affect me, but I will work to ensure the freedom of journalists.
The government is taking a keen interest in protecting the media and the rights of journalists, but I want to know if the private media has the same interest.
The Prime Minister was addressing the one-day seminar organised by the UNESCO and the Ministry of Finance and Media on ending impunity for crimes against journalists.
According to UNESCO, nine journalists were killed in Sri Lanka with many more attacked, abducted or tortured between 2005 and 2015 when Mahinda Rajapaksa was President.
Sri Lanka which ranked at the bottom of the Global Impunity Index (of the Committee to Protect Journalists) has now been removed from it as a result of the positive work done by the government over the last two years, the Prime Minister added.

Rapid advances power Chinas online transformation
What happens every minute online in China Well, in every 60 seconds, users hail about 1,400 cabs and 2,800 private cars on Didi Chuxing, the country's largest car-hailing company. More than 194,000 people are video or audio chatting on WeChat, the most popular social networking platform run by Tencent Holdings Ltd. And over 770 people buy something, with about $1,133,900 spent on purchases at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's online marketplaces.
The data offers a quick look at how the internet is shaping China, in a stunning way. The country does in 60 seconds (online) what some would only do over a day, week, or more, said Tech in Asia, a popular technology website which compiled the data. What is more important, the blossoming trend has unfolded just in few years, as the cyberspace gets increasingly intertwined with the offline world, officials and experts said.
China officially launched the Internet Plus initiative in 2015, which was designed to upgrade traditional industries by embracing new technologies such as mobile internet, cloud computing, big data, and the internet of things. In just two years, concrete progress has been made, with internet-related technologies revolutionizing sectors such as manufacturing, retail, transportation, finance, and healthcare.
We will work faster to build China into a manufacturer of quality and develop advanced manufacturing, promote further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy, said President Xi Jinping in the report he delivered at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Since the inception of the Internet Plus, new industries and business models have emerged, which have greatly boosted China's economic growth, according to Premier Li Keqiang.
AliResearch, a research institute of Alibaba, noted that internet-related growth has accounted for 6.9 percent of China's gross domestic product, the second highest proportion in the world.
The fast application of new digital technologies in traditional sectors has been enabled largely by China's powerful information infrastructure. The country has built the world's largest broadband network.
Thanks to the quick deployment of 4G mobile technologies and fiber-optic networks, the world's second-largest economy has also accumulated about 751 million netizens as of June this year, roughly equivalent to those of the United States and India combined, data from the China Internet Network Information Center show.
In comparison, the number for June, 2012 in China was just 538 million, reflecting the stellar growth the country has made in the past five years.
Miao Wei, the minister of Industry and Information Technology, said China has risen to be a strong player in the global internet arena, and become the largest manufacturing powerhouse in the world.
Upgrading the manufacturing sector with advanced digital technologies is a global trend. China has already made a good start in this direction, he said.
The ministry has handpicked 206 smart manufacturing pilot projects across the country since 2015. Twenty-eight of them are rolling out industrial internet trials, which have boosted their production efficiency by more than 30 percent.
By establishing a computerized interconnection of machinery, big data and the internet of things which can analyze data from machinery and adjust its operation, companies are accelerating their push to upgrade plants.
Zhang Ruimin, chairman of Haier Group, a household appliances giant, said traditional enterprises have been completely overhauled in the internet age. The company has built an industrial cloud platform, which helps it swiftly satisfy customers personalized demands on a large scale.
As for businesses which used to be hit by the prevalence of internet technologies, positive changes are also showing up to inject new vitality. Brick-and-mortar stores, for instance, are starting to benefit from e-commerce behemoth Alibaba and JD.com Inc's efforts to develop the so-called new retail experience.
They are scrambling to help brands merge online and offline resources to offer customers a seamless shopping experience with the aid of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing technologies.
To be more specific, tech gurus are converting retail outlets into intelligent stores that have drawn thousands of labels, from Nike to Shiseido to Wyeth. Through an interconnected system, they allow shoppers to track product availability at other locations in real time and get timely delivery to their doorsteps while choosing to pay with their phones.
Danielle Bailey, Asia-Pacific research head at consultancy L2, said the integration of virtual and physical landscapes is an area where China leads the way.
In the West you have this battle of online and offline ... Here through a variety of models you see where China has already had these things work, and not just empty talk, she said.
Likewise, how to embrace the internet is also the latest buzz word echoing around the finance sector. In addition to offering mobile payment services, local financial technology companies are actively embracing new activities such as online wealth management, credit scoring and utility bill payments.
Such robust development has helped China secure five of the top 10 places in a ranking of the world's best-performing fintech players, according to a report released by UK-based advisory firm KPMG and Australian investment company H2 Ventures.

RBI likely to keep interest rate on hold for second time in a row
The Reserve Bank is likely to keep the key rate unchanged on Wednesday and stay focused on inflation control as the rebound in September quarter GDP growth - after a five quarter decline - seemed to have eased pressure on it to lower rates, experts said. India Inc, however, is demanding interest rate cut to further build on positive sentiment generated by the rebound and upgrade of the country's sovereign rating by Moody's.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, will meet on December 5 and 6 for the Fifth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2017-18. The resolution of the MPC will be made public on December 6. In its October review, it had kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged on fears of rising inflation while lowering growth forecast to 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal. The central bank had reduced the benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6 per cent in August, bringing it to a 6-year low.
Bankers and experts are of the view that the RBI for the second time in a row may key repo-rate or short term lending rate unchanged as inflation trajectory is likely to remain upward in the coming months. It's going to be a status quo. The liquidity in the system is very low, deposit rates are firming up and there are concerns about inflation, said Union Bank MD and CEO Rajkiran Rai G.
Global financial services major Nomura said while lower GST rates have moderated output prices, input cost pressures are marginally higher, which along with higher food inflation is likely to push retail inflation slightly above the RBI midpoint target of 4 per cent in November and beyond.
We expect a hawkish hold from the RBI..and policy rates to remain unchanged through 2018, it said in a report. Wholesale prices based inflation had shot up to a 6-month high of 3.59 per cent in October. The retail inflation (Consumer Price Index) for October rose to a 7-month high of 3.58 per cent.
Meanwhile, industry body Ficci said there has been positive news in the form of improvement in ease of doing business rankings, Moody's upgrade of India's rating and the massive recapitalisation plan for banks. This is a good opportunity to further build on the confidence levels. The monetary policy announcement next week will be a perfect timing to give another shot to boost the sentiment, said Ficci President Pankaj Patel in a statement.
Reversing a five-quarter slide in GDP growth, Indian economy bounced back from a three-year low to expand by 6.3 per cent in the July-September period as manufacturing revved up and businesses adjusted to the new GST tax regime.

Rohan Abeywickrama reappointed as President: Sri Lanka Tourism recognizes ASMETs role at 11th AGM
Rohan Abeywickrama was reappointed as the President of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises in Tourism (ASMET) for 2017/18 at the 11th AGM held recently in Colombo.
The recognition and importance given to ASMET by the Ministry of Tourism and the relevant authorities such as the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) and other related tourism organisations has greatly strengthened ASMET to venture into greater strides in the development of Sri Lanka Tourism.
ASMET was founded in 2005 and has come a long way to meet the aspirations of the Sri Lanka Tourism Industry.The present membership numbering over 100 and many more intending to join in the near future has benefited largely by the assistance of international agencies such as the CBI of the Netherlands and the US Department of Commerce offering educational programs and numerous other assistance such as training and familiarization, Web upgrades and assistance to buy space and enable participation in International Travel and Tourism Trade Fairs.
The recent encouragement by CBI to help companies to qualify for Travelife certification was a boost to the industry certified companies only. Several companies were awarded this prestigious certificate during the ITB held in March this year.
The CBI Netherlands EU organisation offering aid to travel and tourism in the Asian region also trained selected ASMET members by foreign tourism experts on two occasions in the Hague and continues to conduct these educational programs in Sri Lanka too. While the special American Business interim training in tourism related sector SABIT hosted a three weeks exposure to eleven ASMET members in the USA, the tremendous knowledge gained was contributed towards the development of Sri Lanka Tourism. The lessons learnt from these foreign donor agencies gave a fine boost to ASMET that facilitated the holding of several workshops in the provinces that helped to share the information gained and studied during this USA program with the private and public sector. This is part of ASMET policy to provide opportunities for the Small and Medium Enterprises and enhance the good image of the tourism industry by upgrading their respective products and services to meet international standards, create a platform for the informal sector to be given the opportunity to come into the mainstream.
Meanwhile the ASMET President has played a dynamic role in the progressive affairs of ASMET and has enabled participation in many workshops with the Western and North Western Provincial Councils, the Hotel School and many other associations including the ABS information systems, Monash University and tourism sector stake holders. Representations have been made to the Ministry of Finance for the soft loans to be extended by banks to the membership and to The Ministry of Tourism for numerous facilities to help the membership to develop their respective business.
Meetings with insurance companies were organised to establish a blanket cover for the entire membership and negotiations are in progress.ASMET has always been invited by The Ministry of Tourism SLTDA and The SLTPB for all meetings in respect of the development and promotion of tourism. An important provision of a 50% discount rate for participation of SME's in the International Travel fairs is a grateful and highly appreciated assistance by the membership.The President has also used his influence with The CBI (Foreign Ministry of Netherlands) for an extension to continue the scholarship scheme through 2018 and also conduct an IT workshop in the forthcoming month of February 2018.
ASMET will continue to pursue its mission to establish good partnerships and links with National and International Tourism related organisation and the Government together with large enterprises and corporate companies and be part of a multi stake holder network that has access to Policy Makers, Industry Leaders, Financiers, Investors and International Markets.
The tremendous support extended to ASMET by the Ministry of Tourism -SLTDA and SLTPB is a great source of strength to move forward. ASMET will continue to administer a professional Secretariat to achieve its goals that will emerge by the changing times.
Awards were also presented several past presidents to the service rendered for tourism in Sri Lanka.

Scottish revival makes for mouth-watering Six Nations
Cardiff: Nobody was left in any doubt about which team sits atop the world rugby pecking order, New Zealands clinical finishing and robust defence in their autumn campaign once again proving they are streets ahead of their rivals.
But the Six Nations promises to be a hotly contested tournament as Ireland and Scotland wrapped up their November outings in style and threaten to match the might of England.
The autumn series was a mixed bag for Wales, however, and a catastrophe for both France and Italy.
The All Blacks blooded a host of players little known in the northern hemisphere as they won all five of their tour games, although they were made to graft by Scotland (22-17).
The Welsh dominated the first half in their 33-18 defeat by Steve Hansens men, but were unable to convert pressure into points and the 64-year, 30-Test wait for a win over the world champions went on.
Gone are the days that the All Blacks would put out a second-string side against a Wales or a Scotland and comfortably win the game, said Wales coach Warren Gatland, who led the British and Irish Lions to a 1-1 series draw against New Zealand in the summer.
Theres still a gap but Id like to think its closing a little bit.
Scotland were undoubtedly the stand-out team of the autumn, Gregor Townsends side backing up their close defeat by New Zealand with a thrilling demolition of a 14-man Australia, the last team to have beaten the All Blacks.
Theres been a lot of positivity around Scottish rugby. A lot of hard works gone in at a number of levels over the last few years and its great to get that win against the current number three team in the world, Townsend said.
Weve just got to build on this and make sure this energy, enjoyment and hard work keeps on going.
Our next three games (against Wales, France and England) are really going to test us. Those three are excellent teams but weve got to go into the Six Nations with real confidence that we can do well.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose team won three from three in November, posting a record 38-3 win over South Africa before edging Fiji (23-20) and beating Argentina (28-19), insisted that he would not be experimenting at the Six Nations with fresh faces ahead of the 2019 World Cup.
The Six Nations is such a tough title to get, said Schmidt. In the Six Nations you are obliged to go as hard as you can because you still need your top selection as they need to build their fluidity and confidence.
Unenviable record for Noves
Ireland travel to France for their opening Six Nations game, and the hosts at the Stade de France have a lot of restructuring to do after finishing their autumn series with three losses and one draw, against Japan.
Veteran coach Guy Noves now enjoys the unenviable record of 14 defeats and a draw from his 22 matches in charge, the sides worst win-ratio in almost 50 years.
Noves, however, told AFP he would not consider stepping down, insisting he was optimistic about getting Les Bleus back on track.
Theres neither depression nor worry, Noves said. Im well aware of the period were going through. I know some of the reasons for it but I dont really want to list them because otherwise theyll say Im complaining.
While Hansen starred with the All Blacks and Gatland the Lions, it was Englands Eddie Jones who was named coach of the year by World Rugby.
Jones only defeat in 2017 came against Ireland in the final game of last seasons Six Nations, denying England a Grand Slam and halting his winning run since taking the job at 17 Tests.
After beating the Pumas, Australia and Samoa over the last month, Jones record as England coach now reads 22 wins from 23 Tests.
Im excited about the Six Nations as weve got a chance to create history, the Australian said.
Every side wants to beat us. Whether theyre playing here at Twickenham or away, this is their big game of the Six Nations.
Gatland added: With where all the teams are, its going to be one of the closest Six Nations that we have had for a long time. Italy, however, look sure bets for the wooden spoon. They won their opening November Test against Fiji but further losses to Argentina (31-15) and South Africa (35-6) meant that under Conor OShea, who took over as coach in March 2016, Italy have won only four of 22 Tests and three of those were against tier-two nations.

SFIO to probe 18 companies for suspicious transactions post note ban
The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) will probe at least 18 companies for alleged suspicious transactions involving huge amounts of money during demonetisation, a senior official said as the government continues its crackdown against illicit fund flows.
After striking off names of around 2.24 lakh companies from the official records for being inactive for long and disqualifying more than 3 lakh directors, the corporate affairs ministry is carrying out data mining to gather more details.
Against this backdrop, authorities have come across suspicious transactions involving huge amounts of money by some of the deregistered companies.
A senior official said the SFIO would probe at least 18 companies for indulging in suspicious transactions during the demonetisation period.
As part of efforts to curb illicit funds flows and corruption, the government had demonetised old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes in November last year.
On November 23, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs P P Chaudhary had said that based on details gathered from banks, around 50,000 deregistered companies deposited and withdrew about Rs 17,000 crore during demonetisation.
According to an official release issued on November 5, cash deposits worth over Rs 17,000 crore were made and later withdrawn post demonetisation by as many as 35,000 companies that were later deregistered.
Preliminary enquiry on the basis of information received from 56 banks in respect of 35,000 companies involving 58,000 accounts has revealed that an amount of over Rs 17,000 crore was deposited and withdrawn post demonetisation, the release had said.
In one case, a company which had a negative opening balance on November 8, 2016, deposited and withdrew Rs 2,484 crore post demonetisation, it had said.
Data mining is continuing with respect to the struck-off entities and artificial intelligence could be used to identify illegal activities of companies, the minister had said on November 23. (Business Today)

Everything was arranged in the chopper to smoothen the mission. Doors removed. Seats re-arranged. And the safety ensured for the team.
In early 2013, Dominic Sansoni, Sebastian Posingis and Richard Simon launched a mission with Squadron Leader Asiri Pathirage and his four-man crew from the Sri Lanka Air Force on the SLAF SUH556. The chopper is a war veteran, now decommissioned and decked out in civilian livery to borrow words from Richards account.
Both Dominic Sansoni and Sebastian Posingis flew all over the island, first tracing the coastline, then making a series of flights across the interior of the island. They gradually developed a digital repository of photographs taken at heights ranging from 1000 feet near ground level. The visual granary has accommodated towns as well as wildernesses, paddy fields as well as tea plantations, people at work as well as play, domestic animals as well as wildlife; mountains, forests, waterfalls, rivers, beaches and offshore islands; dagobas, temples, mosques and churches; in essence, the whole country in one capsule form.
We had long wanted to photograph Sri Lanka from the air. But it is quite an expensive task. Luckily Access Engineering came our way. They wanted to celebrate their silver jubilee, and warmly welcomed this proposal of ours.
Sebastian was to join Dominic in the photographic task with Richard Simons behind them to put in the written version. Simons narrative, however, is not linked to the photographs. Nay, it is not a captioned essay to support the photographs. The narrative and the photographs decorate the voluminous coffee-table book in two layers on one theme: Sri Lanka.
Simons text is an illustrated version of Sri Lanka taking the reader to the mystery, mythology, history and various other abodes blanketing the country. The wordsmith tenders a photographic narrative of how Ravana must have flown across the island. Long before Dominic and Sebastian have taken the picturesque landscape into custody with their Nikon DSLRs, it could have been an already-experienced spectacle to the legendary king.
Whether I believe this mythology or not is not important. What matters is to talk about it so that people can relate their own experiences to it. My job is not to tell what to believe, but to reinterpret it to go along with the artistic content. That is where three of us merge, Simons said.
Flying above, however, was not that much of a pleasant experience for Dominic. Maybe not necessarily acrophobia, but Dominic claims that flying above is not always a pleasant experience for him.
There were times when I felt it is simply stupid to get into something heavier than air or water. Sometimes I thought about it and wondered why I am in this project at all. I am not fond of fights. Even if you put me up the ladder, I will easily get scared, Dominic expressed.
But the landscape down below was too tempting. The team did not have much time to think. They had a job in their hand. They did not have much time for worry either.
Sri Lankan Air Force was the best team to fly with. I found them fantastic. They are very knowledgeable. Well experienced, Dominic added.
With Colombo as the starting point, the chopper took the team up to west coast as far as Talaimannar, Puttalam, Vavuniya, northeast, east coast and then to Palali.
You can never cover Sri Lanka because there are a lot of places to capture. We had to pick the places that stand out. Not necessarily the landmark. Any interesting geographical location such as the dunes of Bundala will do. You cannot find such spots easily. If you go to Adams Bridge, you will find a terrain that you will not see anywhere else in the country. We thought about that. Our journey was one circle around the whole country, another circle around the hill country, and in the middle, Simons chipped in.
The most difficult part was hiring an Air Force helicopter. It will probably cost you a fortune. Thats when Access Engineering came calling.
I would call them amazing patrons. And the Air Force team was also amazing. They did not come behind to see what we are doing. They did not impose any restrictions on our assignment. They simply asked us to photograph anything. It was not only fantastic but also a rare opportunity, Dominic added.
Many Sri Lankan corporate bodies invest their monies to boast about their logo or the products, Simons elaborates with experience in advertising for 35 years.
I say they are wasting their money. In the end, only the people of the company are interested in it. But a project like this reaches out to different people, markets and age groups. There is quite a lot to gain in the long run, Simons elaborated.
The biggest challenge for Sebastian was the necessity to a quick reaction.
You havent got much time. You have to be swift. You miss one thing, and its gone. You have to react quickly. And you dont know what to expect either. You dont know how they look like in the air. I would not call them challenges, but the big surprises. We never had an idea on how to undertake this project. But in the end, we managed to focus a lot on the details, Sebastian added.
Simons was to add other technical challenges  or rather surprises  such as sun and difficult angles.
I thought I knew Sri Lanka because I have travelled and flown a lot. But on this journey, I came to realise how arrogant I had been. Oh my god the surprises we had! That was a fantastic experience, Dominic said.
