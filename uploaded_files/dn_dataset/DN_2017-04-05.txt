Implementation of RTI Act successful
The Right to Information Act is being successfully implemented and 80 percent of information officers were appointed to state institutions, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said.
He said the appointments had been delayed in certain ministries and departments due to the complex nature of those institutions. But, according to the terms of the RTI Act, the Head of an institution automatically becomes the information officer where such an appointment had not been made. Therefore, delay in providing information would never occur.
Steps had also been taken to train all information officers this year, the Deputy Minister said that they would be able to implement 100 percent of the RTI Act soon.
Paranavithana said the Mass Media Ministry was performing a colossal amount of work to implement the RTI Act and the Information Commission was established as an independent commission.
This would ensure open governance where government activities would be carried out in a responsible and transparent manner. The RTI Act tied down state institutions with a legal responsibility and a new work culture was required for its proper implementation.
He said the RTI Act No. 12 of 2016 approved by Parliament on August 4, 2016 is in operation with effect from February 3, 2017 and in terms of it, people can seek any information dating back to 10 years from any state institutions.

Australia invited for first ever survey of mineral resources
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva calls for long-term SL, Australia collaboration

The Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, on a visit to Australia last week on an invitation extended by the Australian Government under their Special Visitor Program sought to utilise the expertise of Australia which is one of the worlds leading explorers of minerals and metals, to expand the investment opportunities in the mineral sector of Sri Lanka.
The discussions on the mineral industry were among the several agenda items for the Deputy Ministers visit which sought to develop collaborative and innovative relationships between the two countries. The Deputy Minister was following up on the discussions relating to the visit of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in February 2017.
The need for mapping of Sri Lankas mineral resources which has never been done was discussed during the Prime Ministers visit. The Deputy Minister held discussions with officials of GeoScience Australia which is the repository of data on Australias natural resources.
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop
He pointed out that an island wide survey of Sri Lankas mineral resources is a prerequisite for Sri Lanka to utilise the potential of the mineral industry and get investors interested in establishing linkages from Sri Lanka to global production networks. GeoScience Australia responded positively regarding bringing Australias experiences and expertise to Sri Lanka and undertaking a needs assessment visit.
In Canberra, the Deputy Minister called on Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and the Minister for International Development Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells where a range of issues of bilateral interest and concern were discussed.
Foreign Minister Bishop expressed support for the Governments reconciliation efforts and conveyed Australias appreciation for Sri Lankas cooperation in combatting people smuggling.
Both Ministers highlighted the contribution made by the Sri Lankan community in Australia and who possess expertise and skills that can be harnessed for development work in their country of birth. In Melbourne, the Deputy Minister visited the Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the Australian Synchrotron which is a world-class research facility that uses accelerator technology to develop scientific applications in sectors from medicine and nanotechnology to manufacturing and mineral exploration.
The Deputy Minister invited the scientific leadership at the Australian Synchrotron to focus on finding root causes of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) which is affecting several tens of thousands, mainly farmers, in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka.
During discussions with Asialink at Melbourne University, the Deputy Minister reached an agreement to send teachers at Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Maha Vidyalaya who are piloting Sri Lankas first ever cloud smart classroom on a tour to Australia to learn from Australian practitioners about applying technology in the classroom.
The Deputy Minister also met with officials of the Business Council of Australia in Melbourne and discussed a proposal to prepare a presentation to be shared with the top 100 Australian CEOs about the opportunities for investment in Sri Lanka. He also discussed expansion plans of Sri Lankan operations of KOOKAI, an Australian owned fashion label which has a significant presence in Sri Lanka.
During the visit the Deputy Minister had two speaking engagements where he delivered a public seminar titled Sri Lanka in Transition: Opportunities and Challenges at the South Asia Research Centre of the Australian National University in Canberra and a round-table discussion at Asialink, Melbourne University with academics, INGOs, and business community.

BASL clears Kannan's appointment
An expert committee appointed to look into the controversial appointment of High Court Judge R.Kannan has informed the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) that there was no just cause in asking for the removal of the judge under the Constitution.
BASL Secretary, Attorney-at-Law Amal Randeniya speaking to the Daily News said the BASL could only intervene if the appointment was unconstitutional.
The expert committee consisting of past presidents pointed out that there was no point in us asking for his removal as the High Court Judge had not violated any conditions set out in Article 111 (2) of the Constitution which outlines the reasons upon which a High Court Judge could be removed, he said. He added that if the President was to remove Kannan without due cause, it would set a bad precedence.
In accordance with the Constitution, a disciplinary committee would need to be appointed to investigate into the Judge and his actions before any recommendations for his removal are made.
The Judicial Services Association (JSA) in the meantime on April 1 unanimously adopted five resolutions seeking the removal of Kannan from the position of High Court Judge.
The expert committee however has asked that in future, there be set criteria when appointing members of the Private Bar to the High Court.
They have given us some recommendations on that and we expect to table it at our Executive Committee meeting on 5 April, said Randeniya.
The expert committee consisted of; Upul Jaysuriya, Ikram Mohamed, Romesh de Silva, Upali Gunaratna, Nihal Jayamanne, Ajitha Athukorale,W.Dayaratna, Faiz Musthapha and K. Kanageeswaran.

Depression on the rise among Sri Lankans
Eight hundred thousand people in Sri Lanka suffer from some form of depression. Thirty six psychiatrists worked in Sri Lanka prior to the tsunami. The figure had doubled to 77 by 2016. During the same period, the number of Medical Officers of Mental Health rose from 34 to 205, WHO Representative to Sri Lanka Dr. Jacob Kumaresan told the `Daily News' yesterday.
Dr. Kumaresan said Sri Lankas transformation of mental health services over the past 15 years has been nothing short of remarkable. Since the devastating tsunami in 2004, the country has experienced a dramatic change in the provision of mental health services, with increased political commitment, funding and a shift in priorities.
He said Sri Lanka has 217 outreach clinics providing mental healthcare at the community level, covering almost every health division in the country. The number of mental health workers dramatically increased over the past 15 years with new training programmes and professional posts created within the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine.
While Sri Lanka has made excellent progress in the field, the public must be inspired to access these services. People must learn to recognise the symptoms of depression early. About 15 percent of new mothers experience postpartum depression, he said.
Throughout the world, 350 million suffer from depression.
The majority of whom do not receive treatment. As people lead increasingly stressful lifestyles, depression is on the rise.
It is the leading cause of disability, causing an estimated loss of US $ 1 trillion to the global economy each year through lost productivity, he added.

The classic architecture of the project reflects Sri Lankan architecture, where natural ventilation and open view provide guests the opportunity to live with natural beauty. All apartments are designed with large terraces facilitating this.
Dusit Thanis world class management style is known for its emphasis on pampering and well-being. Along with the fact that The Beachfront is the only development on the south-west coast of Sri Lanka which can accommodate large-scale events, it truly is going to become the go-to destination.
Paul Dwyer added, We are extremely excited and proud of our project. We selected a beautiful beach location because that in itself is a luxury which most countries do not have. Tourists love to spend their time on the beach. Our project is the total package of opportunity, location, luxury and return on investment. We look forward to further contributing to the city's tourism boom and welcoming visitors to the Dusit family.
The Beachfront guarantees significant returns to its investors of 6% net per annum for a period of 5 years which is paid in USD quarterly. In addition to this every apartment owner can enjoy 21 days free stay, per year. Each apartment has its own Freehold title and there are no on-going costs for owners. The developers anticipate an expected 30% increase in the capital value of the apartments over next 3 years. Investing in The Beachfront is particularly attractive for foreign investors as it is the only project of its kind that they can legally own.
The Beachfront Balapitiya is another shining example of Dusit Thani portfolio. Dusit Thani is a five star brand which has an international portfolio of distinctive hotels and apartments including 25 in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa with 22 new hotels and apartments planned for completion within the next 5 years.
The Dusit Thani Sri Lanka Beachfront Balapitiya will bring it to 48 in total. With this positive milestone, we are delighted Dusit Thani Beachfront Balapitiya construction is on track and we look forward to operating this unique property when complete. said Ian Brewis, VP Technical Services & Design of Dusit International.
Mondays Groundbreaking kicked off with a live feed from the construction site. The construction is now under way and the project will be fully completed by 2020. More information from www.dusitthanisrilanka.com.

Fines increased from Rs.10,000 to Rs. 200,000
The fine for long distance buses plying without valid permits has been increased from Rs.10,000 to Rs.200,000. Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday in Parliament presented the National Transport Commission (Amendment) Bill to give effect to this revision.
The minister said the new fine is only related to inter-provincial buses coming under the purview of the NTC.
He said a set of new criteria in issuing long distance route permits has also been developed.
He said as of now a total of 3,219 permits including 459 semi-luxury permits, 603 luxury permits and 94 super-luxury permits have been issued for long distance buses.
The minister further pointed out the integrated time table for private and SLTB buses has not yield successful results as both parties do not comply with the time table. He said private bus owners have not allowed even a single SLTB bus to ply on the 103 Narahenpita-Fort route.
He pointed out the Treasury provides Rs.1.3 billion monthly to the SLTB to cover its expenses.

GMOA takes Kiriella to task
What Higher Education and highways Minister Lakshma Kiriella says about the Court of Appeal judgement on SAITM is completely fabricated and the judgment dose not say that SAITM cannot be or should not be closed down. What Minister Kiriella said on behalf of SAITM when he was an opposition MP is now freely available through all social media, Government Medical Officers' Association Secretary Dr.Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA expects that the current Higher Education Minister will not fall into the low level of the former Higher Education Minister who had been sent home by the people of Sri Lanka. But, unfortunately, he is now in Parliament holding a ministerial position against the wish of the people.
According to Dr.Zoysa, the current Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister should carefully read the 42 page judgement given by the Court Of Appeal on SAITM. In the judgement it very clearly states what the two ministers did not tell the judiciary, the country and what they did not do for the country and the people and how they ignored their official duties. The minimum standard of medical education is Sri Lanka was there from the beginning and under that standard the Sri Lankan doctors won world recognition. But the Health Minister said there was no such standard. Now he has to accept the fact the minimum standard is already there and issue the gazette notification legalizing it. Dr.Zoysa pointed out that the GMOA expect that President Maithripala Sirisena will intervene and solve the SAITM issue before April 7 keeping the promises he made to the people becoming the President and stand by them.
The meaningless and useless talks of ministers is worthless. If not health service, especially the private health services will be halted for a long period of time to make the Government understand / feel the issue through a known / familiar language.

ICGs to reduce youth unemployment
The National Youth Front of the SLFP has implemented a systematic approach for bringing down the rate of youth unemployment in line with the national convention of the Youth Front held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium recently, National Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said. He said this while addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters.
Bandara said that the systematic approach was launched under the theme 'Visanduma' (Solution) at the National Youth Front Convention. Under the Visanduma programme, an institution called Institute of Career Guidance (ICG) will be established district-based countrywide. Each ICG will guide youths for job-oriented vocational training.
Youths at the ICG will be guided and instructed for vocational training after their hidden talents and capabilities are identified. Then these youths will be guided to specific fields in accordance with their talents. In other words, a youth who visits the ICG will be converted to a capable person who can obtain a job easily, he said.
He added that all ICGs will be coordinated through Sri Lanka Institute of Career Guidance (SLICG), which is going to be established in Colombo. It has been planned to establish the first ICG in a few months, he said. Bandara said that the President highly accepted and appreciated the concept of the
Visanduma project when he was presented the draft of it at the national convention.

ICPPED draft Bill will affect judicial independence: PNM
Patriotic National Movement (PNM)Secretary Dr. Wasantha Bandara said a draft Bill to give effect to the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) will affect Sri Lanka's Judicial independence.
"The Bill which has proposed a domestic mechanism to probe alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka will be presented to Parliament shortly.
Our judiciary system will become enslaved to foreign countries if we passed this Bill in Parliament, he said. The bill will be a move to witch-hunt the war heroes, he said.
"ri Lanka became a signatory to the ICPPED on December 10, 2015, and ratified the instrument in May, this year. But, the Convention has not yet been translated into Sinhala and Tamil. It has not even presented to Parliament and MPs had not been given a copy. So how those MPs will participate in debate without this information The ICPPED has not even signed in many countries such as Australia, USA, UK, India and Pakistan as they know the adversely effects of it.
Attorney-at-Law Kalyananda Thiranagamage said if this law was passed in Parliament, our judiciary is bound to implement the provisions of the convention," he added. Rear Admiral Dr. Sarath Weerasekera said it is questionable why the people are still silent when the attempts are being made to take our valiant soldiers to international criminal courts. People have not much aware on adversely affects of this Bill for the country and for them.
"The recently concluded 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva has once again recommended that Sri Lanka should form a hybrid court consisting of foreign judges to hear alleged war crimes.The UNHRC will never withdraw the proposal of setting up hybrid court even though the many politicians say various things, he added.

The Next Economic   Revolution   Just (re)Launched:   Congratulate   SpaceX, Thank NASA
Elon Musk and NASA have shifted the financial calculus of space and in doing so they have transformed Americas economic future. On Thursday, Musks SpaceX successfully relaunched the first previously flown orbital rocket. This reusable launch system, along with those in development by Musks entrepreneurial competitors will change our lives.
The development of a robust space economy promises growth, astounding new products and services, amazing high-tech jobs and a quantum leap in our national security capabilities. All of this was made possible by a series of visionary public-private partnerships initiated by NASA.
The Next Economic Revolution Has Arrived
Launch cost has always been the primary constraint in the space business. If access to space werent so expensive wed have an astounding amount of entrepreneurial activity in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and beyond. Space tourism, materials development, pharmaceutical research, power generation, communications, earth imaging and national security all have killer apps just waiting for reliable and affordable access to space.
In the past few years, commercial competition has driven down the price for a mid-sized (10  15 metric ton) orbital space launch from over $150million to under $65million. Reusability will quickly cut that price by another 30% or more. As serious competitors like ULA and Blue Origin enter the reusable market we could see launches for as low as $30million. This downward trend will continue as reusable rockets get simpler and higher demand drives economies of scale into the production of what are now very specialized materials and components. After all, the fuel costs for a space launch are very low  typically less than $1million.
The combination of continually falling costs and constantly increasing performance promises an economic environment analogous to the one we saw during the PC and software boom of the 80s and its follow-on, the Internet explosion of the 90s. In 1980, very few Americans foresaw that their world and fortunes were about to be transformed by affordable computing.
Those that did see this coming made a lot of money during the PC/Internet boom. Several of them even became rich enough to start building rocket companies. Aspiring entrepreneurs and savvy investors should think seriously about why the founders of PayPal, Amazon, Google, Virgin and Microsoft are pouring $billions into space startups. This just might be 1980 all over again and time for sideline investors to start looking at which applications the space launch revolution will make affordable and profitable.
A Pre-Flown Rocket is Tested Safe an Expendable One is . . . Well, Not So Much
So far, the reuse story has centered around the potential cost savings of used rockets, moderated by the concerns about the reliability of flying a payload or crew on a used vehicle. Thinking of this rocket as used is a completely backward way of viewing this monumental event. With any other vehicle, manufacturers assume that each individual unit must be operationally tested before it transports passengers or goods and the customer expects and desires that operational testing. Simply starting the engines and declaring a vehicle ready to go would be a frightening idea.
As an air traveler, would you want to board a plane that had never been tested in flight That will never happen, because Boeing and Airbus wont (and cant) deliver a plane that has not been flight tested. Each and every one of their commercial airliners goes through at least one pre-delivery flight and more if anomalies are detected. After that, the plane is flown to the paint facility to have the airlines livery applied. With the colors on the new jet then takes a joint customer-manufacturer flight test. Finally, it is flown off to join the airlines fleet somewhere. Thats at least four flights before a single paying passenger is wedged into a middle row coach seat.
Wander around a new car lot and try to find a new car with zero miles on its odometer. You wont. Every car on the lot has several miles on it, because the auto manufacturers test every vehicle, usually on a test track at the factory and sometimes in the real world.
Iterative Improvement Based on Data
Satellite operators dont buy rockets, they purchase launch services. Service must be Reliable. Reliability depends on predictability. Predictability is based on data. An unflown rocket has no flight data. With flight data, anomalies in a particular vehicle can be identified and addressed. Designs for the entire model line are iteratively improved via analysis of returned vehicles. Reuse will make every rocket flight less expensive and safer.
The obvious, but often unexpected, conclusion is: customers will pay more to place their precious payloads on previously flown vehicles while the first flights of the shiny new ones will have to be discounted. Reuse will drive prices down, but reusable rockets will also command a competitive market advantage. Expendable rockets will cease to exist outside of niche markets on the low (venture class) and high (SLS) ends of the launch market.
An American Future, Again
As with the PC and the Internet, American innovation in space will drive our economic growth for at least a generation. Dominance of the space business will ensure that the U.S. economy remains the most powerful on Earth.
Our global competitors in Russia, China and even Europe remain wedded to an antiquated socialist vision of space development. Their space programs are run by state-owned enterprises and quasi-governmental national champions. While they flirt with very small commercial endeavors and rebrand their government bureaucracies as companies, the political leaders of these nations are very unlikely to truly let go of a strategic national industry with military implications.
The current trend already suggest that it is time to put a fork in Chinas Great Wall Industry Corp, Russias TsSKB Progress and Europes Arianespace. In 2011, the U.S. had surrendered the entire mid-sized commercial space launch business to subsidized global competition. Just four years later, SpaceX had recaptured half of that market. SpaceXs success has motivated ULA to aggressively pursue commercial launches as well. Reuse and new competitors will restore 80% or more of this business to America over the next few years.
All of this aligns perfectly with the trade and job creation goals of the new White House. Support for commercial space goes back to Ronald Reagans signing of the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 and the Trump team has stated that public-private partnership will form the cornerstone of American space policy.
Thank You NASA
The particular Falcon 9 rocket that SpaceX relaunched this week was originally built for NASA and flown on a mission to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). More significantly, the entire Falcon 9 program was made possible by support from NASA under its innovative Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) programme.
Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, COTS solved NASAs problem for ISS resupply. COTS competitors SpaceX and Orbital ATK filled this need faster and cheaper than a traditional government rocket program would have. NASA gained two new rocket and capsule systems for less than $1billion. Traditional, cost plus contracting for these systems would easily have exceeded $2billion per vehicle and they would not have been ready in time to keep the station supplied when Russias progress resupply rockets began to fail.
The agencys follow-up program, Commercial Crew, promises to do the same for human spaceflight. SpaceX and Boeing are producing advanced capsules that will send NASA astronauts to the ISS using existing Falcon and Atlas rockets. Space tourists and astronauts from other nations will soon be paying these firms for rides, launching another American industry.
Throughout this process, NASA, along with the Airforce, have provided important launch and tracking infrastructure to commercial operators at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). KSCs director Bob Cabana is running successful commercial partnerships with many firms. SpaceX is launching from historic Pad 39A while ULA is doing commercial launches just around the corner. Jeff Bezos Blue Origin has its own pad at KSC as well and a manufacturing plant for their New Glenn reusable rocket is rising just outside the gates.
NASA must also be commended for supporting SpaceXs efforts to innovate and test reusability on NASA missions and other launches from their facilities. This was not a requirement and the space agency has gone the extra mile to help American industry gain this important leg up. NASAs public-private partnerships offer a proven model for achieving President Trumps goal of running government more like a business.
Cost Savings across Agencies
The benefits of the reuse revolution will extend beyond the commercial sector. Over the next few years reusable rockets will force costs down across the spectrum of space launch markets, benefiting all customers including government ones. While NASA will call on its flagship Space Launch System (SLS) for really big jobs (above metric 70 tons), reuse will allow NASA to save $billions on launches for the majority of the agencys missions. We will get a lot more science out of the existing budget.
Redundant, disaggregated and highly responsive space systems are key to success on a 21st century battlefield. Reusable launch systems will allow the DOD to do a lot more for our warfighters with less of our tax dollars. Our global military rivals, dependent on their state-owned aerospace bureaucracies, will find they are once again unable to keep up with American innovation.
Funding Urgently Required to Support the Space Boom
All this commercial space activity presents a challenge to a couple of obscure and sadly underfunded government agencies that were established as part of Reagans commercial space initiative. The FAAs Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) regulates commercial spaceflights with the specific mandate of protecting the uninvolved public. While AST has been doing a truly commendable job, its current resources are entirely inadequate for the task it faces.
Congressman Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, a member of the House Science and Technology Committee, has called for increasing the funding for AST from a paltry $19million to $23million. Bridenstine commented, The agency must be properly resourced to allow the private sector to innovate and grow the space economy which affects every aspect of our lives. Amen.
The Commerce Departments Office of Space Commerce (OSC) is charged with advocating for U.S. commercial space in both domestic and foreign markets. The OSC, which is tasked with supporting a $246billion space industry, squeaks by on a budget of about $1million.
Seriously, you cant buy a condo in D.C. for that. The tiny agency has been hidden inside of NOAA and left without a permanent director for the last eight years. This situation is simply ludicrous given Americas commercial opportunities in space.
AST, OSC and our commercial space firms must be fully supported if America is to dominate the economy of the 21st century.
Lets take a moment to congratulate SpaceX and to thank NASA for creating this astounding opportunity. Our entrepreneurs, investors and government must work together to seize it!

Due to the fear the JO members are saying various things including they are going to surround Temple Trees and Presidents Secretariat on May day he said.
Commenting on this Bandara said that the JO can surround the Temple Trees and the Presidents Secretariat on other day.
The JO earlier though that they would not be given the Gall Face Green but once they received it they are afraid of filling the premises with people.
The JO members think when they say that they are going to surround the Temple Trees and the Presidents Secretariat, the Police will not permit them to hold the Mayday rally at Galle Face Green as it is a threat to national security, Bandara said.

LG bodies member allocation to be completed by next week: Faiszer
The allocation of the number of members in each of the Local Government body will be completed by next week, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha said in Parliament yesterday.
He was replying to a question by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma as to when the gazette in this regard would be published.
The MP pointed out the Elections Commission is unable to declare the Local Government Elections until the Minister publishes the relevant gazettes and make amendments to the Local Government Elections Act. MP Alahapperuma said the Elections Commission Chairman has highlighted 52 revisions needed to the Act.
The MP made these observations when the minister said holding Local Government elections is on the hands of the Elections Commission.
Minister Musthapha said the Attorney Generals clarification on the incorporation (the allocation of the number of members in each of the Local Government body) of LG bodies was sought by the ministry as there was a new legislation pertaining to facilitating 25 percent female representation in the LG bodies.
He said the AG has given green light to go ahead with the gazette on the incorporation of the LG bodies. He said the amendments pertaining to the LG Election Act would be presented for the Cabinet approval shortly.
It was revealed in the House that the report of the Delimitation Review Committee has not been gazetted. The minister said he handed it over to the Government Printer to be published in the Gazette. However, when MP Alahapperuma said the Gazette has not come out, the minister said he would ask to expedite the process, adding that part of it has been printed.
Minister Musthapha said the Delimitation Review Committee has proposed 1,036 revisions to the boundaries of the wards. He said there are 133 Local Government bodies on which there would be no revision of boundaries.
No inquiry over alleged misuse of public money
No inquiry has been held over the alleged misuse of public money by former President's Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath and Piyadasa Kudabalage when they functioned as Directors of the companies affiliated to the Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, Parliament was told yesterday.
Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne made this revelation responding to a question by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa.
The deputy minister said Piyadasa Kudabalage had been paid Rs. 20.8 million from March 2012 to January 2015 as allowances. This amounts to Rs. 600,000 per each month. This is a huge allowance,|" Wickramaratne said.
He said the Sri Lanka Insurance had invested Rs. 5,000 million, Litro Gas Company Rs. 450 million and EPF Rs. 2,500 million in the Canwill Holdings Pvt Ltd when it was started in December 22, 2011. He said Gamini Senarath and Piyadasa Kudabalage have only invested Rs. 10 each in the company.
Helanco Hotels and Spa pvt ltd and Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa pvt ltd are affiliated companies of the Canwill holdings. Helanco Hotels and Spa pvt ltd started constructions of the Hambantota Hyatt, while the Sino Lanka Hotels and Spa pvt ltd started constructions of the Kollupitiya Hyatt.

Road opposite Temple of Tooth Relic won't be opened for vehicles: Kiriella
The road opposite the Temple of the Tooth Relic which is the most venerated place for the Buddhists all over the world will not be opened for the vehicles, Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
He made this assurance in Parliament in response to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23(2).
"We have decided to construct a tunnel road from Tennekumbura to Ampitiya and from Bogambara to Gatambe to reduce the traffic congestion in Kandy," Minister Kiriella said. "We got the Cabinet approval today for the construction of the tunnel roads,"he said.
Minister Kiriella said it was hilarious that those who organised car races around the Temple of the Tooth Relic are shedding crocodile tears over the protection of the temple. "It was a UNP government that demarcated the premises where the temple is located as a sacred premises," Minister Kiriella said.
"The UPFA government was in power for 20 years, but they complain that there is traffic congestion in the Kandy city. The previous government only closed the road opposite the Temple of the Tooth Relic. But they did not provide an alternative road for the closed road. But this government has given the solution," he said.
Moving the motion, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the UPFA government took measures to remove the Court and the Kachcheri which had been constructed within the sacred premises of the Temple of the Tooth Relic by force by the British Colonials. He asked if the government knew that there was an attempt to open the road opposite the temple. "The Chief incumbents of the Malwathu and Asgiriya chapters and Diyawadena Nilame had also requested not to open the road for vehicles," MP Gunawardena said.
He questioned if the government would prevent opening the road for vehicles.
Following the response of Minister Kiriella, MP Gunawardena demanded to make a statement and the Speaker observed that it was a statement.

PM calls for new economic, political order to rebuild Indian Ocean region
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday called for a new economic and political order to be established between the countries of the Bay of Bengal to rebuild the Indian Ocean region and bring prosperity to Sri Lanka.
We cannot hope for a Union like in Europe as Asia is too vast a region. But we have been trading and living together for centuries and it is through our wealth that Europe and Britain prospered through. We need to use that in our present and build our own countries, the Prime Minister said speaking at the launch of the book Ranil Wickremesinghe-A Political Biography, written by Dinesh Weerakkody.
The Prime Minister also explained that there was greater scope for India and Sri Lanka to further improve relations and there was no reason for Sri Lankans to fear ETCA, There will be no takeover of our economy. It will be a win-win situation for both.
And we have a program for Sri Lankan businesses. We need to become an export hub of the Indian Ocean, he said. The launch of the book held at BMICH had the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, former Indian Minister and current Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs Shashi Tharoor as chief guest, MPs and other dignitaries.
As the event spoke of the Prime Ministers many achievements in politics, Premier Wickremesinghe himself recalled an interview of former President J.R.Jayewardene, he was asked how he came to be President of Sri Lanka and to this he replied, I survived all my contemporaries, the Prime Ministeradded, thus patience is a virtue.
The four time Prime Minister having started his career as the youngest Deputy Minister in government, observed, If you look at Sri Lankan politics today, Game of Thrones is kids play and survival has become an art in diplomacy and politics.

Police Spokesperson DIG Priyantha Jayakody addressing a media briefing at Police Headquarters yesterday said Police teams dressed in civil would be deployed to monitor shoplifters and thieves targeting unsuspecting shoppers.
People also tend to leave their homes unattended for long periods during this time and thus we ask that they take precaution to keep someone on watch at home or take other necessary precautions when they have to go out often. Also do not keep too many valuables and cash at home, warned the DIG and asked that people be careful in handling large amounts of cash when shopping as this would catch the eye of potential thieves.

Police to take action against police brutality
Police condemns all forms of police brutality and we will take the sternest action to stop such acts recurring, said Police Spokesman, DIG Priyantha Jayakody yesterday, as he explained that it was necessary to make the stance of the police clear in such cases.
DIG Jayakody was referring to an incident where two traffic police officers in Dodangoda mercilessly beat a 16-year-old on April 1, over a traffic offence. The incident which was caught on video was published on many media outlets. The student, according to DIG Jayakody, was driving a motorcycle without a valid licence and when asked to stop, he had sped away and thereafter collided with an oncoming three wheeler. The police had then caught him and beaten him up. As soon as the incident was known, we launched an investigation and produced the two officers in court. Given the public outcry over the incident, we asked that they be remanded, but the judge released them on Rs 200,000 surety bail each, he said as he addressed a media briefing held at Police Headquarters.
The suspects however, were not tried under the Torture Act but on assault charges and the DIG said they would refer to the AGs advice on how they would proceed further. We do not want this incident to damage the image of the Police. We have 84,000 police officers working with us under various circumstances and there are bound to be a few undisciplined individuals in the group. But, the Police is more than capable of dealing with them, said the Police Spokesperson.

Property additions to meet office space demand
Sri Lankas Research Intelligence Unit (RIU), a real-estate advisory firm said the island's commercial property market in the next three years will see further significant additions to the inventory at the top end of the market.
Releasing its high end commercial property market report for the first quarter of 2017, it said the Colombo City Centre, Shangri-La and Water Front projects will make contributions.
These mixed development projects will be positioned as commercial destinations which offer premier, state of the art A Grade office spaces integrated with residential, retail and luxury hotels.
With occupancy levels at the top commercial developments maintaining close to 100 percent over several years now, we can observe that there is still unmet demand for high-end commercial space in Colombo, Research Intelligence Unit chief executive officer Roshan Madawela said. Over the next several years, we expect supply to narrow the gap with demand which will continue to grow in correlation with economic growth.
Whilst there are no formal classification systems for commercial office space, several factors can be identified to determine high-end or Grade A office real estate. These factors include the age of the building, location, standard of maintenance, prestige related factors and the availability of parking. In addition, these buildings will have high-quality furnishings, state-of-the-art facilities and excellent accessibility.
This high-end segment of the market is often targeted towards the international market, demanding rents that are well above prevailing averages. In the Sri Lankan context, WTC, HNB Towers, Access and PARKLAND are considered as meeting the mark in all respects of Grade A commercial property. The latter, as the latest development on the market, is the subject of a detailed case study in the RIU report.
Parkland by RIL property is the latest Grade A office space supplier to start operations in Colombo is a real estate company founded in 2009, as an owner, developer and manager of Grade A commercial office space in Colombo.

PTL purchased Treasury Bonds with funds borrowed from CB
It was suggested at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue yesterday, that Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited has purchased treasury bonds with the money borrowed from the Central Bank itself.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake leading the evidence for the day, stated that throughout a specific date Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited (PTL) has funded all purchases of treasury bonds through the borrowings of treasury bonds and Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF). The information surfaced as the Additional Director of the CBSLs IT Department, Wasantha Alwis was testifying before the Commission yesterday. He was analysing data derived from the Real time Gross settlement System for the understanding of the Commission. Concentration was on transactions that had taken place between the CBSL and the PTL on February 29, 31, 2016 and on the April 1, 2016.
DSG Gunatilake explained that an ILF provided for a Primary Dealer is to be returned at the end of the very day. ILF is not a loan but free money given by the CBSL to a Primary Dealer, that should be settled within the same day, it was explained.
DSG Gunatilake said the PLT had a total outstanding of Rs.11.06 billion worth ILF by April 1, 2016, which attracted its consequences. He pointed out that PTL was fined, based on this default.
It has happened only four times in the past.
The largest other violation of the ILF is Rs. 350 million. PTLs violation is 33 times more than the past largest violation, DSG Gunatilake pointed out to the Commission.
He also expressed his dissatisfaction stating that, this violation shows the degree to which and the manner in which the PTL has operated.
Meanwhile, PTLs legal counsel Nihal Fernando PC, pointed out that the ILF taken from the CBSL were all based on government securities and that all other Primary Dealers have followed the same practice of borrowing from the CBSL to purchase treasury bonds. He was pointed out that the PTL had a default of Rs.11.06 billion. Commissioner, Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said to Fernando PC that he will as usual receive an opportunity to question the witness and then he can explain if any contradictions occur to the evidence provided.
