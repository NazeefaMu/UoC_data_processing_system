Developing countries need more voice in decision-making
There is no guarantee that international discussions go the way you want, but it is important for Sri Lanka and other developing nations to be present and to assert themselves in the dialogue, Finance and Mass Media Minister, Mangala Samaraweera said referring to current IMF, World Bank Meetings in Bali, Indonesia.
Minister Samaraweera is chair to G-24 (Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development), which is a forum to coordinate the positions of developing countries on international monetary and development finance issues.
Prior to his departure for Indonesia, Samaraweera said, My hope is that there are enough risk factors evident and enough voices that people in positions of power take seriously the risks of global economic downturn and in response take concrete steps to ease trade tensions, improve on the global trade system and take steps to address debt problems.
As great power tensions rise, I think there are more opportunities for developing nations to influence and temper discussions. We plan to do that in Bali, he said in an interview.
The topic for discussion among G-24 Ministers at this years meeting will be the key issues faced by emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) in Navigating an Uncertain Global Environment. Major sources of uncertainty to be discussed are escalating trade tensions and protectionist policies, as well as tightening financial conditions in EMDEs.
Minister Samaraweera also said he would like to see developing countries get more voice in decision-making through further reforms to increase the voice and representation of emerging and developing economies, which have grown in importance in the global economy.
The current system gives advanced countries greater voice, under-represents dynamic emerging economies, and marginalizes smaller poorer nations.
Talking about global economic prospects, the Minister said, much of the world economy is doing well but there are warning signs that need more serious attention. There is concern that such warnings were ignored in the years prior to the 2008 global financial crisis and as G-24 chair I want to ensure that world leaders arent complacent and take some proactive measures, not wait until a crisis to react. The threat of trade war is significant, which could have very negative side effects not only for the United States and China, but for many developing nations that can be disrupted.
At the same time some major economies are ending their loose monetary policy and raising interest rates. This comes at a time when many developing countries, including Sri Lanka, have taken on significantly more debt. As interest rates rise that increases the pressure of that debt. Turkey, South Africa, Argentina among others have made headlines with falling currencies and fiscal deficits, which has led money managers in developed countries to pull back from investment in emerging markets.
Excerpts;
Q: You mention trade conflicts. What can be done, particularly by small economies, when major powers want to take unilateral action
A: Clearly there is frustration over some aspects of the global trading system. However, there is major risk in abandoning a rules-based approach for unilateral action. I think the best way to head off unilateralism is to offer a credible alternative, which is toprocess to reform the World Trade Organization. We are ready to engage in efforts to make the trading system fair, supportive of development, and fit for the future. Small nations individually cant persuade big countries but by banding together in groups like the G-24 we can push issues onto the agenda and try to get the influential actors and discussions at the IMF pointing in a better direction. We small developing nations of course will not always win over everyone, but we can influence the global agenda, which I try to do through the G-24.
Q: High debt levels and unsustainable repayment are risks to global and national economies. What should be done at the national and international levels
A: There is a tendency to frame the high debt issue as only one of emerging markets but remember many developed nations  Italy, Japan, the US  also have high debt. The difference is they have higher revenues and deeper financial markets so they have more options than poorer countries, and when an economic squeeze comes emerging markets are hit earlier and harder when markets begin to doubt their ability to repay. It is crucial to remember that every individual and nation faces needs greater than their income. There always is a temptation to borrow but we have to temper that with institutions and laws that slow down the accumulation of debt, assure transparency around debt terms and purposes, ensure that money to be borrowed goes to practical purposes that are a net boost to the whole economy. When nations do get in debt trouble, the IMF must play a key role in simultaneously recommending reforms and supporting countries in restoring debt sustainability. To complement that we also are pressing for better international tax cooperation to combat illicit flows of funds. And we call on developed nations to live up to their development finance commitments to assist developing nations.

## Title: Labour imports must be managed professionally, if not will destabilize local labour market

Labour imports must be managed professionally, if not will destabilize local labour market
A group of professionals belonging to several agencies said in one voice on Tuesday that foreign worker policies must be carefully drafted, should not in any way be allowed to destabilize the local labour market.
The known facts about Sri Lankas labour market are;the skills mismatch, low female labor force participation 36%, youth unemployment, demography and aging population, and outdated Labour Policies. To address our labour shortages and the skills mismatch we need to up-Skill our domestic labor pool, tap into our overseas Sri Lankan workers and diaspora, and finally for short term gaps look to foreign labour. It is estimated based on immigration department data that around 40,000 foreigners mainly from India, China and Bangladesh are working in different sectors. Some however put the figure as high as 200,000.
Sri Lanka currently has no adequate institutional, legal, policy and operational framework for facilitating and regulating foreign worker movement in Sri Lanka. According to the Department of Census and Statistics there are nearly half a million vacancies in medium and large scale private sector enterprises in 2017 (see chart). The hardest to fill vacancies are found in the occupation categories of sewing machine operators,(46,576) security guards (45,316) and other manufacturing labours (31,277). Large scale labour shortages in selected industries including the tourism, construction and information and communication (ICT). Moreover, industry level estimates show that the labour shortages are likely to increase over time in key sectors, largely driven by a Skills mismatch and young people not interested in certain jobs.
Shortage is real
Sri Lanka is increasingly facing domestic Labour shortages in key economic sectors and industries. While demographic, social attitudes, expansion of the economy and outward labour emigration largely contributes to the shortfall, lack of interest in certain types of jobs, competition, insufficient salaries and payments, lack of qualified people, poor terms and conditions of the job also play a significant role.
Shortages are today recorded in many projects with foreign direct investments as well as in Sri Lankan own companies. As the labour component is a key input to economic development, the consequences can be critical leading to a drop in productivity and direct output losses. Acute labour shortages will affect economic growth and also investor confidence.
Economic research in other countries suggests unemployment below 5% builds wage pressure as businesses struggle to find suitable candidates. Labour shortages  and the resulting higher labour costs make markets inefficient and are a disincentive for investment like what is now happening in many developed markets. Therefore a clear policy is required to deal with the issue of labour shortages, both in the short term and the long-term. In the short term we need to increase the female labour participation level, training of existing workers to do new jobs, improvement of benefits to attract more workers, mechanization, improvement of HR management practices and lastly foreign workers as solutions through local certification and mutual recognition agreements (MRAs). Long-term however we need to invest to get our Labour ready for the emerging new jobs. The government and the private sector will need to address this challenge jointly.
Options
Some industries in the country are adopting varying strategies to overcome the shortage. Some industries in the construction and tourism sector are now using foreign workers to fill vacancies. Notwithstanding economic consequences, labour import to any country is a sensitive issue as its impact will be felt across its social, cultural and economic fabrics with far reaching consequences.
Some of key challenges of bringing foreign labour and skills include, loss of job opportunities to locals due to cheap labour being imported, skilled labour becoming unemployed, threats to social-cultural identity, health and Order and national security. Unregulated labour immigration may also lead to illegal immigration, drug trafficking, overstaying, abuse of visa conditions, risk of human trafficking resulting in the loss of public confidence in the immigration system.
Therefore as the panel of experts suggested this week the government immediately needs to; a) establish a national mechanism to quantify and publish total foreign worker requirement per year, by sector and by occupation, b) establish a national mechanism to set and verify qualification/skills/ experience of Professionally Qualified Persons and Persons with Special Skills c) establish eligibility guidelines for employers intending to hire foreign workers d) establish a work permit issuance mechanism and e) establish guidelines and robust verification mechanism to ensure job opportunities are first offered for Sri Lankans, before hiring foreign workers.
Therefore the foreign labour hiring policies needs to be carefully drafted so as not to destabilize the local labour market.

Lilo & Stitch  live-action remake  in the works
Stitch is back. Lilo & Stitch, the 2002 animated movie from Walt Disney Feature Animation, is getting the live-action treatment.
The studio has hired up-and-comer Mike Van Waes to pen the script for the remake, which will be produced by Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich of Rideback, formerly known as Lin Pictures. The two are already known in the Disney halls as they are working on the high-profile live-action remake of Aladdin.
The original film was written and directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, who later found acclaim with How to Train Your Dragon.
The Hawaii-centric story told of the bond formed between a lonely human girl named Lilo and a dog-like alien named Stitch, who is engineered to be a force of destruction. Pursuing aliens, social workers and the idea of the bond of a family figure into the proceedings.
While not a massive success by modern box-office standards, the well-regarded movie was a bright spot in a down period of Disneys animation history and launched several direct-to-video sequels as well as several television series.
It is unclear whether the new project, which is intended to be a live-action/CG hybrid, is intended for theatrical release or for Disneys streaming service that is set to launch in 2019.
Ridebacks Ryan Halprin is co-producing. The project is the latest in Disneys successful strategy of mining its past animated classics and repurposing them as live-action events. Cinderella, The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast and Petes Dragon are some of the recent releases, with Dumbo, The Lion King and Aladdin among those heading moviegoers way in the future.

Pohottuwa voters abandoned
At the last local government election, people voted for the Pohottuwa party expecting some change. But those who obtained the people's mandate are not doing any service to the village, Public Administration and Management, and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
The fate that has befallen the people who voted for Pohottuwa can be described by the pithy Sinhala saying Watta Baddata Deela, Essata Datha Niyawanawa Wage.(Grinning at the fruit after leasing out the land), he said.
The minister was addressing a series of meetings after launching several road development projects in the Madulla Divisional Secretariat Division on October 6.
Minister Maddumabandara said the period of the previous administration could be described as an era of robbery. In his capacity as Law and Order Minister, he said he was aware of the colossal weight of files relating to acts of fraud and corruption committed by the previous regime.
But the time the government took to bring the perpetrators of those acts of fraud and corruption to book was far too long, he said.
He said as a responsible and law abiding government, they could not intervene to expedite the cases as they respected the independence of the judiciary. They would, however, try to expedite these cases and get those guilty punished by trying to expedite these cases.
Minister Maddumabandara said those who spoke about toppling the government had forgotten that it was elected to power by UNPers as well as smaller communities including social activist groups and they would never allow anyone to reverse that mandate.
Uva Provincial Council member Harendra Dharmadasa Banda also spoke.

Small scale industrial zones covering every district essential
Sri Lankas main investment promotion agency, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) says it is facing huge challenge catering to the project requirements of BOI approved companies owing to lack of available resources, mainly land, buildings and raw materials, know-how and most importantly, lack of skilled manpower in the country.
Manilal Ranasinghe, Deputy Director-Investment Promotion of BOI expressed theses views in an interview with Daily News business on the sidelines of a pre-budget seminar, organised by Business Economics Faculty of University of Jayewardenepura under the theme, Striving for Export Competitiveness at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo recently.
He said main task of the BOI is to attract investors who were looking to tap foreign markets like India Pakistan, Singapore and member countries of the European Union.
Ranasinghe said it is an essential to develop small scale industrial zones covering every district to woo more local and foreign investors to invest in Sri Lanka.
Commenting on challenges faced by BOI in attracting FDIs into Sri Lanka, he said it takes considerable time to obtain approvals for investment proposals due to various other government organizations involve in the approval process and archaic government circulars delay this process to a great extent.
In addition, there is a scarcity of ready-made buildings available for new investors to set up their projects immediately. If private property developers are encouraged to build factory buildings in remote areas to cater to the requirements of these investors, in turn investors, they will go to remote areas or set up investment projects, he said.
In order to attract more FDIs to the country, he proposed the government to provide maximum security to foreign investors and to take measures to popularise the countrys location advantage among other regional competitors while assisting investors to get the necessary approvals without any delay to commence investment projects in Sri Lanka.
In order to promote agricultural sector FDIs, he suggested establishing a new agriculture equipment hiring centres to enable small scale farmers to obtain services for their land preparation, land cultivation, water supplying services and labour requirements.
In addition it is also necessary to identify suitable lands for agricultural sector and to introduce an attractive incentive package for local multinational manufacturing companies to promote agri investments in Sri Lanka, he said.
In addition, foreign investor who wishes to set up projects in Sri Lanka will be looking for a workforce, trained up to their expected standards. To redress the lack of skilled workforce, we need to introduce special industry training programs, in association with BOI industries and various other industries that come under the purview of the Industrial Development Board. It is also essential to introduce awareness programs with relevant government departments to educate industry people on new technologies in their respective sectors, he said.
He also pointed out the need to upgrade the existing government technical and other training institutes, operating island wide to the international standards, providing them with necessary funds, buildings and equipment.
Going forward, he said it is essential to implement new strategies to promote FDIs into Sri Lanka such as export diversification measures by identifying sectors and new value added products, promotion of project clusters, establishment of new export processing zones, new incentive scheme compatible with WTO commitments, based on common employment threshold and common investment threshold.
Furthermore we need to tap into global production network by utilizing bilateral and regional trade and investment arrangements , encourage investments of services and manufacturing industries in lagging regions, promote environment friendly green activities that use energy saving technologies or use alternative energy and establish separate zones for environment sensitive projects, he said.
Also, we need to organize business forums in other countries and find out export markets. It is also essential to find joint venture partners for local investors while encouraging existing investors for re-investments, he said.
Speaking on BOI contribution towards economic transformation in Sri Lanka, he said there are about 768 projects in commercial operation under the section 16 of BOI Act while another 1,700 projects are in operation in Sri Lanka under the section 17 of BOI Act.
Likewise, there are about 200 projects, waiting implementation after signing agreements in Sri Lanka.
Altogether, there are about 2,500 projects, operating under the BOI arm at the moment, he said.In terms of projects in commercial operation under section 17 of BOI Act, manufacturing and apparel sectors have taken the leading position, representing 50 percent of total projects.
In terms of projects in commercial operation under the section 17 of BOI Act , there are about 405 projects in the apparel sector while 442 in manufacturing sector, 308 in utilities and infrastructure sector and 166 projects in tourism sector.
In addition, there are about 143 and 133 projects in knowledge services and agriculture sectors respectively.
He said these 2,500 projects have created almost 500,000 direct employment opportunities.
In addition to that, these projects have also created another 500,000 indirect job opportunities in the area of transport operations, canteen operations, container handling, special services and many more.
Ranasinghe further said that there are about 50,000 job opportunities available at 16 BOI projects at the moment. As per the targets, set during the period 2018-2020, BOI sources said it is expected to achieve US $ 2.5 billion FDI (Estimated FDI) in 2019 and US $ 3 billion in 2020. In terms of realized FDI, BOI is expected to achieve US $ 1.6 billion in 2018, US $ 1.8 billion in 2019 and US $ 2 billion in 2020.
In terms of exports by BOI companies, BOI is expected to receive US $ 7,900 million, US $ 8,000 million and US $ 8,400 million in the years 2018,2019 and 2020 respectively.
As per the cumulative FDI inflows in Sri Lanka during the period 2005-2017,China is the leading investor in Sri Lanka (US $ 1,738 million) followed by Malaysia (US $ 1,540 million) , Hong Kong (US $ 1,441 million , India (US $ 1,164 million) ,U.K (US $ 1,067 million) , Netherlands (US $ 850 million), Singapore (US $ 665 million), Mauritius (US $ 610 million), UAE (US $ 593 million), the USA (US $ 444 million) and Japan (US $ 331 million).

Abbass triple bring Pakistan closer to win over Australia
Dubai, Wednesday: Hard-working fast bowler Mohammad Abbas took three wickets in seven balls to bring Pakistan closer to victory in the first Test against Australia in Dubai on Wednesday.
The right-arm medium pacer dismissed Aaron Finch (49) and the Marsh brothers -- Shaun and Mitchell - for ducks as Australia slumped from 87 without loss to finish the fourth day at 136-3.
At stumps opener Usman Khawaja was batting on a fighting 50 and Travis Head on 34 as the pair had added an invaluable 49 for the unbroken fourth wicket stand to prolong Australias resistance on a weary and spinning Dubai stadium pitch.
Pakistan will need seven more wickets while Australia require another 326 runs for an improbable victory to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series, with the second Test starting in Abu Dhabi from October 16.
Abbas said he was happy to be among the wickets.
I used the crease to bring the ball in and got wickets from those deliveries, he said.
We need seven more wickets so, God willing, we will get them and get this win for which we have worked very hard and it will be good to take a lead in the series.
- Australian replay -
It was an action replay of the first innings as Australian openers put on 87 -- they made 142 in their total of 202 on Tuesday -- as Finch was trapped leg-before soon after tea with a sharp incoming delivery from Abbas.
Finch, who took an unsuccessful review, hit five boundaries in his knock.
Two balls later Abbas had the elder Marsh caught behind and in his next over trapped Mitchell right in front of the stumps only to get the decision on review.
But it was Finch and Khawaja in the afternoon session who batted with resolve.
Pakistan-born Khawaja, who top scored for Australia with 85 in the first innings, held one end intact with resolute batting, having so far hit six boundaries.
Abbas has figures of 3-26 to add to his four wickets in the first innings, but leg-spinner Yasir Shah was still wicketless in the match.
If Australia still wish to win this match they will have to rewrite the history books as the highest chase in all Test cricket is West Indiess 418-7, made against Australia at Antigua in 2003.
Pakistan, who were 45 for three overnight, declared 7.5 overs after lunch on 181-6 at the fall of Asad Shafiqs wicket for 41.
Pakistan made 482 in their first innings while in reply Australia were dismissed for 202. Jon Holland, who took the key wicket of Azhar Ali for four on Tuesday, dismissed opener Imam-ul-Haq for 48, caught and bowled off a flighted delivery. Debutant Marnus Labuschagne then had Haris Sohail caught close to the slips for 39, leaving Pakistan at 110-4. Sohail and Imam had added 65 runs for the fourth wicket.
Holland had figures of 3-83 from 20 overs while off-spinner Nathan Lyon took 2-58. AFP

CBEU seminar on govts unfair economic practices
The Ceylon Bank Employees Union (CBEU) will organise a seminar to educate the public, professionals and working masses oppressed by the governments unfair and unsuccessful economic practices, in Kurunegala on October 14.
Ceylon Bank Employees Union Senior Vice Secretary Keshara Kottegoda said yesterday that the main aim of the seminar is to save the working masses, professionals and the common man from the unfair economic programmes launched by the government.
He said that five economic traps laid by the government are selling state resources, tax burden and depreciation of rupee, escalating cost of living, curtailing of pensions and White Paper to allow EPF investment in the share market and Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP). These are not our requests, but the actual conditions imposed by the IMF for granting loans, he said.
Taxes on essential commodities have increased, placing heavy burdens on the people. When fuel prices go up, the cost of livings also goes up. Continued depreciation of the rupee has also resulted in increasing prices of essential items.
Therefore, the government should immediately remove the tax burdens of the people and impose taxes on the people who defaulted on tax payments.
CBEU General Secretary Ranjan Senanayake said the countrys economy suffered lot as a result of different FTAs signed with various countries. The government has already lost US$ 10 billion of tax revenue due to the FTA signed with Singapore. The FTA was signed in an illegal manner and would adversely affect Sri Lankan professionals.
The Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) launched recently has actually created an unfavorable environment for the working class. Both the government and employers are engaged in oppressing the working class through this programme, he said.

China, Norway to ink free trade deal
A free trade agreement between China and Norway is expected sometime next year as productive discussions are continuing between the two nations, Norways top envoy in China said on Tuesday.
The FTA with China is a priority for Norway, Geir O. Pedersen, Norwegian ambassador to China, said at a news briefing in Beijing.
Pedersen said Norway has the same ambitions as before. We believe it is more important than ever to deepen and develop political dialogue, economic dialogue, exchange of tourists and investment, and have trade (with China).
Last month, China and Norway concluded the 12th round of FTA negotiations in Beijing. China is currently discussing signing or upgrading FTAs with 27 countries.
Starting Thursday, Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja will make a state visit to China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
It will be the couples first visit to China since China and Norway normalized their diplomatic ties in December 2016. It is also their fourth visit to the country since their first trip in 1985.
The visit is a political and symbolic expression of the deepening relationship between China and Norway, Pedersen said.
Besides Beijing, the couples 10-day trip also will take them to Dunhuang, Gansu province; Shanghai; and Changshu and Suzhou in Jiangsu province.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Tuesday that China considers the visit an important opportunity that will help China and Norway deepen mutual trust, expand cooperation and facilitate people-to-people exchanges, thus advancing their relationship.
Joining the king and queen is a Norwegian business delegation of 340 people representing 140 companies.
It will be the largest business delegation ever from Norway to China, said Knut Sorlie, the embassys commercial counsellor.
According to Sorlie, 40 commercial agreements will be signed during the visit, which reflects the dynamism of China-Norway business cooperation and will also consolidate and further deepen bilateral business relations.
China is Norways largest trading partner in Asia, with two-way trade having reached $5.62 billion last year, according to the Foreign Ministry.

Citizens' Mail
Disfigured currency notes
I recently visited the Peoples Bank branch at Dam Street, Colombo 12 to pay my electricity bill. Seeing a handwritten (not by me) figure of No. 12 on one side of my 1000-rupee note the counter clerk politely told me that she could not accept it. Further, she added that the deadline given by the Central Bank to surrender such notes was over. I tendered another note and settled my bill.
But the question is if a bank, whether state or private, will not accept such notes, where else could the public make use of them Nobody can be so careful and attentive to check such notes in their day-to-day dealings with anybody. It is practically impossible in this busy and time-precious society. Yet those notes circulate amongst themselves but when reaching the banks they become almost dud.
No doubt there are thousands of such notes still in circulation. Imagine how much a man in the street will suffer if his only available 50 or a 100 rupee note is not accepted not only by a bank but by a shop in the street too If the banks will accept such notes the mudalali will not be much concerned as he will include it in his normal deposit to the bank.
Furthermore, what will happen to a passenger on a bus if he or she has such a note and a rude conductor refusing to accept it
Defacing of currency notes must not be encouraged and simultaneously, dead-lines should not be declared. At least, as a punishment allow those who possess them to get them cashed or exchanged only from a bank or deposit them.
At a time when people are financially struggling, a bank refusal is like a man fallen from a tree being gored by a bull.

Conspirators plotting Presidents downfall wont succeed  Minister Sajith
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said that President Maithripala Sirisena is facing the same vilifications that his father Ranasinghe Premadasa had to endure during his tenure as the President.
Those who are jealous about the achievements of President Sirisena are plotting his downfall. They attack him mercilessly, fuelled by rage, jealousy, envy and grudges. These were the type of attacks my father too faced, he said, addressing a Village Reawakening (Gam Udawa) function.
Minister Premadasa noted that President Maithripala Sirisena was not a person born with a silver spoon. He hails from a farmers family. I am often reminded of my fathers roots when I see him as he is also someone who comes from a middle class family. They both broke the stereotype notions in politics, he added.
He said that United National Party supporters and many others brought him to the position where he is today. When he first became President, the opposition called him Aiyo Sirisena who betrayed the leader after eating hoppers together.
But today all conspirators were showing an interest in working with President Sirisena, not because of the love and concern they have for the people and the country, but because their only motive is to bring him down.
Their eyes are on positions and power but we will continue to go ahead with the Yahapalanaya Government established by the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.
He said that the formation and removal of a Government can only be done through the ballot and not through petty political agendas. The ones who are plotting to fill their pockets with dollars have no aspirations for the betterment of the public.
We should all together defeat the conspiracy against President Sirisena, he said. Minister Premadasa said that President and the Prime Minister have given him their blessings and strength to establish more housing projects. More than 20,000 houses will be built for the people under the Village Reawakening Movement by 2020.
He noted that the ones who are plotting against the Government do not have any aspirations to build houses for the people and strengthen their standard of living.
Their plan is strengthen their own family and generation, they are not bothered about the public or the future generations of our country, he said.
Minister Premadasa emphasized that conspiracies will only serve to strengthen the Government and enhance its commitment to serve the people.

A correct move
The police crackdown on the Aava gang and other criminal outfits in Jaffna is to be welcomed. In our main story in yesterdays edition Jaffna Senior DIG Roshan Fernando was quoted as saying that a special operation was launched by Jaffna police to arrest suspects involved with the Aava gang and other gang activities.
The police, according to him, had searched 21 houses so far and arrested three Aava gang members. However the Senior DIG said their operations were carried out in a manner that would not harass or inconvenience the law abiding civil population. Although the police have stepped up operations to combat the threat emanating from Aava and other gangs, these measures were solely targeted at apprehending those who commit violence and not directed at disrupting the lives of the people.
True, there are sporadic acts of violence reported from the North from time to time and the onus is on the police to curb such acts and bring to book the suspects. We say this because the police in the North are sometimes unfairly blamed for being slow to act in such situations, particularly by the Joint Opposition which attributes this alleged leniency to the Governments deference shown towards Tamil politicians in the North. There are also fantastic claims made that the Government is going slow on the law enforcement front in the North due to its truck with the Tamil Diaspora.
It is nearly ten years since the conclusion of the war and although peace prevails in the former theatre of conflict the region by no means is immune from violence and crime just like any other part of the country. This truism has escaped the thinking of the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila who still consider the North as distinct from the rest of the country that needs special policing and different treatment. It is as if they are waiting in eager anticipation for some act of violence to occur in the North to jump to the conclusion of an LTTE revival and compare the situation with the Rajapaksa era where, according to them, everything was hunky dory. Ditto for certain members of the Bhikku community who are quick to point to the situation then and now in accusing the Government of turning a blind eye to the alleged re-emergence of the Tigers.
These elements who are nurtured on a heavy dose of nationalism, alas, fail to comprehend that criminal activity in the North prevailed even before the birth of the LTTE and is a common phenomenon all over the country. Besides, there is no proof so far unearthed to suggest that Aava and other gangs operating in the North are part of any LTTE buildup. In fact, the Police have uncovered evidence showing that the Aava gang had been inspired by South Indian action movies that are beamed to the North via satellite TV from across the Palk Strait.
Whatever the reasons, it is high time that the police went into action to curb the activities of these gangs. The civil population in the North deserves to live in peace after the harrowing ordeals they were made to endure for 30 years. They can well do without criminal gangs in their midst to upset their existence. There is also a need to draw in the North into the mainstream of things in alignment with the South. Law and Order could be one such component. We say this because the folk in the South still seem to view that part of the country with blinkers, perhaps due to the vast gulf that existed between the communities during the war years where more or less every Tamil was branded as a Kotiya (Tiger). Perhaps it is this alienation that still manifests itself when criminal acts that are commonplace in the South also take place in the North.
For instance, when a policeman is manhandled by some gang in the South there is hardly any outcry among the Southern population quite in contrast to when similar incidents occur in the North. Then all hell breaks loose, with pro-Rajapaksa media too joining in the bandwagon to portray the government as supine and bending to the wishes of pro-LTTE politicians in the North.
This is the reason why those in the JO are able to exploit these feelings for political advantage. Hence, every effort should be made at normalizing such divisive sentiments. We often read and witness on TV special programmes and events launched by the police in the North with the enthusiastic participation of the civil population similar to that in the South. This, needless to say, will bring the citizens closer to the Law Enforcement agencies that would go a long way in facilitating the work of the police in the North while also resonating with the folk in the South.
It would also obviate the need for the Army to take over anti-crime operations in the North as suggested by the Army, which will only serve towards reopening old wounds. Civilian administration must prevail there at all times.

Crying need for revival of club cricket in Kandy
Most of the sports fraternity in Kandy believe that cricket at club level is the most popular sport in this city, although, realistically, it is behind rugger. In Kandy club cricket has not been part of the cricket lovers favorite sports, since it has not been promoted the way it should be at club level. When presidents of the caliber of Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, Dr. M. S. Uduwella, Harindra Dunuwille, Roy de Silva ruled, only a few clubs like Kandy CC, Kandy Youth SC, Peradeniya University RC were involved in the game at top level, later clubs like Saracens SC, Old Trinitians played in the lower group, in the countrys domestic tournaments. Later more and more fancy clubs came into the scene but they only get active when the AGM is around the corner, to get their people get elected into the main committee by playing fancy six a side tournaments.
That will never help to promote cricket, and also those at the helm get active to obtain complimentary tickets when international matches are played in the hills. Clubs should be given the right support, having many clubs will not help promote cricket that will only promote the officials and kill players cricket. If there are limited clubs then for sure they will succeed. According to a research done, today no club has a ground to call their own. They dont have the proper players. Today no school leaver is keen to play for a Kandy club because there is no prominence given at club level. They move out of Kandy and play for other town clubs.
Fans overwhelmingly want cricket to finally make a comeback to Kandy.
In the early days in sports there was no politics involved, today it is the thing and if a politician gets in as president he wants all his supporters in the committee, who know nothing about the sport. There should be a man who supports every sport as the sports minister of the province. Today sports ministers come and go, and they can only be seen as chief guests at events and if the funds are obtained they go only to their known schools and clubs. Grassroots cricket at club level is struggling in Kandy and everyone believes a big change is needed to give it a viable future.

Madhuka Dilhani Tilakaratna of Bulugahapitiya nearly two kilo metres off Eheliyagoda town is a talented Gem Studding Artist who has fully mastered this art form of a different nature.
She has won the President's Silver award for her gem art work at the 'Shilpa Abhimani' Handicraft National Competition, 2017. This art piece that depicts a fresco of Kelani viharaya was purchased by the Chief Monk of the temple, she recalled.
The Gem art form is being created by applying a strong adhesive on the selected art sketch and carefully studding very tiny gem related stones on the sketch. These small pieces are obtained by grinding different sized gem stones using a small grinder.
"This art form is similar to a meditation and it needs patience," Dilhani explained.

Deepika  and  Ranbir to reunite for  another film
The dazzling duo, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone is loved by the audience. Every film they do together ends up being remembered for their fabulous performances. Though they were once in a relationship, the two continue to be friends.
It has been three years since Tamasha released, which was their last project together. But, now the hot onscreen couple will apparently reunite for another project.
Reportedly, Ranbir is already on board for the project, which is Luv Ranjans next. It also stars Ajay Devgn and Tabu. Latest reports suggest that Deepika is showing a keen interest in taking it up.
A source told a leading daily, Deepika just heard the synopsis. Nothing is finalised till now. But its an exciting project and the fact that she has shown interest is a good sign.
Hopefully, well get to see their crackling chemistry on screen once again playing different characters yet recreating that infectious vibe. Ranbir and Deepika recently also met at the formers residence along with a few of other friends from the industry including their respective partners Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh.

Facelift for Kalthota hospital at Rs. 70 m
Kalthota Base Hospital, Balangoda will be renovated by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council at a cost of Rs. 70 million.
At present, the hospital provides OPD treatment to about 500 patients daily. About 50 are inward patients.
The Provincial Council has taken steps to renovate and upgrade hospital facilities as the hospital had not undergone renovation for years.
The facilities at the hospital are not sufficient for the day-to-day requirements to render a quality service.
According to hospital sources, even though the hospital requires 14 medical officers, there are only seven in service.
Moreover, there should be eight more nurses and 13 minor staffers, Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayaka said.

## Title: Fashion and Textiles Supply Chain Management

Fashion and Textiles Supply Chain Management
In todays digital era, students are no longer passive learners because they can access information conveniently anywhere anytime through, their mobile computing devices such as Phone.
In order to arouse students interests in learning as well as enhance teaching, there is a need to incorporate more activities in class which means establishing active learning. Here active learning refers to a learning process in which students will actively engage by, working on some real cases, projects and simulation games.
In fact, prior research on higher education indicates that active learning is especially important for tertiary and advanced education because it emphasizes higher ordering thinking such as synthesized analysis and solution development. Based on my own teaching and curriculum development experience with active learning components for over a decade, I discuss and propose in this matter several practical ways on how active learning can be incorporated into the subject on fashion and textiles supply chain management. I also suggest several future on active learning and teaching for fashion and textiles supply chain management and related subjects.
Traditional teaching on fashion and textiles supply chain management focuses a lot on the theoretical aspects on the subject. Critical topics, such as inventory management, apparel production technologies, transportation management, use of information technology, facility control and location selection, supply chain coordination mechanisms etc, are usually presented in a way that students are simply passive learners and they learn as much as possible by listening to the teachers.
However, most undergraduate students who attend a class on fashion and textiles supply chain management will have very limited industrial experience in fashion and hence it is very difficult, if not impossible, for them to visualize and truly understand how the theories and models around these topics can be applied in the real world. Even for postgraduate students (such as MA/MBA/MSc students) who have substantial industrial experiences, they also tend to understand only some specific facets of fashion supply chains (but not all). Lets consider a real and rather commonly observed example from my own class: A senior garment production manager who is an MBA student in my fashion and textiles supply chain management class is very knowledgeable on apparel production technologies and quality control. He has over 20 years experience in the respective fashion industrial sector and knows every step in the garment product development process and the related internal integration mechanism. However, he has no prior experience on retailer-driven fashion supply chain coordination schemes (which refers to how giant fashion retailers strategically and specifically impose contractual and alliance measures on the suppliers)so as to achieve a globally optimal fashion supply chain). Unfortunately, since he has substantial experience in the fashion industry, when I discuss with the class the issues around retailer-driven fashion supply chain coordination schemes, he would naturally interpret these issues by his own experience from garment production and quality control. This will end up with a lot of confusion and misunderstanding on the topic.
As discussed above, it is crystal clear that for most students enrolling in a fashion and textiles supply chain management subject (at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels), basically none of them will know every part of the long fashion and textiles supply chain in practice (from upstream yarn producers, fabric suppliers, garment factories, to downstream regional distributors, local wholesalers and fashion retailers). As s result, in order to make sure that they will better understand the topics on fashion and textiles supply chain management, it is important to let them experience the scenario faced by each specific area and play an active role in the learning process.
1.Make students formally write down what they observed and thought about:One popular active learning process is to let students engage in some real world projects. In some projects, students are required to conduct a mini-research on some real cases. To foster class collaboration, teachers usually ask students to form groups and then make class presentation on their findings. Even if they pay full attention, they will easily forget afterwards. As a result, the first tip is to make sure every audience is required to write down his/her own comments, findings and questions during the class presentation by others. One way to achieve this goal is to pass to every audience a form which requires completion and submission. In addition, a copy of the collected comments will be scanned/photocopied and passed to the presenting group for their references. This simple tip can foster class sharing and enhance the level of engagement of both the presenters and the audience.
2. Encourage innovative and deeper thinking by short and inspirational class exercises:In fashion and textiles supply chain management, many challenging topics require some strong motivation and inspiration or else students will find the topics very boring (especially for the topics that they could not easily follow). Thus, the use of short and inspirational class exercises is important. For example, in order to illustrate the interesting industrial practice of having a common sizing label for apparel products across markets, I brought a real label to class and asked students to discuss on this real-world observation. Students points (of all kinds) were first collected, summarized and discussed, before I started the topic on inventory aggregation with a rigorous mathematical analysis for the theory.
3. Let students be decision makers - the role playing scenario-based exercises:It is interesting for students to imagine themselves as real decision makers and think about the optimal decision under each given scenario (Notice that this point is consistent with some other teaching models, such as Purposeful Assignments with Real Scenarios). For example, I once employed a real case on an apparel sportswear company to illustrate the topic on fashion apparel quick response program. I divided the whole case into many parts, and each part has a decision making issue (termed as question) to be addressed. After introducing the background part, one question arose and students would work in groups to propose practical solutions with the given information available at that time. After that, students were invited to share their points and I would also make my points. Then, the case continued with the reported real decisions made by the specific managers of the real company and later on, another question arose. Students would continue to address these questions one by one with the given scenario. Through these role playing scenario-based exercises, students will better understand the respective problems, have more interests to learn, and can share with one another for all kinds of new thoughts and crazy ideas. With the corresponding discussions, students will also understand more deeply about the case and make critical comments on why some decisions failed. Last but not least, it is of great fun to most students.
I believe that active learning is a global trend in tertiary education. By having more interactive activities among students and between teacher and students, students can learn better and the class discussions will be more fruitful. Moreover, it is of more fun from a teachers perspective because students and their teacher are investigating the topics and solving the problems together with all kinds of interesting ideas.
This approach is especially important for teaching subjects on fashion and textiles supply chain management. I hope that this discussion paper can provide some hints to fellow faculty members on how active learning and teaching can be achieved for fashion and textiles supply chain management (and similar subjects), and lead to more future related research and investigation. Before I close, I suggest some future research areas as follows.
Fashion textiles departments usually have quite a large intake for popular programs which implies that many conventional active learning activities would become difficult or even impossible to be implemented. It will thus be interesting to explore how active learning approaches can be effectively and efficiently implemented in a large-size fashion and textiles supply chain management class. Prior research by Power can provide valuable reference.
Owing to the popularity of online education programs, another promising and interesting future research topic is related to the incorporation of active learning components into online fashion and textiles supply chain management subject. The use of social networks for active learning and teaching is also related to this topic.
Analytical models and data analysis are critical in fashion and textiles supply chain management. However, most fashion school students may not have solid background on analytical tools such as applied mathematics and computer programming; instead, they have strong appreciation to artistic aspects on fashion such as design and beauty. A failure to understanding analytical models could lead to very negative learning outcomes. This indicates the need to have very careful planning of the active learning materials for them.
The fashion industry is known to run on a high degree of uncertainty.
With ever changing trends it is even harder to predict the market and hence forecast the required raw materials and supplies. In the past the apparel industry has been categorized as more of a push model where the retailer outlets push styles and new outfits to the market.
What increases the complexity of the supply chain is the dependence on exports from other developing countries. Almost sizable of all garments produced in the world are exported in developing nations. Hence, there is a large cost involved in transporting materials and finished goods.
It has maintained its stand as a leader in the apparel industry and what makes it so profitable is its unique supply chain strategies. The uses the following principles to increase their net income and maintain a standing of being a brand that is both fashion forward and affordable.
Quick response to Demand The follows a pull model in their inventory and supply chain management. They create up to more designs every month based on store sales and current trends. They monitor customer spendings in the store to evaluate and understand what types of designs are being consumed and then accordingly iterate on their next designs.
Small Batch Productions This has a fast turnover, they produce small number of quantities for every product. This gives them the opportunity to quickly understand what designs are successful. It is also a great way to explore new designs and understand its acceptance rate in the market. This also heavily reduces the risk of producing large quantities of something that the customer does not want. Even though it might seem like a bad idea to invest in different designs, optimizes by using the same material only in different ways.
Central Distribution CenterThis has very strong IT systems that back its distribution. All the clothes are shipped back to Spain, the central location. From here, it is distributed to different countries and stores is based on individual requirements and needs of the particular locality.
As industries and competitors follow up on this unique supply chain model, it is. Will not be threatened by the new entrants or old catching up and continue to practice its well tested and tried model or they will they be agile and innovate to sustain a competitive edge through supply chain
There is a new generation of textile-to-textile recycling technologies that will enable raw materials, like polyester and cellulose from cotton old clothing, to be recaptured, restored back to virgin equivalent quality and reintroduced back into the supply chain.
People must be equally conscious about the environmental issue arising and this will lead to demand for sustainable fashion products. Companies need to move to more and more innovative ideas to produce sustainable products so that their future is safe from being shut down.
Innovation in active learning: Future research can be conducted on the effectiveness of some innovative approaches on teaching For instance, encouraging active learning via game competition and other related activities is a well explored area while how significant it is for fashion and textiles supply chain management is largely unknown.

Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksas wish to topple the government somehow or the other, is serious and he needs to be questioned to ascertain the reason for such a statement, UNP Colombo District Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahuman said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Rahuman said that as a former defence secretary of the country, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa should be very well aware of the democratic way of forming a new government. So there seems to be a hidden motive for his statement which claimed that he is not aware of the way to form a new government.
He said that this is an irresponsible and conspiratorial statement which challenged the democratic way of forming a government.
Responding to a question by a journalist with regard to the proposed caretaker government, MP Rahuman said that nobody can form a caretaker government without dissolving Parliament and a two-thirds majority is required to dissolve Parliament.

Drawing and painting competitions under different themes and different age-groups, cultural activities and experience sharing sessions were organized and every participating child was provided with a gift pack, where the winners of the competition were presented a gift voucher in addition.
Refugees do not have the right to work in Sri Lanka and there is no possibility of local integration. Therefore, UNHCR provides them with core relief items along with other basic assistance on a monthly basis to help them survive during their stay in Sri Lanka till they are able to achieve a durable solution through either voluntary repatriation back to their home lands or resettlement to a third country.
MASL is one of the Implementing Partners of UNHCR and receives support to implement a project for refugees and asylum-seekers including the Refugee Education Centre at Dehiwala. MASL takes all possible efforts to alleviate the sufferings of this vulnerable population irrespective of religion, race, gender, nationality or any other differences.

Just add milk!
Seems that some of you are wondering exactly how much protein you are getting in a glass of milk. The short answer is eight grams. The longer answer needs to address why this is important. Protein is an essential nutrient for health, it helps to create a feeling of fullness and satisfaction after a meal or snack thus helping with weight maintenance. And an easy way to boost protein at any meal or snack is simply to add a glass of milk, because in each glass of milk, you are getting those eight grams of protein.
Protein is used by our bodies for everything  building muscle, renewing skin and hair, synthesizing enzymes and immune elements, even building DNA. In foods, protein can slow digestion, making us feel full and satisfied for longer, and helping with weight maintenance. But our bodies can only use so much protein at one time.
Some of us tend to eat very little protein at breakfast and lunch, and eat a large amount at dinner. Shifting some of that evening protein to earlier in the day can maximize our bodies ability to use protein.
The easiest way to accomplish this, without upending your whole eating pattern, is to add a glass of milk to breakfast and lunch and eat smaller portions of your protein-rich entree at dinner.
If you tend to graze all day rather than eat meals, include milk (cheese or yogurt) in your mini-meals and snacks.
An added benefit, you will likely close the gap on other key nutrients, such as calcium, vitamin D and potassium, nutrients that are often under-consumed.
With these simple changes, you may notice you feel more satisfied after meals and snacks, and your body will definitely be able to use the protein you've eaten more efficiently.

*Replace water with milk in soups for a creamier and more nutritious meal.
*Cook your morning oatmeal in milk instead of water for more protein, calcium + vitamin D.
*Make a milky treat like rice pudding. Simply bring 3/4 cup long-grain rice to a boil, drain, add 5 to 6 cups of milk, 1 cup of sugar, 1 split vanilla bean and a large pinch of salt and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. After an hour, add a cup more milk, allow it to absorb, and serve. Instant pudding from a box mix is even quicker and uses 2-4 cups of milk.
*Find more recipes using milk.

Lanka poised to increase South Asian regional trade
Sri Lanka has set out a series of plans to increase South Asian regional trade over the next few years. Among the main initiatives are to find new ways to break into the Indian market and to sign a Coastal Shipping Agreement with Bangladesh.
A World Bank report launched this week revealed Sri Lanka has the potential to more than double its exports to South Asia.
Increased intraregional trade will provide a greater variety of goods and services at cheaper prices for Sri Lankan consumers, better access to inputs for producers and exporters, increased investment, export diversification and growth, the report said.
Sri Lankas current exports to the South Asian region are US$ 1.2 billion, but the potential is nearly US$ 3 billion.
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said, a committee comprising leaders from top Sri Lankan enterprises who have succeeded in the Indian market has been set up to find ways to increase trade with India while the Coastal Shipping Agreement between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will be signed very soon after receiving Cabinet approval.
Minister Samarawickrama said, this will also permit third country port usage which means that Ports in the East Coast of India can be used under this agreement. He was speaking at the launch of A Glass Half Full: The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia report by World Bank on Monday.
He said, we have to work hard, we have to support our enterprises to seek out and exploit the opportunities. For this, already we have several initiatives underway.
The Market Access Support Program and the Enterprise Innovation Program being led by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is providing matching grants for Sri Lankan enterprises to become more competitive, by undertaking market studies, improving quality and compliance standards, deploying new technology, and developing new and innovative products and services. The Enterprise Sri Lanka concessionary loan schemes are helping new and existing entrepreneurs get access to cheaper capital in order to expand and modernize. The new Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy that went to Cabinet this week, and was in fact developed with technical support from the World Bank, will spur a whole new era of innovative businesses in our country and add a fresh growth impetus to our private sector, he said.

Heartbreaking account of  Hiroshima tragedy revisited
Let it not  happen again!
It is often said that history repeats itself; thus, the importance of history classes and education about the past. There are certain things, like wars, that we do not wish to see happen again in our world.
One such event was the first (and last to this day) dropping of atom bombs, during World War II on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the US sought to end the war with one devastating attack in return.
On August 6 and 9, 1945 America dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, The first was dropped on the city of Hiroshima on August 6 and the second on the city of Nagasaki on October 9 resulting in the death of over 129,000 Japanese nationals.
Not knowing the true extent of the damage that the nuclear bombs would cause, they were dropped. And since, books and memoirs and journals and history texts and more have been written, and photographs taken, and research done to educate people of its destructive power so that in this case, history will never repeat itself.
The Sinhala publication Hiroshimawe Kandulu (Tears of Hiroshima) authored by senior Journalist Chandana Wijekoon is another effort in that direction.
Wijekoon in this publication, a derivative work of an English book, tells the stories of 25 people in Hiroshima in the hours and weeks after the attack. Here he tries to capture a full spectrum of feeling  panic, grief, disgust, resilience, hope  often on the same page.
Hiroshimawe Kandulu is filled with evidence of humanity at its worst and best, with stories of generosity, grief and pain.
In Chapter three we could read the experience of 13-year-old Takeshi Tanaka, a student at Hiroshima Technical college. Tanaka says Everything was black, had vanished into the black dust, and was destroyed. Only the flames that were beginning to lick their way up had any colour. I didnt hear a sound but saw a bright light in the sky. I was unconscious for a bit of time but when woke up was covered in blood. From the dust that was like a fog, figures began to loom up, black, hairless, faceless. Their bodies too were covered in blood. They screamed with voices that were no longer human.
We see melted bodies, rivers filled with corpses, and rubble stretching into the distance. In one narrative we see how one student describes seeing her School auditorium filled with bodies.
Other eyewitnesses tell of the greasy, black rain that began to fall on Hiroshima shortly afterwards; how some even tasted it, washed the dust covering their bodies; unaware of its radioactive toxicity.
Hiroshimawe Kandulu is not a history lesson. It is a raw, very human account of the death, destruction and resilience that, all these decades later, we still witness around the world. According to Wijekoon the rise of Japan from such devastation could be an example to Sri Lanka as well which has suffered from a three-decade terror war. Wijekoons book is a good medium for Sinhala readers to become familiar with the experiences of victims of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
Wijekoon a member of the editorial staff of the Dinamina newspaper published by the Lake House says he derived inspiration from a recent visit to Japan and Hiroshima to write this book.
The book Hiroshimawe Kandulu (Tears of Hiroshima) authored by Wijekoon, will be launched today at 3.30 pm, at the Colombo City Hotels Monara Banquet Hall.

Human Elephant Conflict Management
Let's learn from past mistakes
Wildlife and Nature Protection Society is happy to announce that Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya will be presenting the October instalment of its monthly Lecture Series on October 18 at the Jasmine Hall BMICH starting at 6 pm.
The WNPS Public Lecture is open to all members and non-members. Free Entrance. 
Elephant habitats are declining and the frequency and severity of the HEC is increasing, calling for alternative approaches to HEC management. Studies undertaken in Sri Lanka have shown that translocation and confinement are not a viable management strategy and jeopardize the survival of Sri Lankas elephants, both within and outside the PAs and with no long term benefit for reducing HEC. This is largely because restricting elephants to DWC Protected Areas (PAs) reduce their current habitat to about 30 percent of what they use at present.
Most national parks are already at or even beyond carrying capacity and hold the maximum number of elephants they can support. Additionally, national parks are generally primary or mature forests providing only sub-optimal habitats for edge species, such as elephants. Over two thirds of elephants in Sri Lanka have home ranges that go beyond areas controlled by DWC. Research has shown that elephant drives that are conducted mainly in response to political and social pressures have failed to eliminate crop raiding elephants from the drive areas.
While herds tend to be driven, the crop raiding males often remain behind. Communities have confirmed that the remaining males become more aggressive and develop into a bigger threat to people after such drives. Construction of electric fences along the administrative boundaries of DWC PAs has failed to yield the expected outcome of HEC mitigation since DWC PAs are often surrounded by forest reserves which are sometimes better habitat for elephants than DWC PAs. Therefore, this results in fence breaking by elephants. Yet, we act as if we will never learn from our mistakes and continue with business as usual, while practical and implementable solutions to reduce HEC exists.
Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya will be presenting the October instalment of its monthly Lecture Series on October 18 at the Jasmine Hall BMICH starting at 6 pm.
Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya has a PhD in Environmental Sciences from Rutgers University, in New Jersey. He joined the World Bank and was a Lead Environmental Specialist for the South Asia Environment and Natural Resources Unit of the Bank.
He has lead Biodiversity and Wildlife Conservation Projects in South Asian countries, including a Regional Wildlife Project focusing on the conservation of flagship species such as the tiger, elephant, snow leopard and one-horned rhino in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. He has worked on environmental institutional development projects, strengthening the institutional capacity of the relevant statutory conservation organizations, including the Department of Wildlife Conservation in Sri Lanka.
On retirement from the World Bank, Dr. Pilapitiya was briefly the Director General, Department of Wildlife Conservation before resigning from that post on matters of principle. He is a Consultant to the World Bank for its conservation projects in the South Asian region, including its ESCAMP project in Sri Lanka.
He has personal research interests in elephant conservation and addressing the human-elephant conflict, and has been working on elephant social behavior in the Yala, Minneriya and Kaudulla National Parks and their surrounding landscapes.

Living a dream
When it comes to dreams no dream is unattainable for Dream Caravan! Dream Caravan is a band that is itself a dream realized. In the words of Lead Vocalist of Dream Caravan, Ryan Henderlin  We have found a great mix of our individuality to create something unique! They have a love for experimenting musically with each member bringing a unique strength to the table. Melodies speaks to Ryan Henderlin on this fantastic musical collaboration.
Ryan Henderlin, is a born and bred Peterite, with an affiliation towards Music, Dance and Theatre, who is involved in those areas on a personal and professional level as well.
I started my music from school which evolved into performing with groups outside of school. I was involved with a show choir called  Vocal Enigma Sri Lanka and in 2015 was crowned winner of MTVs Yes Superstar Season 03. Im involved with a Theatre production Company called Cue Theatre Sri Lanka and I am currently involved with Dream Caravan, said Henderlin.
Dream Caravan is a band that covers pop, rock, reggae, baila, alternative, blues, jazz and indie. The list goes on because the members of the band are gifted in their own way. They have learnt to merge their talents and give something special to the audience. To them music is a journey and Henderlin points out that a song to a twenty year old means something completely different to a fifty year old. Its all about the point in life you are in and music speaks to you accordingly.
All six in the band have completely different preferences and styles in music. Henderlin certainly sounds enigmatic when he points out that this could be a danger sign or a blessing! It depends on how you put it together! However along with their differences they also have their similarities. They all love experimenting with music, new ideas and techniques. This mix of personalities creates that magic necessary for the success of a band. The name came about when they were figuring out a name to call themselves. The name of course had to represent their love for experimenting musically! Right throughout they have always tried to be unique. This exploration of theirs sounded a bit like traveling in a Caravan, and so came the name Dream Caravan!
As much as I stick to the ideology of greatness isnt born, Its made, I believe the passion for music is in our blood. We all can learn to appreciate music as human beings, but the choice to pursue it in a professional level requires a dose of insanity or something unquantifiable from within. I like to think its the latter, stated Henderlin.
Personally for Henderlin his inspirations ranges from Bryan Adam to James Brown to Michael Jackson. One of his biggest inspirations would be Bruno Mars. Henderlin points out that the amount of skill and work Bruno Mars puts into his performances are just awe inspiring.
I love singing and dancing as well and Its something of Bruno Mars I try to follow and gather from. Its almost impossible to pick one line in a song that is my favorite and which appeals to me, but I like the line from the song by Lynyrd Skynyrd  And be a simple kind of man, Oh, be something you love and understand. It is from their song Simple Man, added Henderlin.
His message to aspiring young musicians revolves around consistency- Consistency along with the right attitude. It sounds simple but when you put it into action then comes the difficult part. Henderlin points out that it requires a major level of will power because when you start out, you may not have the support or push that you would hope for. You will have to get there by yourself. The right attitude will keep you grounded and keep you moving in the correct direction. The rest will unfold itself!
If you want to thrive in the music industry in any country the formula is roughly the same - Stay Humble, Remember your roots, be genuine and be smart. Henderlin very correctly asserts that like any industry there are pitfalls and there are wrong turns. The music industry in Sri Lanka, just like any other country is a continuously evolving one. With the changing times one needs to constantly keep adapting and keep changing ones game.
You need to learn what is new and happening in the music industry, new techniques and new technology and be courteous to everyone you meet. At the end of the day strive to be original. Thinking back there are many uncountable and unmentionable outstanding experiences with the band, both on stage and off. Its hard to mention just one. Best part is everyone around us, family, friends and fans alike are very much involved! But with good times and bad, we stuck together, made the best out of the situation and as Roshan says, whatever happens we Slam through, explained Henderlin
The truth is that the best is yet to come for all of us. Henderlin is of the opinion that there have been so many outstanding experiences. Each of the members have had various experiences on their separate platforms, but in terms of the band, usually every performance ends up being a great one because no matter where they perform, they enjoy themselves and in turn the audience responds accordingly. Having different personalities there are differences of opinion. They come from so many different backgrounds but that is their strength! Their diversity which allows them to put together something unseen before.
We are never on the same page, seeing the picture through different angles. The beauty of it is all of these differences have found a great musical synergy to deliver a truly genuine Dream Caravan experience to the listener. As individuals on a personal level we can never be more in sync, in the ways we like to spend our time together, to the crazy scenarios we put ourselves through, we stick through it together, less as just a band and more as a family. Apart from our usual performances and covers that we put out, There are some originals in the pipe line that people will be able to hear in the near future, so do follow us on social media to get first hand updates on what we are up to, on and off stage, summed up Henderlin.

Destruction of archaeological sites:
A majority done in the South - Wijeyadasa
There are serious allegations and news reports regarding the destruction of archaeological sites in the country and information has been circulating with the intention of instigating racial and religious tensions by certain unscrupulous elements, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
Making a Ministerial statement in Parliament yesterday presenting the data pertaining to the destruction of archaeological sites, under the Antiquities Act, from January 01, 2016 to July 2018, he said during that 2  year period 36 incidents of stealing of archaeological artefacts were reported, 75 reports of the destruction of archaeological sites, 515 cases in illegal excavations in search of archaeological artefacts and 51 other cases of violation of the Antiquities Act were reported totaling 677 such incidents.
Today, there is a hyped up theory being spread that the most number of destruction of archaeological sites is taking place in the North and East. However, the statistics indicate otherwise. The most number of offences have been reported from districts with a majority Buddhist Sinhala population.
In Anuradhapura, 178 such incidents of archaeological destruction were reported, Kurunegala 75, Monaragala 58, Badulla 41, Kandy 36, Matale 28, Polonnaruwa 28, Hambantota 26, Gampaha 23 and Ratnapura 23, he noted.
On the contrary, he said the least number of archaeological offences was reported in the North and Eastern provinces. Accordingly, one archaeology offence has been reported from Jaffna, Mannar and Killinochchi three each, Mulaitivu 5, Batticaloa 6, Ampara 20 and Trincomalee 26.
He noted that there are extremist elements in various areas who try to highlight certain isolated incidents and try to exaggerate them in order to create tensions between races and religions for ulterior motives.
The highest number of such archaeological offences was reported from Anuradhapura and Kurunegala clearly highlighting the fact that the media has been misled and in turn have been misleading the public, he said, adding that the people in these areas are living in harmony and there is a handful of persons belonging to the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim denominations who are unable to bear this peaceful coexistence and are trying to create racial and religious discord by spreading false information.
The Minister noted that the gravest offence of the above mentioned offences is the theft of archaeological artifacts.
While 36 such incidents have been reported, the highest number of 9 thefts have been reported from Kandy, 6 from Anuradhapura and 5 from Kegalle. Next it is the destruction of archaeological sites and of the 75 reported cases during this period the highest number has been from Anuradhapura 13, Kandy 11, Kurunegala 8 and six each in Gampaha and Matara. Hence, it is very clear that a sinister plan is underway to distort the facts and create false opinions about the North and East which is a clear threat to national reconciliation.
Further, referring to a headline in a prominent Sinhala newspaper, he said that it had reported that a group of students at the Vavuniya University were not allowed to keep their Buddha statues and they were suspended for violating their basic rights. Clarifying the incident the minister said; However, the headline clearly implied that the Buddhist students did not have the opportunity to even have a Buddha statue with them and practice their faith in the North and East. There are students representing all four religious denominations studying at the Vavuniya University.

Alleged receipt of funds by Minister:
Malik calls for CID probe
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema has asked the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to start a full scale investigation into any Cabinet Minister who has allegedly received a fund of Rs.150 million to be credited to his or her bank account.
Samarawickrama responding to the media reports that Rs. 150 milion had been received to be credited to his bank account and the Central Bank had frozen the funds, yesterday urged the CID to investigate this matter at its earliest and take action against any Cabinet Minister if such funds have been received.
He said that he had already written to the DIG of the Criminal Investigation Department regarding this matter.
He called on the Speaker to take necessary steps to prevent Members of Parliament being insulted and defamed through irresponsible media reporting.
If not, no decent person will want to enter Parliament, the Minister said.
Making a Ministerial statement, he said there was a sinister social media and electronic media effort by certain parties to tarnish his reputation and discredit him.
While I was in Germany about 10 days ago, I was made to understand that a Director of the Ceylon High Speed Railway Limited, a company who had sent a proposal to the Board of Investment (BOI) to produce and export high speed trains, had accused the State Minister and myself of requesting for a commission of US $ 25 million to have the project proposal approved. This is a totally false allegation. In fact, I have never met this party, nor have I spoken to them or even seen the colour of them, he said.
However, he did not want to delve into details of the process through which the BOI and the Single Window Investment Approval Committee approves the investments proposals submitted to the BOI.
The BOI officials have given a detailed description of how the proposals are evaluated and approved. At no stage do the ministers get involved in the approval process. However, I have requested for and received a report of this proposal from the BOI, he said tabling the said report.
Minister Samarawickrama noted that last week the same media institutions had published reports that Rs.150 million had been received to be credited to his bank account and the Central Bank had frozen the funds.
This is a totally false allegation. I have checked with the Central Bank and I am informed that no such funds had been received to be credited to any of the accounts of Cabinet Ministers, he added.
However, the Minister said that he had written to the DIG and CID to investigate this matter at this earliest and take necessary action against any Cabinet Minister if such funds have been received.
Expressing his dissatisfaction over certain news reports he asked, Is this the media freedom that we wanted This is nothing but freedom of the wild ass, the Minister said.

Siluni Walakuluarachchige is quicker than a calculator. Ten two digit sums are hurled at her. She takes only two seconds to add them up. Saathvika Natarajan takes on numbers with equal ease.
Nine year old Siluni Walakuluarachchige and Saathvika Natarajan have acquired a rare mastery over numbers thanks to the Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System (UCMAS) Sri Lanka. The two proved their mettle recently, managing first and second positions in two categories at the UCMAS Mental Arithmetic Championship held as a part of the Second Eurasian Womens Forum 2018 which was held in St Petersburg on September 19. Around 200 girls from across the world took part in the event. A new world record for the Longest Maths Relay Race among girls was also set at the Championship.
The Abacus method is more than Abacus. Coupled with whats called Mind Gym, it increases a childs span of attention, enables multi-tasking and activates creative thinking. It is about instilling and
UCMAS Country Coordinator and trainer Chithra Ilamanathan
boosting confidence at that early stage in life. Children start to realize that they can solve more complex problems easily, as compared to others in their age group and sometimes, much beyond their age group. Aimed at better right-and-left-brain coordination, it increases the power of concentration and awakens lateral thinking. It enables them to look at a mathematical problem in a different way and teaches them to look at all problems in a different way, giving them the foundation they need to be successful.
This is not the first time that the young lasses have been in the limelight. They have won many national and international accolades on their journey of calculations. Siluni is one of the youngest UCMAS graduates in the country, having obtained a Higher C in Malaysia last year. She also won first place in the Higher A category in the 21st Abacus and Mental Arithmetic and Listening Competition 2016 which was held at the Hamdan Sport Complex in Dubai in 2017. She bagged third place in the Intermediate B category in the UCMAS 20th International Competition in New Delhi. She won second place in the Basic category in the UCMAS National Competition in 2014 and was the champion in the Intermediate A in 2015 and the National Champion in the Higher A category in 2016. Siluni has won distinctions and credits at the UCMAS IGE International Grading Examinations and aced the Abacus Computation.
Every child has to start off the process in the basic course. There is no age limit but many children stop when they have completed the elementary or basic course. We have to keep 36 formulas in mind when we engage in this process, Siluni elaborated.
Siluni has completed her UCMAS basic course in two weeks. Her parents took her to the UCMAS head office in Sri Lanka which is in Wellawaththa when she was three and a half years old. This started the process of a long journey which brought her fame and fortune.
A premature baby who had been born in 26 weeks, Siluni showed signs of intelligence from an early age. When other children are either glued to the television or engaged in play, the young lass spent her free time reading books or occupied in creative activities. She has written quite a number of essays during her spare time which her parents later compiled into a book titled Tiny Gems.
Siluni, Saathvika and Sarmisda with the other contestants
Doing sums is like engaging in meditation. It soothes you. You can be in one position without getting bored. You do not feel anger or frustration. Therefore you are able to excel in your studies as well. I love mathematics and I am among the first few to complete a paper at our school examinations, the student of Colombo International School (CIS) said. Her next target is to reach the Grand Level in December 2019.
Similarly Saathvika too had made her mark and excelled in the numbers game. The grade five student of Asian International School said that the UCMAS Mental Arithmetic Championship was the fourth international competition she faced. She has won third place at the UCMAS 21st International Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Competition 2016.
I got to know about UCMAS through a neighbor and was keen to check it out. Once I joined I realized my flair for calculating sums. This became a passion for me and helped me excel in the sector, said Saathvika who vies to become a doctor in the future.
After winning first place
Speaking about the nature of the competition Saathvika noted that the girls were asked to solve 200 sums in eight minutes. The person who has solved the most number of sums during that period is named as the champion. Saathvika solved two digit sums in five rows in four seconds while Siluni had solved two digit sums in five rows in two seconds. Both are grateful to Chithra Ilamanathan, their trainer and UCMAS Country Coordinator for her guidance.
It is astonishing indeed to see these children visualise the problem and the route to the answer through mind and finger coordination. Even after graduating beyond the need for the Abacus, they feel the numbers in their hands.
Everybody thinks that Abacus is just for maths but it develops confidence, concentration and memory power. It is very benefitial for your future. Do not be afraid to move forward. Only you know your own potential and what you are capable of. Make use of your gifts and polish up your talents. That is the path to success, are Saathvikas words of wisdom to other youth.
Sarmisda Sivarama Sharma, another student of UCMAS Sri Lanka also took part in the UCMAS Mental Arithmetic Championship and clinched second place in her category.

Mihin Lanka first set up, then taken to Cabinet - Witness
A Cabinet Paper on the establishment of a government owned budget airline - Mihin Lanka, has been presented to Cabinet only after two months from its establishment in October, 2006, Treasurys Public Enterprises Department (DPE) Director Champa Balasooriya said yesterday.
According to the certificate issued by the Registrar of Companies, Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd. has been incorporated on October 27, 2006. But, even the first discussion to establish a government owned budget airline within the Cabinet had taken place on December 1, 2006.
Although, it was supposed to be a joint proposal between Finance and Planning and the Ports and Aviation Ministries, the Cabinet Memorandum had been presented only by then Ports and Aviation Minister on December 20, 2006.
Balasooriya made these revelations before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Malpractices of Sri Lankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Catering, and Mihin Lanka.
This Cabinet paper sought approval for several proposals including the ratification of the decision on formation of this budget airline which had already been established and also the budgetary allocation of Rs. 500 million from the Budget 2007. As this paper was presented subsequent to the Budget 2007, this had not been mentioned in the Budget 2007. However, all these decisions have been approved by the then Cabinet of Ministers.
The witness also revealed that several capital infusions had been taken place from 2007  2009 for Mihin Lanka including the aforesaid Rs. 500 million. The first tranche of Rs. 250 million of this amount had been made in March 2007 as a supplementary allocation from the budget. According to the documentary evidences available, this amount had been transferred to the Mihin Lanka Company via the Presidential Secretariat. The witness said that she did not know as to why it was given to the Presidents Secretariats name. The rest of the amount had been given to the Mihin Lanka Company from the Bank of Ceylon (BoC) as a loan on a bank guarantee issued. For the first tranche received, the company had issued 2.5 million shares to the treasury in November, 2007.
It also came to light that the company had issued three million preferential shares to Lankaputhra Development Bank in June 2007 before shares are given to the General Treasury. The witness told that she couldnt find any documentary evidence to prove if the prior approval had been given to grant these shares to a different entity by the Treasury Secretary, who is also the main shareholder of the company.
The next budgetary allocation of Rs. 500 million for the company was made through the National Budget 2008. The Treasury had released this amount in March, 2008 as per a request by Sajin de Vass Gunawardena, then CEO of the Company. From the Budget 2009, another amount of Rs. 6 Billion was allocated for the Mihin Lanka Company through the line ministry, Ministry of Ports and Telecommunication. According to Balasooriya, only Rs. 2.5 million out of this amount was released to the company in 2009.
The witness further revealed that the Mihin Lanka Company was failed to submit performance reports even for the first six months of the year 2007. She said that the DPE as the authority to supervise the government owned entities, by its DG M.G. Dayaratne on June 06, 2007 sent a letter to then CEO of Mihin Lanka, Gunawardena requesting documents on performance. She said another letter on the same topic was next sent to the Chairman of the company in October same year and the third letter was sent to the Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Civil Aviation and copied it to then Secretary to the President and the Chairman of the Company Dr. Samaratunge in November. But, none of these requests were answered and no report was sent even by November 2007, she said. She said that the company had not presented even the Annual Reports of the Company to her department.
Balasooriya further revealed that that the Mihin Lanka had not earned any profit by 2009. It also had not a proper business plan instead of several business plans that were presented time to time. However, a letter from the Secretary to the Treasury addressed to the Chairman of the Company in May 2009 highlighted the importance of following a proper business plan and pointed out the inefficiency of the company, she said.
The commission will inquire the same witness into the loans that the company due to settle today.

Motha introduces double-layered pudding mix to local market
Motha Confectionary Works (Pvt) Ltd., one of Sri Lankas leading producer of dessert and beverage mixes and baking ingredients has introduced a novel range to their pudding mixes portfolio in the form of the Motha Double-Layered Pudding Mixes.
The mixes are available in two flavour combinations; Almond Chocolate and Mint Chocolate.
Following a timely addition of innovative creativity to their list of desserts as well as through extensive research and surveys that led to the need to introduce the layered dessert concept for Sri Lankans, Motha decided to include these two products and further expand their product portfolio.
Lending his insight about the initial strategy behind this new product range, Motha Confectionary Works, Managing Director and CEO, Nihal Wijeratne said, Following market research, surveys and positive feedback that were subsequently accumulated, we moved forward to bring to life this novel idea.
This double-layered pudding mix concept is probably the only one of its type to be found in the country to date.
Speaking about the new product launch, Motha Confectionary Works, Director/General Manager, Adrian Fonseka stated, Motha has over the years elevated its brand status as a household name amongst Sri Lankans from every walk of life and with the aim of maintaining our market stance whilst adding novelty to our products, we worked on introducing the double-layered pudding mix, which is a new concept to this portfolio of dessert mixes.
With guaranteed offerings of high-quality, convenience and affordability into their products, Motha is tied up with Sri Lankan standards and manufacturing entities that are on par with global standards.
With the imposition of import restrictions by the then government, Julius Motha, the current Chairman, commenced local manufacturing in 1960 and this family owned business has grown to be a leading heritage brand having won the confidence of over three generations. Motha products are currently being exported to countries such as the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Maldives, India and the Middle East.

Moves to expand forest cover
The government plans to plant 20 million trees and increase the forest cover from 27 percent to 32 percent within the next three years, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday.
He said the first tree planting campaign to achieve this target commenced from Mannar District and it will be expanded to other districts soon.
As Sri Lanka lacks trees to produce high-quality timber, we have to spend a large amount of money to import them. We have spent Rs. 13 billion in 2016 on the import of timber and timber furniture. Plans are afoot to plant one million saplings in home gardens from which we would be able to produce high-quality timber, he said.
Libraries and holiday resorts will be built in forests to educate the public on the value of forests, allowing people to study forest conservation as well.

Mujibur to take legal action against JO accusers
UNP Colombo District Parliamentarian Mujiber Rahuman yesterday said he will take legal action against those who damaged his reputation by accusing him of distributing poisonous milk packets to the participants of the Joint Opposition janabalaya protest .
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, MP Rahuman said that the Government Analyst has already confirmed that the milk packets provided to the Joint Opposition protesters were not contaminated. By spreading this type of false information, the corrupt politicians of the previous regime attempted to create a Sinhala-Muslim conflict in order to cover up the utter failure of their Jana Balaya Kolambata campaign and used it as a ruse to cover their heads in shame.
I have lodged two Police complaints and I earnestly request from the IGP to investigate these complaints without any delay and take action against the culprits, Rahuman added.

NATION-BUILDING THROUGH RECONCILIATION
National Reconciliation is again a matter of concern to those of the international community who sincerely wish to see Sri Lanka progress in unity and harmony so that we become adult partner in bringing about a new world into being.
Our birth into this world initiates us to see, hear, touch, judge, understand, know and encounter the material world and of human beings and live. Some are also inspired, by a vision of life beyond this world, to live a life dedicated to the common good and to a mission of human spiritual union.
All of us look for coherence, meaning and rationality in life and believe what we are told. As Julius Caesar said, Homines quod volunt credunt, Men believe what they want to believe. What human beings choose to believe may be rational or irrational, mythical, biased or even superstitious hearsay. But we human by nature, meant to be truthful and rational are driven to decipher the meaning and purpose of life in community and in relationship with others. These relationships intended to be life enhancing for all are naturally grounded on equality of human dignity, mutual understanding and love.
Mature minds and hearts
Reconciliation is a process that continually upkeeps and resolves all that needs mending and renewing in human affairs. Today it should embrace all the ethnic, religious and language communities of people of this country who have in her a historical and cultural identity to call their own. Each community is appreciative of the elements that have built up their identity which have also enriched them.
If those treasures of thought and assets of knowledge, culture, art, music, crafts and the various scientific achievements and economic gains could be shared justly with others, all would get mutually enriched and progress towards a comprehension of one anothers heritage. It could lead to a sober way of resolving conflicts and reaching out to a humane level of caring fellowship and spiritual refinement. In keeping with our human nature, to live humanly, all of us together need to deepen our understanding and mature the capacities of our minds and hearts, considering every human life very precious and ignoring no one.
Rivalries that have led to conflicts and bloodshed, war, conquest and despotic rule have been there over the centuries. Yet the identities and differences among people have not been erased but remained long-lasting with also actual patterns and ways of life, culture and traditions particular to human communities enduring over centuries.
Conflicts that dehumanize
Today, communities of human beings find it highly unacceptable and unsatisfactory for any identifiable cohesive group of human beings or any nation to be subject to the arbitrary will, conquest and domination of another. Production of armaments intended to be used against others, turn out to be heinous crimes against humanity.
Human communities are realizing that with right communication, constructive cooperation and collaboration in all spheres of useful human activity, all stand to gain. Constructive cooperation in a spirit of reconciliation is a far better and nobler substitute to destructive rivalry, contentious clashes and annihilating war. The varied energies and powers of individual human beings as well as that of whole communities and nations engaging in all manner of productive work when channeled to objectives beneficial to human beings could raise all to uplifting levels of humanness and forge healthy relationships.
Wherever throughout history, one community has overpowered another, there has almost always occurred deception, cheating, stealing, looting, and outmaneuvering, injury, killing and murder, rape and fornication, drunkenness, licentiousness, paedophilia and all manner of vice, crime and immorality. They dehumanize human beings and leave whole nations in despair and devastation. Internecine destruction and dehumanizing warring among nations of the world have been going on for far too long.
Human nature rises to relate
Sri Lanka has been tarnished and degraded on and off since Independence. Thousands of men, women and children have suffered in racial violence and conflagrations of guerilla warfare. They continue to bear the agony of their unhealed physical wounds and suffer intense anguish in their hearts and minds.
Our society today is a plural one with a pronounced presence of different communities. The home upbringing of the young needs to take into account this plurality so that all, while growing to be themselves, will also blend adequately with others. The education systems flawed aspects of intellectual, social, ethical, moral and spiritual development too should be set right to harmonize with and contribute to enrich a multi-cultural world. Consequently, no one will get withdrawn, isolated on single issues and cocooned in separate existences. Moral and spiritual values in students will not stagnate introverted in their diverse communities. Those affected with estranged, suspicious and distrustful attitudes towards fellow citizens should be helped to outgrow them.
The passage to reconciliation is a progressive challenging journey through a narrow gate on a craggy, difficult trail paved with sharp rocks of long absorbed prejudice, bigotry, fanaticism and misguided extremism. Many have inherited this distorted legacy of toxic links associated with race, religion, language, culture and social interaction to such an extent that they cannot tolerate and coexist with those who are not of their tribe and tradition.
While sharing a common homeland they continue to remain alienated from the genuine dignity and honour of their race, religion, language, culture and tradition. Although physically occupying the same land and living near one another individually and as communities, they remain distant in mind and spirit from their fellow citizens. It is a sad state of affairs perpetuated by ignorance, irrationality and inhumanity. It is evidently incongruous for a people, who have attained a high rate of literacy and progressed through religion, science and socio-political progress, to lack a levelheaded and sensible vision.
When social and moral values are not upheld together, human beings could be driven by excessive emotions as well as unjust intentions that make human behavior malicious, irrational, intemperate and even violent. Exacerbated, dangerous patterns of conduct, unfair public administration, violent invasion and irrational intimidation and overawing of others cause disorientation and estrangement in relationships, social disruption and even social anarchy. The ways revenues are collected - are they just and fair by the ordinary citizens - and how wisely the peoples taxes are spent could affect social order and relationships. It is the Governments responsibility to plan the social order equitably as the imbalances in various sectors and spheres of life could adversely affect interactions, justice, fairness and reconciliation.
Spiritually stronger, wiser
Human nature inclines to what matters most in life and that is the will to live and to relate to fellow human beings. Everyone should have the opportunity to live, to humanly grow and mature on the level ground of equal human dignity, autonomy, freedom, justice, honour and mutual respect. Society should be organised to accord such opportunity to all.
The time has come for us all to completely abandon violence, fighting, aggression and warring and change over to a more civilized, new and humane way of life worthy of human beings. We should strive to accept as well as go above our various differences; we should begin to meet with and speak with, relate and understand one another and become friends and neighbours who feel for one another. Cultivating harmonious fraternal feelings and attitudes of solidarity should become a shared spiritual adventure, now.
We should pass on this precious heritage to our younger generations and teach them how to value and appreciate our particular identities and yet transcend them for a higher good and be united with others in order to build our Nation together as members of one national family.
Just to live in tolerance and peace, all of us will need to cultivate a robust resilience and a new capacity to bear a diversity of minor burdens and even submit to a common discipline for the sake of the country as a whole to elevate her rather than cause pain and misery to some of our fellow countrymen.
All of us need to learn lessons of firm non-violence and patient forbearance. We need to grow to be more compassionate, forgiving, loving, spiritually stronger and wiser, aware that promoting reconciliation is indeed building the nation. All of us Sri Lankans individually and collectively should recover anew a genuine sense of humanness and fraternity. By a New Constitution we could lay the bases to regain it. Revival of genuine religion could promote it. Then a new and socially integrated society will begin to emerge in our lifetime.
Governments high responsibility
The mission of reconciliation cannot be confined to a single ministry with that designation. Every minister and ministry will have its particular impact on serving all the people and therefore on some aspect of the process of reconciliation and its creative evolution.
Therefore, a serious cognizance of all the ministers and deputy ministers and chief administrators of the ministries is called for so that without any default on their part they may attend to their due obligations to the citizens and consolidate solidarity among the people.
The Ministries of Education and Public Administration should be directly influencing the thinking and the attitudes of students, teachers, government servants and the general public; they could mould the ways of harmonious relationships that build reconciliation and understanding among the younger generation and among the people and give vibrant purpose and meaning to peoples lives. However widespread bribery and corruption in the public service remains a destructive evil that undermines reconciliation. It has to be noted that many from peons, drivers, accountants, transport officers to holders of very high responsibility in government service are bribe takers; their pervasive corruption impedes service to the people and impairs justice and reconciliation among them.
Those who are not sympathetic towards reconciliation also need to be contacted, patiently persuaded and sensibly converted to reconciliation. In a situation where, irresponsibility, prejudice, suspicion, jealousy and partiality prevails social confusion continues. All fair minded people stand to lose not knowing where they are in their relations with others. A change of heart for life-saving self-preservation, to the advantage and benefit of all would be effected only by a pure spiritual impulse. Leaders, led by religious leaders need to focus the people and guide them towards achievable relationships and standards of social conduct to create a revitalized national community buoyant with abundant and unblemished human coexistence.
Faithful to reconciliation
The members of the Government and all Parliamentarians as civic leaders should personally commit themselves unambiguously to the mission of reconciliation and uphold social justice, law and order without prioritizing vote catching schemes. Making speeches to impress the people and issuing statements contradicting one another are evasive of decisive just action. Refraining from divisive actions, they should faithfully implement policies and projects relevant to reconciliation, prevent the people being set against one another, protect the people from every corrupt individual in the government services, state corporations and armed forces who abuse their power and authority, remove structures of injustice and liberate the country, now, to shield Sri Lanka from sliding from one national calamity to another.
While striving to create a united interconnected Nation let us by example, bring genuine humanness, inspiration and the light of the divine into the lives of other peoples in horizons beyond our shores. Thus when an ongoing process of reconciliation becomes an elan vital of our national life, we shall make our valid contribution to transform the world into a better habitation for all.

National Esports team competes with worlds best at 18th Asian Games
This years Asian Games saw history being made as Electronic Sports (Esports) were included as a demonstration sport at the event for the first time in history. Electronic Sports, the worlds fastest growing sport today, is the competitive play of video games. Much like traditional sports, Electronic Sports are structured around athletes, either solo or coming together to form teams competing in tournaments, leagues and championships.
The Sri Lanka Esports Association with the support of strategic partner Gamer.LK, along with the Sports Ministry and the National Olympic Committee sent a contingent of Sri Lankas best Esports athletes across 5 titles to compete at the games. The titles included in this years games were League of Legends, Hearthstone, Pro Evolution Soccer, Starcraft 2 and Clash Royale.
Sri Lankas Esports athletes taking part in the respective eSports titles were as follows: LEAGUE OF LEGENDS: Akthar Hafeez, Shalitha Chandrarathna, Ashik Saleeth, Achintha Konara, Hilal Jismy, Abith Latiff. HEARTHSTONE: Ramesh Uthayakumar. PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER (PES): Mufeed Miskin, Shihab Rizan. STARCRAFT 2: Amruth Alfred. and CLASH ROYALE: Joel Joung.
Sri Lanka faced a South Asian regional qualifier, where the top country from each game would qualify to take part in the main event in Jakarta, Indonesia in August. PES, Hearthstone and Starcraft two qualifiers were played online, while League of Legends and Clash Royale were played in Vietnam and Hong Kong respectively. Out of the 5 titles, Amruth Alfred playing Starcraft 2 beat the rest of South Asia to qualify for the main event in Indonesia, where he would go on to face the best Starcraft 2 players in the world. Sri Lanka didnt qualify for the other 4 titles. Amruth Alfred Coming from Peradeniya, Kandy, is an alumnus of Gateway College Kandy, and is currently following an MPhil in Astrophysics at the University of Hong Kong where he completed his BSc in Physics and Astronomy with Second Upper Honours.
I really like 1 v 1 games, because it just depends on you. Your skill determines if you win or lose. Amruth, with previous competitive experience in Call of Duty, Dota 2 and Overwatch, picked up Starcraft 2 and steadily progressed with the game by watching pro twitch streams. Amruth climbed to the top of the Sri Lankan Starcraft 2 leader board within 2 months of picking up the game.
Winning 2 weekend tournaments, he soon caught the attention of Gamer.LK which led to his selection as national representative for Starcraft 2. Amruth came out in first place in South Asia with a clean sweep of 2-0 beating the best from both Pakistan and Maldives. Amruth would go on to not only represent Sri Lanka, but South Asia as the regional winner.
The main event consisted of the best Starcraft 2 players in the world, including South Koreas Maru who was enjoying #1 ranking worldwide. Amruth faced off against Taiwans Nice, losing to him 3-0 but gaining invaluable experience and drive for competition. Nice went on to win Silver, behind Koreas Maru who won gold - an experience of a lifetime for Amruth and just the beginning to a whole new Esports journey.
Never expected that Id represent Sri Lanka as its first official Esports athlete and represent the South Asian region as well. It was just great to see Esports being recognised by the Olympic Council of Asia. Didnt think wed come this far, this fast. Was an absolute honour and privilege to be surrounded by gold medal athletes! I even managed to meet the God of Starcraft 2, Maru! As for future plans and being Sri Lankas first Esports athlete, Amruth plans to keep playing Starcraft 2 as preparation for the next Asian Games and play more competitive DotA 2 and Overwatch. He also intends on trying out League of Legends as the title was present at the Asian Games.
The national Esports team for the 18 th Asian Games was sponsored by Dialog Gaming. Dialog Axiata
PLC, Sri Lankas first connectivity provider to launch a mobile gaming platform, empowers the local pro-gaming community by powering cyber athletes who represented Sri Lanka in the Asian Games 2018. Recognising the potential and growth for cyber athletes in the country, Dialog continues to spearhead Esports and supports the community to challenge global gamers on international platforms.
Commenting on Dialogs vision to power Esports in Sri Lanka Supun Jayasinghe (Product Manager- Gaming Services), Dialog Axiata PLC said,
Dialog Gamings vision is to create the No.1 gaming experience and propel the future of Esports in the country. As the main sponsor of the teams, we hope to provide opportunity for talent within the country. He added, Dialog Gaming currently connects Sri Lankans to the largest mobile gaming platform, and we are certain the future of Esports will be a cyber athlete receiving an equivalent recognition to that of an athlete.
Sri Lanka has been a member of the International Esports Federation (IESF) who recently announced that they are in discussion with the International Olympic Committee regarding the introduction of Esports as a title at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.
The IESF says its aim is to work consistently to promote Esport as a true sport beyond language, race and cultural barriers.

OMP recommendations, a timely requirement
The challenges faced by the OMP are many and need to be balanced with the urgency of the needs of families of victims enduring years of physical and mental suffering. The OMP recognises the multiple needs and positions of various families and the importance of securing their trust. - The OMP suggests recommendations after it had several consultations with the affected people and communities. The OMP had six public consultations within the six months. The OMP, which travels across the country to get to know the needs of the people, has reached the first step of the success by correctly identifying the pressing needs of the affected people, which is a crucial part of any transitional justice mechanism.
We, Sri Lankans have passed a dark part of our history. However, we are fortunate to have made a new change in 2015 and move from the dark past. We have been able to alleviate the fears of white vans and unlawful arrests. However, still we can hear sundry voices highlighting existing problems and incurable pain and trauma. We cannot be deaf to those agonizing voices.
As Sri Lankans, as the children of one mother, we all have a moral duty to ease the existing problems and heal the wounds. Thus, the recommendations set out in the interim report of the Office of Missing Persons, submitted to the President and Prime Minister on September 5, can be the good initiatives to achieve the reconciliation and heal the wounded communities.
The lack of communications and awareness establish the basement for each and every problem. When we hear something, we need to spend few minutes of our valuable time to realize what it is, to analyze whether it is good or not. Now, it is the time to ask from ourselves what OMP has recommended; why the recommendations are important; why it should be considered in the current context.
Amendment of PTA
OMP proposed the legal amendments including the amendment of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). PTA is a draconian Act which had been used as a tool to stage human rights violations in the past. It was enacted as a temporary legislation in 1979 and made permanent in 1982. The PTA was enacted to regulate the emergency situations, but unfortunately PTA fails to comply with International Human Rights Standards.
PTA facilitates arbitrary arrest, detention without charge for up to 18 months without a judicial and torture. Under the ordinary criminal law, confession made by the suspect cannot be considered as an evidence against him. However, PTA allows the confessions made to the police officers above the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) to be used as an evidence against the suspect. The confession is not admissible only on the ground of involuntary nature of the confession. However, under the PTA, the burden of proof vests on Accused, that he should prove the confession was made involuntarily. The arbitrary and unchecked detention powers and the admissibility of the confession contravene the international human rights standards and the legal obligations of Sri Lanka.
The provisions of the PTA contradict with Article 12 and 13 of the Constitution, the Supreme Law of the country. In addition, the PTA disregards the provisions of the international conventions such as International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which are ratified by Sri Lanka.
Good governance, heard the voices of the aggrieved people and the recommendations made by several local and international institutions including the OMP, has decided to repeal the draconian PTA and replace it with a Counter Terrorism Act which complies with the international human rights standards. Though, there are few concerns raised regarding the released draft on Counter Terrorism Act, space is there to make amendments to the Bill and make it compliant with human rights standards. As citizens of Sri Lanka, it is our duty to put forward our suggestions and inputs on the initiatives of the government.
A debt relief programme
Identifying accurately, the OMP suggests to have a debt relief programme prioritizing the families of the disappeared persons. Baby Nona, an old mother of this country lost all three of her sons, the breadwinners within a night. What she would have done for the basic needs following the disappearances There was no body to give a hand to her. She was suffering throughout her life. Baby Nona is just one example of many. What other option remains for such helpless single mothers apart from debt, which subsequently destroys their lives They are compelled to apply for debts from microfinance as they have lost all their assets, livelihood opportunities and the breadwinners during the course of insurgencies and war.
Women who have obtained microfinance and are unable to pay the monthly installments have been subject to sexual harassments by the loan officers. Sometimes they had to sell their kidney or commit suicide as they do not have other options.
It can be noted that the target group of the microfinance lenders is the poor, war affected women. We cant let our valuable women die or sell their kidney or be subjected to sexual harassments.
The State is obliged to give them relief as it is responsible for their loss. Therefore, the recommendation made by the OMP to introduce a debt relief programme which gives priority to the families of the missing is a timely requirement in Sri Lanka. We, as citizens of Sri Lanka will support the government to save our mothers from the debt trap.

Over 40 dead in Kenya bus accident
KENYA: More than 40 people have been killed in a bus accident in western Kenya early Wednesday, police said.
Reports reaching me are that more than 40 people died on the spot but it could be more because the roof of the bus was ripped off, Rift Valley Provincial Traffic Officer Zero Arome told AFP.
Another traffic police officer who spoke from the scene, in western Kericho county, placed the number at 42.
We have 42 people dead, but we are still at the scene, he said.
According to police, the bus was travelling from Nairobi to the western town of Kakamega and was carrying 52 passengers.
The Kenyan Red Cross wrote on Twitter that the bus had overturned. However more details on the cause of the accident were not immediately available.
Official statistics show that around 3,000 people die annually in road accidents in Kenya, but the World Health Organization estimates the figure could be as high as 12,000.
In December 2017, 36 people died in a head-on collision between a bus and a lorry.
In 2016 more than 40 people died when an out-of-control fuel tanker ploughed into vehicles and then exploded on a busy stretch of highway. - AFP

Implementation of laws on accessibility:
Perera re-agitates invocation of FR petition
Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera, the Chief Executive of Idiriya organisation, has re-ignited a public interest litigation Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court.
Supported by an affidavit and testimonials from two eminent medical doctors, he has urged for the implementation of the laws on accessibility regarding new buildings without further delay.
Dr. Perera said the Social Services Ministry, on October 17, 2006, has promulgated a comprehensive and detailed set of regulations approved unanimously by Parliament, stipulating the design, space requirements and safety measures in which the parts identified in the access regulations of new buildings, shall be constructed.
Since 2011, it has been witnessed that the proliferation of public buildings and an estimated 20 percent of Sri Lankas population  the largest minority group of citizens - is with restricted ability.
He said despite renewed attempts over 12 years and granting of three extensions of the deadline, the implementation of the accessibility regulations and the order by the Supreme Court has been poor. Appearing voluntarily on a wheelchair, he pursued this application since 2009.
This case was taken up on a number of occasions. All respondents were given enough time to file their views, objections, and affidavits, then discussed and argued over a month. Later, the court made an order on April 27, 2011.
The petitioner states that in the face of non-compliance of the accessibility regulations even after 12 years and also after an order of the apex court, an increasing number of people have become physically inactive, excluded from meaningful participation in the economic and social life, and pushing them towards poverty with the loss of productive opportunities, potentially crippling their lives.
It has thus become incumbent on the petitioner to re-agitate the invocation of the Fundamental Rights petition, the petitioner states.
Dr. Perera, a qualified professional with over 12 years of senior managerial experience, was left instantly paralysed waist down for life in 1992, by a falling roadside tree.
He has undergone formal training in the UK in the art of designing built environments accessible for all. Since 1999, he has pioneered the campaign for Accessible Sri Lanka for All through the design of built environments.

Politics, a game of numbers
The political grapevine is abuzz once more with talk of changes in the National Unity government, brought about by a series of discussions between the leaders of mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its breakaway faction, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
That there have been differences of opinion between the two partners in the government, the SLFP and the United National Party (UNP) is no secret. That their two leaders, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe do not see eye to eye on some issues is also self-evident. This is what the SLPP and its parliamentary group, the Joint Opposition (JO) has been focusing on.
Differences over key appointments have contributed to the strained relations between the UNP and the mainstream SLFP. For instance, when a Deputy Inspector General of Police was implicated in an alleged plot to assassinate the President and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, sections of the SLFP wanted Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundera removed from office.
This however, is easier said than done. The IGP cannot be summarily dismissed unless he resigns and Jayasundera showed no inclination to do so. The SLFP faction complains that Jayasundera is favouring the UNP. This is probably why bribery allegations against Jayasundera, dating back to 2006, suddenly surfaced. The UNP meanwhile maintains that action could be taken against the accused DIG or even IGP only when charges against them have been properly investigated.
Another conflict that appears to be looming is the appointment of a successor to Chief Justice Priyasath Dep who retires this week. It has been reported that the UNP faction prefers the elevation of Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya to head the highest court while President Sirisena has indicated he would nominate sitting Supreme Court Justice Eva Wanasundera.

Legal and political circles
Again, the appointment process is complicated. While President Sirisena may make a nomination for the position of Chief Justice, it is subject to approval by the Constitutional Council. The Council itself is in a state of flux at present with several existing vacancies. Therefore, legal and political circles are eagerly observing developments in this regard.
It is against such a backdrop of heightened tensions between the UNP and the mainstream SLFP that the JO is seeking to be opportunistic. Given the SLFPs lacklustre performance at the local government elections earlier this year, some SLFP parliamentarians loyal to President Sirisena are also backing moves to unite the two factions of the party, if only to secure their political futures.
The thrust of their strategy, conceived with the active participation of stalwarts such as S. B. Dissanayake is to push for a SLFP-JO coalition, instead of the current SLFP-UNP alliance. While this is indeed a better fit in terms of political ideology, there are many hurdles that need to be overcome before such an objective can become a reality.
The professed claim of those agitating for a SLFP-JO coalition is that they need to intervene to offer relief to Sri Lankans in the face of the spiralling cost of living and a nosediving rupee, but few are fooled by such lofty ideals. The aim is to create an ideal environment from which national elections in 2020 could be contested as a single political alliance opposing the UNP.
The proposed regime change envisaged by S. B. Dissanayake and likeminded others is one where Mahinda Rajapaksa is installed as Prime Minister with the formation of a SLFP-JO government. Of course, in the unlikely event that this would eventuate, there would be no need for a separate SLPP, as it could return to the fold and coalesce with the parent party, the SLFP, in much the same way as the Democratic United National Front morphed with the UNP after President Ranasinghe Premadasas assassination.

Presidential election
Current discussions however focus on a coalition until the election on the premise that the SLFP and the SLPP will contest general elections separately. However, this would be a meaningless exercise and would only lend an advantage to the UNP. The real issue at stake though is not the general election but the presidential elections which are due earlier than the general elections.
For President Sirisena to acquiesce to any kind of arrangement with the SLPP, the latter would have to agree to support the President for a second term of office, arguably in return for Mahinda Rajapaksa being his Prime Ministerial nominee.
President Sirisena has run into difficulties with his more liberal minded Premier Wickremesinghe and how he would govern in tandem with Rajapaksa, who has a more authoritarian approach to power is a significant question. Similarly, whether Rajapaksa would want to be Prime Minister under a President who, under the terms of the Constitution, still wields considerable power is also worthy of discussion.
Such potential personality clashes aside, the other major issue is whether any plan that is devised by those brokering a rapprochement between the two factions, have the numbers to pull it off. All the groups of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, namely, the Sirisena faction, the Rajapaksa faction and the so-called rebel group who voted for a vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe together command only 95 seats in Parliament. Therein lies a major obstacle.
For Parliament to install a SLFP-JO government and appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, it would need the support of at least a simple majority in the House, or 113 seats. With only 95 MPs in its own ranks, there is a shortfall of 18 MPs. It is also extremely unlikely that either the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (6 seats in Parliament) or the Tamil National Alliance (16 seats) will support this move. Thus, the success of the plan depends entirely on defections from the UNP itself.
It will be recalled that, in the lead up to the motion of no-confidence which was also sponsored by the same individuals now promoting a SLFP-JO alliance, there was an expectation that it would receive the support of disgruntled UNPers. That never materialised and not a single UNPer voted against the Prime Minister. In the end, it cost President Sirisena dearly as it was untenable for those SLFPers who voted for the motion to remain in government and many of them left Cabinet rank reluctantly.
It must also be noted that the motion of no-confidence targeted Prime Minister Wickremesinghe whereas the current moves threaten the power bases of all UNPers. Therefore, there is no reason for UNP parliamentarians, even for those with issues with the partys leadership, to forego sitting in government and join an exercise, the outcome of which is at best uncertain.
In the end, politics is a game of numbers and in this instance, the UNP does have the numbers to trump moves by the opposition to oust it from government, unless there is a mass scale defection from the party for which there is no reason at this stage. Publicly, the UNP has been buoyant with Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa openly declaring that he does not expect President Sirisena to join hands with the authoritarian forces he helped oust in 2015.
Matters will come to a head at the vote on the Budget next month. It provides the perfect opportunity for both the JO and the UNP test their support in Parliament and prevailing opinion in political circles is that the JO and the SLPP would be better off focusing on the next national elections instead of being in an indecent hurry to grab power before the polls are held.

Prime Minister tells Parliament: FUEL PRICE HIKE INEVITABLE
The increase of oil prices is inevitable in the current global context despite what the price formula is, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister was responding to a question by JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake who demanded to know the oil price formula.
The PM in response said that he does not have the price formula and that it must be requested from Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Whatever the methodology or the price formula is, the impact of the highly volatile global situation will be felt. If the US imposes economic sanctions on Iran in November the global crisis will deepen. World oil consumption usually increases from November to April because of the winter season. Some even predict that the price of a crude oil barrel which is at USD 80 could rise to even USD 90. The other issue is the strengthening of the US dollar. As a result, the currencies of many developing countries have depreciated. As a Government we are ready to deal with these twin crises while giving the necessary relief to the people, the PM explained.
The Prime Minister also stressed that the oil price formula has received due Cabinet approval.
The new methodology received Cabinet approval on May 9 and it was introduced from May 11. The Cabinet appointed a committee of officials on July 10 to make necessary revisions to the oil prices as per the price formula, he said.
India revises the oil prices daily and some countries revise the oil prices weekly. We do not have the technical expertise to make daily adjustment to the oil prices. Hence, we do so every month. Until recently, the oil price revisions were administrative decisions of the Government, but in 2015 we proposed to go by the world market prices, and we gave that benefit to the people by reducing the prices. I can only explain the policy decisions.
You have to sort out any technical matters with Minister Samaraweera, the Prime Minister added.
The Premier also said that the US-China trade war could also make a significant impact on Sri Lanka.
The world oil market prices are dependent on the demand for oil by these two countries, he remarked.
The Prime Minister, responding to a question by MP Dissanayake on reducing import duty on oil, said it would not help ease the prevailing crisis.
All countries impose tax on oil imports and it is a vital source of income for the Government. Removing tax will not solve the problem we are facing, he noted.
MP Dissanayake pointed out that Minister Samaraweera did not table the price formula in Parliament despite the repeated requests. He said the Finance and Mass Media Ministry has refused to give out the oil price formula even under the application he filed under the Right to Information Act.
You increase the oil prices on the 10th of each month citing a price formula which nobody is aware of. This is unfair by the consumers, he complained.
Meanwhile the Prime Minister replying to UNP MP S M Marrikar said the measures taken by the Government to suspend the vehicle permit of state officials as a means of curtailing imports would have to be continued till the current pressures on the exchange rate eases. The MP requested to continue to offer the vehicle permit to the state officials who use it for the first time.
[Petrol, Super Diesel up]
Prices of petrol Octane 92, 95 and Super Diesel were revised as scheduled from midnight yesterday.
The Fuel Pricing Formula Committee which met yesterday decided to increase Octane 92 to Rs 155 from Rs.149, Octane 95 to Rs.169 from Rs.161and Super Diesel from Rs.133 to Rs.141. Auto diesel prices remain unchanged at Rs.123.
The Finance and Mass Media Ministry in a press release yesterday explained that though diesel was scheduled to be increased by Rs 11, the Committee took into account its impact on the fishing and other vulnerable communities and thus chose to keep prices unchanged.
Crude oil prices which stood at USD 75 per barrel on September 10, at the time of the last increase, has now risen to USD 84 per barrel.
The fuel pricing formula was introduced on May 9 of this year to reflect the price fluctuations of crude oil in the international market and the foreign exchange fluctuations in the country.
Prices are scheduled to be amended on the tenth of every month, by a committee consisting of five persons which includes; the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury (Chair), a representative of the President, a representative of the Prime Minister and a representative from the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry.
Lanka Indian Oil Company, Managing Director, Shyam Bohra told the Daily News they will decide on the increases to their prices once they receive the official communique. The LIOC committee was set to meet last night to decide their revisions.

1st ODI ends in no-result  only 15 overs bowled:
Rain does not spare even arid Dambulla
DAMBULLA, Wednesday: Englands chances of retaining top spot in the ICC One-Day International (ODI) rankings ran into a road block by way of the prevailing bad weather that is currently affecting the country when the first ODI of a five-match series against Sri Lanka ended in a no-result at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
England, the current no. 1 ranked ODI team will have to win the series to retain that position. Their failure to win to do so, will give India a sniff at the top spot when they take on the West Indies in the five-match ODI series from 21 October.
Currently England are on top with 127 points with India second on 122 points.
There was bright weather at the start of the match and everyone was hopeful that it would remain that way throughout the day. But by around 3.42 pm at the end of 15 overs the dark clouds closed in and with it came the rains that later turned into a steady drizzle that continued throughout the night forcing the match officials to abandon the match with England 92 for two wickets after being invited to bat first.
The rain ceased by around 7.00 pm raising hopes of the match being resumed with a reduced number of overs, but following an inspection at 8.15 pm by the match officials a decision was reached in consultation with the two captains to abandon the match due to wet patches on the outfield.
Dambulla is renowned for having the least amount of rainfall, but the prevailing bad weather did not even spare such an arid area.
Sri Lanka having suffered seven straight losses at this venue since 2015 took up a defensive ploy by inviting England to bat first on what looked like a good batting track.
The manner in which the England openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow went about hitting boundaries at ease off Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Pradeep clobbering seven fours and one six showed how easy paced the pitch was.
They put on a stand of 49 in eight overs before Bairstow (25) edged one from Pradeep to Niroshan Dickwella, back in the fray after being overlooked for the two Asia Cup matches.
Mystery spinner Akila Dananjaya was greeted by Bairstow with a six and a four in his first over but in his second over he got rid of Roy (24) who failed to get to the pitch of the ball and ended up hitting a catch to mid-off.
Sri Lanka had struck twice within the space of four balls, but Joe Root (25 n.o.) and skipper Eoin Morgan (18 n.o.) checked that mini slide and got England back on track once again with an unbroken partnership of 41 off 38 balls when the game was stopped.
It was this pair that figured in a 170-run stand that paved the way for Englands win in their first warm-up game against a Sri Lanka Board XI and here they were once again taking stock of the situation and gradually getting England into a position of ascendency with a stand of 41 in 38 balls when the heavens opened up and deprived the spectators of a batting treat.
Sri Lanka once again went with the side thin in the batting with only five specialist batsmen and two all-rounders, whereas they should have gone with a 7-4 combination that has served them well in the past.
The second ODI is scheduled at the same venue for Saturday which will be a day match with a reserve day thrown-in for good measure.

Robbie to play Barbie
Margot Robbie could be living in a Barbie world very soon. The Australian actress is hotly-tipped to star as the worlds most famous doll with Warner Bros. reportedly hoping to bring Barbie to life in a live-action movie.
Its said that Margot, 28, is in talks with the Hollywood studio, who have reportedly taken over from Sony after several failed attempts to get the Barbie project off the ground since 2014.
The Hollywood Reporter claims that Margot would not only star in the lead role, but would also produce the film under her production company LuckyChap.
Margot would be in good company as Wonder Woman director, Patty Jenkins, is also rumoured to join the project. Its reported that scriptwriters are toying with the idea of a feminist direction for the story, using Barbie to promote positive body image and identity.Margots involvement comes after Amy Schumer was previously linked to the film but reportedly dropped out due to scheduling issues. The comedienne was then thought to have been replaced by Anne Hathaway but it seems she may have also dropped out.Sony tried to get the ball rolling by setting a release date for June 29 but that was significantly pushed back to May 8, 2020. Toy company Mattel are said to have reclaimed the rights to Barbie earlier this year hence Warner Bros.s alleged talks with the brand, according to Entertainment Weekly.
Until she officially signs on, Margot will next be seen in a very different film. The actress will star as Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots, which is set for release in 2019 and could earn her another Oscar nomination. Metro

Shrine Room matter:
SC orders Jaffna VC and others to be noticed
The Supreme Court yesterday directed the petitioners to send notices on the Vice Chancellor of the Jaffna University and several others to appear in court on December 5 regarding a Fundamental Rights petition filed by five students for allegedly penalizing them for bringing a Budu Kutiya to the Vavuniya Campus.
Five students including four Sinhala Buddhists and a Tamil Hindu student attached to the Faculty of Business Studies in Vavuniya Campus of the Jaffna University filed this petition complaining that the university administration is continuously harassing, victimizing and penalizing them for their suspected involvement in bringing the Budu Kutiya (Wooden structure for the placement of a Buddha statue) to the Vavuniya Campus by keeping them indefinitely out of bounds of the Vavuniya Campus.
The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Nalin Perera.
The petitioners further alleged that the University administration prevented them from pursuing their university education and sitting for the examination, subjecting them to excessive punishment informally not warranted by disciplinary procedure, by not granting any hearing to their appeals and by not releasing the Board of Inquiry Report and by not informing them of the decision of the Board of Inquiry.
The petitioners cited Vice Chancellor of the Jaffna University Prof. Ratnam Vigneswaran, Dr. T. Mangaleswaran, P. Priyadarshan and six others including the Minister of Higher Education as respondents.
The petitioners stated that as the Vesak Poya was falling on April 29, 2018, the students had planned to bring the Buddha statue and later placed it in the Budu Kutiya and celebrated the Vesak Festival. They allege that the third respondent, a Sub Warden came there and asked the students to take it out of the campus premises.
The petitioners stated that freedom of thought, conscience and religion is the most important fundamental right of every person. They further alleged that the respondents have infringed the Fundamental Rights of the petitioners to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution when they were penalised for expressing their views asserting their Fundamental Rights to conduct their religious observances within the campus premises.
The petition was filed through Senior Counsel Kalyananda Thiranagama and Counsel Nilmal Wickremasinghe.

SL Army stationed near Hambantota Port - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in a speech at the Oxford Union on Monday, said the Sri Lanka Army is stationed within the vicinity of the Hambantota Port and there are no foreign naval bases in the island.
The Premier said Sri Lankas Hambantota Port is a commercial joint venture between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPort) - a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

In a Q&A with Oxford University students after his speech, the PM echoed President Maithripala Sirisenas comments to the UN in September regarding the importance of a countrys independence in reconciliation efforts. The PM said Sri Lanka does not need foreign interference in investigating war crimes.
With Indian Ocean sea lanes carrying about half the worlds containerised cargo, Sri Lanka, positioned in the middle of EastWest shipping lanes, is at the centre of growing trade activity, and, thus, at the centre of global investment and an intensifying power struggle, the Premier said, during his speech.
Outlining an emerging global cartography, the Prime Minister divided the world into four quartiles  the West, China, the Islamic World, and everyone else. He said those remaining countries, which include Sri Lanka, will possess the potential of determining the final outcome of this power play.
Because of the Indian Oceans increased strategic importance, Wickremesinghe said a concept of the Indo-Pacific is developing. Some, he said, welcome the Indo-Pacific as a means of containing China, but others fear controversy in the South China Sea will spill over to the region.
With its unprecedented Belt and Road Initiative, China has an ever-growing presence nationally and regionally. Japan has expanded involvement in the region stepping forward to lead the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership when the US departed from the agreement. And India has set its sights on strengthening ties within its own region with its Neighborhood First policy.
This is an indication that the powers of the Western world are becoming limited, the Premier said, predicting the re-emergence of Asian countries as centres of power like they were pre-colonial times.
Emphasising the importance of preserving a distinct Indian Ocean identity amidst these rapidly changing development, the PM called for a strengthening of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) for smaller states. In accordance with this goal, Sri Lanka will be hosting a conference on the Indian Ocean at Temple Trees today and tomorrow (11 and 12).
The PM also spoke at the London Stock Exchange while visiting the UK.

## Title: Sri Lankas maritime affairs in the changing Indian Ocean

Sri Lankas maritime affairs in the changing Indian Ocean
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for the Hub of the Indian Ocean concept to be adopted as the policy platform for Sri Lankas maritime cooperation. This concept has become the ideal platform to address many policy bottlenecks that Sri Lanka encounters today, be they related to transportation, trade, foreign direct investment, security, or even issues of urbanisation and environmental degradation.
This article covers some of the vital changes in the Indian Ocean that will prompt Sri Lanka to drive its economic and foreign policy towards a new direction emphasising maritime cooperation.
Sri Lanka, situated at the centre of the Indian Ocean, has a geographically advantageous setting that can make strategic use of Indian Ocean maritime trade links, thereby placing the country as a potential beneficiary of the current global shift of power from West to East.
According to the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) - Sri Lankas leading foreign policy think tank - the population in the 28 Indian Ocean states earning less than US$ 1 a day (the international poverty line) is estimated to decrease from 12 percent in 2017 to 7 percent by 2025. Such poverty reduction is, of course, dependent on these economies continuing to benefit from open maritime trade. Is it any wonder then, that the Indian Oceans maritime relations could be considered an archetype for how freedom of navigation and maritime trade can shape regional prosperity
Sri Lanka is indeed blessed to be at the centre of this thriving maritime environment, which has created enduring links between the Indian Ocean and its economy. Sri Lanka only stands to progressively benefit from the continuation of such peaceful maritime links into the future. On the other hand, with the recent global shift in power, with the US seeking to rebalance towards Asia, there is also an impetus for Sri Lanka to carry out some serious maritime policy planning.
Amidst the growth of such geopolitical and economic dynamics, this article details some of the opportunities that Sri Lanka successfully exploited in the past, which can inspire its future course on maritime policy. The key historical lesson from the Indian Ocean is its tremendous importance to global trade and economic cooperation, going all the way back to the second millennium BC. In this narrative, Sri Lanka played a major role and arguably, continues to do so. By building itself up as a transit point in the trans-continental sea trade connecting Europe, the Middle East, East Africa, India and Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka became a significant player in the Indian Ocean. This great trading legacy brought great wealth to the country.
As the Mahavamsa indicates, the diffusion of Buddhism from India to Sri Lanka was primarily facilitated by ancient maritime trade routes. Many other forms of evidence have shown that Sri Lankas strategic geographic centrality enabled maritime transactions in terms of both trade and cultural exchanges since at least the 2nd century BCE. The countrys significance in the global trade of the time is apparent in Ptolemy of Alexandrias world map.
Many other seminal research works on Sri Lankas ancient maritime trade have pointed out the flourishing trade based on the maritime silk route that connected Europeans, Arabs, Indians and Chinese. This body of research has also referred to the excellence of ancient Sri Lankas maritime engineering relating to the construction of ships, ports and other maritime infrastructure. In addition, during the entire period of colonial rule under the Portuguese, Dutch and British, respectively, Sri Lanka played a tremendously important role in regional maritime trade.
Post-independence Sri Lanka made a clear stand for the openness of the maritime domain and for maintaining the status quo in the Indian Ocean. At the San Francisco Conference in 1951, Sri Lankas Finance Minister at the time, J.R. Jayewardene, declared, We are not concerned about favouring this bloc or that bloc. We are concerned about maintaining peace in the world.
Later, in 1971, the worlds first female Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, tabled the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace (ZoP) proposal at the United Nations, which was adopted as UN General Assembly Resolution 2832. Since then, Sri Lanka has made a case for the strategic independence of the Indian Ocean. President Jayewardenes government, as said earlier, made efforts to maintain the status quo in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka therefore upheld a non-aligned approach towards the Indian Ocean for many years.
In addition, by signing the Sri Lanka-India Agreement on the Boundary in Historic Watersin 1974, Sri Lanka succeeded in demarcating its maritime boundary in the Palk Strait, Gulf of Mannar and the Bay of Bengal, endowing the country with a legally grounded maritime security. With the acquisition of a territorial sea area of 21,500 km2 and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of nearly 517,000 km2, Sri Lanka has succeeded in obtaining a significant resource base that can strengthen the countrys economy and broader security.
Given this history of maritime trade, strategic location, and vast maritime entitlements, Sri Lanka should naturally play a greater role in the Indian Ocean. As explained by LKI Executive Director Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, Maritime trade has the potential to transform the Indian Ocean into a new global growth pole. At present, the region is host to 35 percent of the global population, but only accounts for 13.1 percent of global trade. This reinforces that argument that a countrys economic growth is heavily dependent on its trade. This argument is especially valid for Sri Lanka, since some of the most successful sectors of the Sri Lankan economy are based on maritime trade, especially port services relating to container cargo shipment, trans-shipment and related services. In addition, the Colombo Port is ranked 13th in the world according to the Drewry Port Connectivity Index. Sri Lankan port development has also expanded to Hambantota with the joint venture with China Merchants Ports Holdings and will potentially expand to Trincomalee with Japanese development assistance.
Sri Lanka also took over the chairmanship of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in 2018. This has provided an opportunity to develop economic ties that can benefit maritime industries and boost cooperation on protection of the marine environment. In addition, as a member state to the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Sri Lanka can also play a vital role in promoting strategies for maritime cooperation that would seek to maintain the Indian Ocean status quo and create win-win outcomes for both regional and extra-regional states. Another important strategic direction that Sri Lanka could engage in is the rapidly developing marine city concept, which would significantly boost trade and tourism by marketing itself as an attractive destination with incentives for foreign businesses.
Looking beyond Sri Lanka to broader geopolitical developments in the Indian Ocean, Senior Professor in International Relations at the University of Colombo, Nayani Melegoda explains that the Indian Ocean is experiencing complicated geopolitical changes. In this context, the balance of power between small states and large states becomes of paramount important for regional stability and peace.
This elaboration is in line with the global power shift evident from various strategic developments in the maritime domain. There is of course the question of whether these developments can help South Asian states overcome the effects of the big-brother syndrome in relation to India. To tackle this issue prudently, Indias Neighbourhood First policy has been carefully crafted to minimise strategic mistrust among its neighbours.
Another important power change is the growing US interest in the Indian Ocean, evident from the coining of the Indo-Pacific term. This shift has led to increasing security cooperation between the US, Japan, Australia and India, and to stricter surveillance of the Straits of Malacca and Straits of Hormuz to ensure the security of these chokepoints. At the same time, it is impossible to forget the continuing role of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has already invested billions in the region and carved out a Chinese strategic presence in the Indian Ocean.
The enormous economic potential of the Indian Ocean and these growing strategic developments have prompted Sri Lanka to begin working on a well-planned maritime policy. Such policy is essential to safeguarding Sri Lankas national interests as it faces strategic competition between the great powers in the Indian Ocean, and considers ways and means of maintaining regional peace and stability to ensure its economic growth and future prosperity.
The Indian Ocean: Defining Our Future Track 1.5 International Conference begins in Colombo today and will continue tomorrow.

Sri Lankan Navy ships in Kochi
Two Sri Lankan Navy ships, SLNS Sagara and Suranimala, commanded by Captain N.M.J.D. Nissanka and Captain M.H.C.J. Silva are visiting Kochi, India.
The Commanding Officers called on Indias Rear Admiral R.J. Nadkarni, Chief of Staff of the Southern Naval Command, and discussed issues of cooperation between the two Navies, especially those pertaining to training. They also interacted with other flag officers in station.
During the visit, the Sri Lankan Navy personnel visited Indian Navy training facilities such as the Navigation and Direction School, Anti-Submarine Warfare School, Signal School, Water Survival Training Facility, Damage Control Training Facility, INS Dronacharya, and the School of Naval Oceanography and Meteorology. A friendly football match was also conducted between both personnel.
Indias bilateral relations with Sri Lanka are rooted in historical, social and cultural ties and extensive people-to-people contact. In the past two decades, with regular exchanges of visits as well as increased trade and investment, Indias relations with Sri Lanka have evolved into a comprehensive partnership.
Being immediate maritime neighbours, the two nations and navies also share a common vision in promoting maritime cooperation in the Bay of Bengal region, as is evident through the SLNs regular participation in the MILAN series of biennial meets and Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS).
The scope of training cooperation between the two navies is extensive. Last month also witnessed the latest edition of SLINEX (Sri Lanka India Naval exercise)  a bilateral exercise involving ships of both navies, said an Indian Navy press release.
The Sri Lankan ships will depart for Colombo on October 11.

Sri Rugby proud hosts Asian 7s finals...but stare down both barrels
Greetings and traditional welcome to all our Asian rugby brothers, sisters plus head coaches.
Our city by the sea and champion Racecourse ...will certainly be a voyage of discovery on many levels, as the red carpet captures their imagination totally.
Sri Lanka has an absolute task on their hands ... and intense pressure to press for podium finishes.
Both teams staring down both barrels with no love lost and literally everything to play for.
The majestic setting quite able to soak up a massive step up performance from our islanders in the middle.
Expectations are that we will shock the home fans with skills that throw the final dice in our favour.
The pressure is on...and no compromise at all.
Naturally its down...to the team and leader to live up or down....as that relentless pendulum swings.
As I have said before...and a well documented performance stat, is efficient effective prep....under pressure...so players grow familiar and feed on confidence.
Fitness beyond human and super skills that separate....good from average, exceptional from good, brilliant from exceptional and last....genius from brilliant.
This is pretty much the bloodline for 7s royalty, and massively significant in the middle.
There is much wax about pure pace, and rightfully so....teams reserve their blitzer...making sure you dont over run or exhaust them in the build up to the final 2 matches.
Finishing and finishers are like uncut diamonds.
Tabs on their reserve and fuel gauge, innovative, and vital to the BIG W..!
Lack of planning is condemning your team to good luck and survival...
Run a Carlyn Isles, Perry Baker... Dan Norton. Or a Kolinasau, in your opening 7....or plan for an injection of devastating pace that decimates and shreds defences, in the 2nd half.
Planning and patterns of play crucial to wellness and the desired results.
For your Sri islanders strike against Japan, Hong Kong, Korea......new captain Sooriyabandara, return from injury Danushka Ranjan, Kavindu, Sudam, Naveen Henakan.....our oxygen to blitz some magic against the big Asian titans.
Concern in my deckchair expert mind, is Danu Ranjans match response protocol and blood fitness to last the critical phases as we conclude from quarterfinals up.
The best answer will come from our lads recovery under pressure.
There is no place to seek shelter and Danushkas muscle memory will glam up or condemn him as per level of his performance fitness.
Its a complete ....all or nothing theory.
Whatever happens our targets are still the same top 4 from Korea.
So its intense focus from your warm up onwards.
Both coaches hoping and a few prayers too for coach Woods and Sampath ....dead legged with injuries to Muthu, Jason, Danushka, Gayan.
For the women Randika, captain Hemakumari and Anusha vital to finishing in the top 4.

There will  never be a  female 007!
Bond will always be a man. James Bond has always been a mans man. Yes, his misogynistic mannerisms of the 60s and 70s have been heavily toned down, but Bond is still the embodiment of masculinity.
Hes attractive, trained in combat, owns nice cars, and sleeps with endless exotic women. The entire concept of Bond relies on his persona, and executive producer Barbara Broccoli agrees.
Speaking with The Guardian, Broccoli revealed that future Bond movies wont be doing a gender switch any time soon.
Bond is male, she said.
Hes a male character. He was written as a male and I think hell probably stay as a male. There have been calls for a change in race or sex for Bond, with rumors swirling around an Idris Elba casting for months. Elba denied those rumors, but some fans are still asking for a change to the familiar Bond narrative.
We dont have to turn male characters into women, continued Broccoli.
Lets just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters.Look at the way the world has changed, Broccoli opined.
And I think Bond has come through and transformed with the times. Ive tried to do my part, and I think particularly with the Daniel [Craig] films, theyve become much more current in terms of the way women are viewed. Bond 25 is scheduled to begin filming next year with a proposed 2020 release date. Variety

## Title: Time for Singapore companies to invest in the Pearl of the Indian Ocean
## Supertitle: Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA:
## Section: Finance

Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA:
Time for Singapore companies to invest in the Pearl of the Indian Ocean
Historically, Sri Lanka has not been viewed in the same league as some of its South Asian counterparts when it comes to attracting foreign investments. This is evinced by the disproportionately low Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) entering Sri Lanka compared to its regional neighbours. Between 2012 and 2017, the average FDI into Sri Lanka was US$150.68 million. In the same period, the average FDI into Bangladesh and Myanmar was US$958.13 million and US$571.14 million respectively.
With the anticipated signing of an expanded Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India as well as a comprehensive FTA with China, Sri Lanka is set to bridge this gap. At the same time, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) led by China is expected to positively impact the Sri Lankan economy.
This should be music to the ears of Singapore investors as, with the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) signed earlier this year, Singapore investors are primed to benefit from the early mover advantage. The Singapore government has been urging businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to internationalise and the signing of the SLSFTA portends Sri Lanka as an attractive investment destination.
The SLSFTA, which was signed on January 23, 2018 makes it easier for Singapore investors to invest in Sri Lanka and provides access to previously closed-off sectors and projects within the Sri Lankan market. At the same time, the SLSFTA includes various legal safeguards for such investments.
The Singapore Business Federation and the Law Society of Singapore organised a mission to Sri Lanka last week and the delegates noted that there are considerable synergies between Singapore and Sri Lanka. The current relative political stability, favourable socio-economic conditions as well as the pro-business stance of the present government should further entice investors.
Political stability
The relative political stability currently being experienced in Sri Lanka suggests that the time is ripe for entry into the Sri Lankan market. Although Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes ruling coalition lost the municipal election earlier this year, he is widely expected to remain in power and win the next national elections slated to be held in 2020.
Given his pro-business stance, this would be good news to potential investors. In his speech at the Invest Sri Lanka 2018 Forum in Singapore earlier this year, the Sri Lankan Prime Minister promised various measures to incentivize foreign investments. These measures include reducing the time taken to set up a company and register a property in Sri Lanka.
Additionally, Wickremesinghe is generally considered as Sri Lankas hope for good governance. Thus, with Wickremesinghe in power, Sri Lanka has a leader who is committed to ensuring government accountability and economic prosperity. This could only bode well for investors planning to invest in the country.
Sri Lankas socio-economic pull factors
Labour cost in the country remains relatively low with minimum wage at 10,000 LKR (approximately US$61) per month. In a 2016 survey focused on Japanese companies with presence in Asia Pacific, the average monthly salary paid to an employee in Sri Lanka was US$165. Additionally, the average monthly salary of a factory engineer was US$396 while a managers monthly salary US$720. In contrast, the average salary of a factory engineer and manager in Indonesia was US$449 and US$993 respectively.
Further, a significant number of Sri Lankas population is of working age. 56.21% of Sri Lankas population is between the ages of 15 and 54, while the youth population (i.e. persons aged 15 to 29) stands at 4.4 million.
Favourable government policies
The policies and initiatives introduced by the government to improve the ease of doing business in Sri Lanka should facilitate foreign investment.
A new registration portal was recently set up by the Department of the Registration of Companies with the aim of cutting down the time taken to register a new company from six days to one day. Through the portal, a business owner can register his company from the comfort of his home and make the necessary registration payments via credit card.
Sri Lanka also started an online platform, known as the One Stop Shop (OSS), to facilitate foreign investments into the country. OSS seeks to make investments convenient as it will be the only communication platform pertaining to applications for new and expansion projects between the Sri Lankan government and foreign investors.
The SLSFTA
For the Singapore investor, the SLSFTA is thus opportune. One of the key aims of the SLSFTA is to increase Singaporean FDI into Sri Lanka which currently stands at an average of only 5.3% of the latters total FDI between 2014 and 2017.
The SLSFTA brings numerous benefits to a Singapore investor. First, the SLSFTA covers tariff elimination for 80% of all tariff lines through staging periods of up to 15 years. Second, the SLSFTA allows Singapore companies to bid for projects by the Sri Lankan government and state-owned enterprises which were previously not open to foreign businesses. Sri Lankas Board of Investment is targeting Singapore FDI in infrastructure, IT services, tourism and education in particular. In the infrastructure space, there will be multiple opportunities for Singapore businesses as Sri Lanka is looking to develop three large ports, two international airports and build a highway to connect Hambantota, Colombo and Kandy in the near future.
Third, the SLSFTA protects investments against expropriation and also provides safeguards against discrimination based on factors such as nationality.
Lastly, the SLSFTA provides for the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) to be the venue for the adjudication of Investor-State disputes which is reassuring for Singapore investors.
Treaties and initiatives
There are also various upcoming treaties and initiatives involving Sri Lanka which should add to her allure as an investment destination. First, talks are ongoing between Sri Lanka and India to finalise the Economic and Technological Co-operation Agreement (ETCA). At the same time, Sri Lanka is looking to conclude a FTA with China. Although Singapore already has an FTA with both India and China, these new agreements, if concluded, could potentially allow Singapore investors to utilise Sri Lanka as a hub to enter into sectors in these countries which may not have been covered under the respective FTAs.
Additionally, Sri Lanka is expected to play a sizeable role in the Chinese led BRI as she is strategically located in the middle of the Indian Ocean and adjacent to one of the busiest sea lanes in the world. This represents an opportunity for Singapore businesses. For instance, earlier this year, the Sri Lankan cabinet approved a proposal for a Singapore-based consultancy, Surbana Jurong Pvt Ltd, to draw up a plan for the development of the Chinese investment zone in Sri Lanka. It is also expected that Chinese firms will increasingly seek to monetise the land surrounding major infrastructure projects as an alternative means of funding projects. This will in turn, create real estate investment opportunities. It is estimated that BRI projects linked to China will be worth USD 350 billion by 2022. By investing in Sri Lanka, Singapore companies have a chance to be more directly involved in the BRI and reap the rewards of this landmark initiative.

Top British investors at Invest Sri Lanka Forum in London
A large gathering of Institutional Investors based in London showed a keen interest in investing in Sri Lankan equities while attending an Invest Sri Lanka Forum held at the London Stock Exchange recently.
The Forum, which was organized by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in association with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC), attracted a number of UK- based frontier and emerging market Institutional Investor representatives. An event in Edinburgh, Scotland will also be held as part of the Invest Sri Lanka road show presently taking place in the United Kingdom (UK).
Through the years, Institutional Investors based in the UK have consistently had a strong investment presence in the Sri Lankan stock market and the UK remains to be one of the leading investors of Sri Lankan equities.
A high-level Sri Lankan delegation representing the Government of Sri Lanka, the Central Bank, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, the Colombo Stock Exchange, Sri Lankan listed companies and Stock broker representatives were at the Forum to collectively make a case for the Sri Lankan capital market
In what is a key feature of Invest Sri Lanka Forums, the event also facilitated over 45 One-to-one/group discussions between investors and chief executives/senior representatives of Sri Lankan listed companies. John Keells Holdings PLC, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, Dialog Axiata PLC, Hatton National Bank PLC, Sampath Bank PLC, MelstaCorp PLC, Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC, Nations Trust Bank PLC, Aitken Spence PLC, Tokyo Cement (Lanka) PLC, Sunshine Holdings PLC, Union Bank of Colombo PLC and Resus Energy PLC were represented at the event.
State Minister for Finance and Mass Media Eran Wickramaratne, who made the keynote address at the Forum said, 2017 resulted in the largest ever inflow of foreign investment into the Sri Lankan stock market in its history. This was a response to Sri Lankas prudent macro-economic management resulting in reduced budget deficits, higher government revenue, decreasing inflation, increased exports, an improved foreign exchange reserves balance and an alltime high in foreign direct investment. Despite the hike in the US Dollar, the comparative value of Sri Lankan stocks with comparable Asian markets augments well for the performance of the CSE in the near future.
The Forum was offered a strong endorsement from the Chief Executive Officer of the London Stock Exchange PLC Nikhil Rathi, who spoke of the potential value of investing in Sri Lanka, stating that London Stock Exchange Group is one of the largest direct investors in Sri Lanka. He went on to reaffirm LSEGs commitment to strengthening its relationship with Sri Lanka and noted that LSEG would continue to grow its presence and facilities in the country.
Member of the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka Nihal Fonseka offering perspective on the monetary policy and the macro-economic outlook, stated that broad-based reforms under the IMF agreement has complemented the efforts of the Government, while noting that ongoing trade reforms are expected to strengthen the countrys external sector on a sustainable basis.
SEC Chairman Ranel T. Wijesinha speaking to investors present at the event assured that the SEC is strongly committed to sound regulation and the development of the securities market in Sri Lanka.

Twenty-six million women may lose jobs to technology  IMF
The International Monetary Fund in its report titled - Gender, Technology and the Future Work estimated that at least 26 millionfemale jobs in 30 countries were at risk of being displaced by technology.
The IMF President, Christine Lagarde, made this known in a panel discussion on Empowering Women in the Workplace at the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings in Bali, Indonesia.
Lagarde said that globally, 11 per cent of women were at risk of losing their jobs due to advances in computer technology, while only four per cent of the male population faces same risk.
She said, Less well-educated and older female workers aged 40 and above, as well as those in low-skill clerical, service, and sales positions are disproportionately exposed to automation.
Extrapolating our results, we find that around 180 million female jobs are at high risk of being displaced globally.
Therefore, policies are needed to endow women with required skills, close gender gaps in leadership positions and bridge digital gender divide that could confer greater flexibility in work, benefiting women.
Also, the Indonesian Minister of Finance, Mulyani Indrawati, said that adding more women into the labour force of an economy would reduce poverty and ensure prosperity.
She urged women to be role models at their places of work.
She said, As women, we must strive to do extraordinarily well in other to set example for the younger generation.
We also need to ensure girls have the right role models and mentors so they can really be the ones leading the way.
Also, the Executive Secretary, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Vera Songwe, said that increased access to the internet would bridge womens skill gap.
Songwe said, 250 million fewer women than men in 2017 had access to the internet. In Africa, 27 million fewer women access reliable and affordable internet which will help close the current digital divide.
She said also thathigher femalelabourforceparticipationcould boosteconomic growth of a country.

WB approves $515 m for Bangladesh to improve fisheries, roads, forests
The World Bank (WB) has approved US$515 million for three projects in Bangladesh to improve coastal and marine fisheries, forest management, and rural roads.
These financings will help rural people by reducing poverty and creating new livelihood opportunities, including for local communities in the Coxs Bazar district hosting Rohingya people who fled violence in Myanmar, said a releasetoday, reports BSS.
WB Country Director for Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal Qimiao Fan said these three projects will create opportunities for the rural population and especially help the vulnerable people come out of poverty. At the same time, they will improve the countrys resilience to climate change, he added.
The $175 million Sustainable Forests and Livelihoods Project will help improve forest cover through a collaborative forest management approach involving local communities. The project will plant trees in about 79,000 hectares of forest, including a coastal green belt that will also help increase climate change resilience.
WB Senior Natural Resources Management Specialist and Task Team Leader for the project Madhavi Pillai said the project will support increasing income through alternative income generation activities for about 40,000 households in the coastal, hill and central districts of the country.
This will include Coxs Bazar where nearly one million Rohingya took shelter. The project will particularly help the host communities through its income generation activities, improving the availability of wood for fuel in a sustainable way and reducing human-wild elephant conflict which has affected parts of the district.
The project will develop and implement protected area management plans for about 10 protected forest areas with involvement of community members.
The $240 million Sustainable Coastal and Marine Fisheries Project will help improve fisheries management, expand mari-culture and strengthen aquaculture bio-security and productivity.
In 10 coastal districts, the project will set up community co-management associations with the fishing communities, enabling them to adopt supplementary and alternative livelihoods. It also empowers female workers through alternative livelihoods support, skills development, and nutrition awareness.
World Bank Senior Environment Specialist and Task Team Leader for the project Milen Dyoulgerov said Fisheries are vital to the countrys food security and the sector employs more than 18 million people. After garments, fishery is the countrys second largest export earning sector.
The project will help improve fisheries management systems, infrastructure, and other value chain investments. This will result in better productivity and availability of fish, he added. The project will also help expand the current fisher ID card system, which will be linked with the geographic information system platform. It will also improve vessel registration and licensing for fishing. The $100 million additional financing to the Second Rural Transport Improvement Project will help rehabilitate rural roads in 26 districts that were damaged from last years heavy rainfall and floods.
The ongoing project has improved and repaired more than 5,000 km rural roads that helped millions of people access markets, hospitals, and schools. The financing will factor in climate-resilience in planning, technical design, implementation and maintenance of the roads.
World Bank Senior Transport Specialist and Task Team Leader for the project Dung Anh Hoang said the financing will continue a road safety program to ensure traffic safety as the rural roads is facing increased motorized traffic. (theindependent)

Whiff  of well being
If you desire thick, shiny, and beautiful hair then make head massage an integral part of your hair care ritual. Not only is it a wonderfully relaxing holistic therapy, which treats the mind, body and spirit but it will also revive you of any physical or emotional tension. From nourishing your hair deeply to its roots to encouraging the relaxing of your senses a scalp massage is the way to go to achieve your dream of beautiful hair.

Scalp massage as a regular part of a hair care ritual
Regular scalp massage strengthens the hair roots leading to hair growth. It is done using oils and if you use a good moisturising oil like jojoba or something in the same calibre, it adds moisture and conditions the scalp, making your hair look more vibrant. Hair that is moisturised regularly is less likely to split or break; thus choose the massage oil wisely.

Doing a scalp massage at home
You can give yourself a scalp massage at home. Start by running your hands through your hair while applying oil in a downward pressure movement with your fingers. Move your fingers in small circles as you press down on your scalp. When youre ready, move your hands in the opposite direction and gradually work down to the sides of your scalp. Finish your massage by gently rubbing around your ears.

Dos and donts related to scalp massages
There arent many things to avoid after a massage but here is a list with what is generally recommended to do after a massage:
* A massage lowers the blood sugar levels. If you are insulin dependent, make sure you keep you blood sugar under control.
* Do not eat right after the massage, unless your blood sugar dropped drastically. Dont eat a large meal within a couple hours before the massage.
* Do not consume alcohol before a massage.
* Take a shower before a massage therapy.
* Good breathing complements the massage session bringing the patient the most results. It deepens the relaxation and accelerates the purification process. The patient has to learn how to maintain a good breathing.
* Drink plenty of water. The massage sets your lymph in motion, and water helps detoxification.
* If you got an aromatherapy massage, you want the essential oils to stay on your body/head as long as possible. Dont take a shower right after the massage, if this is possible.
* If possible get a nap. This is the most restful sleep youll ever have.
* Plan a bathroom trip immediately after the session.

Air freshener machines have been installed in the newly opened Western Provincial Council building at a cost of Rs. 16,362,500 to provide a pleasing odour inside the building, said Western Provincial Council UPFA member Salochana Gamage.
He said another Rs. 2,625,000 had to be spent at a time to refill the air fresheners in the 15 storey building.
He was addressing a meeting of the Western Provincial Council held yesterday.
Gamage said an air freshener had been installed in each room in the building while two or three air fresheners had been installed in wider areas such as the council chamber. He said altogether, 875 air fresheners had been installed, each costing Rs. 18,700.
These machines had to be refilled once in three weeks. Each refiling costs Rs. 875 and the refilling sum amounted to Rs. 2,625,000 at a time, Gamage said.
He said this was a wastage of taxpayers money. Gamage, who added that the previous council building or ministry offices never had this facility, requested the council to put this money into some other useful service such as the welfare of disabled children in the province.

Zonta Club 11 invites dance enthusiasts  for spectacular  Theme Night
A hundred years ago there lived and worked a remarkable woman named Marion de Forest . . . who had a dream.
She was an American playwright and journalist from Buffalo, New York. She believed that women all over the world needed a voice, champions to protect their rights, their freedoms. And she attracted a group of Pioneer supporters, with whose help the Zonta International movement was born.
Today there are some 30,000 Zonta women in 63 countries around the world, with some 200 of them in five Zonta Clubs in Sri Lanka.
And if theres one thing that ALL Zonta women have in common. Its PASSION. Passion for their beliefs, their amazing projects, and inevitably also for their fund raisers!
On October 23, the Zonta Club 11 of Colombo have put together a Mamma Mia THEME PARTY as a fund raiser for their most significant project. This party will feature the awesome Abba music of the well-loved musical Mamma Mia. There will be vibrant rhythms for exuberant dancing, great food, themed cocktails and intriguing surprises. It will truly be a party to be hugely enjoyed and remembered. The Zontians hope for enthusiastic support from fun loving ladies and their men friends.
Colombos Dancing Queens and their Super Trouper guys might want to seriously get their tickets and be there. Secure in the knowledge that while they are having an unusually good time, they are supporting the MITHURU PIYASA Counselling Centres. There are five such Centres, sensitively designed and much supported by Zonta Club 11. With professional counsellors working devotedly with needy, often distressed families. Doing some amazing work and regularly recording heartwarming success, most significantly for the woman in the home.
Zonta Club 11 also welcomes e banners for display at the event, and any voluntary donations will be gratefully accepted. With Zonta Club 11 President Meneka standing by to advise inquirers.
Readers will do well to plan to have a rocking night! What better than dancing a night away exuberantly for an admirable cause.
