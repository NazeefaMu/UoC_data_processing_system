I decided to join hands with Chief Minister to strengthen SLFP
Newly appointed Irrigation, Lands, Rural Development and Women Affairs Minister of the North Central Provincial Council Sarath Ilangasinghe said he decided to accept the portfolio and join hands with the Chief Minister in order to strengthen the SLFP and prevent any break up in the party.
He debunked allegations that he was bought over for Rs. 20 million and said he is ready to declare his financial assets giving details of his own and family members' bank accounts at any public debate to disprove these allegations.
Addressing a meeting held at Eppawela, Provincial Minister Ilangasinghe said some people would be baffled to see him in a ministerial position after being a leading member of the Joint Opposition group. He said he was a person who tried hard to resolve the dispute occurred in the North Central Provincial Council. The Chief Minister and the Council Ministers as members of the SLFP had always worked for SLFP supporters.
"If there had been any change in the power equation in the North Central Provincial Council, SLFP supporters in the province would have been left high and dry unable to obtain any service from the Council. I pointed out this to other rebels in the council, but they failed to accept the reality," he said.
Therefore he discussed this with another member and decided to accept the portfolio to prevent any change in the power equation in the council which would have been detrimental to SLFP supporters, he said.

Singapore Convention Hall should be vested with government
The Singapore Convention Hall at Siribopura, Hambantota should be vested with the government to make it more beneficial to the public, Hambantota District Parliamentarian Nihal Galappththy said. At present, it is managed by the D.A.Rajapaksa Foundation.
The Parliamentarian was addressing the Hambantota District Development Committee meeting held at the Hambantota Administration Complex recently presided over by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister MahindaAmaraweera and the Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa.
Galappththy said the hall remains closed and it is used only for wedding functions. He said the hall must be used for other functions as well for a nominal fee.

Upheaval in NCPC meaningless
The upheaval in the North Central Provincial Council (NCPC) is meaningless because Provincial Councils have been set up through a weak and powerless Act, Matara District Parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene said.
Addressing a meeting held at Weligama on May 26, Abeywardena said the setting up of Provincial Councils could be likened to the Sinhala saying "changing pillows to cure a headache". Under the Act, a Governor could act according to his whims and fancies.
The common belief was that power is lost once a no confidence motion was carried through successfully. But this was not so in the case of Provincial Councils. In a Provincial Council, power cannot be changed through a no-confidence motion, he said.
"Even Prabahakaran opposed Provincial Councils because they were established under a pointless and useless Act," Abeywardena said.
"The North Central Provincial Council's present administration cannot be toppled by whatever means. The only option left was to prevent its proper functioning by resorting to acts of sabotage, he said.

Airbnb agrees to pay commission for bookings
Sri Lanka Tourism has come to an agreement with one of the worlds leading budget hotel booking engines, Airbnb to collect an incentive for their business in Sri Lanka.
Speaking to Daily News at the (Pacific Asia Travel Association) PATA conference in Negombo Sri Lanka Tourism Chairman Paddy Withana said that Airbnb has now agreed to pay a commission for their bookings made in Sri Lanka trough their search engine. This is a welcome move.
Asked if a similar incentive would come to Sri Lanka through the taxi booking engine, Uber he answered in the negative.
However we must take in to account that through Uber a significant number of employment opportunities have been created and this helps the economy in some way.
With the development of technology, it is unlikely that the future tourist will follow the traditional travel methods. With easy access to social media and budget travel tools like Airbnb, Couchsurfing, Skyscanner, and Lonely Planet message boards, travelling is made easier and faster, said Andrew Jones, Chairman PATA.
The young generation likes to try out new ideas, innovations and concepts, which suit their dynamic lifestyle.
The changes which tourism will go through will create an important impact on them which they will apply for their benefit.
Tourism administrators must try to focus their campaigns to target these new trends and move away from traditional marketing trends. he said. (SS)

[APPRECIATIONS - (22-05-2017)]
D.K. Weeratunge
Kind-hearted social worker
It was really a day of mourning for mostly everyone in Hatton, irrespective of race, caste or creed when the fatal news echoed at the dawn of January 31, 2017, that D.K. Weeratunge passed away at Nawaloka Hospital, Colombo, consequent to a surgery. His untimely demise was an irreparable loss to Hatton, especially to the families of DKW Plastic Industries and DKW-Aqua International (Pvt) Ltd, whose income depended on him as an employer. It also left an infallible void in the context of institutional, social and religious environments, mostly in the Central Province where all his social activities were centrallized. He was a genuine social worker who had served society in all aspects.
D.K. Weeratunge was born on October 1, 1932. His parents were Dickowita Kankanamge Don John and Bopagoda Hettige Punchihamy (Kodagoda Hammie). This family was well recognized by the Government. His father was a 'Vel Vidane,' which was a post offered by the Gate Mudliyars of the Government in the old colonial days with no remuneration, purely on the basis that the applicants were hailed from the descendants of families recognised by the state.
Weeratunge had his formal education at Angunna Badulla Mixed School situated in Matara. He had the opportunity to enter into Central College, Telijjawila, where he was a student under former Commissioner General of Examinations late H.C. Wimalasuriya.
Notwithstanding the environment for his secondary education, he had to leave his parents in order to assist his uncle in his grocery business in Hatton. Having joined his uncle, he admitted himself in Sri Pada College, Hatton, for his further studies. This was somewhere in the 1950s. At this time, the post colonial social-economic ruins were already prevailing in the plantation sector in upcountry. He had to choose English as his medium for study and other appropriate subjects to match the society at that time.
With the assignment shouldered upon him by his uncle, Weeratunge was compelled to pay attention to the retail business after school. He underwent immense hardships during this period even to the extent of making a cement floor with mat and pillow as his bed. Amidst sleepless nights, he managed to obtain a simple pass in S.S.C. in English Medium which was recognised as qualified to enter into the government service. He was the only student who got through this examination in Sri Pada College for the first time. Former Principal of Sri Pada College late Hettige requested Weeratunge to join the staff as an English Assistant on a salary scale of Rs. 120 per month.
Weeratunge was fortunate to capture his career in business as he possessed the knowledge in English and Tamil, in addition to his mother tongue, Sinhala. The gift of the gab he gained paved the way for successful business, as aimed by him. He never turned as deaf ear to the grievances of the workers who were employed under him and therefore, knew their problems and solved them in an amicable manner.
He found Rupa Widanapathirana, a teacher from Porathota Vidyalaya, Akuressa, as his partner and their marriage took place at Matara. Athula and Iromie were his lovely children.
With the introduction of opened economy in 1977 by the government, Weeratunga chose poly packaging as new business with his good friend, Aktha Careem as a partner. Whilst the then Minister of Industries Cyril Mathew approved this new industry, Dr. Wickrama Weerasuriya and his cousin S.M.A.G. Perera were among the gentlemen who assisted in extending their co-operation to start this new venture.
Initially, a cadre of approximately 10 employees were engaged and later, it increased to as much as 400 with the speedy development of the business. He was much strengthened to face challenges in business and even entered into the export market, joining hands with Aqua Packaging, Wattala, thus fulfilling his ambition.
Where Corporate Social Responsibilities are concerned in the latest buzzword in the private sector companies, and also a criteria to measure how a private sector complies with companies in modern business tendencies, Weeratunge was practising it performing all his contributions to society long before the introduction of C.S.R.
Weeratunge actively contributed towards poverty alleviation by creating direct and indirect employment opportunities to the unemployed youths in the vicinity. His prime objective was to find human resources for his business within the area itself. This was the secret behind the long journey of his business. He never hired qualified employees to engage in the business, but stretched hands for the youths to come up to the levels of engineers, technicians and accountants etc. He had a remarkable skill of identifying talents by observing one's behaviour. The ethnic unity, peacefulness and harmony among the races always became a model to the most burning issue in the Tamil-dominant Hatton.
Weeratunge, in no way, enjoyed the profits earned from his trade for himself, but shared with others in the society. His contributions towards the health sector in the area was of much importance. Be it a construction, donation or a maintenance, he was always at the doorstep for any request. Leaving aside the government hospitals in the area in general, the annual maintenance of Ward No. 09 in the Kalubowila Hospital could be treated as one among social activities launched out of Hatton for his generosity.
He foresaw the need for a cultural centre in Hatton for the residents of the area to have meetings, conferences, stage dramas or other social activities. In consultation with his close associates, he was able to obtain a land for this purpose and complied with this requirement, completing the construction within the scheduled date. These buildings are currently used for Y.M.B.A., Cultural Centre, Weera Elders Home and for other activities.
Although we could write books on the autobiography of the late D. K. Weeratunge, we call him a genuine philanthropist not only for the Hatton area, but also for the whole island.
He spent millions for the Hatton Buddhist Temple and other temples in the area. He spent for the 'Dhana Shalawa' for serving alms to 50 priests in commemoration for his deceased daughter Ironie Weerathunga, construction of pagodas for Ruwanpura and Kudaoya Buddhist Temples, laying of marbles for 'Salapathala Maluwa' in 'Mahaweli Seya' in Kotmale, besides rehabilitation of ruined temples in his own villages after the Tsunami disaster.
For senior employees who worked under him, he paid his gratitude by providing lands for their shelter and this land is now registered under local authority as 'Weertunge Pura.' Among others, erection of pedestrian crossings covered with overhead roofs leading to Sri Pada College and the parlour at Kudaoya cemetery are some. He was also a foster parent to numerous schoolchildren, even up to university and other institutions, which is worthwhile to mention.
He was a successful businessman, great social worker, active industrialist and above all a kind-hearted employer.
Before we conclude this brief note on appreciation to the newspapers, late Weeratunge will no doubt shower the blessings of the Triple Gem to attain the most blissful Nibbana for the meritorious deeds he had done towards religions. Although he will no more participate in society physically, the name Weeratunge will be written in gold letters in the history of Hatton for what he had done for humanity.
Dr. M. N. Weerasuriya,
President

LakshmiWikkramatilleke
Compassionate soul
I write this appreciation in memory of my dear aunt Lakshmi, whose birthday we remember on May 25. She was suddenly called to rest with Jesus on November 11, 2016, at the age of 93 years in Nugegoda and her Husband Clive Wikkramatillake, predeceased her in August, 1980, both leaving memories in life. They were blessed with three sons, namely, Charith, Suren and Ranjan, all of whom are married and doing well by profession.
Aunty Lakshmi, was the third in a family of five to late Dr. Hector and Mabel Ekanayake. Clarence and Lalitha (Lala) were the older, while Eric and my mother, Premeani, were the younger siblings.
It was Aunty Lakshmi who supported her Father in taking care of the name very meticulously when they lost their mother Mabel at a very tender age. She continued to live in their ancestral home in Nugegoda and grew a beautiful garden which she took much pleasure in till the very end.
She was a caring and compassionate lady who was a mother not only to her three sons, but also to my sister and I who lived next door. In her care for us, she was very fair-minded. She taught us to be loyal and keep the unity of the family whatever our differences may have been.
She worked as a secretary at Ford Rhodes and was also a teacher at St. Johns College, Nugegoda. Our Christmas lunch was traditionally at her home and the fun, frolic and laughter we had during the get-togethers lie engraved in my memory.
She was of course in the centre of the laughter with her humorous storiessomehow being one who saw the funny side of life. Life presented her with a great challenge when she lost her dear husband Clive in 1980. However, her strong faith in the Lord gave the courage to pick up and move forward and looked after her three children. She gave them love and care and they all know that their dear mother has done her best and that it will take some time to heal their hearts.
She was an active member of the Mothers Union at St. Mary and Johns Church and served as their enrolling member. She also served as the President of the Diocesan Mothers Union.
Reading the Bible and morning devotions were an important part of her daily routine. Reading, gardening and collecting stamps were her hobbies. Playing Scrabble was her favourite pass time. Making jigsaw puzzles of over 1,000 pieces also kept her going as her mobility reduced. She was a regular Sunday worshipper in her Church until Christmas, 2015. Aunty Lakshmi was a animal lover too. She always had a dog or two in the house and was a Member of the Animal Welfare Society, Dehiwala. We thank God for her life.
Aunty Lakshmi, you left us suddenly, which was a great shock and loss to the family circle.
'May God grant you peace of Heaven until we meet once again on that Beautiful Shore.'
We miss you a lot, dear Aunty Lakshmi.

Christie Gunaratnam
Dutiful gentleman
Late Wijeratnam Christie Gunaratnam was born to orthodox Catholic parents on January 15, 1940 in Jaffna. Gunam was ailing for a few months and was treated by specialist doctors for a terminal illness in the best nursing homes in Colombo. His family and friends had hope of his recovery, but he suddenly developed a severe heart attack and died on May 10 at the age of 77 years.
God summons the virtues irrespective of their age. As a young lad in Jaffna, he became an altar server in his parish at Our Lady of Refuge (OLR) and also joined the church choir where he was recognized for his gifted voice.
He had his education at St. Patricks College, Jaffna and on completion of his secondary education, he moved to the upcountry for employment and worked as an accountant at the Scottish Tea and Lands Company of Ceylon Ltd.
He married Cathorine Nesamalar on August 22, 1973 and was blessed with two sons, Mervin and Malcolm and a daughter, Melonie. He was a devoted husband, an affectionate father and a loving grandfather, ever dutiful and concerned of their blossoms. He endeared his paternal responsibility with commitment and grace. He brought up his children in the fear of God, instilled noble qualities and gave priority for their education.
His priority in life was his faith in God. He believed in the power of prayers and requested many to pray for his cure. In fact, his life was not that rosy, but for his prayers, God blessed him. His faith sustained him in all his trials.
After his retirement, he settled in Colombo in January, 1996. He became the Parishioner of St. Lawrences Church, Wellawatte and was actively involved in church activities. Gunam has rendered yeoman services to his alma mater and to St Lawrences Church.
He was the Chief Editor for the annual SPC OBA Colombo souvenirs and also the news bulletin 'Bottle Sunshine.' He had great passion in producing caricatures and anecdotes and his articles were appreciated with much interest by all Global Patricians.
He was a prolific writer who enlivened his alma mater and parish. He had contributed volumes of tributes to Patricians and even to his brother Ganam. When the Patricians heard about his illness, they volunteered to help him financially for the services he rendered to our alma mater, which he acknowledged with gratitude. He was a unifying force among the Global Patricians. Gunam, a stalwart of St. Lawrences Church, Wellawatte, had served as the Editor of the church's quarterly bulletin 'ECHO.'
He was an active member of the church choir and was also an organizer of holy mass for the elderly and the sick during festive seasons and also conducted the 'way of the cross.' He was an ardent devotee of Divine Mercy of Jesus and never failed to attend the first friday novena and played an important role at Divine Mercy Feast celebrations.
He was also the Chairman of the 'Platinum Jubilee' souvenir magazine committee which produced very valuable data and photos of the Church history, which remains as treasure for parishioners. He served with utmost zeal and dedication in the parish and earned the admiration of the young and old. He was a faithful friend at times of need; many were privileged to have moved with him closely and had enjoyed his love and wisdom. He adhered to his convictions and never wilted under pressure. He was a man of principle and discipline, with sound character and charisma, with virtuous and adorable qualities.
As a choir member of Our Lady of Refuge in Jaffna, he earned a name for his golden voice. He sang the hymn 'Addaikallame' with his stentorian voice, bringing in heavenly atmosphere. He was a most lovable personality, gifted to entertain with witty jokes, lifting spirits up at parties.
Being a friend, I enjoyed his wisdom and kindness. Having fulfilled his obligations towards his family and relatives, he cherished his fruitful life on earth and entered into his glory to thank and praise the Lord Almighty in Heaven
His demise is an irreparable loss to his family and friends.
May the Merciful Lord of love receive him into the heavenly kingdom and grant him eternal bliss.
May he rest in peace.
Sorrows tried him,
Faith sustained him,
Earth lost him,
Heaven gained him.

Rukie Eheliyagoda
A mothergreatly loved and cherished
I send this bouquet of words of love
To her heavenly abode above
Reached the milestone three score and thirty
Embraced life's hues gallantly
and cheerfully.
A Mother so gracious, never to find
So understanding, compassionate and kind
When troubled,
always found her by my side
Never to leave until my tears were dried.
The fabric of the family closely woven
Held firmly by a thread rare and golden
Teaching integrity, loyalty and generosity
Above all to love and fear God in humility.
A smile ever present; voice like a nightingale
A heart that quickly melted with each sad tale
Envy, hatred, vengeance found no place to dwell
In her soul, never to be claimed by hell.
Anything worth doing is worth doing well and fast
Her motto for life through the years past
Caressed by her love my days so happy and calm
an endless labour of love by a marvellous Mum.
God picked me out from the rest
and gifted me a Mother
Better than the best

Bakeer Markar
Unique leader
On September 23, 1997, nearly two decades ago, the demise of Marhoom Al Haj Mohammed Abdul Bakeer Markar was a shock.
Popularly known as M.A. Bakeer Markar, he was a well-established criminal lawyer in the Kalutara Bar Association. Bakeer had a busy legal practice due to his honest and charismatic approach to clients.
He worked tirelessly on his cases. In addition to his legal prowess, Bakeer was a multi-linguist and great orator. This helped him to compete for the Beruwala Parliamentary seat in 1977.
He developed a flourishing political career and became the Chairman of the Beruwala Urban Council and later, became the first elected Member of Parliament for Beruwala. In 1977, he became Deputy Speaker and later, was elected as the Speaker in Parleament.
He was also appointed as a Cabinet Minister without portfolio and the Governor of the Southern Province. Even when the President and Prime Minister were out of the country, Bakeer served as the acting Head of State.
Born on May 12, 1917, in his ancestral hometown Beruwala, Bakeer was elected President of the Kalutara District Branch of the Ceylon Bar Association. Bakeer always showed his love, kindness and the loyalty not only to his friends and colleagues, but also to others.
He was a rare breed of politician, ever-willing to pass on his expertise and knowledge to the next generation.
I still remember a story told by my father, the late E.T. Kannangara, about this great son of Sri Lanka. My father, who was in the Health Department, said, he had a rare opportunity to talk with the late Bakeer Markar during one of his visits to Parliament with the former Health Minister Gamini Jayasooriya. The former Minister had introduced him to my father saying that Bakeer was unique as the last Speaker in the old Parliament and the first speaker in the new Parliament.
Educated at Sri Lankas popular Muslim school Zahira College, Maradana and Sri Lanka Law College, the late Bakeer was a strong supporter of the United National Party. He had no enemies. He loved all people irrespective of their caste, creed or religion. The huge gathering at his funeral spoke volumes of his public life. People from all walks of life paid their last tribute, genuinely pouring their tears. The gap he left is unbridgeable.
It is also my pleasure to speak few words about his son Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, whom I have a very close friendship with him. Whenever we meet, he never forgets to utter even few words about his father. Like his father, Imthiaz too always admires the peace among all people whether they are Sinhalese, Muslims, Burghers or Tamils.
Educated at Ananda College, Colombo, Imthiaz is very versatile in all three languages: Sinhala, English and Tamil. A lawyer by profession, Iimthiaz was the Minister of Media in 2002 under the Ranil Wickramasinghe Government .
Let me quote a few lines from the great bard William Shakespeare to put my pen down.
'Fear no more, thou thy worldly task hast done.

BBS clash with Police in Kurunegala
A tensed situation erupted in Kurunegala on Saturday night when a Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) mob led by its Leader Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera tangled with the Police when the monk was to be arrested.
Ven. Ganasara thera hurled abuse at the Police and used obscene language at the Prime Minister also threatening to take the people to streets to overthrow the Government.
The incident took place around 10.30 pm at Thorayaya in Kurunegala. BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Withanage said the BBS group led by Ven.Gnanasara thera was returning after a Dhamma sermon at Sulugal Viharaya in Ibbagamuwa.
The Police Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) had informed Ganasara thera on Friday that the Police needs to record a statement from him over a complaint. However, the monk had stated that he could not make it in the weekend as he has got some arranged work to attend and that he would come on Monday.
After the sermon, our plan was to have tea at Kurunegala and proceed to Anuradhapuara as we had arranged a couple of meetings and a Pooja at Thuparamaya. As the Police blocked the road we decided to turn back, but before we do that the Police blocked the other side of the road too he said.
However, Withanage said the Police could not produce any document to support the arrest of the monk.
There had been a lot of heated arguments said Withanage adding that the officers from different Police stations and the STF were called in to the scene. We were surrounded by over 200 policemen including several officers from the CCD. We had about 20 persons in our group and people who were in the roadside also thronged. Finally, the Police decided to recede he narrated.
The BBS mob was heard shouting at the Police aggressively demanding to clear the road blocks also threatening to set the area on fire.
Withanage said Ganasara Thera prior to his Kurunegala visit met with the Chief Prelates in Kandy and informed them on the move to arrest him.

Blessed Always
The Buddhists the world over celebrated the thrice blessed day. The Enlightenment of the Buddha led to the emergence of the doctrine of the Dhamma Go forth Bhikkus taking the message into the world and explain to them what I have explained for the wellbeing of the majority and the solace of the living so said the Buddha.
The message thus proclaimed was brought to our motherland from India the Jambuddweepa. Ever since Sri Lanka has had a long history of religious and cultural ties with India. (The service rendered is too wide a subject to be dealt with here). As history continues to evolve and reshape itself so have the religious links and ties with India in particular and other neighboring countries. From India and Sri Lanka Buddhism spread to Burma. Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, China and Japan in the East and also countries in the West like UK, USA and European countries in the recent past. European scholars too have begun to study Buddhism.
Many Buddhist monks have taken Buddhism to almost every country in the globe. The Buddhist missionary monks of the 19th and 20th centuries have performed a great service by establishing the Buddhist Missionary society to propagate the Dhamma through books and various other publications, organising seminars, discussions and meditation retreats as well as youth training and Dhamma activities. This means a Buddhist awakening and a great revival in its true sense. From time immemorial Sri Lanka has been the most important place that played a vital role in protecting the Theravada Doctrine. It was clearly unfolded touching life at all points covering the entire process of moral conduct. Sri Lanka had long realised that Theravada Buddhism was the most important in the life of Buddhists. The ancient royalty, the most commanding, has made us proud of our past in upholding Theravada. Several ancient kings occupy a unique place in pioneering the Buddhist resurgence enthusiastically. In this back drop there was no doubt that the Dharmadweepa was fairing well, for the betterment of the human society.
Incredibly a special event
Now going back to my topic what a dream come true when a religious event of great significance and such magnitude was held in Sri Lanka for the first time in the annals of history. This is none other than the International Vesak Festival celebrated in the Motherland recently. Thanks to the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and organisations concerned for the magnanimous task. The United Nations Vesak Day is held annually since 2002 on a plea from the United Nations in 1999 by the then Foreign Minister, late Lakshman Kadiragamar - a true son of the Lankan soil, a distinguished university product during Jennings era who claimed that it was not Oxford but Peradeniya that made him a classy all-rounder to serve the Motherland.
Being a Theravada Buddhist country the main aim of having the International Vesak festival was to spread the message of love and compassion and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. UN has been a long term organisation in Sri Lanka to help achieve her goals not only in national development and reforms in good governance. Hence all heads of states of the Buddhist countries leaders of eight countries had been invited to participate in the celebrations. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Guest at the festival, further strengthening our long standing cordial relations.
The greatest bliss
International Vesak arrangements included the declaration of Vesak Week in colourful Vesak ceremony organised island-wide to celebrate the sacred occasion. The true meaning of Vesak was well reflected in the vast range of activities performed by Sri Lankan Buddhists with great devotion and gusto. Pandals in the city, Vesak zones full of flags and lanterns all the way with wonderful dcor and vibrant colours, Dansalas exhibiting their generosity are just a few meritorious deeds kept in line with the sublime message of Dhamma. Among others there were intellectual discussions, academic sessions, religious observances providing a fantastic opportunity to witness a serene Buddhist atmosphere in keeping with Buddhist Philosophy.

Brazils stock market plunges after corruption claims
Brazil's Bovespa stock market was briefly halted as investors reacted to corruption allegations against Brazilian President Michel Temer.
Stocks plunged more than 10% at the start of trading, prompting circuit breakers to kick in and halt dealings.
President Temer was forced to deny a newspaper report that he had given consent to paying off a witness in a huge corruption scandal.
The Supreme Court has authorised an investigation into the allegations.
On Thursday Temer said in a TV statement: "I never authorised any payments for someone to be silent. I did not buy anyone's silence. I fear no accusations."
"I have nothing to hide. I never authorised anyone to use my name"
"We cannot throw so much hard work [on reforms] done for our country in the rubbish bin."
"I will not resign. I will not resign. I know what I have done."
Investors are concerned that Temer's reform plans could be derailed. The Ibovespa index closed more than 8.8% down at 61,575 points.
Temer is trying to get pension reforms through Congress that would mean men would have a minimum retirement age of 65, and women 62, and most people would contribute more. There is currently no minimum retirement age.
There are also labour reforms on the cards to weaken trade union bargaining powers and make hiring and firing workers easier.
"I've never seen anything like this", said one trader with decades of experience.
Trading was delayed in Sao Paulo's stock exchange and once it opened, the circuit breaker stopped all operations within just a few minutes. That has not happened since the global financial crisis of 2008.
In a fortnight Temer was about to start pushing his economic reform plan through Congress.
Until Tuesday markets were very optimistic - but now many don't see how Temer can keep his job if the allegations about a tape in which he condones a bribe payment are true.
What happens next If Temer keeps his job, he will need a Herculean effort to get Congress behind him again. If not, the Brazilian Congress will have to chose a new president indirectly. Getting reforms approved is no longer a top priority for a country still in deep crisis. On Wednesday night, the O Globo newspaper reported that Temer had been recorded discussing payments to silence former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha.
Temer's office said he had never requested payments to Cunha, and called for a full investigation into the allegations.
Two MPs have filed impeachment proceedings against the president.And on Thursday senator Aecio Neves, an important ally also accused in the tape recording, was suspended from Congress and had his house raided by the police.
Cunha was jailed for 15 years in March for corruption, money laundering and tax evasion, as part of a major investigation dubbed Operation Car Wash.
The probe, launched in March 2014, centres on companies that were offered deals with state oil giant Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and political party slush funds.
Almost a third of Temer's cabinet is under investigation for alleged corruption.
Temer played a key role in the impeachment proceedings against his predecessor, President Dilma Rousseff, last year.
She was removed from office accused of illegally manipulating government accounts. She denies all the charges. BBC News

Buddhist delegation leaves for Pakistan
A 34-member delegation led by Most Venerable Kanumuldeniye Chandavimala Mahanayaka Thera, comprising senior monks, religious scholars, government officials and pilgrims left for Pakistan recently on the invitation of the Government of Pakistan to attend the Vesak festival at Taxila for the second consecutive time from May 21 to 24.
Pakistan Acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra and other officials of the High Commission of Pakistan were there to see-off the delegation at the Bandaranaike International Airport.
Despite being a predominantly Muslim country, Pakistan is celebrating Vesak and many countries haver been invited for the Festival.
The delegation will visit different sites of Buddhist spiritual and religious significance in Taxila including the Dharmarajika Stupa, Sirkap, Taxila Museum besides and Takht-i-Bahi.
Pakistan has been the cradle of the Buddhist and Gandhara Civilization for well over 22 centuries. Buddhism left a monumental and rich legacy of art and architecture in Pakistan.
Despite the vagaries of centuries, the Gandhara region preserved a lot of the heritage in craft and art.
The Gandhara civilization flourished in the north-western region of Pakistan from the 6th Century BC to the 5th Century AD. The territory of Gandhara civilization and its heritage is a triangular piece of land about 100 km, east to west and 70 km north to south on the west side of the Indus river surrounded by mountains in the present day Pakistan.
The Gandhara School of Art is credited as being the first creators of Buddha in human form carved in stone, stucco, terracotta and bronze. They were mostly enshrined in monasteries and stupas throughout the Gandhara region.
A major portion of the invaluable heritage has been preserved in the museums and the sacred sites at their original locations.

Celebrating the appearance of Virgin Mary
It was one hundred years ago on May 13 that Virgin Mary appeared to three little shepherd children who were grazing sheep and on this very day that the Bishop of Chilaw, Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis recalled and refreshed the minds of tens of thousands of devotees that gathered to hear their Shepherd's oration on the significance of her appearance to children. Why she chose to appear to children :- 'Because of her motherly love she showered on baby Jesus and watched him grow to childhood, perhaps like these innocent shepherd children who had taken upon themselves to tend to the sheep while their fathers and mothers strived hard to put some food on the table. They represented God's children, obedient to parents and Mary appeared to sustain their love for parents.
The Bishop further said 'All children including the ones who are stirring in their mothers' wombs must be protected. It is a sin to resort to abortions and take a life in the process of being born. We must overcome such crime that amounts to Mary represented hundred years ago and in the coming hundred years dedicate ourselves to the welfare of the young as Jesus desired :-
'Let the children come to me and do not stop them because the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these' Mathew 19,13
Jesus placed his hands on their heads and went away as mother Mary watched all these in silence.
Three tender young shepherd children, Jacinta Marto, Francisco Marto and Santos were grazing their sheep at Fatima in Portugal on this significant day that was unusually balmy and peaceful with gentle breeze touching their weary brows when all of a sudden she appeared in visions to touch their innocent hearts and breathed motherly love. They were not afraid and yielded to her affection. Then she disappeared. Virgin Mary deemed to have appeared six times between May and October 1917 when Jacinta was 7, Francisco 9 and Lucia 10. Her appearances have been linked to three prophesies involving the ravage of World War 1 and the attempted assassination in Rome of Pope John II on May 13, 1981 which was the first anniversary of her apparition in Fatima.
Francisco died in 1919 and Jacinta in 1920 through an epidemic of influenza. Their cousin Lucia lived until 2005 and became a nun.
CANONISATION
In the presence of over 500,000 thousand pilgrims, Pope Francis canonized Francisco Marto and his sister Jacinta Marto as saints in the historic Sanctuary of our Lady of Fatima watched by millions around the world who watched it live on TV. It is also believed that Lucia by process will became a saint later. Thousands after the canonization, made their way to the Basilica where the tombs of Jacinta Marto and Lucia, two of the three kids who saw the Virgin Mary to pray for them.
OUR LADY OF FATIMA CHURCH
At Mudukatuwa in the Diocese of Chilaw where Rev. Vasantha Tissera is the parish priest, the holy event was commemorated. Worshippers in their thousands arrived especially to hear their gentle Shepherd, Rt. Rev. Dr. Valence Mendis deliver the sermon on the theme of the day on children.
Bishop Valence Mendis though an eloquent speaker always speak in simple language so that the poor and the not-so-literate understand his message and who make up the majority of his Diocese. Apart from them, there were hundreds who crossed-country never to miss him speak as he keeps gathering more and more to his flock because of his spiritual deliveries and devotion to God. If one is lost, he will go search for the sheep like Jesus did.
After everyone left the Fatima church, they carried with them his spiritual aura that lingered. He is truly a child of God.

Construction instead of college, and ways to live in the world
Start on a spring day, drowsy with pollen, watching the sun shine on the new leaves outside the window while a class of some description droned on. This was the eleventh grade. I hadnt read the book. I was maybe stoned from lunch.
I dont remember the exact class or the exact day but I do remember the longing inside. On the other side of the window was a wide and various world, full of possibility, and I just needed the nerve to seize it. I was an ocean of restlessness, a volcano. What did I want Where did I want to go Anywhere but here. Anything but this.
No dramatic moments: I just tapered off, quit doing any of the homework, quit showing up after lunch, or if I did show I had Mateus ros and hashish on my breath. By the last of the school year, the ending was obvious. I spent a regular summer, drove to California, slept on the beach, and when everybody else went back to school in the fall I went to a construction site in the suburbs and tried to get hired on.
Why construction I had heard the money was good, which turned out to be semi-true: for a skilled carpenter or bricklayer, yes, but for a pick-and-shovel guy, not so much. More than that, I wanted to prove myself. My father made his living with a typewriter; I had grown up among white soft privileged children. There were parts of the world I didnt know, and I was curious about them. I was listening to Muddy Waters and The Band and Mississippi Fred MacDowell and I wanted to get down to something real, something I could touch. Something romantic about this quest, maybe even something ridiculous, I think I knew this at the time. But school had already started without me.
So I found myself one rainy fall day looking for Big Jim. I found him on the plywood floor of a half-finished house, drinking coffee out of thermos cup and eating a raw onion as if it were an apple in big crunching bites. What do you want he asked.
I told him I wanted a job.
He looked me up and down and laughed. No mystery why: I had hair halfway down my back and a George Armstrong Custer mustache. I looked more like a member of the Byrds than a working man.
He laughed again and said, Go find Mr. Baker and tell him to get you some gloves.
I stood there trying to understand what he meant.
Well, go on, he said, and went back to his onion.
I went back out into the damp afternoon, asked about Mr. Baker.
I think theyre pouring a sidewalk today. Over there.
The people I knew who were going to college were no smarter or funnier or better with language than these people.
I wandered down through houses and building sites. They were putting in a whole new neighborhood, several houses at a time, a hundred or more in all. Some of the houses looked finished, others were just framed, others were simply holes in the ground. Down near the end of the subdivision, where most of the houses looked nearly complete, I found a group of black men leaning on their shovels, waiting for something.
Mr. Baker I asked.
The oldest of the group stepped forward, looking at me.
Jim put you on he asked.
I nodded.
Oh, well, he said, and sighed. Lets get you some gloves.
I followed him over to a clapped-out Ford pickup truck. The company had about a dozen of these, all identical, and I would log many hours in them in the next year.
Are you even eighteen he asked.
Yes, sir. Nineteen in January.
He seemed amused but I didnt know why. His eyes were kind, though, and tired-looking.
Waiting on the cement truck, he said. All set to pour if it dont rain.
This was as much of an introduction to the labor crew as I ever got.
Two days later, I wanted to quit. I had blisters on my hands, a tweaked shoulder, assorted cuts and bruises. I had wrecked my nice hiking boots working around wet concrete. Also, the site was not a particularly nice place to work. It was organized around strict racial and hierarchical lines: the stonemasons and bricklayers at the top, mostly Italian, mostly from Maryland; the carpenters in the next rung, Scots-Irish from Virginia and West Virginia; and at the bottom, the labor crew, all black except for me and one other hippy kid, mostly fresh up from the country of North Carolina and Tidewater Virginia. Nobody talked to anybody else except for occasional yelling. Big Jim would drive by in his pickup truck, wherever we were working, and roll the window down and yell Assholes and elbows! I dont want to see nothing but assholes and elbows!
Sometimes hed stop and get out and demonstrate what he meant with a 30-second burst of activity with the shovel, flinging dirt furiously all around. Then a glare as he drove away.
A pretty unpleasant place to do pretty unpleasant work. I stuck it out anyway. As I said, I started out trying to prove myself, which is a game with weird rules. Essentially it meant that I had to do the same dumb thing for as long as it took to get good at the dumb thing and for the dumb thing to stop killing me.
I did get good at it, more or less. I got to the point where I could do it with a pretty major hangover, which happened. My hands got harder, my back got stronger, I got some regular boots and some really good gloves. Also, I learned the art of just working enough. Mr. Bas Mr. Baker was universally knownwas very good at calculating this. - Lit Hub

A doctor attached to the Colombo National Hospital (CNH) following a Tamil language Training course at the Agalawatta National Languages Education and Training Institute who went on a field tour with a batch of 80 other doctor colleagues to the Makeli Ella (waterfall) in Palindanuwara died after slipping and falling into the waterfall on May 13.
He was identified as Dr.Thameera Dissanayake (27) of Aruppola Kandy.
Dissanayake had been trying to take pictures of the batch standing dangerously on a slipping rock when he had suddenly slipped and fallen into a deep spot in the waterfall and disappeared in the water.
When the Baduraliya Police was informed Police along with officers from the Makeliya Army Camp and neighbours conducted a search operation in the lower reaches of this waterfall but they had to abandon the search on May 20 night due to inclement weather conditions.
When they resumed the search on May 21, Navy divers who came to the assistance recovered the doctors body around 7.30 a.m. stuck in 30 feet deep water. When the media personnel visited the Galewatta National Languages Training Institute to gather more information about the tragedy they were disbarred from entering the institute premises by the security officers.

Defence Discipline with fun drills thrills and spills
We have already discussed the importance of introducing children to the martial arts and how the discipline can help calm and focus young minds while teaching them important skills. Yet one may wonder what courtesy has to do with martial arts. To many the two disciplines may seem totally opposed to each other. The term martial arts conjures up visions of combatants going at each other with a flurry of punches, kicks and lethal strikes aimed principally at demolishing an opponent.
True, but that is an image mostly projected by many action movies that provide conflict buffs with high-octane entertainment. Some parents are concerned that teaching kids martial arts may make them violent, but the reverse is actually true. Studies have found that some form of such training actually made them less violent than their peers.
The most important benefi
Its true that the word martial is related to war and fighting. But as a sport, martial arts offer kids an excellent opportunity to learn athletic skills, self-defence, respect, and self-discipline. They also learn when and where kicking, punching, and wrestling are appropriate. And equally important they learn where not to.
Activities such as tae kwon do, kung fu and aikido are a fun way for both boys and girls to achieve fitness and focus. Some parents may think they also promote violence, but thats a myth, according to experts. The martial arts actually help teach self-discipline and socialisation skills. In fact, many parents whose children have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report great success with these programs because self-control and concentration are exactly the skills underdeveloped in ADHD kids.
A typical hour-long class begins and ends with a bow to the teacher, or master. After a warm-up, students practice the arts particular skills, which may include kicks, punches and blocks. Each requires concentration and strict attention.
With children it is much more important to emphasise the need for self defence only. An adult understands when it is appropriate to use martial arts skills. With children, you really need to stress that it is not ok to solve our problems with force. If this comes from a positive role model, children take it to heart.
Progress is often marked by the belt system, which takes the beginner from a white belt through a variety of colours until black. Testing for each new level, generally every three months, is a good exercise in setting and achieving goals.
But, say experts, its the respect kids learn, whether from bowing or standing still and waiting for the next command, that can be the most important benefit: It often carries over into school, helping to improve behaviour and even grades, according to recent research.
The right type of humility
Whether a child is punching a pad or breaking a board, he or she must be incredibly focused on the action. When a child learns to concentrate energy on the task at hand this same focus can be applied to schoolwork assignments.
Another significant aspect is effort. Students are always being hard-pressed to give 100 per cent of endeavour on a consistent basis. Students are unfailingly encouraged to kick a little higher or punch a little faster or with more power at every training session. This motivates them to never accept less from themselves and makes them realise their true potential. It also teaches children that they can be far better than average when it comes to achieving higher academic grades.
Most instructors tend to be extremely strict when it comes to behaviour in dojo classes. They will not tolerate excessive jabbering or horsing around in the dojo. Improved behaviour in martial arts classes often translates into improved behaviour at school, which in turn enhances grades.
Courteousness demonstrates that you have what it takes to be a leader and shows you have self-control. It also exhibits the fact that you possess the right type of humility and want to avoid confrontation. Remember that most punch ups start with words. Courtesy and elegant behaviour is your first line of defence.
Conventional martial arts, in their varied forms, teaches you to show consideration to others. And its not just towards your teachers or fellow students, but everybody you meet and interact with in your day to day life. In a traditional martial arts school courtesy is not an option. It is the norm.
A variety of different ways
Anyone wanting to learn the skills of codified systems and traditions of combat practices should first learn to be courteous. And when you train in an environment that demands courtesy and mutual respect, you are bound to develop those qualities to even higher standards of excellence and practice them in your daily life.
Yes, and the discipline is appropriate for kids with special needs as well. Children with attention deficits may find a new sense of focus in martial arts. With its emphasis on balance, coordination, concentration, and flexibility, kids martial arts can be beneficial for children with a variety of physical, emotional, or cognitive challenges.
The reason children gravitate towards the martial arts is that they are seeking a route to self-empowerment in a frightening world. The children want to be strong, capable, and physically coordinated. They also want to become, in a very real sense, the hero of their own story.
What you should look for is a teacher that ignites that passion in the children, and then keeps consistently high expectations for focused effort and hard work, while also modelling and embodying the deeper philosophy of good martial arts practice.
The ability to defend oneself against an assailant is an empowering feeling. Most martial arts disciplines use self defence as a cornerstone of the entire program.
The precise methods will vary from discipline to discipline, but you can be certain that with regular practice, your children will learn to defend themselves in a variety of different ways. Many martial arts schools also teach street-smart techniques to kids to help avoid problems altogether.
As students become stronger physically and they begin to realise they can handle themselves in dangerous situations, they become more confident individuals overall. A heightened sense of self confidence will certainly benefit children throughout their lives. So never be impartial to the marvel of the courteous arts that are martial.

Dry heart of the creator
Paris was never really Camuss cup of tea, and certainly not when, newly arrived there in the spring of 1940, he was living in a drab hotel room in Montmartre and doing humdrum secretarial work at the newspaper Paris-Soir. But in his spare time, he was frantically busy. On completing a full draft of Ltranger at the end of April, he sat down in the middle of the night and wrote to his future wife Francine Faure back in Algeria.
He confessed to her that the intensity that came with writing was the only thing that can get me beyond myself and I believe that I will forgive everything in Paris for having allowed me to live locked up like this in what I was doing. Even if it didnt have value, the joy of the work itself has a value that no one can destroy and it is that joy I would feel tonight if I werent so tired. I still imagine that the reader of this manuscript will be at least as fatigued as I am and I dont know if the continuous tension felt within it will not discourage many souls. But that isnt the question. I wanted this tension and I worked to transmit it. I know it is there.
Just how many souls the book may have discouraged is hard to tell. What is certain is that it gripped the imagination of influential figures such as Andr Malraux, whose strong recommendation paved the way for publication. Watch out: this will be an important writer, he predicted to Gaston Gallimard. As for the German censors, they judged the work to be apolitical. But even with these doors opening, Camus could never have envisaged the extent of the novels future success. With more than 10 million copies sold in France alone and translations into sixty languages, it has become an icon of twentieth-century world literature. Alice Kaplan tells the life story of Ltranger (The Outsider in Britain, The Stranger in the United States) with verve and insight.
The vogue for the American novel in France in the 1930s helps explain why Hemingway is frequently cited as an influence on Camus. Kaplan focuses more tightly, however, on James M. Cains The Postman Always Rings Twice and draws some striking parallels. And yet the origins of Ltranger were intensely local. As Kaplan explains, Camuss work as a reporter working for Alger-Rpublicain meant that he was covering court cases that reflected the tensions and violence that were part and parcel of colonial Algeria. In the edgy Algiers life of the period, pimping, street violence and machismo were all part of the mix. Kaplan reports specifically on a case of racial segregation on Zralda beach outside Algiers in the summer of 1942 and the killings of Arabs that followed.
If such a climate of violence finds its way into Ltranger, so too does the posturing of courtroom officials that had caught the eye of a young journalist on the lookout for copy. Kaplan cites the example of a French judge, Louis Vaillant, who, dealing with a Muslim defendant accused by the colonial authorities of murdering a conservative Islamic leader (this was the El Okbi trial of June 1939), produced a crucifix to let the defendant see what the guiding principle of the judges life was. In the novel, Camus would assign the cross-wielding role to Meursaults examining magistrate.
Again, in the letter to Francine, Camus wrote of being desperate to stay in what he called the atmosphere of the book. The grating tones of cultural and ethnic assertion are central to that atmosphere. Kaplan reminds us of the contrasting readings of the novel, of how publicists in post-war America, for example, lumped its young author and Sartre together as exponents of a new European trend called Existentialism and of how Edward Said, writing almost half a century later, would insist that behind what he called Camuss portentous metaphysics lay the novels nameless Arabs. Kaplan also draws in Kamel Daouds Meursault contre-enqute (2013), a rewrite of Ltranger which tells how the family of Meursaults unnamed Algerian victim not only have names but also live lives blighted for decades by frustration and resentment. As Daoud explains to Kaplan, Ltranger means different things for American, French and Algerian readers.
But another key to the atmosphere of Ltranger is its style. Recalling the novels distant and empty narrator, Kaplan asks: How can such a disturbing book elicit so much loyalty If the tone was what intrigued so many readers, Kaplan draws out powerfully how Camus was discovering his craft: To write, he mused, one must fall slightly short of the expression rather than beyond it. No chit chat. Pas de bavardages en tout cas, reads the original diary entry of August 1938. After the wordy expositions that had gone into his failed novel La Mort heureuse, Camus was fashioning a narrative voice that was disarmingly pithy. He reflected in his notebooks on the dry heart of the creator.
Kaplan vividly recreates the atmosphere surrounding the books material production in wartime France: the miles clocked up by the manuscript as it crossed back and forth between Occupied and Free zones; Malrauxs speculative query to Camus, now back in Algeria, about the cost per ton of shipping paper over to France should it be needed at the printers; and the lack of red tape  the book went to press on April 1, 1942, and a month later Camus had yet to see it or even a contract for it. But of course finding a big Paris publisher was the prize for someone more used to tiny print runs in Algiers.
As Kaplan observes, Ltranger was an odd work for someone building a reputation as a humanist. While the novel evokes the disturbing life of a social marginal, Camuss work as a journalist drew him increasingly into the public arena. In the summer of 1939 he had campaigned in Alger-Rpublicain against the conditions of desperate poverty then affecting the population of Kabylia and he was outspoken about colonial rule. In August 1944 around the time of the liberation of Paris, he was writing editorials for the newspaper Combat.
Yet a decade later, the reality of life for Camus was one of growing social and political isolation. After his bitter falling out with Sartre in 1952 over LHomme rvolt  his controversial essay had presented National Socialism and Communism jointly as examples of state terror  Algerias slide into all-out war in the mid- to late 50s was another cause for despair. As someone viscerally tied to French Algeria, Camus now felt increasingly disabled as a writer. He was drying up. Yet in public he could still make the business of writing sound easy. In an interview in 1959, the year before his death in a car accident, he reflected back on the technique he had used in Ltranger: once I discovered the trick, all I had to do was write.

Dusit International to make Nepal debut
Thailand-based, global hospitality company Dusit International has signed a management agreement with Omstone Asia Capital Nepal Pvt. Ltd. to operate Dusit Thani Himalayan Resort & Spa, the first Dusit-branded property in Nepal.
Located in the heart of Nepals central region, just over an hours drive from Kathmandu and Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM), the luxurious mountaintop resort will comprise 44 well-appointed guest rooms and 20 exclusive villas, each providing magnificent views of the majestic Himalayan range.
Leveraging the natural beauty of its surroundings, with pristine air and good weather year round, the new property will have a wellness spa concept created by Dusits signature Devarana Spa, which provides luxurious, personalized treatments designed to promote emotional and physical well-being. Other facilities will include an all-day-dining restaurant, a bar and lobby lounge, meeting facilities and a swimming pool.
Namo Buddha, a small village which houses the ancient Thrangu Tashi Yangtse Monastery, one of the most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Nepal, is less than ten minutes away by car. Dhulikhel, the administrative centre of Kavrepalanchok District, whose old town is home to many Hindu shrines and Buddhist stupa, is also located nearby. The extension of the highway which links Dhulikel to Kathmandu is expected to complete by 2020, reducing travel time from the capital to the resort to under 45 minutes.

Easy, practical and quick!
Garden Talk speaks to Development officer, Provincial Deputy Directors office of Agriculture Ratmalana P.A.G.C. Siriwardhana on Pot Nursery Management at the Home Garden Level, focusing on vegetable Pot Nursery Plants. Not many of us are knowledgeable about what happens at the nursery stage. Siriwardhana informs us about the nursery stage.
When it comes to nursery management there are many techniques such as bed and pot type. Today we are discussing the pot type. The pot type is the easiest techniques when it comes to home gardening. It is more practical. The early stages of a plant begin in the nursery. In many instances we plant seeds of small size in the nursery. That is normally done. There are many types such as Chili, Tomato, Capsicum and Brinjals, said Siriwardhana
When it comes to Management there is a concept called Root to Shoot Ratio- the ratio between the volume of the roots and shoots. At some stage the plants in the nursery will need to be planted in the field. If the volume of the roots is less than the volume of the shoots then it cannot withstand the shock of being uprooted and planted in the fields  this is called the transplant shock.
Root to Shoot Ratio
When you take the small seeds the vegetable plants that arise have a similar Root to Shoot Ratio. When you take Brinjals, Capsicum, Tomato and Chili the root and shoot ratio is similar. They can be uprooted from the nursery and planted in the fields. This is because the Roots will absorb the water and successfully distribute it amongst the shoots. If the roots ratio is low compared to the shoot ratio, then the roots cannot successfully distribute the water amongst the shoots and the plant will die.
When planted in the fields, plants with an equal volume of roots and shoots can withstand the transplant shock of being planted in the field, explained Siriwardhana.
We know by experience and experiment which plants have less amount of roots and which ones have more roots.
For example we know that Chili, Tomato, Capsicum and Brinjals have a similar Root to Shoot Ratio. Also if there are plants with less amount of roots than shoots, then they are not directly uprooted and planted in the fields. They are planted in the fields along with the mound of soil in the pot that they grew in, stated Siriwardhana.
Container types
In pot nursery the containers can be polythene bags, yoghurt cups, curd or ice cream containers.
However the containers should have good water drainage holes. A good drainage system is necessary. This affects the development of the seedlings. The polythene bag could be 5 inches wide and 5 inches high, pointed out Siriwardhana.
In the nursery the soil is also an important matter.
In the soil media, the Organic manure and the top soil ratio must be 1:1. If you take one container with organic manure, the top soil should be in the same amount. Then it is mixed. The media must be soft without huge particles. It needs to be free of debris. Then the roots can grow freely. However before planting and put into a container, the nursery media also must be sterilized. You need to expose the organic manure and top soil to the direct sunlight and close it with a transparent polythene for two weeks. The heat gets trapped and the soil gets sterilized. You can even use fungicide as another alternative  chemical sterilization, informed Siriwardhana.
The pot filled with the soil medium must subsequently be placed in an area that will protect it from direct rain or wetness and even against strong sunlight.
Then we plant 10  15 small seeds. Again we apply a light layer of the soil (previously prepared soil) over these seeds with a thickness of 1cm. However before planting the seeds we need to do the seed treatment. Here you administer a fungicide to the seeds. This is before planting. You apply a fungicide layer to the seeds. After that the seed is planted in the pots. However at the home garden level applying fungicide is not a really big issue, said Siriwardhana.
Then the pot needs to be covered by a net  a shade net. After that it needs watering. But only the required amount. After about one week the shoots emerge. After the shoots emerge the net is taken off.
Watering
When watering it needs to be done with sensitivity, if the water spray is too strong the seedlings will be damaged. After two weeks we do the hardening process. However before this there is the danger of ants. So in the home garden we hang the pot or apply insecticide (When done commercially), pointed out Siriwardhana.
After a few leaves appear the hardening process begins.
We train the plant to get used to direct sunlight. We increase the amount of exposure to direct sunlight and reduce the shading. A plant that has been exposed to hardening is planted in the field, stated Siriwardhana.
In a pot where we have planted around 10 seeds, the seedlings have to be uprooted and transplanted. In a pot with two or three seeds, without uprooting it can be transplanted. When five leaves appear it is suitable for transplant.
In a pot where we have around 10 seedlings we need to uproot them and plant separately in the field because of the competition amongst the plants - the productivity is low and no spacing. However in a pot where there are two or three seedlings, we can remove the polythene bag and plant the seedlings in their soil mound. When planting without uprooting the productivity is high. The harvest comes quickly, elucidated Siriwardhana.
NURSERY TIMES FOR PLANTS
* If you take Tomato the nursery time is 21 - 28 days
* If you take Chili and Capsicum is 28 - 35 days
DISEASES IN A NURSERY
* One is damping off  for that you need a fungicide. The base of the seedling develops a brown spot/ it rots and the seedling falls down. This happens when there is too much water and when it is watered too much at night.
* Mite attacks  they suck the plant sap and the leaves become deformed. The growth is stunted. You need to administer Miticides.
* Snails and Slugs.

ECCSL to hold tourism seminar on June 7
The European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL) will conduct a seminar titled Sri Lanka Tourism Challenges and Opportunities - the way forward on June 7 at the JAIC Hilton from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm.
Key speakers have been drawn from the industry who have many decades of exposure to all facets of tourism and the hospitality industry. Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga will be the Guest of Honour.
The seminar is ideally targetted at travel agents, hoteliers, hospitality service providers, potential investors in the hotel industry, individuals holding senior executives positions in the hospitality and travel industry and also officials in tourism policy formulation either at government or in semi-government institutions.
The central thrust of the seminar is to create a platform for industry experts to articulate the challenges faced by the industry and to identify the opportunities that lie hidden in the market, that is, whether Lanka has achieved its full potential and to what extent it can further develop the industry.
Industry sources believe that Sri Lanka has not adequately promoted the Ramayana trail in the Indian market and the full potential of promoting and marketing the Ramayana trail has not yet been fully realized.
Hindus still hold the Ramayana story in high reverence and even the dredging of the Sethusamudram project had met with stiff opposition from political parties affiliated with the Hindu religion. Hindus believe, as the story is narrated in Hindu mythology, that it was a bridge built by Lord Rama.
The tourism industry has faced a number of challenges in terms of policy and regulatory issues, capacity building, training programmes for youth, and non-availability of skilled labour, environmental issues and the issues that concern the investment climate in the hospitality industry.
The seminar will address these issues through the discourse by experts and there will be a question and answer session to give expression to various perceptions and expert views of individuals.
The seminar is open for both members of the ECCSL and nonmembers. For further information, email [emailprotected], [emailprotected].

The benchmark index consequently closed in positive territory for the 8th consecutive week, driving the ASPI to a near 1.5 year high of 6729.66 points.
Renewed local and foreign institutional and HNI investor interest, helped drive turnover value over the week, pushing the weeks daily average turnover ~39% higher W-o-W to average LKR 0.93Bn (cf. LKR 0.67Bn last week and LKR 0.73Bn the week prior).
Relative to last weeks 33%, crossings this week rose to ~44% of the weeks total turnover, amid steady interest in Index heavy-weights such as JKH (~49% of weeks total crossings), Dialog (~24% of crossings), Nestle (~9% of crossings) and mid-caps such as TKYO, AEL. Retailers too remained active participants in the weeks trading, helping overall market turnover levels rise ~39% W-o-W to LKR 0.93Bn.
Invigorated market momentum since late-March has pushed up average daily turnover levels, and daily turnover levels in April and May have averaged LKR 1.2Bn cf. a daily average of LKR 0.73Bn in Q117. Market volumes were also driven by Foreign investors who returned strongly to markets this week to close the week in a net buying position for the 16th consecutive week (net foreign flows for the week was LKR 1.2Bn cf. LKR 0.21Bn last week). Markets in the week ahead are likely to experience some profit-taking but retain its general trend of positive momentum.
Sri Lanka regainsGSP+ tariffconcessions
The EU on Wednesday reinstated GSP+ tariff benefits to Sri Lanka, approx. 7 years since withdrawing the preferential trade scheme. Under the GSP+ scheme, effective May 19th 2017 Sri Lanka will be able to export >6,000 products duty free to the EU.
Although the additional tariff concessions gained by industries varies, sectors such as Apparel, Processed Foods, Seafood, Toys, Porcelain and Ceramic-ware are among the main beneficiaries under the scheme.
Within the Apparels sector for instance, duties for most apparel categories are reduced from 9.6% to 0%. Zero duties are also available for sectors such as Seafood (previously 18.5%), Fresh & Processed Fruits & Vegetables (previously 12.5%), Porcelain & Ceramic-ware (previously 8.4%) and Toys (previously 1.2%).
As apparel remains the biggest export to the EU (~61%), the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce estimates that the additional duty reduction (via GSP+) is ~$60Mn, and leading apparel exporters anticipate a 10-15% boost in export earnings over the next 12 months while export volumes are expected to increase by as much as 25%.
The EUs reinstatement of GSP+ is expected to ease pressure on the countrys B-o-P and debt servicing issues and should help transition the country towards a more export-oriented economy. Nevertheless, the country remains eligible for the concessions only until it graduates to upper-middle income economy status, underscoring the need to implement long term and structural changes to increase the countrys export competitiveness.

The Groups primary dealer arm, First Capital Treasuries PLC, was the main contributor towards the financial results recording a profit after tax of Rs. 343 million for the year 2016/17 (2015/16  Rs. 11million) attributed to net interest income and fair valuation gains on government securities. First Capital Treasuries, is the pioneer non-bank primary dealer appointed by Central Bank in 1982 and is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Further, the companys credit rating was reaffirmed by ICRA Lanka as A- with stable outlook.
The capital markets advisory of the Group, First Capital Limited, which specialises in structuring and placement of corporate debt securities, successfully mobilised Rs. 12.4 billion through structuring and placement of corporate debt securities.
Despite the above performance First Capital Limited was negatively affected as a result of higher funding cost and fair valuation losses on trading securities. The performance of the Groups subsidiaries were further impacted due to damped investor sentiments as a result of the proposed changes to taxation via the budget proposal  2017.
Despite the setback experienced in the preceding quarters, the Group is optimistic in its outlook and have planned several calculated improvements to its operations, said Director / Group CEO, Dilshan Wirasekara.

Foresting the analog way
Analog forestry was developed by a group of scientists and researchers led by Dr. Ranil Senanayake in 1980 at the Belipola Arboretum, Bandarawela.
Analog forestry was conceptualized at this time to meet the challenges brought about by conventional thinking to forestry.
The main principle of Analog forestry is to work on bringing the natural vs. anthropogenic needs back to harmony. This objective was reached through design approaches to reforestation which have been influenced by natural systems.
Analog forestry is a specific approach to agro-forestry developed in Sri Lanka. It restores the productivity of degraded land and provides new sources of food and income to local people.
An analog forest is designed in such a way that it imitates the original native forest in an area and has similar (analogous) structures and ecological functions.
Trees and crops are planted in different layers, providing food and marketable products such as spices (pepper, cinnamon), fruit (mango, citrus) and tea and coffee, which grow particularly well in the shade of the trees.
The analog forest also provides firewood, fodder, construction materials and medicines for daily use. Analog forestry minimizes the use of external inputs such as agrochemicals.
The method enhances biodiversity, soil fertility as well as water retention and quality. Analog forests serve as a buffer against climate change.
The principles of analog forestry can be applied in many different ecosystems and climates as long as they are adapted to the local situation.
Analog forestry is a method which has immediate results and can be applied everywhere Analog forestry can be applied in many different ecosystems and climates. There are successful analog forests in Sri Lanka, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica and 18 other countries around the world.
The basic principles of the method need to be adapted to the local ecosystems and the situation of the local communities.
In Ecuador it has been used to successfully regenerate abandoned pastures whose soils had become completely degraded. After the first year the farmers were already harvesting fruit and spices.
The shade provided by the trees and other plants was favourable to commercial crops.
Within 5 to 8 years they had established diverse agro forests that were highly productive.
In Sri Lanka analog forests provide local food crops as well as commercial crops such as tea, coffee, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, pepper, cashew nuts, mango, papaya, etc. Within these forest gardens a small plot is set aside for household consumption.
One farmer increased her yearly income from 7,000 to 27,175 SL Rupees in just 4 years. Such results can be achieved without chemical fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides or heavy machinery, but by creating compost, plant nurseries and combinations and successions of species.
Analog forestry and integrated landscape management in Sri Lanka
Belipola, is a 17 acre oasis, where lush vegetation rises high above the forest floor.
The massive broadleaved evergreens, stately palms and various fruit trees support an array of vines, lianas, orchids and other epiphytes, while a host of herbs, shrubs and cycads crouch below.
The air is cool and humid; the earth is soft and damp. Majestic Hornbills can be seen perched among the branches. Although it was founded relatively recently, the area very nearly resembles an old-growth tropical rainforest.
Briefly, the method consists of selecting forest species  both native and introduced  which are economically valuable while at the same time analogous, in physical structure as well as ecosystem function, to those present in a naturally occurring forest at various stages of succession (in this case, the climax profile of an upland tropical rainforest).
In this way, the land serves to support biodiversity and maximize ecosystem services while at the same time bolstering rural livelihoods and promoting food security.
Principles of analog forestry
* Observe and record: knowledge of the terrain one is working with is highly important in restoration.
* Understand and evaluate: in order to understand an ecosystem, one needs to make use of local knowledge, field surveying, and ecological evaluation.
* Know the land: knowing the lay of the land extends to watercourses, slopes and microclimates.
* Identify levels of yield: restoring an ecosystem can increase biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic production, but one must be aware of the capacity of the land.
* Map flows and reservoirs: water, light, air and nutrients flow through, and are stored in, ecosystems Knowing the enrgy flows in an ecosystem can help in planning future actions.
* Reduce external inputs: an ecosystem with a high level of biodiversity has the advantage of providing a large portion of the necessary inputs that are necessary for the functioning of the farm.
* Be guided by the needs of the landscape: each area forms part of a landscape, whose characteristics must be taken into account in the design process.
* Follow ecological succession: like a person, a forest matures in phases. Some plants grow early on, before being replaced by others and yet others, as the ecosystem progresses to a stable state.
* Use ecological processes: the idea is to imitate nature, not to struggle against it. It is important to look at the ecosystem in a different way and understand the uses of its diverse elements.
* Value biodiversity: a variety of plants and animals is the source of vitality for the ecosystem, as they contribute nutrients, drive ecological processes, and are indicators of environmental resilience.
* Respect maturity: the mature forest provides many environmental services and increases its productivity.
* Respond creatively: prepare for the unexpected, and always be aware that there are alternative ways to reach your goals.

Geoffrey Bawa Award for Excellence
Geoffrey Bawa Award for Excellence in Architecture 2016/2017 is the fourth cycle of triennial awards hosted by the Geoffrey Bawa Trust, and it has certainly contributed in no small way to enhancing the contemporary architecture in Sri Lanka.
What distinguishes the Award is that the shortlisted projects are visited by the judges, as well as a technical team, and does not depend merely on images. The Geoffrey Bawa Trust celebrates the shortlist, as well as the awards.
This year's panel of judges are the distinguished Singaporean architect Mok Wei Wei, Ward Beling representing the Geoffrey Bawa Trust, President elect D.H. Wijewardene representing the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects, and Sharmini Perera of Raking Leaves the founder of the Sri Lanka Archives for art, architecture & design, Jaffna. (as the informed lay person.) The Bawa Trust has received 65 submissions.
"The judges felt that most of the submitted projects show a high calibre of architecture. The judges, having deliberated in January, visited 15 projects, out of which 11 have been shortlisted. Also for the first time, we have two unexpected projects which have been shortlisted. One by a non- architect who is Sri Lankan and the other by a foreign architect.
This suggests that Sri Lankan architecture has attained a level of maturity of design, where non-professional Sri Lankans are also able to participate in this prestigious project."states the Bawa Trust in a press release.
The judges will make their final deliberations, and select the winner who will be presented with the prestigious Geoffrey Bawa Award for Excellence in Architecture on Sunday , July 23, 2017.

Gifts of Dhamma for Ananda and Nalanda through Peoples Bank Sulohitha Sansdaya
Sulohitha Sansadaya is an initiative by old Anandians and Nalandians currently employed at People's Bank to display banners containing words of Dhamma in both schools. With the aim of further uplifting the long existing brotherhood between Anandians and Nalandians, especially to inspire present students about that strong bond shared between the two schools, many projects were carried out by old Anandians and Nalandians currently employed at Peoples Bank, throughout the past years.
Since 2013, the newly-admitted children for Grade 1 of both schools were granted with Sisu Udana Pass books under this initiative by their own contributions. Recently, banners depicting the proper management of money for a blessed lifestyle as preached by the Buddha were displayed in both schools. The Principal of Ananda College, the deputy principal of Nalanda College, other deputy and assistant principals, teachers in charge of Sisu Udana and old Anandians and Nalandians employed in Peoples Bank, along with other executives of the Bank, graced the occasion of revealing the banners.
In correspondence to this, the launch of the Sulohitha Sansada Facebook page also took place at the Ananda College Centenary hall.

Vesak celebrations in New Delhi would further augment the historic Indo  Sri Lanka socio-cultural linkages and the time tested goodwill between the two peoples as amply manifested during the visit of Prime Minister Modi to Sri Lanka for the UN Vesak Celebrations last week, Education Monister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam stated, while the Indian Minister of State Kiren Rijiju welcomed a significant leap in New Delhis cultural calendar symbolizing one of Indias greatest gifts to the mankind  Buddhism. These observations were made at the inauguration ceremony of the first ever Vesak Pandal in New Delhi, as the final phase of the celebrations organized to mark the Vesak 2017 by the High Commission of Sri Lanka.
The Pandal would be on display for a week, taking the centre stage in an area that had been lit up since the Vesak day, with hundreds of lanterns and buckets making it a Vesak Kalapaya or a Vesak Compound in New Delhi.
The ceremony commenced with the invoking of the blessings by the Maha Sangha led by the Chief Incumbent of the Varanasi Centre of the Mahabodhi Society of India Ven K. Medhankara Thero and the Chief Incumbent of the New Delhi Centre of the Mahabodhi Society of India Ven R. Sumiththananda Thero. The traditional oil lamp was lit by the Minister of Education of Sri Lanka Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in India Chitranganee Wagiswara, Minister of State for Home Affairs of India Kiren Rijiju, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment of India Rajesh Athawale, New Delhi Municipal Council Chairman Naresh Kumar and the Joint Secretary of the Indian Ocean Region Division of the Ministry of External Affairs of India Sanjay Panda.
The ceremony was attended by the clergy, political dignitaries, city officials, diplomats, members of the academia and a cross section of the general public, to mark the inauguration of the glittering artwork of the 40 feet high Pandal erected overlooking a park along the Shanti Path which is also known as the Ceremonial Route in the diplomatic enclave in New Delhi. The Pandal attracted the local crowds in numbers soon after its 15,000 multi-coloured bulbs illuminated the night skies. Although the Buddha Purnima is a government holiday and is celebrated by the Buddhists in India, Vesak Pandals are not a widely known cultural feature.
Internationally recognized
High Commissioner Chitranganee Wagiswara welcomed the gathering and outlined the importance of the Vesak day and the extensive arrangements made by the High Commission in collaboration with the City authorities to celebrate Vesak in New Delhi. She spoke of Buddhas universal message of peace which is internationally recognized by the United Nations following the initiative taken by the former Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka Lakshman Kadirgamar. She also referred to the Prime Minister Modis remarks in Sri Lanka on Limitless possibilities of our shared future and our Friendship that lives in the hearts of our people and is the fabric of our societies.
The Staff of the High Commission, and their family members joined by a group of Sri Lankan expatriates sang Bhakti Gee. As the lights were switched on by the Ministers and the High Commissioner and Colonel Kumara the leader of the Sri Lanka Army Engineering Corps team which erected the Pandal, the Hindi translation of the story of the Pandal  Angulimala was played in the background.
A special 16 member team from the Engineering Services Corps of the Sri Lanka Army erected the Pandal and the main structure which was brought from Sri Lanka while the necessary facilities and assistance was secured in India.
The High Commission of Sri Lanka has been facilitated to carry out this task by a group of well wishers and sponsors both from Sri Lanka and India. They include Sri Lanka Navy, Sri Lankan Airlines, ICT Maurya Group in India, RITES Ltd in India, Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) and the Indian Oil Company (IOC).

GM to stop  making cars for Indian market
General Motors (GM) has announced that it will stop making cars for the Indian market by the end of 2017.
The firm, which sells its Chevrolet brand in India, said it would continue to provide maintenance services. It also said that its plant in Maharashtra would continue to make cars for overseas markets, mainly central and south American regions.
GM has announced similar plans for South and East African markets as part of its global business restructuring. The US carmaker said it would stop selling cars in South Africa, and sell its manufacturing business there to Isuzu Motors.
It added that Isuzu would also purchase 57.7% shareholding in its East Africa operations, assuming management control. The firm is aiming to make significant savings through these steps.
"As a result of these actions, GM expects to realise annual savings of approximately $100m (77m) and plans to take a charge of approximately $500m in the second quarter of 2017," it said in a statement.
GM's announcement comes against the backdrop of predictions that India will become the world's third biggest vehicle market by 2020. But the firm has put faith in exports from India.
"In India, our exports have tripled over the past year, and this will remain our focus going forward," GM International president Stefan Jacoby said in a statement. GM had planned to invest $1bn in India to boost its domestic presence, but its sales figures fell below below 1% in the year ended in March 2017.
"We determined that the increased investment required for an extensive and flexible product portfolio would not deliver a leadership position or long-term profitability in the domestic market," Jacoby added. BBC News

GMOA strike today
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will launch an islandwide 24 hour token strike today (Monday, 22nd) from 8.00 am to 8.00 am on the following day (Tuesday) on five demands, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the token strike will be launched because the government allegedly attacked, injured and arrested innocent students who protested against the fraudulent SAITM institution. The failure to arrest the person/persons responsible for the bomb attack on Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is another reason for the strike.
According to Dr.Zoysa, the law has not been enforced on the culprits involved in the `shooting drama staged by the former SAITM CEO and this is the third reason for the strike. The fourth reason is the programme implemented by the Government to repress of trade union leaders.
The fifth reason for the strike is not investigating the complaints made by the GMOA to the Police and to the Bribery Commission in connection with permitting state hospitals to conduct clinical training for SAITM students,Dr.Zoysa said.
The Accident Service, maternity hospitals, childrens hospitals, the Cancer Hospital, Kidney Hospital and Dialysis Units and hospitals of Armed Forces will not be affected by the strike,he added.

Government will not burden people with further taxes: Finance Minister
The government is not prepared to further increase the tax burden on the people. What should be done under the existing situation is to trap the non-tax payers in the net, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The Finance Minister was addressing the 22nd annual conference of the Inland Revenue Service Association held with the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on May 19 at the Sri Lanka Foundation.
It is up to the people to decide whether to obtain more foreign loans as the previous regime did or to increase government revenue in order to reduce tax burden on them, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
. No advice is necessary from international organisations to strengthen the countrys economy. The current administration has been maintaining the necessary financial disciplines to that effect, the minister said.
President Maithripala Sirisena opening the 22nd annual conference of the Inland Revenue Service Association by lighting the auspicious lamp. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake looks on.
There is a rapid progress taking place in the Inland Revenue Department.
We have been able to achieve this status through a creative programme supported by your views and being enhanced by modernisation, the minister said.
At the time we took over power on January 8, 2015, the state revenue was 10.2 percnt from the GDP. With the contribution by the Sri Lanka Customs, Excise Department and Inland Revenue Department, the 10.2 percent revenue was increased up to 15.3 percent. The advantage is that such revenue would help reduce tax burden, he said.
We are able to prepare our own system depending on your knowledge and our confidence. The new Draft Bill will be created accordingly. Experiences from all countries will be used to create the Draft Bill. This is not created on the guidance of a particular person or entity. There is nothing included in the Bill that could harm the sovereignty of the country. No foreign country can dictate us what sectors should be taxed and what should not be taxed. It will be decided by the government. I will say with responsibility that the International Monetary Fund is not an entity that takes people hostage but an organisation constantly prepared to assist needy countries. Therefore, I assure that the Good Governance administration led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would never allow a harmful thing to be happened to the country, he said.
Our tax revenue in 2012 was Rs.305 billion. It was Rs.355 billion in 2013, Rs.366 billion in 2014, Rs.421 billion in 2015 and Rs.466 billion in 2016. Our target in 2017 is Rs.609 billion. Had we collected this revenue in the past, do we need to impose VAT Our revenue was not sufficient to repay the loan instalments at least. Then how did we go forward as a country the minister asked. What we want is not to increase tax but to get the current tax evaders into the tax system. The current population in our country is 23 million. Of this 23 million, 48,000 are direct tax payers. When we assumed office in 2015, the total number of tax files including the Nation Building Tax and VAT were 609,000. With your commitment, this has risen up 1.5 million today, he said.
The Minister said that when VAT percentage was increased to 15 percent, he saw it as a crime and imposed it with discontent.
If we continue to increase tax revenue in this manner, by end of this year or possibly at the beginning of next year, we will be able to reduce VAT to 9 percent or 10 percent. I would like to remind you that it is the best commitment that we can do for the people. We are ready to do that. But what we should think again and again whether to do this by obtaining more foreign loans or increasing our revenue. How did we increase our income by 50 prcent during the past two years Did we tax everything No! What we did is to make a group of non-tax payers pay ta, the minister said. Our VAT revenue in 2012 was Rs.230 billion. It was Rs. 251 billion in 2013, Rs. 275 billion in 2014, Rs.220 billion in 2015 and Rs. 283 billion in 2016. We anticipate Rs. 380 billion VAT revenue in 2017.
However, I would like to state proudly that we were able to collect the revenue that we projected for the first five months within the first three months, he said.
The minister said the IMF needs not to dictate Sri Lanka and the best Inland Revenue Department is functioning in Sri Lanka.
If we need to take the country forward, what should we do is not to put hurdles in the way or conduct protests but to extend us some strength such as building a house for a needy family or provide a job to an unemployed individual at least. By doing such services only, we can be happy one day as contented public servants, the minister said. State Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena and Inland Revenue Department Director General Kalyani Dahanayake were present.

## Title: How to start your indoor garden
## Supertitle:

How to start your indoor garden
Save money and get a head start on your garden by starting plants and vegetables from seed in your home.
Choose your plants and buy the seeds
Home and garden centers sell plenty of seeds. But Melinda Myers, a Milwaukee-based gardener and author of more than 20 horticulture books, says you'll get a wider selection of plants with online or mail orders.
"Some lesser known or less popular plants, or newer varieties, aren't available yet in stores, so you have to start with seeds," she says. And with seeds, you can get what you want. So Myers encourages gardeners to take advantage of online or mail order by buying something unique, rather than buying easy-to-find radishes or roses that every home center carries.
Seeds are less expensive than plants, so you'll save money, but the package may contain more seeds than you need. In that case, Myers says, save some for next year. Or, plant them all and swap seedlings with friends when it's time to transplant them outdoors.
Make, Buy, or Reuse Containers
When you grow seeds indoors, any number of items can make good containers. Empty yogurt cups are the perfect size-about 2 inches square by 2 to 3 inches deep.
Myers also likes to loosely wrap newspaper around a 21/2-inch-thick dowel, press the lower ends of the paper together to create a bottom, then remove the rod and fill the newspaper cup with potting mix. This makes transplanting easy because the entire paper container is biodegradable, so it can be placed in the garden. "It's a way to recycle and reuse," she explains. Just be sure to use a container that lets excess water drain out. If roots sit in excess water, they rot.
So cut holes in containers if they don't already have them.
Dedicate an Indoor Garden Location
Pick a convenient spot in the house for the garden.
When the seeds are first planted, heat is more important than light. Myers says you can start the seeds in a warm location that doesn't have to be lit. But once the seedlings break through the soil, they need light.
You can start seeds in a basement corner or even in front of a large window that lets in lots of sun for warmth. If the window is drafty, though, pick another spot-seeds and bulbs do best in warm soil. When the seedlings are visible, you can move them to a bright location under artificial lights. Or, better yet, a spot that receives sunlight as well as artificial light.
Prepare the Soil and Plant the Seeds
Preparing the perfect soil is much easier for indoor gardens than their outdoor counterparts because you're dealing with a lot less space. Use a seed-starting or sterile potting mix right out of the bag.
Most seed packages tell you what time of the year to plant them based on your region or the average last spring frost. If you're not sure, ask a local gardener. It is possible to start too soon-if plants grow too large indoors, they get stressed when they're transplanted. But if you start too late, the seedlings don't mature enough indoors.
Water wisely
The trickiest part of indoor gardening is giving the plants the right amount of water, without over-watering. "It's almost impossible to water correctly, so drainage holes in your containers are critical," Myers says, adding that she sometimes uses a mist bottle to water newly planted seeds. "You want enough water to moisten the soil without washing out the seed."
Check the soil moisture daily. "You want the soil about the consistency of a sponge that's been wrung out," she says. Sticking your finger into the soil is a quick way to tell if it's getting enough water. It should be moist all the way through so that roots will go downward. Covering the container with damp newspaper or plastic holds in warmth and moisture, but remove the cover once the plants break through the soil.
Light It Up
Even plants that receive natural sunlight benefit from cool and warm fluorescent lights. "You have the best results if you supplement your natural sunlight with light from a bulb," Myers says. "This gives you a full spectrum of light." She recommends full-spectrum CFLs and LEDs for more energy-efficient artificial lighting.
Hardcore gardeners place aluminum foil or whiteboard on the surfaces around containers to reflect light, Myers says. "This lets you maximize the light by reflecting it back toward the seedlings."

I am not afraid of being arrested or going to jail: BBS General Secretary
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said yesterday there is a plan to arrest him to fulfill the needs of Muslim extremist politicians.
He said he would start a protest before the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters if the Government used different laws to suppress Sinhala Buddhist activists and support Muslim extremists.
Speaking to journalists after paying a courtesy call on Most Ven. Tibbotuware Sri Siddahartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at Malwathu Maha Viharaya, Kandy, Ven Gunanasara Thera said he is not afraid of being arrested or going to jail. But, we oppose the Governments plan to obstruct our activities for protecting the rights of Buddhists by upholding the Muslim extremist vision of Rishard Bathiudeen and Azad Salley.
The authorities should arrest corrupt politicians allegedly involved in the destruction of artifacts, antiquities and archaeological sites, wildlife conservation and spreading racism, before they arrest me.

Jetwing Yala highly recommended  at the 2017 Green Hotelier Awards
The worlds most eco-friendly and sustainable hotels have been listed by the 2017 Green Hotelier Awards as part of Responsible Business Week and Jetwing Yala, the only Sri Lankan hotel, has been highly recommended for its sustainability initiatives in the Asia Pacific region.
The annual awards invite applications from hotels of any size anywhere in the world, judging them on their efforts to reduce energy and water consumption, waste output, roles as responsible businesses to their employees and in the local community, as well as looking at how they communicate their sustainable and responsible ethos to guests.
A winner and high recommendations were selected from the European region, Africa & Middle East, Asia Pacific and the Americas.
Through the awards the organisers suggest that more hotels than ever are measuring their performance on energy, water and waste, and setting themselves new targets each year.
Committed to sustainability initiatives through the Jetwing Hotels Sustainable Strategy, Jetwing Yala has one of the countrys largest privately owned solar installations of 300 kilowatts, which meets 40 percent of the hotels daily electricity needs.
The plant supplies excess energy at peak back to the national grid, helping to cushion grid fluctuations experienced by local residents.
Its cooling is operated by a vapour absorption chiller, run sustainably via steam generated from a biomass boiler using sustainable cinnamon wood procured locally. Hot water is provided entirely through renewable energy, and lighting is 100 percent LED.
The renewable energy applications and efficient operations reduce CO2 emissions by about 60 percent when compared with conventional technologies.
All waste water is collected, treated, and reused onsite. All waste generated at the hotel is separated at source and quantified prior to disposal.
As for water needs, seawater is filtered through a reverse osmosis system, ensuring no strain on the scarce freshwater resources of the region.
The waste water is separated at source and treated black water is used for gardening purposes while treated grey water is used for the cooling towers and further disinfected for use in cisterns.
The property also homes its own compost machine and plant whereby all organic waste is treated and used as organic fertilizer for the hotel gardens and farms.

Land ownership deeds for 10,000 Mahaweli families
The national programme to grant land ownership deeds for 100,000 Mahaweli families took place with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena at Vilayaya Maha Vidyalaya at Aralaganwila in Polonnaruwa on May 15.
On the occasion, 10,000 families of Mahaweli systems B and C received deeds for the state land in which they have settled in.
The programme is being implemented on a promise given at the presidential and general elections.
Here, making a speech, Minister Daya Gamage said the programme was progressing successfully with the support of Mahaweli officials.
The settlements that began through D.S. Senanayakes Galoya and Gamini Dissanayakes Mahaweli movements developed due to the commitment of the settlers, he said.
As a result Polonnaruwa and Ampara districts have been able to produce 40 percent of the countrys rice requirement, said Minister Gamage.
The Korean technology will be provided to raise the production in order to achieve the ability to export rice by next year, he said.
He noted that the Moragaha Kanda movement launched by the President would add 350,000 more hectares of agricultural land.
Minister Gamage added the Ministry of Primary Industries and the Export Agricultural Department would distribute JCT mango, pepper and cinnamon plants among recipients of the land ownership deeds.

Love at First Bark
Have you ever been awakened by a brown-eyed beauty who walks over to your bed long before the sun decides to leave his own bed, stands only millimeters away, her lips grazing your cheeks to see if you are awake (or alive) If you pretend to be otherwise, woe betide, she will sneeze right in your face. And when you reluctantly open your eyes you see her gazing at you, smiling, panting a hello! Even though the alarm clock says its 4 in the morning, you cant help grinning back.
Welcome to a story you already probably know a lot about: Devoted dog: Besotted owner. Sure they are more work than cats. Sure, they make bigger messes. Sure, they eat more. But they also have bigger hearts. They just want to love and be loved. And really, who can turn a blind eye to all that love, adoration and enthusiasm
No wonder Andy Rooney once said, The average dog is a nicer person than the average person. And Rudyard Kipling wrote, When the Man waked up he said, What is Wild Dog doing here And the Woman said, His name is not Wild Dog any more, but the First Friend, because he will be our friend for always and always and always. And George Bernard Shaw observed,If you eliminate smoking and gambling, you will be amazed to find that almost all an Englishmans pleasures can be, and mostly are, shared by his dog. And Charles M. Schulz said, Happiness is a warm puppy.
Sweet little bark
In the form of a bulldog perhaps, or a chihuahua or a Labrador or the best of them all - a puppy picked up from the street. All of them are guaranteed to put you on top of the world with just one sweet little bark. Miss Asia Kinney, is the bulldog who knew how to do it right and caught Lady Gagas, heart. Asia has her own Instagram account, has appeared in a television trailer and is even set to launch her own line of pet products. Heiress and reality star Paris Hiltons Tinkerbell, was with her for 14 years, was inseparable and usually lived in her handbag.
Sadly, Tinkerbell is no more, but, comfortingly, she left behind three brothers and sisters who make equally gorgeous accessories for the glamorous 34-year-old. Ben Fogle of BBCs Castaway fame has Labrador Storm. He and his wife Marina, bought Storm at a poignant time. We call her Storm because of the way she stormed into our lives, he says. We got her just after Marina had a late miscarriage, a few weeks before our little boy was due to be born. It was by no means a replacement but it was something to look forward to as a family. Having a dog teaches you to be less selfish because you have to look after them.
Ben also believes dogs and their owners can share personalities. When people choose a dog they try to match their own personality, or the personality theyd like to have. Ive always had Labradors and I think Im slightly Labrador-esque. Im quite chilled, quite laid-back, l like to please people... and Im also quite greedy.
He could be right. Recent studies have found a very clear correlation between peoples personalities and what type of dogs they owned; for example, people who owned toy dogs tended to be more intelligent, while owners of utility dogs like Dalmatians and bulldogs were the most conscientious. Other studies have found that dog owners in general are more outgoing and friendly than cat owners. But be careful: Dogs also take on their owners personality traits, so if you fly off the handle all the time, it might explain why your dog is so bad tempered too!
Feelings of happiness
Hopefully, not for long. Not if you pause for a minute to gaze at your dog. A 2009 study by Miho Nagasawa of Azabu University in Japan found that ones level of oxytocin (the neurohormone that elicits feelings of happiness) raised intensely after interacting with their dogs. And the only interaction they needed was to stare into their dogs eyes. Those who looked longer into their dogs eyes had the bigger dose of oxytocin.
And then there is the meaning of a dogs gaze, too. Like the human gaze which is layered with nuance, dog owners may ascribe similar complexity to their dogs gaze, too, certain that they, like parents, can interpret it. If your dogs gaze helps you think your dog understands you, says Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, New York, this can produce bonding.
Dogs, of course, offer more than just companionship. In fact, everything about owning a dog seems to lend itself to better health. Just the act of petting a dog lowers heart rate and blood pressure. A Chinese study found that people who own dogs get better sleep at night and are sick less often. Other studies show dog owners have slightly lower cholesterol and are more likely to survive a heart attack.
While other pets have positive effects on your health as well, dogs have the added benefit of needing to be walked and played with numerous times a day. This means most dog owners get the recommended minimum 30 minutes of exercise a day, lowering their risk of cardiovascular disease and keeping them in better overall shape than cat owners (sigh) or people without pets.
Sense of security
Dogs can also be an effective home security system. Studies show that barking dogs deter burglars. Just knowing that you have got a dog who can use its keen sense of hearing to detect anyone prowling around can help increase your sense of security, which is good for both your mental and physical health.
But for me, it is John Grogan, who best sums up the magic of having a dog in our lives. A dog has no use for fancy cars, big homes, or designer clothes. A dog doesnt care if youre rich or poor, clever or dull, smart or dumb. Give him your heart and hell give you his. How many people can you say that about How many people can make you feel rare and pure and special How many people can make you feel extraordinary So, the next time those big brown eyes gaze at you, deeply and lovingly and the tail goes thump thump thump on the floor, caress that silky head and let your heart leap.
Fun facts about having a dog
1: When you drop food on the floor, they will eat it. They also like to eat the random scraps of food left behind.
2: They force you to exercise. Dogs like to go for walks. It gives you the perfect excuse to roam the neighborhood at night and look through your neighbors windows. (But in a totally non-creepy way).
3: They are always happy to see you. Your dog will get so excited when all of you are finally home.
4: When you are home alone you have someone to talk to. And your dog will look at you and cock their heads and pretend they understand. (If you tell your puppy how smart she is she will chase her tail around until she is dizzy and falls over.)

Mobitel brings joy of Vesak to visually impaired through Nethrabhimana
The National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel brought the light of joy to the visually impaired in the country on Vesak day, with an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform, that enabled users to listen to the stories on display on five prominent Vesak Pandals in Colombo this year.
Mobitel set about to remain true to its slogan We Care, Always by sharing the joy of the celebrations with the visually challenged. Mobitel combined one of the oldest methods of communication in the form of storytelling with modern technology, to bridge the gap that previously prevented the visually impaired part of society from experiencing the splendor of Vesak.
Along with the supervision of the Sri Lanka Federation of the Visually Handicapped, Mobitel accompanied two luxury buses with close to 50 visually impaired citizens to experience the ambience of prominent Pandals located in the city.
Enabling them to take part in other Vesak activities such as enjoying Dhansal and walking in groups along the illuminated streets. The IVR platform enabled those who could not be in the vicinity to experience Vesak in the comfort and the safety of their homes.
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of Nethrabhimana the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Federation of the Visually Handicapped, Nawarathne Mudiyanse said I believe that what Mobitel has conceptualized for the first time ever through this effort is an act of great thoughtfulness and empathy towards those of us who are less fortunate.
Mobitel aims to raise awareness about the hardships faced by the visually challenged population living in Sri Lanka and remove societys blindness to their plight.
With this small gesture of goodwill, Mobitel used its brand to communicate the message of equality for all human beings living in the country including the visually impaired. From the reactions received it was evident that they had immensely enjoyed the Vesak outing and had an unforgettable experience overall.

Most Everest summits
A 44-year-old Nepalese mountaineer has broken her own world record for the most Everest summits by a woman after scaling the worlds tallest peak for the eighth time.
Lhakpa Sherpa, the mother of three, conquered Mt Everest for the eighth time from the North Col (Tibetan side), according to expedition organisers.
Lhakpa reached the summit point at around 6:35 AM yesterday, Mingma Gelu Sherpa, Managing Director at Seven Summit Adventure, was quoted as saying by The Himalayan Times. She bettered her own record of scaling Mt Everest seven times.
Before leaving for Tibet in mid April, Lhakpa had said that she wanted to show that Nepali women have the courage and endurance to perform their best despite all their hardships. She reached the summit point along with Nima Dorjee Sherpa.
Born in Makalu VDC of Sankhuwasabha, Lhakpa scaled Mt Everest from Tibet side for the seventh time in the last spring season. This time, she broke her own record, Sherpa said.
Lhakpa had reportedly scaled Mt Everest eight months after the birth of her first daughter and while she was two months pregnant with her second child, the report said.

She wants to climb Mt Everest for 10 times, the report said. A former store worker who ended her 12 years of marriage with a Romanian-American climber two years ago, she believes in mental strength as the key to success.

Muslim MPs to meet President ,PM to stop BBS campaign
Muslim Parliamentarians in the Government have collectively decided to meet the President and Prime Minister to urge immediate intervention of the two leaders to stop the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) campaign that instigates communal tensions.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, UNP MP M.H.M.Navavi said they hope to hand over a letter signed by all Muslim Parliamentarians to the President today seeking an appointment with him as the President was to leave for Australia on Tuesday.
The Muslim Parliamentarians are a real clout in Parliament as we have a representation of about 10 percent. If no action is taken we will be forced to take stern decisions he said.
Muslims in large numbers voted for the President and the Government expecting that the problems faced by them would ease, but contrarily things are getting out of hand now he said also adding that the Jumma Mosque in Mallawapitiya, Kurunegala had come under attack by an unidentified group on Saturday night. The MP, who was travelling to Mallawapitiya, said he would meet with the Kurunegala District DIG and discuss measures to maintain security in the area.
The MP stated the BBS led by Ven. Ganasara Thera are trying to create unnecessarily problems to detach the Muslim people from the President and the Government. The idea behind all these is to topple the Government and theres is nothing else, Navavi said.
UNP MP Mujibar Rahuman said mob attacks on Muslim religious places and shops have increased lately. He said within the past week four mosques and 5-6 shops have been attacked. He said a shop in Elpitiya had come under arson attack on Saturday night.
We demand the Government to implement the law against the culprits behind these incidents he said.

New beginning for Iran
In giving a strong mandate to reformist Hassan Rouhani to continue as President for a second term, an overwhelming majority of Iranians have rejected isolationism and fundamentalism and opted for closer integration with the rest of the world. This is a great result for the people of Iran as well as the International Community.
According to Iran's Interior Ministry as reported by Irans Press TV, Rouhani (68) won about 57% of the vote with more than 23.5 million votes against his main challenger conservative Ebrahim Raisi's 15.7 million. In a live speech carried by State TV, Rouhani said on Saturday that the vote showed Iran's willingness to work with the international community and a rejection of hardliners.
Indeed, the tenure of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was an unmitigated disaster for Iran, which faced crippling Western sanctions for continuing its Uranium enrichment programme. Rouhani knew more about the effects of sanctions than anyone else - after all he was the countrys chief nuclear negotiator who reached a deal with European nations to halt Uranium enrichment back in 2004. However, differences between the two men led to Rouhanis resignation and the recommencement of the nuclear programme, which resulted in sanctions.
Rouhani, who grew up in Sorkheh, a small town in Irans northern Semnan province, is from a conservative family. As a young law student, Rouhani was heavily involved in the Islamic Revolution that saw the ouster of the Shah. He rose rapidly through the ranks of power in Tehran and later met an inspiring leader who would change his outlook on the world.
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, under whom Rouhani served as National Security Advisor, is his mentor and inspiration. Rafsanjani understood the importance of opening up to and working with the West and Rouhani too followed in his footsteps. After winning the Presidency in 2013, Rouhani oversaw Irans participation in a multilateral initiative in 2015 to halt the nuclear programme. It began with a telephone conversation with then President Barack Obama, the highest-level exchange between the two countries since the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover and hostage crisis in Tehran.
Despite new US President Donald Trumps initial promise to rip up the nuclear agreement, it is still holding on and so far, there is no sign that either side will dishonour the agreement that has lifted the sanctions imposed on Iran. Although there is no immediate sign of a further thaw in US-Iran ties, the country is already reaping the benefits of the lifting of most of the sanctions.
To cite an example, both Boeing and Airbus have signed multi-billion agreements to supply hundreds of new aircraft to replace Iran Airs ageing fleet. It has also benefitted the economy by increasing oil production and exports. The oil sector alone expanded by a staggering 65.4%, thanks to higher crude production and exports following the lifting of sanctions. Iran is one of the top oil-producing countries in the world, ranked number seven.
Enforcing this agreement and seeing the rest of the sanctions off is just one challenge facing Rouhani. Rouhani will have to work hard to push his reform agenda which has seen the resumption of the publication of reformist newspapers, release of imprisoned journalists, expansion of 3G and 4G networks for smartphone usage and many other beneficial moves. He will no doubt have to keep in mind the fact that ultimate power in the country rests with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has held the title since 1989. Khamenei controls the country's Security Forces and can veto any presidential policies. In fact, Khamenei has challenged some aspects of Rouhani's rapprochement with the West. Rouhani will thus have to engage in a finely balanced act on the international stage.
The sluggish economy which took a major hit from the international sanctions remains a major concern, with youth unemployment at a staggering 12.7 percent (mid-2016). Iran is basically a young country and this could lead to discontent among the youth. Inflation is down, but this has slowed down the economy. The IMF has projected that Irans economic growth will stabilize at 4.5% over the medium-term, as the countrys recovery broadens. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 6.6% in 2016-17 and to ease to 3.3% in 2017-18.
The export and production figures too are not very positive. Rouhani has already talked of a workforce training programme aimed at ending joblessness that has left the electorate largely disappointed with his promise of economic recovery. Years of sanctions have kept foreign investors at bay and with the new developments in the US, most investors are unwilling to take the plunge in Iran. The countrys disorganised banking system is another cause for worry. Iran's dual foreign exchange rates regime is also seen as an obstacle to the country's reintegration into the global banking system and payment networks.
Rouhani will have to grapple with all these issues and his job will not be an easy one. But under his reformist drive, Iran has the potential to become a beacon of hope for the region.

PATA Annual Summit concludes
The Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Annual Summit (PAS 2017), hosted by the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, concluded at Jetwing Blue Hotel, Negombo, Sri Lanka last week.
Under the theme Disruption, Innovation, Transformation: The Future of Tourism, the event also featured a half-day UNWTO/PATA ministerial debate where industry leaders and government representatives discussed the topics The Shift to Recognised Sustainability Leadership and The Sharing Economy in Travel and Tourism.
We were happy to host the event in Sri Lanka as it would give good mileage to market Sri Lanka as a destination, said PATA CEO Dr. Mario Hardy. Trends are so positive, and tourism is growing and is expected to grow further. There are a few megatrends coming up which are forming the global economy as well as deciding the future of tourism. These are the aging population, generations Y and Z, and the growth of the middle class.
The global population is aging and as a result a significant tourist segment is emerging, named silver hair tourists with specific desires and needs in terms of customistion, service consumption, security and desired products.
In addition, the arrival of millennials, also known as Generation Y and iGen are also contributing to changes in tourism for the future.
These groups are technology-driven age groups, different from one another, with specific needs for communication, consumption and tourist experience. The increase in average income and the fall in levels of absolute poverty are seen in the growing middle class. The middle class population is expected to increase further, up to 4.9 billion by 2030. These characteristics too, will have a considerable impact on the tourism sector.
With the development of technology, it is unlikely that they will follow the traditional travel methods.
PATA Annual Summit 2017, a four-day event, brought together thought leaders and travel and tourism industry professionals from around the world who spoke about the constantly evolving travel and tourism landscape challenged by disruption, continuous innovation and transformation.
Tourism Development, Lands and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said that this is the third time PATA is hosting an event of this magnitude. Colombo, Bentota, Kandy and finally Negombo were the venues for the event.

Piyadasa Sirisenas 71st death anniversary falls today : Ceylonese revivalist
In this tribute we intend to trace in detail how Piyadasa Sirisena became one of the leaders in mass communication in the early part of the twentieth century. Using communication as a tool he launched a long drawn out resistance against imperial rule. He was in a crux a countervailing force against the British rule in Sri Lanka.
In retrospect when communication technology was not available to Ceylonese easily, how did Sirisena, just a single individual reach out to the indigenous mass of Sinhala Buddhists.
As opposed to this situation, the British under whose control this island was, utilized considerable means of communication at their disposal to disseminate information. By this time the British had access to the printing press - The Telegraph, and newspapers. Though printing presses had been established in Ceylon since the mid- nineteenth century, the resources available to the Ceylonese to disseminate printed material was highly limited.
Britain controlled its colonies through dissemination of information. Though technology in communication was then somewhat backward they used it with telling effect to influence the mindset of vulnerable people of the countries they had colonized.
The British colonized these countries using their military might. The idea of the conquest of the weaker countries especially in Asia was to exploit their resources and transfer the material gains to Britain. This was a part of empire building.
It goes without saying that some of the information transmitted to their colonies could rightly be called fake news.
In a forthright article in a leading newspaper recently Farish A. Noor Associate Professor Nyang Technological University, Singapore, states that empires were built on misinformation, twisted information or distorted news which enabled empires to influence and control mass thought.
When you consider the case of Ceylon, a pervasive control was effected in respect of information by one of the principal agents of colonial rule-the Christian missionaries.
Religion is a powerful tool in the mindset of the people especially the unsuspecting masses. It is a known fact that Christian missionaries during the nineteenth century engaged in religious conversions of the people basically in the maritime provinces to achieve their ends. The missionaries built churches all over the country. Along with inducements to change their religion there were also a host of benefits offered for example employment opportunities, school admissions and other such benefits.
But what caused discontent among the masses were not so much the privileges offered to their brethren who converted to Christianity but the false information or fake news the missionaries spread about Buddhism particularly in the coastal areas.
Buddhism had been for ages the central component of life and culture of the Sinhalese community. The faith the people had in the temple, the priests, the sermons and alms offered by them could not be taken away easily though some Sinhalese did give in to material gains. There was, as a result a simmering discontent against the subtle anti-Buddhist campaigns launched by the Christian missions.
The discontent erupted in the form of a debate, through the brilliant communicator - a courageous Buddhist priest in Panadura. The Panadura Wadaya held in 1873 in which the Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera played a significant role, is considered a major step in the Buddhist revival.
During the subsequent years, it was Anagarika Dharmapala who continued the revivalist campaign with great fervour. He himself was a great communicator who launched a series of verbal attacks island wide, against British imperialism.
The Mahabodhi Society which he founded transformed the revivalist endeavor to a high degree, in a truly institutionalized form. On the other hand our country by the turn of the century was increasingly on the path of economic, social and cultural regeneration. According to a leading critic, Professor Nadasena Ratnapala, the resurgent, religio-nationalism which Anagarika Dharmapala had begun, became an important part of the anti-imperial struggle.
It is correct to say that the lively centre of this struggle was a part of the capital city, Maradana.
Emergence of Piyadasa Sirisena
How did the main subject of discussion enter the picture of national and Buddhist revival.
Born in 1875, in a verdant and laid back village named Induruwa, just three kilometers south of Bentota, he moved to Colombo on being offered employment in a furniture establishment. Piyadasa Sirisaena was no doubt inspired by Anagarika Dharmapala. He admired Dharmapalas courageous crusade against the British.
Sirisena began his career in a quiet manner by contributing to publications begun by Irvin Gunawardena-a businessman. The publication - Situmina was first published in 1895 and a little later Sirisena contributed articles to Sarasavi Sandaresa edited by a leading newspaper man named Hemendra Sepala Perera. It is widely believed that it was Perera who opened the door enabled Piyadasa Sirisena to launch his illustrious career which in due course impacted on our society.
The central theme of his work was revivalism. Ceylon at this time had a growing literate populous. They were increasingly conscious of their political rights and their ancient Buddhist heritage.
It was through Sarasavi Sandaresa that Piyadasa Sirisea was able to serialise his first novel Roslin and Jayatissa. In 1903 Sirisena began to publish his newspaper Sinhala Jatiya. In the meantime Anagarika Dharmapala who held the view that the Sinhala Buddhists in this country did not have a Buddhist newspaper, launched the Bauddhaya. Having observed Sirisenas growing dedication to the Buddhist revival and his deep interest in connected work, Dharmapala entrusted the task of editing The Bauddhaya to him.
By this time, he was deeply involved in literary activities. As a result of his editing both Sinhala Jatiya and Bauddhaya, there appeared a conflict of interest. This made Sirisena resign from the editorship of the Bauddhaya. In 1909 he began publishing Sinhala Jatiya as a bi-weekly paper.
As the twentieth century advanced Sirisena grew in stature and recognition. His communication skills brought him into close contact with the formal leadership of the country. Among such leaders were D.S. and F.R. Senanayaka, Dr. C.A. Hewavitharana, and W.A. de Silva.
The Temperance Movement
The British liquor policy at his period of time began to impact adversely on civil society. It not only caused addiction but also harm to the general life pattern on the Ceylonese society.
The liquor issue and the quest for freedom in combination, gave rise to considerable opposition and became a gathering force against British rule.
Piyadasa Sirisena became a flag bearer of the temperance movement. The leaders of the country, enlisted Sirisenas support and his communication skills in the battle against British administration.
The Green book published by the Times of Ceylon states that the Sinhala Jatiya press was established as far back as 1907. It proved to be of the greatest significance to the Sinhala reading public since it not only published a newspaper but also numerous novels which had a wide circulation among the literate Sinhalese.
Sinhala Muslim riots of 1915
In 1915 an event of historical importance which turned the tide against British administration- the Sinhala Muslim riots, were to cause a serious setback to British rule in Sri Lanka. The details of this episode are too well known to be repeated. Piyadasa Srisena along with other Buddhist leaders were arrested on the charge of inciting the Sinhalese against Muslims. He was released from jail after two months. It is an unfortunate blot on British history of this country that young Captain Henry Pedris lost his life in the course of the riots. He also became a national hero following the sacrifice of his life.
We began this exercise by stating that Sirisena was one of the foremost communicators of this nation during that turbulent final phase of British rule.
In all Sirisenas novels and the newspaper the central theme was the Buddhist and national revival and the ancient heritage of the country.
a) Sirisena published twenty novels, beginning with Roslin and Jayatissa which according to Sinhala critics became a landmark in the history of Sinhala novels. He is also widely considered the father of the Sinhala novel.
b) He published several books on poetry. Amongst the eleven published were Dampal Siritha, Jayawardena Sathakaya, and Swarnamali Maha Kavya.
c) Sirisenas publications sold over a 100,000 copies in all during his life time which perhaps is unmatched in the history of this country except in the case of school texts prescribed by the Department of Education from time to time.
Piyadasa Sirisena as many critics state brought about a silent revolution in the thinking of Sinhala people of this country.
Finally we need to emphasise that Sirisena despite his virulent criticism, did admire certain aspects of British administration of this country.
In particular he liked their drive towards a modern state, the legal and education system, in addition to economic advancement brought about in the country.

Political, land problems of N&E Provinces should be solved: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a solution should be found to political as well as land problems. While paying attention to political problems and finding solutions to them, we should build up the economy to ensure a high living standard for the people in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
The Prime Minister was speaking to the media after a meeting with peoples representatives and state officials in the Jaffna district on May 19.
The Prime Minister said Today, I had discussions with the Chief Minister of the Northern Province, Provincial Ministers, Provincial council members, Parliamentarians representing the Jaffna district and our Ministers.
The Northern Province is a Province that was devastated by war.Economic activities continued in other districts during the war time. Late President Premadasa opened 200 garment factories in the South during the war time. Galle city was developed during the period of war. But, the economy of the North was completely broken down and devastated for 25 years due to the war.
Currently, the Northern Province seriously lags behind in terms of economic growth. The rate of economic growth should be above 6 percent if a region was to achieve development. The Northern Province should be development if it is to achieve more than a 6 percent rate of economic growth, the Prime Minister said.
Economic development of the Northern Province would also benefit the economy of the South and the Sabaragamuwa Province.
have malefic effects on the Southern Economy too, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said in order to increase the rate of economic growth and make progress, sectors of the economy which had collapsed should be developed by paying special attention to them. This task could not be handled by the government only. The central government, Provincial council and investors should join together in order to achieve these talks. The government had paid special attention towards bringing in investments, the Premier said.
Discussions had already been held regarding industrialisation, infrastructure development Housing and development of tourism, agriculture and fisheries, the PM said.
We have also decided to work together. We will create an integrated mechanism at the Provincial Council and Central Government level where a committee composing Provincial Council Ministers, Jaffna District Parliamentarians and Central Government Ministers would be appointed, the Prime Minister said.

## Title: Politicians in the making

Politicians in the making
Politicians throughout the world, for their own reasons, leave some groups out of national conversations. One such group is the younger generation. They are well aware that engaging young people in politics is critical to the safeguarding and strengthening of democracy in any country.
Global statistics prove it. People between the ages of 20 and 44 make up 57 per cent of the worlds voting age population but represents only 14 per cent of the total number of the worlds legislative chamber members.
Sri Lanka is no exception.
According to a three-year old report, although 71.5% of youth in Sri Lanka exercise their right to vote, only a small fraction of less than 15 per cent is directly engaged in politics through activism within political parties and trade unions.
Statistics aside, a variety of issues can have particular impact on the young  not just in traditional youth areas like education, employment and health service, but in broader fields such as national reconciliation, climate change and social security reform, which will impact heavily on future generations. In addition, the presence of young people in political positions can make prominent changes in attitudes and leadership qualities of the other politicians.
Two questions
To discuss this issue in a different angle, lets ask ourselves two basic questions. Why do we want more young people to engage in politics Is it because it seems like a self-evidently good thing Or is the truth that the need to reach out is symptomatic of todays politicians own sense of dislocation Or, a desire to feel more connected Or is it yet more evidence of the wider depoliticization of society
The second question is -If we honestly want young people to take politics seriously, do we know what is stopping them from doing so Is it because of the high level of distrust towards present politicians Or, is it because of the lack of self-confidence in facing challenges is prevalent amongst young people
Misconception
One of the most common misconceptions in politics is that candidates and elected persons have to be older, experienced and veterans of legislature. In all respects, there is nothing wrong with being a seasoned politician. In fact, the experiences gained by aged politicians have probably come in handy on more than one occasion.
In order to get young people involved in government we have to move beyond this standard belief.
Today, we have this new, upcoming generation taking the reins and beginning to develop all sorts of opinions unlike any other generation that has come before, but their voices are not being heard like they should be. They have the capabilities of leadership and to be able to make impactful decisions in our country, but it is a challenge to receive the opportunity.
While the current status of young politicians running for local and even national politics is rising, its not as high as it should be. The ones that are bold enough to take a risk and accept the challenge bring a whole new dynamic to the table. Theyre edgy, modern, and capable of changing along with this world around them. They push the envelope on issues that matter to the generation theyre a part of. They think about the future, because it is their future too.
Politicians whove held their seats for years upon years have begun to notice the changes happening before their eyes. Some of them do not like to face the change.
Some politicians believe our younger generation are self-interested, self-seeking and self-serving group. They also think that the youth do not care about the future of this country and that is why they ignore politics. The evidence shows that this common wisdom about youth should be reversed  it is politicians who ignore youth, and not the other way around.
Decision makers
Young people are no strangers to scrutiny. They are used to their lives being examined, and their habits questioned by their parents, teachers, prospective employers and friends. They are familiar with the politicians and the press who will often criticise their behaviour.
Yet, it does not appear to be a two-way street, as their own opinions are rarely listened to and seldom taken seriously by leading influences in the community.
The majority of young people are interested in the decision-making processes that affect their daily lives, even if some of them are too disengaged or disillusioned by the present problems to realise it.
They all have concerns about their future  ranging from racial and other discrimination to the lack of economical access to higher education, efficient health services, jobs and affordable homes. They should not allow themselves to be passed off as too indifferent to participate in such discussions. Young people must be granted the opportunity to discuss current affairs and take notice of the policy areas where they have an important perspective.
Stand up
The chances are that most of the young people may not hold party memberships, not because of a lack of interest in contributing to public debate but due to a barrier that has built up by the alienation of politicians. Our leaders cannot ignore popular culture among younger generations and take the easy route by allowing senior politicians to dictate public opinion.
Its time young people should stand up and be counted in order to prove that they are responsible enough and likely enough to engage in the process. All kinds of teenagers and undergraduates are eager to defy the elitist tendencies of older generations in future parliaments. Whats more, for the health of our democracy, we should encourage them to do so.
Quota
So, it is quite clear that young peoples concerns need to be voiced and heard. There are only a few young people in positions of power, including in legislative bodies.
The introduction of quotas in parliament for young people under the age of 30 years old - for instance, through reserving 10 percent or more for the age group 18-30 years old - could be an important part of the solution for a number of reasons.
1) Young people are stakeholders of the present and the future
In fact, young people have a higher stake in some policies than older people. They will have to experience a comparatively higher share of the long-term negative consequences of politically short-term measures than older generations.
2) To include youth concerns in the party packaging of political ideas
Young parliamentarians can contribute to reform or expand the party policy packages through pushing for a better inclusion of youth concerns in agendas. Younger parliamentarians can easily pick on specific problems relating to housing, education and unemployment in a different way than older one would.
However, although the concept of youth interests is a valid point, it doesnt mean that their answers are always right. Their interpretation of social and national issues will be based on their own goals, values or social class. However, quotas can help in making sure that political parties include those youth concerns which will spur more deliberation in parliament on these issues.
3) Inter-generational diversity promotes innovation and change
Inter-generational collaborations can play a very positive role in the development innovating problem-solving mechanisms.
They also will foster a better understanding and resolution of problems. If collaboration between young and old promotes innovation and efficiency, then the absence of young people in parliament risks undermining the quality of parliamentary discussions (compared to what they could be).
4) Acknowledge young people as political equals and political actors
Finally, youth quotas would signal to society and, particularly, to young people that their contribution is valued and that they are considered with equal respect. Their status as equal citizens would be attested, recognized and emphasized. Youth quotas could thus participate in a redefinition of young adults as able to rule and reinforce their image as equal citizens.
We urgently need young people that can grow right along with us, developing around the needs of a society that is rapidly changing. That is what we need in our politics; blossoming millennial leaders to take charge

Poverty high in the north-eastern provinces: Central Bank
Sri Lankas Central Bank will study the growing indebtedness in Tamil-majority north and east, its Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
We are concerned about the rise in household debt, the governor said, referring to a prevalent post-war challenge facing families that are rebuilding their lives. Following the study and its analysis, the apex institution will take necessary steps, Dr. Coomaraswamy told Colombo-based foreign correspondents.
After Sri Lankas civil war ended in May 2009, scores of displaced families who returned to their hometowns are struggling to piece their lives together. While the community suffered enormous losses for three decades, those resettling are grappling with few jobs, means to livelihood and often resort to heavy borrowing.
A recent report of the central bank pointed to high levels of poverty in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Also, Sri Lanka is experiencing a drought that has badly hit the agriculture sector, a key economic driver in the north.
If the drought continued throughout the year, the country may have to import food and fuel worth an additional $800 million, senior Central Bank officials said. With likely rain and a falling inflation rate, the economy would pick up by the end of the year, they said.
Dr. Coomaraswamy said that if the island nation could deepen the Free Trade Agreement with India ,the neighbours are currently negotiating an Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement,and ink similar deals with China and Singapore, it would have preferential access to a market of 3 billion people. That would include China, India, Pakistan, Singapore and Europe. The Hindu

President Maithripala Sirisena pledged to launch a full scale special investigation into the allegations that disappeared persons are being held in certain detention camps. The special investigation would be launched with the aim of ascertaining the truth behind such allegations.
If anyone forwards such information on disappeared persons who are said to be held in some place or places, a full scale investigation would be conducted to ascertain the truth. I will appoint a special committee to ascertain whether there is such detention centres, President Sirisena said.
Addressing a gathering in Sampur area on Saturday, the President added that a special committee would be appointed soon, considering the reports and recommendations of the Commission appointed earlier.
He also said that when considering the allegations levelled against the Government, it could be considered that there is a political conspiracy.
President Sirisena said a campaign is being carried out in the media about the alleged disappearances of some school children who had posed for a photograph with him in Jaffna in 2015.
According to that political conspiracy, there is an allegation that several students appeared in a photograph with me in 2015 when I visited the Jaffna Hindu College and had gone missing. If such things had happened or these students have really disappeared, I assure my fullest support to search for them, he said.
This is a serious political conspiracy. I will make sure that all such cases are investigated properly and promptly, the President stressed.
Addressing the gathering, the President said that everybody should get-together and work in unity by understanding the value of freedom and the hard earned peace.
He also stated that the conspiracies of extremists carried out to topple the government and to mislead the people should be defeated.
The President said that the Government has set up an Office for Missing Persons (OMP), but awaits further legislation to make it operational. He said that he had already instructed the Cabinet and the Prime Minister to make necessary moves to empower the OMP further.
I also advised the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to take necessary measures to make amendments to the Act approved by Parliament to establish an office for disappearances, he said.
He said the Government would never neglect the development work in the North and South. The President emphasized that all politicians should be dedicated to safeguard the freedom gained and the stability of national peace and reconciliation.

Princess turns commoner for marriage
Japans Princess Mako is getting married to an ocean lover who can ski, play the violin and cook, according to public broadcaster NHK TV.
The Imperial Household Agency declined to confirm the report about the granddaughter of Japans emperor. Women cannot succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne in Japan. Makos father and her younger brother are in line to succeed Emperor Akihito, but only after her uncle, Crown Prince Naruhito, who is first in line.
Once she marries, Mako will no longer be a princess and will become a commoner. But the process building up to the wedding is likely to take some time and be full of ritual, as Japanese nuptials, especially royal ones, tend to be.
First there will be an announcement, the equivalent of an engagement, and then a date for the wedding will be picked and the couple will make a formal report to the emperor and empress. NHK said Mako has already introduced Mr Komuro to her parents and they approve.
Unlike royalty in the UK and other European countries, the emperor and his family tend to be cloistered, although they travel abroad and appear at cultural events.
Akihito, 83, is the son of Hirohito, Japans emperor during the Second World War. Akihito expressed his desire to abdicate last year, and Japan has been preparing legislation so he can.
Until Japans defeat at the end of the war, Hirohito was viewed as divine, and no one had even heard his voice. But times are changing, and the Japanese public harbours feelings of openness and familiarity toward the emperor and his family. People are likely to see Makos marriage as a celebration, although the rituals will continue to be tightly orchestrated.

A pro in everything she does
She was Sri Lankan cinemas doe eyed beauty and he was the down to earth business tycoon who managed to sweep her off her feet. They may have met by chance but the encounter led to a lifelong partnership in matrimony. Now, nearly two decades later, Sabeetha Perera and Upali Jayasinghe are still very much in the spotlight. Not only do they grace some of the top events related to showbiz but they have also built up their own business together.
The wife
Calmness has always been Sabeethas hallmark. She embodies patience and understanding. She gives her 100 percent to anything she takes up. She takes her duties as a wife and mother seriously and fulfills them to the maximum. Whenever she takes on a project she always informs me about it. She is a pro in her profession so I have no objections to whatever she relates to me. Likewise we also talk business together because she and I are the sole directors of our business, D P Jayasinghe Group of Companies.
The mother
Sabeetha is an excellent mother. Since most of my time is taken up by our business she is the one who plans and manages all our sons work. Our son, Chandupa, is now 17 years old. She is very close to him. She manages his tuition classes and gives him words of advice. She supports him in everything he takes up. We are a tight knit family. Though most of my time is taken up by work we have a swell time together during our vacations.
The celebrity
Upali JayasinghePictures bySulochana Gamage
Though she did not get back into acting for a span, Sabeetha has always looked after her health and appearence. She has always made time to keep herself well groomed. There were a lot of offers for her to return back to cinema but she knew how to pick the right moment to make her comeback.
She has always been highly professional about her work. She knows what kind of characters suits her and how to handle a project. There is no need to educate her on matters related to the industry.
The encounter
Of course, Sabeetha was a star when we met. She has been in the industry ever since she was 13 years old. I was involved in the co production of a Pakistan film called Saath Sahiliya (Seven Girlfriends). Gamini Fonseka too took part in it. However I failed to get a copy of the movie to screen it in Sri Lanka. I was at my wits end wondering what to do when Gamini suggested that I contact Sabeetha and seek her help because she has been involved in Pakistan films at that time. I called her for the first time in 1990. However our first meeting was in 1996 when she advertised her Pajero. This meeting led to several other meet ups and soon we were in our courting stages. Three years later on August 4, 1999, we tied the knot. Though she tried her best to track down and obtain a copy of the movie it didnt work out. It was a loss of one million but I won over something invaluable in return!
Obsessions
Sabeetha is very concerned about upholding discipline. You will often hear her say Whatever you do, do it properly to me or Chandupa. She is concerned about time management too. Whatever she herself takes up, she manages to finish off matters beautifully. So no complaints!
His favourite Sabeetha film
I love her in H D Premaratnes Dewani Gamana. I believe that she really proved her acting prowess in it. Her character, Sujatha, is quite unlike herself. Personally, I think that was the turning point in her career.

What singled Sabeetha out from most people I knew was the fact that she is a quality person. We never discuss gossip. She has always said that tittle-tattle does not concern her. She says that we have enough things to discuss which concern our future rather than worry about what a few gossipmongers say.

The best giftshe has given him
The best gift she has given me is obliviously our son, Chandupa. She has brought him up well and he takes after his mother a lot. The second thing I value in her is the fact that she is a balanced person. She does not worry over trivial matters. She has a strong personality and I admire that a lot.
Togetherness time
Free time is rare but when we do have time off work we love to watch movies. If we can spare a lengthy period we would fly to some place like Singapore for a few days. We have holidayed in Singapore, Australia, Canada and USA. It is cheaper to holiday in a country like Singapore than stay in a hotel with your family in Sri Lanka. We go to Australia often because I have relatives who are residing there.Sabeetha and I are both concerned about our fitness so we normally follow our exercise routines wherever we go. I visit the gym five days a week. We also like to listen to music though our tastes in music are different. I am more of the Jothipala, Victor Ratnayake and Mohideen Baig type and she is more into a mixture of the western and local music. She loves Nanda Malinis songs.
One thing he wishes he can change about her
Sometimes when we discuss a certain matter Sabeetha goes all silent. That is because she does not like to get into an argument. That has been her habit in matters when our opinions conflict. I wish she would voice her opinions without hesitation so that she would be able to prove her point too. Arguments are rare between us but when one does happen we take some time off from each other to cool down. In the end one party gives in and things get back to normal.
Three lesser known facts
Many people assume that Sabeetha is snobbish just because she got married to a businessman. That is not true. She is a very down to earth person. She is very caring and likes to help out anyone who seeks her help. She is an ardent Buddhist and is very bound to her religion.
Foodwise
Steamed food is usually a part of our meals. We have maids to attend to the cooking but Sabeetha does prepare something for a meal once in a while. My favourite is the watalappan she makes because she makes it using only a little amount of sugar. Yet it is still as good as the original.
We go out once a week to different places. We are fans of Japanese food. Dining out too we go for less oily stuff. However Chandupa likes Indian food as well so we visit Indian restaurants once in a while.
Fanatic fans
Sabeetha is still as popular as she was before she took a break from the industry. It is as if she has never been away. Even in our holidays abroad she encounters fans in every nook and corner across the world. Her fans are always courteous and their attention has never bothered us at any stage. Sabeetha too is a very friendly person so she does not hesitate to talk or pose for a picture with them.
I can recall only one instance when a fan has gone over the top for her. This incident took place during the time that we were courting each other. One guy has been hanging around her place requesting to talk to her every day. One day he climbed on top of her garage and refused to come down till she came out and talked to him. The police had to be brought in to take the fellow away.

Over 25 Indian and 14 Sri Lankan craftsmen are scheduled to participate in this event.
India has always been a loyal friend and neighbour of Sri Lanka from the ancient times  which continues to remain. The arts and crafts industry in Sri Lanka too has its Indian influences.
Known for its colorful and attractive display of crafts and artwork from every province, India takes great pride in showcasing the skills and talents of its craftsmen who have mastered the work for generations, keeping up with their tradition.
The handicrafts industry in Sri Lanka dates back to King Devanampiyatissas time, where Sangamitta , the daughter of the great emperor Asoka, brought a sampling of the Bo tree in which Lord Buddha found enlightenment.
Various handicrafts such as pottery, jewellery, clay and wood carvings, which have been found from different areas in the country depict the rich culture and heritage Sri Lanka had back then, and also the valuable connection with our Indian counterparts.
The Sri Lankan public is yet to experience a spectacular event which combines two nations in the world of handicrafts, not only showcasing the talents of their master craftsmen, but also creating an opportunity to promote friendship and goodwill and exchange new ideas and concepts between the two countries on one stage.
Shilpa Kala 2017 will showcase a colorful array of handicrafts and textiles identical to different parts in both countries.
The main purpose of this event is not only to showcase the cultural diversities but also to enhance the livelihood of the artisans of both countries, giving them recognition for their hard work and better value for their products.
A wide variety of handicraft and textiles from India will be displayed such as wood products, painted fabrics, fashion jewellery, handloom saris, handbags and leather products, while a attractive galore of Sri Lankan items depicting batik, wood carvings, lace, ceramics, Dumbara work, embroidery, silver and copperware, reed items and clayware will be on display.
According to the Chairman, Hands of Sri Lanka - National Crafts Foundation, Dr. Buddhi Keerthisena, they expect many foreigners too to visit this exhibition. The Indian High Commission has extended its fullest support to make this event a success.

Sinister elements trying to disrupt countrys progress: Malwatte Chief Prelate
There is a sinister group of people in this country who come forward to oppose any country willing to extend a helping hand to Sri Lanka. They are only trying to disrupt development work by making false allegations that Sri Lanka will become a colony of India, China or America, said Most Ven. Tibbotuware Sri Siddahartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter.
They are resorting to this lowly tactic despite realising that the country could not move forward without international assistance,the Malwatte Mahanayake Thera said.
The Mahanayake Thera expressed these sentiments delivering an Anusasana when former Minister M.M. Athaulla called on him at his Aramaya in Kandy and received his blessings on May 19.
The Chief Prelate said whenever a foreign country volunteered to assist Sri Lanka this group started criticising it without allowing things to happen and giving a little time to see whether such assistance was detrimental to the country or not.
The Malwatte Cheif Prelate said the Maha Sangha would never remain silent if any damage or disaster was caused to the country and people.
The Chief Prelate who said that certain politicians were sowing the seeds of communalism taking cover behind harmony and reconciliation added that this programme to achieve petty political gain should be defeated at all costs.
Referring to allegations that certain politicians were acquiring places of archaeological and religions value in the North East and levelling them to build roads, the Malwatte Chief Prelate said that these things were done to cater to the needs of politicians rather than people at large.
The urgent need if the hour for all to unite and wish together to develop the nation, the Chief Prelate said.
Former Minister M.M. Athaulla said a certain group was trying to disrupt national unity by setting up the Sinhalese against the Muslim community.
He said a conspiracy was in operation to amalgamate the North and East by getting Muslims to lose confidence in the Sinhalese by inducing Muslims to think that Tamils were better and more trustworthy than the Sinhalese.

Sri Lankan born speaks out after abuse in Welwyn Garden City
A Sri Lankan born accountant who has been a proud British citizen for 17 years despite his Asian birth has spoken of his shock to suffer foul-mouthed racial abuse on the streets of Welwyn Garden City in England.
Although Eranda Wickramasinghe was born in Sri Lanka 40 years ago, he has lived in the UK since 1990, and won citizenship in 2000, marrying an Englishwoman two years ago and moving to Welwyn Garden City.
Last week, as he arrived at the Hydeway end of the railway station footbridge on his way to work in London, he was confronted by a white man.
The man shouted: Fing world must be st for you lot to come here.
Wickramsinghe told the Welwyn Hatfield Times: I was left in no doubt about what he meant by you lot.
I found this deeply disturbing and hurtful. My wife and I would like to start a family; we are having doubts about whether we feel safe to bring up any children we have in Welwyn Garden City.
We are both British, highly skilled professionals, and would not struggle to find work and settle elsewhere in the world, but we love the United Kingdom and despite its imperfections, we feel that the UK is still one of the best places on Earth to live.
He reported the abuse to the police, but fears racist abuse has increased since the Brexit referendum last year.
I will never forget my Sri Lankan roots but I am very proud to be British, he said.
I consider it a privilege. I also understand that there are duties and obligations that go hand-in-hand with the privilege of living somewhere as amazing as this, duties and obligations like obeying the law, common decency and being a good citizen.
Sadly the gentleman who verbally abused me does not seem to be familiar with these duties and obligations.
Wickrasinghe lives on the east side of Welwyn Garden City with his wife Ruth, who works at the Royal Veterinary College in Brookmans Park.He was brought to the UK by his parents, both professional doctors, with his sister, who is also now a British citizen.

SriLankan operational revenue increases to Rs 136.68 bn
High oil prices, airport closure, cost of flight diversions to Mattala airport, difficult market conditions and several other issues were some of the key factors in the increase of losses of SriLankan Airlines, its Chairman Ajith Dias said.
Speaking at the PATA Summit post press conference at Jetwing Blue Hotel on Saturday he said that they had to cancel over 600 flights during the closure of the Colombo airport which he said was an exercise that had to be done.
We had to then divert some flights to Mattala and they had to be grounded for over three hours which also resulted in additional expenses which increased our losses.
He said fuel prices and other factors have also scaled up the airlines losses for the last financial year from US$ 5 million to around US$ 14 million. He said that with the Colombo airport fully operational they have now halted all their operations flying via Mattala airport.
The depreciation of the Sri Lanka Rupee against the US Dollar had a significant negative impact on the airline.
The total operational revenue increased to Rs.136.68 billion from Rs. 129.48 billion in the prior year.
However, difficult market conditions resulted in the airline recording a net group loss of Rs. 6.49 billion for the year.
This is an increase from the Rs. 2.90 billion (US$ 3.15 million) loss recorded in the prior year, but a significant improvement from the deficit that had been budgeted for the year.
The Chairman said that it was a difficult decision and painstaking to do away with Frankfurt and they were keen to resume that sector whenever possible.
More than Paris and Milan sectors, Frankfurt is important to us to provide connections to Oneworld passengers coming and going from USA and also from a tourism perspective. I must also add that Frankfurt sector losses were marginal.
The Chairman also said that they expect two narrow body A320neo aircraft by July and September and two more are due in 2018.
We are looking at increasing frequencies to some of the destinations especially in India making SriLankan the largest foreign airline to fly to India. We also have plans to launch direct flights to both Vietnam and Hong Kong soon.
The airline also hopes to increase frequencies to India and China. We will also introduce more flights to Bangkok which are all profitable routes.
Currently SriLankan operates 23 frequencies per week to both China and Hong Kong.
He also lamented that they sometimes have to wait for a long time for government approvals for the implementation of its business plans. I must also say that the delay in finding a partner to run the airline has also placed our plans in suspense.
The airline successfully completed the integration of Mihin Lankas operations into the SriLankan network during the year, marking a seamless transfer conducted in a relatively short time frame. At the end of the year, SriLankan was serving 36 international destinations from its hub in Colombo, with an operating fleet of 24 aircraft.

However, it seems that after an hour in church the pressure of being a pageboy may have become a bit much for three-year-old George who was seen becoming tearful after leaving the church.
Charlotte, two, appeared to be quite content as a patient Kate tried her best to calm her son who, after such a big responsibility, may be in need of a rest.
However, when George continued to tantrum he received a rare public telling off from his mother who was eager to prevent anything from disrupting her little sisters big day.
However, the prince appeared to cheer up at the prospect of riding in a vintage wedding car as he made his way to the reception with his mother and sister and could be waving to onlookers.

SAUDI ARABIA: President Trump hailed a series of meetings and ceremonial events with Saudi officials Saturday as a tremendous success during his first trip abroad as President, as controversies surrounding around his administration mounted back home.
Upon arriving Saturday in Riyadh, his first stop on a nine-day trip to five countries, Trump and first lady Melania were greeted on a lush red carpet by Saudi Arabias King Salman before the president received the countrys top civilian honor, the Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud Medal, during a meeting at the Saudi Royal Court.
The visit culminated with the signing of a pledge to counter violent extremism, disrupt the financing of terrorism and advance defense cooperation between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and agreeing to a massive arms sale to the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom worth nearly $110 billion.
Hundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the United States and jobs, jobs, jobs, Trump said after signing the deal.
That was a tremendous day. Tremendous investments in the United States.
The arms sale touches broadly on bolstering Saudi air and missile defense as well as cybersecurity, border and maritime security.
It also focuses on a modernization of the countrys air force. Among the equipment secured by Saudi Arabia were tanks, planes, helicopters and a THAAD antimissile system.
This huge arm sales package reduces the burden on the United States to provide the same equipment to our own military forces, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at a news conference shortly after the signing ceremony. Lowers demand on our own military, but it also lowers the cost to our own people.
The pomp and opulence of Trumps visit marked for the Saudis something of a reset in ties between the two countries, which grew tense during the Obama administration.
Notably absent from Trumps remarks Saturday in the country were any entreatments for Riyadh and Arab leaders in the region to show greater reverence for human rights and democracy  topics that became hallmarks of former President Barack Obamas presence in the Middle East.
While Trump was eager for a warm reception from the Saudis, Melania Trump and the presidents elder daughter Ivanka did not dawn headscarves, continuing a tradition set by former first lady Michelle Obama.
Female foreign dignitaries and officials visiting Saudi Arabia in recent years have also foregone the headscarves.
A flock of senior White House staffers joined the president for the trip, including chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and chief strategist Steve Bannon, as well as Cabinet members Tillerson and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who were spotted dancing with swords during a ceremonial event in the evening.
Trump will deliver an address in Riyadh on Sunday, in which he is expected to call for unity between the U.S. and Muslim world in the fight against extremist groups, dispensing with his often harsh rhetoric toward Muslims during his presidential campaign.
For the president, the trip abroad puts physical distance between Trump and the spate of controversies and scandals swirling in Washington surrounding the probe into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia during last years presidential election.
Trump has faced a steady stream of news reports over the past 10 days that have time and again put the White House on the defensive, among them revelations that Trump asked recently fired FBI Director James Comey in February to end his bureaus investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
It was also reported on Friday that the FBI had identified a current White House adviser close to Trump as a person of interest in its probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
But the coming week offers Trump his first opportunity as president to explain his approach to foreign policy to an international audience, as well as to tout U.S. companies to potential foreign investors. Ross, the Commerce secretary, attended the Saudi-U.S. CEO Forum on Saturday, and Trumps chief economic adviser Gary Cohn touted to reporters a number of business deals that had been struck with the Saudis.- THE HILL

Trump urges Muslim leaders to confront extremism
SAUDI ARABIA: US President Donald Trump on Sunday urged Islamic leaders to take a stand against violence done in the name of religion, describing the struggle against extremism as a battle between good and evil.
In a highly anticipated speech in Saudi Arabia, Trump lashed out at Iran, accusing Tehran of fuelling the fires of sectarian conflict and terror and calling for its international isolation.
Saying he came with a message of friendship and hope and love, Trump told dozens of Muslim leaders that the time had come for honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism.
This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil. The speech came on the second day of a visit to Saudi Arabia, part of Trumps first foreign tour that will take him next to Israel and the Palestinian territories and then to Europe.
The White House has sought to draw a clear distinction during the visit with Trumps predecessor Barack Obama, who Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab allies saw as lecturing and soft on their Shiite rival Iran.
Trump did not hesitate to single out Iran in his speech.
From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region, Trump said.
Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate it. He appealed to Muslim nations to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil and announced an agreement with Gulf countries to fight financing for extremists.
Introducing Trump, Saudi King Salman called Iran the spearhead of global terrorism.
Unlike the Obama administration which would often raise concerns over civil liberties with longstanding Arab allies, Trump had made no mention of human rights during his visit so far.
We are not here to lecture -- we are not here to tell other people how to live... or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership -- based on shared interests and values, Trump said.
Some 35 Heads of State and government from Muslim-majority countries were in Riyadh for the Arab Islamic American Summit, mainly from Sunni states friendly to Saudi Arabia.
Much of the focus during the summit was on countering what Gulf states see as the threat from Iran, which opposes Saudi Arabia in a range of regional conflicts from Syria to Yemen.
Trumps speech was touted as a major event -- along the lines of a landmark address to the Islamic world by Obama in Cairo in 2009.
It was especially sensitive given tensions sparked by the Trump administrations attempted travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority nations and his previous remarks on Islam.
In December 2015, Trump told a campaign rally he was calling for a total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
His words shocked many Americans, with Trump detractors noting that the US Constitution prohibits religious discrimination.
I think Islam hates us. There is a tremendous hatred there. We have to get to the bottom of it, Trump said in a March 2016 interview with CNN.
Still, Trump was welcomed warmly in Saudi Arabia, where he and first lady Melania Trump were given an extravagant reception by King Salman and the rest of the Saudi royal family.
The first day saw the announcement of hundreds of billions of dollars in trade deals, welcome news for Trump as he faces mounting troubles at home linked with the probe into alleged Russian meddling during last years election campaign.
Among the agreements was an arms deal worth almost $110 billion with Saudi Arabia, described as the largest in US history.
The trade deals announced on Saturday were said to be worth in excess of $380 billion, and Trump proudly declared the first day of his visit tremendous.
On Sunday he held a series of meetings with other Arab leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Qatars Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Bahrains King Hamad.
The meeting with Sisi -- an avowed fan of the president -- was especially warm and Trump said he would absolutely be putting Egypt on his list of countries to visit very soon.
Trump referred to Sisi as my friend and Sisi said the US President was a unique personality and capable of doing the impossible, to which Trump responded: I agree! Trump even complimented Sisi on his footwear, saying: Love your shoes. Boy, those shoes. Man... Sisi has faced harsh criticism of his human rights record since he led the military overthrow of Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi in 2013. - AFP

Trump visits Israel amid tight security

He flies in from Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, where he gave a speech to Arab and Muslim leaders at a summit.
Trump will hold talks with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders during the course of his two-day stop.
The president has called an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement "the ultimate deal", but has been vague about what form it should take.
He has said he prefers to leave it to both sides to decide between them in direct talks.
At a summit in Riyadh on Sunday,Trump called on Arab and Muslim leaders to take the lead in combating Islamist militants, urging them to"drive them out of this earth
He singled out Iran, saying it had "fuelled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror" in the region for decades.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif later hit back on Twitter, suggesting the US was milking Saudi Arabia for billions of dollars in newly-signed arms deals.
In his speech, Trump also stated again that he believed peace between Israelis and Palestinians was possible.
The US president has been widely seen as considerably more supportive of Israel than his predecessor, Barack Obama. He has taken a softer position on the contentious issue of Israeli settlements, suggesting thattheir expansion rather than their existence might hamper the search for peace.
More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, land Palestinians claim for a future state. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.
The president has also sent mixed signals on the issue of Jerusalem, pledging to move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv, angering Palestinians and delighting Israelis.
However he has since stalled, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently telling NBC News Trumpwas weighing it up
Israel regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim the east as their capital. The international community does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv.
There has been some consternation in Israel in the run-up to Trump's trip over remarks made by administration officials.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahurejected Mr Tillerson's suggestion that moving the embassy might harm the peace process, while a US Consulate officialcaused outrageby saying the Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites, was "not in your [Israel's] territory but part of the West Bank".
The White Houselater saidthe official's comments "do not represent the position of the United States".
Trump's trip also comes days after it was reported that thepresident had leakedto Russia's foreign minister classified intelligence information said to have come from an Israeli source. The incident has raised questions about the confidentiality of secret intelligence passed to the US by its closest Middle Eastern ally.
A huge security operation is under way for Trump's visit, during which he will hold separate meetings with Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem the following day.

We have a talented Finance Minister - Navin Dissanayake
The inapt practice of dominating the Finance Ministry portfolio by Executive Presidents was changed by this government by appointing a talented minister to run the post, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a press conference held at Sirikotha on May 19.
Minister Dissanayake said he had with the Finance Minister minor differences concerning some policy matters and those have already been resolved amicably.
Minister Dissanayake said Minister Karunanayake took over the Ministry at a time it was passing through dried coffers.
He said allegations are made against all politicians including his father former ministers the late Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali and former president Ranasinghe Premadasa on many things. Minister Dissanayake said all Cabinet Ministers are bound to respect collective responsibility.
There were differences of opinion among my father, Premadasa and Athulathmudali. They compromised and settled the issues within. Likewise, we have compromised and settled the policy differences we had. I have no dispute with the Finance Minister. You will see by another few days what sort of decision taken in unison by the President and the Prime Minister, Minister Dissanayake said.
He said the government ministers need freedom to perform their duties properly and he is enjoying such freedom.
The Minister said that despite the freedom a finance minster gets from the President and the Prime Minister, he has to face other challenges from outside organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as countries with cash-strap economies such as ours are constantly relied on their monetary assistance.
The Finance Ministers are challenged when taking unpopular decisions, he said.
Dissanayake said former Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel was provided with necessary freedom by former President J.R. Jayewardene in 1977 to take critical decisions.
He said that that tradition was changed after Chandrika Bandaranike Kumaratunga elected the President.
Minister Dissanayake disapproved such dominance in the Finance Portfolio said that consequent to such supremacy, former Treasury Secretary P.B. Jayasundera acted de facto Finance Minister during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.

When drummers become writers: the strange wisdom of method books
In seemingly bland method books, drummers become writersand their eccentricities shine through in remarkable ways.
Im a mostly untrained drummer. Ive taken lessons for brief periods, but until recently Id missed out on that most essential component of drum pedagogy: the method book. In my efforts to improve, Ive been drawn to the introductions of these books, which feature efficient, often dull languageand in which, occasionally, the eccentricities of the authors shine through in remarkable ways. In the last few months, Ive become obsessed with gleaning hints about drummers personalities from these books, far too many of which, perhaps unsurprisingly, have been written by men. Lost in the hinterland between art and technique, their introductions tend to exhibit grouchiness, pretension, narcissism, penury, New Age quirkiness, and sometimes even wisdom. What follows is a survey of some of the more striking entries.
Method books, intended to help you master a specific aspect of your musical craft, are usually flimsy pamphlets filled with exercises in musical notation. Theyre aspirational texts, meant to be worried at and wrestled with, written in and dog-eared. Many are so frustratingly abstruse that they seem as though they werent made to be used at all. And like infomercials, some of them make outrageous claims; their titles alone can be a source of amusement.
On my shelf I have Advanced Funk Studies, Drummer on Parade with Street Beats, The Hardest Drum Book Ever Written (by the inimitable Joel Rothman, the author of more than a hundred drum method books), The New Breed II, and Inner Drumming. Often the titles contain the word modern, which traditionally distinguishes between military-style parade drumming and contemporary rock and jazz playing.
This distinction has been in place for almost a century, so it makes for an odd juxtaposition. At the same time, the term cozies up to a vision of the drummers future: some crowning moment after thousands of hours of dogged practice, in which, at last, the exercises are mastered and the drummer becomes truly modern.
Since the books are oriented toward practice, and since most drummers arent seasoned prose stylists, these method books tend to be pretty thin on introductory material. Even the most classic books sometimes have barely a paragraph of prefatory textbut these concentrated statements open windows into their authors minds, deepening the mystery behind the mastery. Stick Control for the Snare Drummer, for instance, by George Lawrence Stone, is the drum method book. It was radical at the time of its publication, and its clarity and simplicity has allowed it to endure since its publication in 1935.
That may surprise you, though, when you read Stones introduction, which is chiding instead of encouraging: It seems that there are too many drummers whose work is of a rough-and-ready variety and whose technical proficiency suffers in comparison with that of the players of other instruments.
Its hard not to imagine Stone creating his masterpiece with a series of deep sighs, hoping to buttress the profession against scores of unkempt stick wielders. Even today, the phrase rough-and-ready might be the most apt description of rock drummers ever coined.
Ted Reeds classic book Syncopation, published in 1958, is the foundation of probably 80 percent of jazz-drum instruction in the United States. Rather than begin with some strategic advice, Reed starts with a heros origin story of sorts.
He describes working as a teacher in extremis, with a Herculean student load and an unimaginable schedule. His struggle to finish Syncopation on the side becomes a metaphor for the creative life:
