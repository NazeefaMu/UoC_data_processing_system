New policies to drive MSME - CB Governor
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that they are looking at implementing new policies to further extend the micro, small and medium sector. (MSMEs.)
This is in a bid to promote entrepreneurial skills among them and allow them more free access to credit and try to increase their export potential.
The governor was delivering the closing remarks at the Asia-Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA) Regional Policy Forum at Colombo Hilton on Monday.
Its very import that financial institutions be more flexible and innovative in dealing with micro, small and medium enterprises.
Financial institutions must have a proactive and value-added engagement and build relationships with their borrowers, helping improve their bankability. Financial institutions most importantly should change their internal credit evaluation and risk assessment processes to increase the quality of management decision making, in order to serve the MSME sector better, Coomaraswamy.
Noting that regulators, including central banks, had a role in assisting the growth of the MSME sector, he said the main role of regulators was to improve the lending infrastructure and enact enabling regulation.
Most importantly financial institutions should change their internal credit evaluation and risk assessment processes to increase the quality of management decision making.
Dr. Coomaraswamy said in the current environment of a depreciating currency, it was advisable for the MSME sector to be oriented towards the export sector, helping to increase the foreign currency inflow to the country. Moreover, in order to promote entrepreneurial skills among the wider population, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is advocating including financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills development aspects in to the school curriculum, which would be implemented within the wider framework of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy of Sri Lanka.
In the current environment of depreciating currency, it is advisable that the MSME sector is oriented towards the export sector, helping to increase the foreign currency inflow to the country.
Apraca is playing a leading role in promoting rural financing through a number of activities such as knowledge sharing, capacity building, and research. APRACAs efforts to identify the shortcomings in MSME financing, and creating a dialogue on appropriate remedies should be highly commended, he added. (SS)

Newlyweds on honeymoon in Tangalle buy their own hotel
Gina Lyons and Mark Lee from London, decided to purchase a rustic hotel after drinking rum on the beach while on holiday - and have renamed it Lucky Beach Tangalle A pair of newlyweds got so drunk on their honeymoon they bought their own hotel.
Gina 33 and Lee, 35, wed in June 2017 and went on a three week backpacking honeymoon to Sri Lanka in December.
During their trip, the London-based couple checked into a rustic hotel on the beach and immediately hit it off with some of the staff members there. On their first night, they took to the beach with several bottles of rum and drank with one of the hotels bartenders, where they were told the current lease on the hotel was almost up.
The couple decided it would be a great idea to take up the new lease - which would cost them 30,000.As of July 1 this year, producer Gina and Mark, a sales director, officially own the hotel they drunkenly agreed to buy and have renamed it Lucky Beach Tangalle.
Gina said: When we walked into the hotel we saw a group of old Sri Lankan men who were still drunk from the night before, so we started drinking with them.The hotel looked grotty and very cheap, but it was by the beach and had the wooden tree house feel that we like.
When we were on the beach , we were told that the lease was almost up for the hotel.
After finding out that it was 10,000 a year, myself and Mark thought that it would be a brilliant idea to buy it - because we were so high.Now, almost a year on from our idea, we own the hotel and have started doing the hotel up and making it ours.
Despite having had the initial conversation about purchasing the hotel whilst they were drunk, Gina explained the couple were also tipsy during the following, more serious, chats.
She said: The next day we went and met an old couple who we had to speak to about renewing the lease ourselves.We had to take two friends we had made with us so they could translate for us, as the couple didnt speak English themselves.
Because we didnt understand most of the conversation, Mark and I were just sat.
After some bartering, we finally agreed that we would pay 30,000 for the three year lease and pay 15,000 in the first year and the other half by March 2019.But on top of that we had to pay about 7,000 legal fees in obtaining licenses and then 6,000 to refurbish, so it wasnt cheap. Despite struggling financially, the couple managed to pay the first half of the lease - however they stumbled into an unexpected debt three months after agreeing the purchase in March this year, when Gina discovered she was pregnant.

NORTH KOREA INVITES POPE FOR VISIT
SOUTH KOREA: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has invited Pope Francis to visit, saying he would be ardently welcomed, South Koreas Presidency said Tuesday, adding it would pass on Pyongyangs message to the Vatican.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in will have an audience with the Pope during a visit to the Vatican from October 17 to 18.
During the meeting with Pope Francis, he (Moon) will relay the message from chairman Kim Jong Un that he would ardently welcome the Pope if he visits Pyongyang, Moons spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom, told reporters.
Moon is embarking on a nine day tour of Europe from October 13 to 21 that will include stops in France, Italy and Denmark on top of the Vatican.
The doveish Moon has pushed rapprochement with Kim, meeting him three times in the last year.
During the most recent face to face -- a visit to Pyongyang last month -- Moon was accompanied by South Korean Archbishop Hyginus Kim Hee-joong.
During a conversation with the visiting archbishop, Kim urged him to let the Vatican know his intention to build peace, according to Moons spokesman.
The young leader of the isolated, impoverished but nuclear-armed North has taken a series of reconciliatory gestures since early this year, including a land summit with US President Donald Trump in June.
During last months summit, Kim also reaffirmed efforts to ease military tension on the flashpoint peninsula but remained vague on measures on how to dismantle his widely-feared atomic arsenal.
Religious freedom is enshrined in the Norths constitution, but all religious activity is subject to extremely tight restrictions and completely banned outside of state-sanctioned institutions.
In the early 20th century before the division of the peninsula, Pyongyang was a regional missionary hub with scores of churches and a thriving Christian community that earned it the title of Jerusalem of the East.
But Kim Il Sung, the Norths late founding leader and the current rulers grandfather, viewed Christianity as a threat to his authoritarian rule and eradicated it through executions and labour camps.
The Norths regime since then has allowed Catholic organisations to run aid projects in the impoverished country, but direct relations with the Vatican are non-existent.
When Pope Francis visited South Korea in 2014, he held a special mass in Seoul dedicated to reunification of the two Koreas.
A 2014 survey by Korea Gallup showed 22 percent of South Koreans identify themselves as Buddhist, while nearly 30 percent are Christian.

Countrys economy not unstable as JO claims:Finance Minister
In case crude oil prices in the international market reach a record hike, the government being sensitive to the difficulties of the general public, would endure the loss irrespective of the fuel price formula, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said. He pointed out that the countrys economy is not unstable as claimed by the Joint Opposition. If the economy is unstable, the Minister questioned, as to how the government had been able to grant loans worth close to Rs. 54 BN under the Enterprise Sri Lanka for young entrepreneurs across the country. He also pointed out that the government had commenced 39,666 projects under the Gamperaliya, worth Rs. 20 BN. He also pointed out that the previous regime never gave the benefit of low crude oil prices to the people even when a crude oil barrel price decreased to US$ 45.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations in reply to the Adjournment Motion moved by the Opposition on the mid-year fiscal position report 2018 of the Finance and Media Ministry.
Minister Samaraweera said that when the present government took office in 2015, they inherited an economic time bomb. We took over a country with a depleting economy. In the 1990s, the government revenue was 21%, but by 2014, it was 11.4%. Sri Lanka was then the country with the lowest government revenue. The gap between the government revenue and expenditure reached a Rs. 601 BN. The previous regime used US$ 4.1 BN to defend the rupee in 2012, when there was a currency crisis. We only used US$ 250 MN to it. We cannot use our foreign reserves as we are supposed to pay humongous debts this year and also in the coming two years. The largest debt installment in Sri Lankan history worth Rs. 1.9 Trillion, would be paid this year. In 2020 and 2021, the government had to pay Rs. 4,000 BN as debt repayment. More than a two third of these debts have been taken by the Rajapaksa regime, Minister Samaraweera pointed out.
Minister Samaraweera also said that in 2015, they had to take over a Central Bank which under had gone losses. We started this journey with a Central Bank that was undergoing losses. In 2013, it was Rs. 24,264 BN and in 2014 it was Rs. 32,309 BN, he pointed out.
The Finance Minister also denied JO allegation that the prices of goods have increased drastically. Contrary to the allegations, Samaraweera pointed out that there havent been serious increases in essential food items at present in comparative to the prices of the same in 2014.
Finance Minister Samaraweera also said the government would strengthen an export oriented liberalized economy in order to manage future instances similar to the present global financial turmoil.
He also denied JO allegations that loans by Enterprise Sri Lanka had been granted based on political favourations.

We are not ready to form a government with rejected groups
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday, insisted that there is no mandate to form a government with groups rejected by the people.
We are not ready to form a government with rejected groups, he said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, confronted former Minister and SLFP Group of 15 MP Chandima Weerakkody in Parliament yesterday, and called him a political opportunist.
The minister made this comment when MP Weerakkody accused the Government over the soaring cost of living.
You were also a part of this Government for three years. You cannot get away from criticisms concerning the cost of living, just because you switched sides in Parliament. You should be ashamed. You were part of this Government as well as the previous. You are nothing but a political opportunist, he accused the MP.
MP Weerakkody said that the pensioners who were protesting at the Parliament roundabout complained to him of the rising cost of living and blamed the Government for doing little to control the cost of living.
In the meantime, the Leader of the House also dismissed claims of a caretaker government, stating that it is not possible to form a coalition Government with groups rejected by the people.
He was responding to a question by UNP MP S M Marrikar who asked for an explanation on the media speculation of topping the Government.
There is no peoples mandate to form a government with groups rejected by the people.
Therefore I dont take such claims seriously. The people gave the mandate for the Yahapalana Government and to the United National Front. We are not ready to form a Government with rejected groups, the Minister replied.
Counter Terrorism Bill presentedin Parliament for First Reading
The Government yesterday, presented the new Counter Terrorism Bill in Parliament for First Reading in Parliament.
This vital piece of legislation which received conditional Cabinet approval early this month, would do away with the widely-objected Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1979.
Foreign Affairs Minister Thilak Marapone presented the Bill to make provisions for the protection of Sri Lanka and its people from acts of terrorism and other associated offences. It provides for the identification, apprehension, arrest, custody, detention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of any person who had committed an act of terrorism or any other associated offence.
The provisions of the proposed legislation apply to any Sri Lankan citizen within or outside the countrys territory.
It covers the territorial waters and the airspace of Sri Lanka and the office premises of diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka, including residences of those diplomats.

It provides for the recovery of damages for the death of a person caused by a wrongful act, omission, negligence or default of another.
According to the new Bill, the family members or the guardian of the deceased person, would have the right to maintain action for damages against the person whose wrongful act, omission, negligence or default caused the death of that person.
The parents, children, siblings, grandparents or the guardian of the person whose death had caused by the above mentioned reasons, have the right to apply for the recovery of damages for the loss of that persons love, affection, care and companionship and the mental pain and suffering.
Presidential pardon had never been misusedunder Yahapalana rule:Minister Rajapakshe
There had been no occasion where Presidents power to pardon was misused under Yahapalana rule, Higher Education and Cultural Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe yesterday said. The Minister observed that this was not the case prior to 2015. Minister Rajapakshe pointed out that the present government, soon after taking office, adopted new criteria to follow when granting Presidents pardon, and has deviated from the framework only on three occasions.
The first occasion was when freeing Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka who was imprisoned by the previous regime.
The second occasion was pardoning the girl from Batticaloa who defaced Sigiriya frescoes, and the last was when President pardoned the LTTE suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate him. Aside from these on three occasions, the government has strictly abided by the criteria. Minister Rajapakshe said.
Minister Rajapakshe pointed out that the recommendations on the prisoners who deserve pardon from the President come through a special committee of experts headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge. He denied that there has been any political or otherwise influence over the said committee.
Minister Rajapakshe made these observations in response to an oral question by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa in reference to the number of prisoners released on special presidential pardon during the period 2006-2015. Jayatissa drew attention to a prisoner who had been granted pardon by the President on March 08, 2010. It was pointed out that the said prisoner, who was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment over two deaths, is the wife of a former minister. According to him, the said prisoner was sentenced for murdering two females. Hence, Jayatissa questioned as to what steps the government would take for such misusing of Presidents powers to Pardon.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who also rose to make an observation, pointed out that there had been two more incidents where such misuse had taken place. There is one former mayor from Kandy area, who was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for misappropriation of public money, was granted Presidents pardon. And then, there Basnayake Nilame of Sabaragamuwa too received pardon. Dissanayake said.
MP Jayatissa requested that the report including the recommendations suggesting the release of the said prisoner be tabled at Parliament. Minister Rajapakshe assured that he would inform the Justice Minister concerning the matter.
It was pointed out that 29,309 prisoners have been granted Presidents pardon from 2006 to 2015, marking special occasions such as Independence Day, International Womens Day, Prisoners Welfare Day, Vesak Day, Poson Day and the Dalada Perahera. It was also pointed out that no prisoner who had been sentenced under rape and child abuse been granted special presidential pardon.
COPE to request Speaker tosummon Sports DG before EPC
The Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) yesterday, decided to request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to summon the Sports Director General before the Ethics and Privileges Committee(EPC) due to his failure to appear before the COPE despite repeated summons.
The Football Federation of Sri Lanka was summoned before the COPE yesterday and it extensively questioned its present management over a report that had attempted to conceal the irregularities and fraudulent acts of its past President Manilal Fernando.
There is a court case going on against former President Manilal Fernando, based on the findings of a previous COPE report in 2016. The COPE questioned as to why this case has been stalled. The Federation has come up with a new report stating that the previous findings were faulty. Those findings had already been confirmed by way of a ministerial level inquiry as well. It was the Football Federation that had initiated legal action against its former President Fernando, but now it is trying to cover him up, the COPE sources told the Daily News.
The Sports Director General did not turn up for the meeting despite being summoned. He had dodged the COPE on two occasions. Therefore, we have decided to recommend the Speaker to summon him to the Parliament Ethics and Privileges Committee, the sources added.
Sittings interrupted twice due to lack of 20 MP quorum
Parliament sittings were interrupted twice due to lack of quorum of 20 MPs yesterday.
The Presiding member ordered for the ringing of the quorum bell on two occasions to summon the MPs to the main chamber.
The House took up a full-day Adjournment Motion on the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report 2018 of the Finance and Mass Media Ministry, moved by the Joint Opposition. UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri and Wijayapala Hettiarachchi asked for the quorum of 20 MPs. However, the sittings continued as MPs filed into the chamber when the quorum bell went off.
Office for Reparations Billto be moved for debate today
The Office for Reparations Bill will be moved for debate in Parliament today.
Parliament is likely to take up a vote at the end of the debate. The Government in conformity with the Supreme Court decision, would move further Amendments to the Bill at its Third Reading. However, human rights activists have also emphasized the need for further amendments to the Bill to preserve its spirit.
The Bill provides for the provision of individual and collective reparations for aggrieved persons. As per the Bill, aggrieved persons mean persons who have suffered violations of human rights or humanitarian law, their relatives and missing persons.
The scope of legislation applies to the conflict in the North and the East, as well, as any political unrest or civil disturbance, systematic gross violations of the rights of individuals, groups or communities of people of Sri Lanka and enforced disappearances.
Under the individual Reparations, the Bill, facilitates any monetary payment or material benefit provided to an aggrieved person, micro-finance and concessionary loans, educational programmes, training and skills development programmes, administrative assistance and welfare services, including psycho-social support provided to an aggrieved person, measures of restitution, including the provision of land and housing and other appropriate measures identified by the Office for Reparations.

Peoples Banks digital journey sets benchmark at National IT Conference
Consolidating its position as a digital financial services provider, Peoples Bank set the benchmark for digital financial services in Sri Lanka at the recently concluded National IT Conference 2018 (NITC 2018).
Organized by the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL), NITC 2018 was held for the 36th time on October 2-4, at the Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo, with the participation of the crme de la crme of the countrys ICT sector. One of the largest ICT events to be held in the country, NITC 2018was inaugurated byPresident Maithripala Sirisena, with over 500 IT professionals from diverse fields of specialization attending the event.
NITC is a premier platform for knowledge sharing among ICT professionals in Sri Lanka, and acts as a channel to transfer international and new knowledge into the country.
The event, which also had, Minister of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment, Harin Fernando as the guest of honor, enables discussion and sharing of ICT experiences and challenges, which contributes towards enrichment of the national ICT knowledge base.
Addressing the august gathering at this premier ICT event, the Head of IT at Peoples Bank, Priyantha S. Edirisinghe gave a very enlightening keynote speech, sharing the Banks journey of transformation from a traditional state bank, into a modern, digitally enabled financial services provider that has lifted thousands of rural consumers onto digital platforms.
Edirisinghe, who spearheaded this national scale transition, made it clear that Peoples Bank has continued to remain true to its core values and its core customer base of rural consumers, throughout this process of modernization.
If you talk about our values, our values are interwoven into our rurals. Thats our DNA. If you think about our base, 74% of the market is rural. So what Peoples Bank serves, is the rural. Thats where our strength is, and thats where we have tried to reduce our digital divide, said Edirisinghe.
Edirisinghe noted that customer responses on a daily basis clearly shows the rapid pace of technology adoption by Sri Lankan consumers, with ongoing channel migration from traditional bank tellers to digital units, including ATMs, CDMs and KIOSKs.
He noted that for the last 6 months the number of self banking transactions have increased by 68%,with counter transactions amounting to the value of Rs 207 bn, in the last 9 months. Cash deposits via the Banks CDM units have increased by 67%, amounting to Rs 145 bn.
Edirisinghe noted that this move to dig deeper into the Banks own human resource pool has contributed towards greater employee empowerment, while enhancing the Banks value creation capabilities.
Looking to the future of Sri Lankas techno revolution, he called for greater emphasis on business analysis skills, which the country is still lacking. He noted that subjects such as data mining, should be introduced to industries to make use of the massive volumes of data collected through digital systems, to continually improve and innovate digital products and services.

Playing pandu with Kusal Mendis career
Kusal Mendis is by far the next Aravinda de Silva or Mahela Jayawardene if his rare talent needs any comparison. But the manner in which this gem of a cricketer has been treated so far by the national cricket selectors defies logic.
With the 2019 Cricket World Cup barely seven months away we find this outstandingly talented player left out of the 15-member squad Sri Lanka has named for the five-match ODI series against England starting at Dambulla today. This is not the first time that Mendis has faced this fate with the present selection committee. He was axed for a tough Test tour of India in 2017.
Sri Lanka has only 13 ODIs (5 v England at home, 3 v New Zealand away and 5 v South Africa away) to prepare themselves for the big event and five of those matches are against England. So the big question is whether Mendis fits into the scheme of things. Is he good enough to play in the World Cup Or according to the national selectors that includes the national coach are there players better than Mendis that he can be discarded in this manner
The reasons given by the head coach for his exclusion from the England series is that Mendis had a poor Asia Cup where he collected two ducks in two matches and that his form has dropped and that he has been left out of the side to rectify whatever mistakes he has and to regain his form and confidence.
It is no fault of Mendis that he was dismissed without scoring in the two Asia Cup matches against Bangladesh and Afghanistan because he was sent to bat in a position that he was not accustomed to - as an opener. He has never opened in ODI cricket until he was pushed into that position in the Asia Cup.
Poor Mendis talent was wasted by sending him to open the innings with Upul Tharanga whereas the best batting position for him is in the middle at number three or four. This is not what we have observed but it is also the view of legendary cricketers like Aravinda de Silva, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who have voiced their opinion on various occasions. These past batting greats who have brought glory and honour to the country with their unique brand of cricket know what they are talking about.
No praise can be too high for Mendis than the one from former head coach Graham Ford who has a keen eye for spotting talent.
Its not hard to back him at all. Hes such a wonderful talent, and hes going to win a lot of games for Sri Lanka along the way, Ford said of Mendis. The worst thing we could do is to put too much expectation on his shoulders. We dont want to put him under any pressure. He is learning and no doubt with his talent he will pay us back down the line. We never thought of dropping him - hes just got too much talent. I am sure down the line, he is going to show everybody just how great he is.
Ford said better shot selection - particularly early in the innings - marked Mendis path to improvement. His technique and attitude, Ford said, did not need much tinkering. He is one player always supporting the guys that are doing well - hes very happy for the other guys. He had a smile on his face the whole time when he didnt quite fire as we know he can.
He kept working as hard as ever. He loves his cricket he loves his practices. We have seen with a guy like that - with the amount of talent hes got - its not hugely about technique. Its just about making sure his decision-making and his shot selection is good. He probably is the first to admit that he was a bit extravagant early on and got himself out. Hes come home and done a lot of work on his own. Hats off to the fella he deserves the big score.
We hope these views are taken seriously in the best interest of Sri Lanka cricket by the national selectors and the team management and saner counsel prevails and, Mendis be given his due place in the team and batting position despite his constant failures.
One has only to look at Mendis ODI career record and see which position he has been successful for his country. The readers can judge for themselves where the team management has erred in sacrificing Mendis by sending him as opener.
Batting at 3 Mendis has scored one century and 9 fifties and averages nearly 30 with a strike rate of 82; and at 4 Mendis has scored 2 fifties and averages 47.20 and has a strike rate of 100.
Did the selectors and the team management get Kusal Mendis mixed up with Kusal Perera. For Kusal Perera who is best suited to open the innings was sent to bat at number three and four in the Asia Cup where his contributions were 11 and 17.
Perera, a flamboyant player is best suited to open the innings and should be given the licence to attack the bowling as the legendary Sanath Jayasuriya once did with great success. His ODI career figures show that he has made the majority of his runs as opener  1412 at an average of 30 and a strike rate of 93.8 and scored all three hundreds (inclusive of 7 fifties) batting in that position. Batting at 3 he averages 15 and at 4 averages 61.
Whereas the majority of the countries taking part in the World Cup have a settled batting order, Sri Lanka are still tinkering with theirs unsure of which positions their batsmen should play. This is the worst way to prepare for a mega event as the World Cup and a sure way to disaster which could be detrimental to the countrys cricket that at present is trying to grapple with an inexperienced administration, embezzlement of its cricket funds and allegations of corruption in Sri Lanka Cricket that involves past and present players and officials.
The decision to drop Sri Lankas best young batsman in years against the backbone of a brittle batting line-up that often struggles to post winning totals is an imprudent one. Its not surprising when selections continue to be made on hunches.

Police Commission responds to Minister Wijayadasa
The Police Commission said it had held 155 sessions over the past three years and more than 5,000 decisions were taken during that period by the seven-member commission after careful consideration of facts, the Police Commission said in a press release.
It was issued in response to media reports that stated that Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe had referred to the Commission as a home for the aged and that the expected tasks had not been fulfilled.
A code of ethics and transfer policy for police officers, performance evaluation system for officers in charge of police stations and a scheme for the increase of women representation in the police are some of the major work of the commission.
The Commission has disposed 4,415 appeals made by police officers including 2,500 appeals carried forward from the past. A large number of delayed promotions of junior police officers were expedited. Further, 86% of 4,805 public complaints received by the Commission have been investigated. A publication with details of the Commissions accomplishments during the past three years has been released.
It is detrimental to express opinion about the performance of the independent Commission without an objective evidence based assessment of its work duly comparing with its mandate, The Commission said in its release.
The Police Commission noted that the age factor of the commission members has no bearing on the accomplishment of the expected tasks. In fact, a probability of a decision to be correct, objective and unbiased is higher when the decision is taken by a team of seven matured, experienced persons. These appointments have been made by the Constitutional Council, a body above party politics at the national level under the provisions of the Constitution. The minister himself had been a member of the Council when these appointments were made, adding that as such, the statement of the minister, in a way is questioning the rationality of decisions made by the supreme body.

Postscript  to Dale  Carnegie
Titled in lower case, think and grow rich brings capital to any reader if digested in the correct mood. My lament is that I came across this valuable life guide in the very evening of my life and I have never read a review of this most inspirational book anywhere in print or never a voracious reader made me aware of this book till I made my second visit to Australia. A PhD holder from Queensland University of Technology just offered me this priceless book on financial management and psychology which has been first published in 1937, to while away my time. Yet, on the following day, my daughter took me to a well-established book shop in Westfield Shopping Mall to find a copy of this book for my own use which I possess now and read reread and ponder because of its indescribable impact on me. I thought of reviewing it in this esteemed paper for the wider use of the enterprising young entrepreneurs for them to harness the much quintessential value of this great effort of Napoleon Hill and the reviser Arthur R.Pell, for the uplift of the Sri Lankan business community in particular and their counterparts elsewhere.
Napoleon has been a contemporary of Dale Carnegie. It is a book that goes far beyond boundaries of time and versatile in money making.
Its authenticity reposes in Hills painstaking endeavor of interviewing around 500 most successful men and women in the tapestry of financial management leading to great riches.
He has unearthed the secret of money making in his effort for the benefit of the wider business community. The book leads the people to join the super-successful entrepreneur elite.
The writer enlivens the achievements of the great giants in the sphere of industrial sector such as Henry Ford, Thomas Alva Edison, F W Woolworth and some others that that provides ample food for thought and the reviewer Pell takes recent success stories of Bill Gates, Spieldberg and some others that the reader could meet in his perusal through the lines.
Hill makes an array of immortal rules for the people to follow if they want to succeed in wealth making.
The pith of the matter is that one has to nurture desire with a definite purpose coupled with an action plan to achieve it. The power of thought is the predominant factor. Yet, the starting point of all achievement is the desire. According to Hill, faith is the cornerstone.
To derive the much needed business resourcefulness for the entrepreneur he or she has to absorb and imbibe digest the contents of this valuable guide.
It is priced at 19 US Dollars, but if it comes to the correct hands, the book could be the goldmine of the modern world. It is a must read even for the lay mind. In my view, it is a readable read due to its lucid writing.

Quest for fitness
Hula dancing is a popular style of dancing in the Hawaiian Islands
Why hula
You lose calories while hula hooping, and thus you can maintain your weight within the normal range for your height.
The hula hoop is a piece of workout equipment that can tone your thighs, abdominals, gluteal, and arms
Hula hoop exercise routines offer several health benefits
You can start with the basic moves until you feel comfortable, then step up your game to more advanced ones, mixing and matching for your own personal head-to-toe tone-up.
A 2010 study by the American Council on Exercise found that hooping burns about 7 calories per minute, or about 210 calories during a 30-minute workout.
After a long day in front of a computer, hula-hooping offers a rejuvenating workout that can help you realign your spine
Hula hooping improves your blood circulation, the healing process, concentration, muscle tone, flexibility, coordination and dexterity significantly.
Those who don't have time to go to a gym due to a busy schedule can try this at home itself.
First two minutes with a simple side-to-side move.
To do this move, hold the hoop at your waist, and your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Push the hoop from your hip to get it started, then spin your hips in a side-to-side motion to keep it going.
Start with one foot about two feet in front of the other. Hold the hoop at waist level and push it off your hips to get it started. Rock your hips forward and back, keeping your knees loose, to keep the hoop going. Try to continue this motion for two minutes
Next two minutes, Stand with your legs squeezed together and your knees slightly bent, with the hula hoop at your waist. Lean forward and push the hoop off so it starts to rotate. Lift your body up and down to keep the momentum of the hoop going, keeping the weight on your toes.
Final minute, spin the hoop around your hand vertically, moving your hand up and down to keep it going.
Keep the hoop going for a minute, then rest, and repeat!

## Title: Removal of Inspector General, a Constitutional hiatus

Removal of Inspector General, a Constitutional hiatus
I feel sorry about the police force. The Inspector General of the Police has become a joker. Former IGs never behaved like this. I dont know whether a thing called the police exists now. Due to his behaviour, the Prime Minister and I have come under severe criticism. Something has to be done about this quickly. The IGs behaviour is shameful. There are media reports saying that crimes have increased in this country. Serious action should be taken against this. The person who criticized the IGP was none other than the Executive President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, the same person who appointed the current IGP three years ago. The President leveled this criticism against the IGP at the Cabinet meeting held last week.
Among the many issues faced by the current government, the issue related to the behaviour of the IGP is a serious one. The IGPs behaviour and whatever he said came under serious public criticism and due to this, a call for his removal arose from the society. As he was not promptly removed, people also started to severely criticize the government. Some who present these accusations level it against the Prime Minister and the UNP leaving out the President and the other factions of the government and allege that the Prime Minister and the UNP are fundamental in shielding the IGP from being removed from office. Underlying these accusations is the idea that it is the Prime Minister and the UNP which is barring the President and the others in the government from removing the IGP. The statements made by the Joint Opposition in this regard are prime examples of the above. This group states that despite the President and his group wanting to remove the IGP from office, the UNP and the Prime Minister is protecting the IGP from being removed.
In reality, more than the Government, it is the UNP and the Prime Minister who has come under severe criticism due to the behaviour of the IGP. The reason behind this is that some label the IGP as a supporter of the UNP and many in the society subscribed to this notion without thinking about it critically and therefore still believe that the Prime Minister and the UNP are working towards protecting him. If a democratically elected government comes under the severe public criticism due to the behaviour of one public servant, that officer should be immediately removed from office. If any person or political party comes forward to protect such an officer covertly or overtly, it is needless to say that it is a serious crime. But it is questionable whether the accusations leveled against the Prime Minister and the UNP are fair because when appointing and removing the IGP, a person or a political party cannot interfere in it due to the constitutional provisions guiding them.
Constitutional provisions
The office of the IGP is a public service post laid out in the constitution i.e. it is one of the posts stipulated and enshrined in the constitution. According to the constitution, appointments to such positions should be done by the President. As these regulations have been changed time and again with the introduction of various amendments there is no consensus among the constitutional provisions laid out in relation to this. The first regulation in relation to this was the provisions laid out in the Constitution of 1978, under article 54. It stated that the President shall appoint all public officers required by the Constitution or other written law to be appointed by the President, as well as the Attorney-General and the Heads of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Police Force. The constitution did not provide guidelines as to who should be appointed and on what grounds those appointments should be based on allowing the President to make such appointments on his/her whims and fancies.
The 17th Amendment made to the Constitution of 1978 which came into effect in the year 2000 changed article 54 and stated that the President should make the appointments in consultation with the constitutional council. Accordingly, when appointments have to be made to the public service posts mentioned in the constitution, the President can only appoint them after following the directives of the Constitutional Council. The following are such posts where this process had to be followed when making appointments.
1. Members of the Election Commission2. Members of the Public Service Commission3. Members of the National Police Commission4. Members of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka5. Members of the Bribery Commission6. Members of the Monetary Commission7. Members of the Delimitation Commission
For the following posts, the President could only appoint people only if the Constitutional Council approves the nominations made by the President to the said council.
1. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and other Judges2. The President of the Appeals Court and other Judges3. Members of the Judicial Service Commission except its President4. The Attorney General5. The Auditor General6. The Inspector General of the Police7. The Ombudsman8. The Secretary General of the Parliament
The 18th Amendment to the Constitution brought out on September 8, 2010, by the former government headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa removed the checks imposed by the 17th Amendment on the President in appointing high ranking government officials on his/her whims and fancies and transferred the sole authority of appointing such officers back to the President. This was again repealed in 2015 by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution introduced by the current government which reversed the absolute authority given to the President in appointing high ranking public officials and brought back the method introduced by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. As a result of this change, the President could only appoint the IGP if the Constitutional Council approves the nomination given by the President. But even though the Constitutional provisions clearly laid out as to how the IGP should be appointed none of the amendments laid down provisions as to how an IGP can be removed from office prior to his/her retirement.
Removal of Officers (Procedures) Act
So from the above discussion, it becomes clear that it is not the Prime Minister or the UNP who is actually working to keep the IGP in office but this particular crisis in the Constitutional provisions. Thus, how can the IGP then be removed As lawyers point out, the only way to overcome this situation is to follow the directives given in the Removal of Officers (Procedures) Act number Five of 2002 which deals with the removal of officers mentioned in the constitution. According to this act, there are two ways which can be adopted to remove an IGP from office. Firstly, if the President is convinced that the IGP is guilty of the following offences, the President can remove the IGP from office. The said offences are:
(a) being adjudged an insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction; (b) being unfit to continue in office by reason of ill health or physical or mental infirmity; (c) being convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude, treason or bribery; (d) being found guilty of misconduct or corruption; (e) being found guilty of gross abuse of power of his office; (f) being found guilty of gross neglect of duty; (g) being found guilty of gross partiality in office; or (h) ceasing to be a citizen of Sri Lanka.
The second method is to remove the IGP through a motion passed in Parliament if he/she is found to be guilty of one or more of the following offenses:
(d) being found guilty of misconduct or corruption; (e) being found guilty of gross abuse of power of his office; (f) being found guilty of gross neglect of duty; (g) being found guilty of gross partiality in office.
For this to come into force, a resolution should be forwarded to Parliament by not less than 1/3 of the members of parliament (including those not present) claiming that an inquiry board should be appointed to inquire into the allegations (as mentioned above) and it should be approved by a majority vote in Parliament.
Accordingly, an inquiry board should be constituted and it should consist of three members, namely a supreme court judge appointed by the Chief Justice who will preside as the President, the Chairman of the National Police Commission and another member who will be an imminent person in the field of law or an eminent person in the field of public management appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader. If this inquiry board after conducting an inquiry deems that the IGP is guilty of the above mentioned charges, a motion should be brought before Parliament requesting his removal and it should be approved by a majority vote in Parliament. After that, the resolution should be forwarded to the President and the President should take the necessary steps to remove the IGP.
Therefore, it is extremely difficult to remove an IGP prior to his retirement as it is an extremely complex process. One thing becomes very clear and that is that the Prime Minister and the UNP cannot do anything much to keep or remove the current IGP from office and this fact should be understood by the members of the Joint Opposition and its followers.
The Joint Opposition should act responsibly and stop misleading the public by spreading false propaganda over and over again in relation to this and what they should do is to forward a resolution to the Parliament as mentioned above requesting to remove the IGP or pressurize the current government to bring forth such a motion. Finally, it is apt to state that such a move would be the ultimate litmus test to check the stance of the Prime Minister and the UNP with regard to the current IGP.

The Minister was addressing a meeting after inaugurating the Embilipitiya Gal Amuna Water Supply Scheme costing Rs. 19 million built under the World Bank funded water supply and sanitation programme recently.
Minister Athukorale said the country had lagged behind in development by about 70 years due to politics which had been the bane of the country.
Everytime the UNP rebuilds the country and its economy, the opposition groups came to power and ruined it. Today, no one spoke about the good work done by the present government. For instance, the Health Minister had drastically reduced the prizes of essential drugs and improved government sector health facilities but no one seemed to give due publicity to it, Minister Athukorale said.
But most people chanted the Mahinda Manthram saying that the Buddha Sasana had been preserved in the country thanks to the former President.The Buddhasasana had been always protected in the country right throughout its history and a Rajapaksa was not needed to give it protection, because the Maha Sangha was there to do it, the Minister said.
Minister Athukorale said that the Prime Minister had been able to assist nearly 1,500 Buddhist temples during the last three years through the Central Cultural Fund. The President too had been helping Buddhist temples in the remotest part of the country through the Presidents Fund. The government led by the President and the Prime Minister was doing everything possible to dispel poverty and uplift the country economically.

Sera to augment  quality of coconut  consumption
Ceylon Biscuits Limiteds (CBL) a much favoured brand Sera coconut milk recently sponsored a workshop in Kurunegala, organized by the Coconut Development Authority which operates under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture.
The workshop mainly focused on the application of best methodologiesfor coconut extraction.
The program was held in conjunction with the International Coconut Day, which fell on September 2. Many topics were brought to light with emphasis on the importance of coconuts, along with the reasons for inculcating best practices in coconut consumption to gain a sustainable coconut cultivation. Demonstrations were also held to further explain about efficient methods of extracting coconut.
Attendees were enlightened on the issue of how a great amount of coconut is wasted when coconuts are scraped manually, or when grated coconut is squeezed to extract milk. The gravity of issue in the context of the country is alarming, as coconut is consumed throughout the island, thus increasing the amount of waste considerably.
The program further elaborated that when local coconut farmers fail to meet the growing consumer demands, the circumstances lead the country to import coconuts from overseas.
This in turn paves the way for a substantial outflow of money, consequently impacting the local economy, as well as the livelihoods of small-scale coconut cultivators.
Sera coconut milk is manufactured using high quality coconut produce directly from the local small-scale coconut farmers. CBLs Sera Real Coconut Milk is an ideal choice that brings great convenience for busy housewives, as it is high in hygienic safety and quality.

## Title: SHAKESPEARE IN THEATRE

SHAKESPEARE IN THEATRE
The cultural diversity and the confusion that was evidently felt, needed to be interpreted on stage and removed from roadside shows as was during his time. Where and how to start becoming the major issue. It was revelatory. In today's point of view, theatre is like a monarch of a toppled regime. It was involved in attempts to resolve a paradox and be faithful to Shakespeare plays and this process was central. Traditions continued to dominate but the plays' limitations became excessively a problem for lack of permanent settings to board the plays.
As actors trudged the countryside playing in the open and marketplaces until James Burbage changed the scenario. He secured a permanent patent for a London company and built an outdoor theatre in 1576 and called it the theatre of the day where later the Lord Chamberlain's Men who were Shakespeare's company would eventually perform. The theatre was not free but was subject to opposition by those who resented the Bard. However, with permanent players, the idea caught on. Theatres like The Curtain, The Swan, The Fortune, The Rose became popular.
And Shakespeare was on the rise.
SOCIAL STRUCTURE
From beautiful open-air shows to today's magnificent theatre
Later, they were to face problems with the fast developing professional companies but with the traditional social structure, theatre-going had developed into a craze by the end of the century, protected by the great and watched by Queen Elizabeth.
There was no stopping Shakespeare.
So, James Burbage built the Theatre to the north of the city and by 1594 The Lord Chamberlain's Men including Shakespeare were residents in this theatre. The Globe was on the north and The Rose on the south bank of the River Thames which was a part of Surrey. There was also the Blackfriars that had been a monastery outside the city authority. Their functions were different but with a single determine goal; to popularize Shakespeare plays. The ideas and ideals flourished when one by one as a dedication to Shakespeare blossomed, from a small theatre to another, they became the celebration to future generations. We see the magnificent Royal Shakespeare Theater a testimony to the greatest poet that ever lived. Like his humble beginning, the theatre too fought its way simultaneously to preserve English that was to make a world of difference from the classroom to the academics of high calibre. The literary scene buzzed and buzzed and still buzz with new vocabulary, unprecedented dialogue and Shakespearean English, and there was the theatre 'live' to the audiences not only in England but around the world, from generation to generation, from century to century and presently in the millennium.
THE GLOBE
People felt a new experience because the theatre favoured two things above all others; actors and spoken word. It was difficult for actors to establish a sense of place as the play required as there were no sets. Girls had to play boys in the plays and the backup music was hard to get emotions and feelings were lost as most of the time actors had to raise their voices from marketplaces or roadside, but people were there to display growing appreciation. The actor's power required the active co-operation of the audience. The audience played along; such was their admiration. The indoor hall-type theatres were boring and admission charges were so low, there was a recess but not before the Burbage brothers made a unique deal for the short capital in 1599 with leading sharers of the actor's company. There were five and one was Shakespeare and the GLOBE built. The new deal secured for Lord Chamberlain's Men stability and self-determination. In 1603, Lord Chamberlain's Men came to be known as King's Men and remained intact until 1642. This Shakespeare and his plays established going from strength to strength.
SHAKESPEARE IN THE MID-THEATRE
Somehow everything did not go well by 1642 when those opposed to the theatre, it closed down. When they reopened in 1660 they were different from those whom Shakespeare had known. Blackfriars with the TEMPEST reflecting its different resources, but his company still played at the Globe. Unfortunately, the open-air theatres did not survive into the 17th century. From 1660 Shakespeare's plays had to be adapted to suit and accommodate different kind of theatres as well as to different genres. In the 17th century, Shakespeare's plays gave the impression of being embraced without knowing why. Critics and scholars were on to neo-classical literature theory which of course, Shakespeare gleefully flouted upon. Shakespeare demonstrated flouts which at times let him be an exception to neo-classical doctrine but at other times, reworked him to fit their taste. Shakespeare had the capacity to evolve around the unsung and unpolished mess left behind by his critics who by now had faded out of the scene.
But the order had not changed because the Restoration actor still enjoyed something of his Elizabethan predecessors' intimacy with the audience. Most important at that time, 'he' was also now a she. Gone were the days that boys acted in girls' roles. It was Margaret Hughes who initiated the profession of actress-playing by acting as Desdemona in 1660.
Still, everything was not clear for the stage as it was hugely expensive to create new sets of scenery and players often used what was available as props. The tradition continued to dominate the acting of Shakespeare plays and actors were faced with the limitation on time and cultural conservatism of the 18th century.
In 1700-79, Charles Macklin scored a massive hit as Shylock when he first played the role in 1741. Followed by David Garrick in 1717-79 who played Richard III in a London debut from an adaptation by Colley Cibber and later as a redefined Shylock and there still was no assumption that performance needed to be organized. One role after another when mounted on a stage enhanced the importance of Shakespeare dialogue. People enjoyed a collective identity and plays became extremely popular as part of London life.
STRATFORD-UPON-AVON
This bring us to Daniel Baker, the puritan High Bailiff of Stratford who banned players from the town in Shakespeare's lifetime and for over a century after his death, there were few performances in Stratford until 1746 when a touring company led by John Ward who was the grandfather of John Phillip Kemble and Sarah Siddons, presented OTHELLO in the Old town hall. Slowly and steadily the plays emerged on and off until David Garrick mounted a Shakespeare 'Jubilee'. The still flourishing Shakespeare Club was founded in 1824 and in 1827, a small theatre open in 1827 in the Chapel lane only to be put down in the following year.
In March 1926 a mysterious fire destroyed the old building with only the library and picture gallery left. Generous donations from America made possible the building of the present Shakespeare Memorial Association and was opened by the Prince of Wales on Shakespeare's birthday April 23.

## Title: Siva worship in Sri Lanka

Siva worship in Sri Lanka
Siva worship in Sri Lanka is deep-rooted and interwoven in the ethos of the Sri Lankan Hindu society. Generally, it is based on Saiva Agama tradition, Hindu moral codes and rituals. According to legend, Ravana the famed king of ancient Sri Lanka was an ardent devotee of Lord Siva. He ruled the country conforming to the edicts of Hindu values and moral codes. This brought him great recognition and fame. The land he ruled got the honorific name Ravanathipathy.
Sri Lanka is known as "Elangai" or "Elangapuri'' in Tamil since ancient times, King Ravana was called Elangeshwaran. Being a fervent devotee of Lord Siva he imbibed the rules and values and adhered to all the Hindu practices in rituals, art, culture and tradition.
Hindu traditionalism
Sri Lanka is well known as a country where the Hindu Bhakti cult is deeply entrenched. The Bhakti cult is followed by the Hindus throughout the island. Hindus of Sri Lanka are devoted to Hindu traditionalism. They carry out the worship of Lord Shiva in accordance with Saiva agama codes, or Margams.
The first and foremost among them is the bodily worship known as Sariya Margam. The second mode is ritualistic in performing poojas and following well-established practices. The third mode is known as Yoga Margam consisted of strict codes of conduct, exercising control over the body and mind and engaging in meditation. The fourth and the highest form or mode is Gnana Margam. In Gnana Margam the re-animation of worldly desires, contemplative thinking and single-minded dedication to achieve salvation are emphasized. All the above-mentioned Margams are followed and practised with earnest dedication.
Observing the regular and systematic pursuance of Hindu worship in the country, the great saint Thirumular gave the name 'Sivapumi' (Land of Siva) to Lanka.
The island of Lanka is dotted with Hindu temples throughout its length and breadth. Among them, two outstanding temples are worthy of special mention. These are Thiruketheeswaram in the west coast of Sri Lanka, and Thirukoneshwaram in the Trincomalee district in the east coast of the island. Both these temples are hallowed by history and tradition.
Wrath of Vayu Bhagavan
According to legend, there was once a conflict and clash between God of Wind Vayu Bhagavan and Athesheshan (thousand headed Cobra). Unable to bear the wrath of Vayu Bhagavan, Athesheshan hid in Mount Meru (Meru Malai).
The Vayu Bhagavan, who was very powerful and mighty, blew the mountain to break it into three parts. One part fell on the western coast of Lanka, near the present day Mannar and became Thiruketheeswaram. Another fell on the eastern coast near Trincomalee, to become Thirukoneshwaram. The third part fell on the southern part of the Indian coast and became Rameshwaram. According to the epic 'Ramayana', the Lankan King Ravana engaged in the worship of Siva both at Thiruketheeswaram and Thirukoneshwaram. Hymns composed by the great Saiva saints praise the devotion of King Ravana to Lord Siva.
The two great shrines of Thiruketheeswaram and Thirukoneshwaram, find a special place in the hymns of Saiva saints. Saint Thirugnanasampanthar and Saint Thirunavukarasar (Appar) of the 7th century and Saint Sundaramoorthy Nayanar of 8th century have sung the glories of these two temples.
There is an overabundance of evidence about Ravana and Siva worship in Tamil literary works. For instance, in the 'Thiruneetru Thirupathikam' composed by the great Saiva saint Thirugnanasampanthar mentioned in a phrase ''Ravananmelathuneeru'' meaning holy ash on Ravana which proclaims the devotion of King Ravana to Lord Shiva. It also shows the high esteem in which King Ravana was held by the Saiva saints. According to puranic evidence, Ravana's mother and wife were also devotees of Lord Siva. It is said that Ravana's father-in-law the divine architect 'Mayan' built the Thiruketheeswaram temple.
Worshipped shrines
According to the epic 'Ramayana', Lord Rama on his way back to India after the victory over Ravana, worshipped at the shrines of Thiruketheeswaram, Thirukoneshwaram and Munneshwaram, with the purpose of washing away the sins caused by the killing of Ravana. Thirukoneshwaram area was regarded as a citadel of Ravana's kingdom.
Thiruketheeswaram is often referred to as Theen Kailasam (Mt Kailah of South). At Thirukoneshwaram also known as Konnamamali, there can be seen a cleft in the rock which is known as 'Ravanan Veddu', meaning 'cut by Ravana'. Legend indicates that King Ravana while performing the last rite for his mother took out the sword and cut the rock to cause the permanent cleft. It is also said in the same legend that the funeral rites of Ravana's mother were performed in the hot springs of Kinniya, close to Thirukoneshwaram.
There is also ample historical evidence to show that many Sivan temples were built all over Sri Lanka by different rulers, chieftains and philanthropists and the general public in different periods.
Highly revered
Each of these temples located in different parts of the country has its own history and grandeur. A few of the temples are worthwhile to be mentioned here. One of them is Karainagar Shivan temple which is in Karainagar in the Jaffna district. This temple is known as 'Elathuchidamparam' which is highly revered. Another important temple in the Jaffna district is Naguleswaram Shivan temple situated in the coastal belt of Keerimalai Sea. This historic temple is located close to the Kankesanthurai natural harbour.
In the heart of Jaffna town, there is another Shivan temple called Vanarpanai Vaitheeswaranather temple with majestic Kopuram (tower) decorated with excellent sculptures. This temple was built with exclusive Dravidian architecture.

As Sri Lanka Army celebrates 69th anniversary:
Soldiers turn nation builders
Soldiering in Sri Lanka during ancient, medieval, colonial, post-independent and contemporary times undoubtedly mirrors how the exercise of military power, as in the case of many countries around us, turned our nation to statesmanship while ensuring a potent and dynamic force for defence of the new nation-state in place.
These histories, many of which are replete with sagas of gallantry and selfless dedication stand out as sources of inspiration to budding generations and serving troops alike.
The birth of the Sri Lanka Army (then Ceylon Army) in 1949 on a day like today (October 10), just 20 months after independence, testifies to the foresight and wisdom the founding fathers of the new nation state had at a time communism was replacing imperialism in the aftermath of decolonisation that began to occur in Asia after World War 11.
Ancient military encounters
The military history of Sri Lanka relates back to the days of the arrival of Prince Vijaya from India with a contingent of his followers, some 700 in number, as cited in the Mahawansa, but seeds for the first military engagement were sown only after Prince Vijaya and his followers vanquished the Raksha queen Kuveni.
Repeated incursions of South Indian Cholas into the country during the period of King Pandukabhaya whose kingdom was established in Anuradhapura around 544 BC, prompted him to raise his own rival forces to defend his territory, along with erection of some fortresses around Anuradhapura.
More prominently, King Dutu Gemunus (around 200 BC) warfare with an army of some 11,000 island-inhabitants, against the invading Chola prince Elaara, an encounter which has gone down in history as the first recorded military offensive against a foreign invader in a well-organised manner is well revered to date.
Before the country fell under colonial rule around the 15th century, Royal history speaks how a galaxy of rulers such as King Gajaba (113 AD), King Dhatusena (433 AD), King Vijayabahu (1001 AD), King Parakramabahu the Great (1153), Parakramabahu VI, and others resisted foreign intruders and reinforced their command in the country with their outstanding military expeditions. Strong fortresses were erected, naval powers fortified, but all those defences were done strangely without any standing Army, according to the chronicles.
Colonial era
Records compiled during the occupation of the Portuguese (1500 - 1658 AD), the Dutch (1658 - 1798 AD) and the British (1798 - 1948 AD) clearly assert how groups of military commanders at provincial levels from time to time organised resistance or rather rebellions against conquerors by inculcating an esprit de corps among Sinhala patriots.
Construction of fortresses by Sinhala kings, many of which remain in Sigiriya, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Kotte are a living testament to the excellent engineering skills that they possessed and their foresight in evaluating the potential threat of the enemy in any given scenario.
The invasion of the British and their subsequent occupation was focused on their own security, particularly as regards the Indian Empire. Unlike the Portuguese and the Dutch, British colonial powers began intruding the up-country and provoked uprisings of the locals against them which are well documented. What is unique in the Kandyan uprisings is how those local fighters resorted to guerilla warfare and became a formidable threat to the Britishers.
Significantly, the Britishers having experienced different fighting skills among the locals and also distinguished war-fighting techniques, by 1802 formed the 1st Ceylon Regiment, commanded by a British Commanding Officer. It was followed by the 2nd Ceylon Regiment and the 3rd Ceylon Regiment which fought in the Kandyan wars in 1803.
One must not forget that although those regiments were largely of the Sinhalese, other ethnic groups like Malays and Africans also joined those regiments. The British renamed those regiments the Ceylon Rifle Regiment in 1817 and began recruiting. However, Weera Puran Appus Matale Rebellion, a landmark threat to the Britishers, ended the recruitment of Cinghalese to the British Army due to different reasons.
Around the same time, the volunteer movement in Ceylon, which was meant to compensate for the void created by the disbandment of the Ceylon Rifle Regiment in 1874, began. A few years later, representations made to the British Crown permitted the petitioners to form themselves into the Ceylon Light Infantry Volunteers (CLIV).
The pre-independence evolution of the existing Army wings and formal raising of the Ceylon Army which was prompted by the World War I, and afterwards, World War II, was clear evidence that the local political leadership was also strongly supportive of Ceylon having a defence policy of their own since Ceylon lies on the sea routes of the world. The local political leadership that replaced the British signed a Defence Agreement with the British Crown on the eve of Ceylon gaining Independence.
Ceylon Army
Dominion status as a Commonwealth member and the Defence Agreement guaranteed Ceylons security and enabled the local political leadership to raise the Ceylon Army (1949), Ceylon Navy (1950) and Air Force (1951) respectively, as independent Ceylon legislated their formation in Parliament. This landmark development of the armed forces was however fully identical to the British defence structure.
Though the concept of having our own Army troops was a new one, it required proper planning and training which therefore prompted the first Permanent Secretary to the Defence and External Affairs Ministry at that time, Sir Kanthiah Vaithianathan, to stimulate the undertaking with the inclusion of British advisors in the Ministry to fine-tune the structure of the Army. As a result, the Army Act of No. 17 of 1949 imparted legal authority for the establishment of the Army.
Cycles of violence
The support of Army troops was sought when ethnic tensions and internal strife occurred in 1952 (hartal), 1959 (anti-Muslim tension), 1971 (JVP insurrection), 1983 (ethnic clashes), 1989 - 1990 (JVP terror), and so on.
The murder of 13 Army soldiers in one single incident in 1983 by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Jaffna and the subsequent threats that began developing in relation to Northern security concerns made the Army play a more formidable task. Successive Army Commanders in close collaboration with Police and Defence Ministry authorities, between 1965-2005 threw their weight behind the governments in power, while the LTTE threat was looming large, entering the very heart of the South. However, it is pertinent to mention here that all those Army engagements against internal threats were largely meant to support the Police as an auxiliary force in defensive roles.
The escalation of LTTE violence in the North and East incurring huge human and public property losses compelled all service commanders, Police and defence authorities to assess ground realities and devise new defensive strategies to take on the enemy. The Army assisted by sister services continued to hold their strongholds in the North despite fierce armed encounters with the LTTE terrorists.
Turning Point
The period between the final quarter of 1999 and 2004 was one of the most unpredictable in recent history, since the LTTE, making use of temporary ceasefires, went on strengthening their armoury and replenishing their fighting cadres. Yet, the Army remained confined to their barracks and camps across the North and East, honouring its commitment to peace. However, as during the presence of the Indian Peace-keeping Force (1989-1992), the LTTE used the ceasefire to their maximum advantage, here and abroad.
Win over terrorism
Different Army Commanders, taking a serious note of developing violence, added new wings, like sniffing battalions, Commandos, Special Forces, and air mobile platoons, with a view to countering the LTTE. With a new government in place by 2005, the public mood was clear. People wanted the LTTE menace to be wiped out if they were not genuine about peace dividends. The Army, together with its sister services, was fully confident that they could take on the terrorists, provided they were supplied with weaponry to match the enemy threats.
The LTTEs closure of the Mavil Aru anicut initialled the beginning of the road to its annihilation by ground troops as the public pressure was mounting against LTTE atrocities. Army troops moved into dense Eastern jungles and took on LTTE hideouts and cleared the entire East of the LTTE. Those battles of the Army caused no harm to any civilian as reported and ended effectively before ground troops began moving North. Sri Lanka Armys outstanding achievements in the Northern theatre of violence between 2006 and 2009 have already gone on record. But one of the most humane approaches that had ever been made by any Army in the world, for that matter, was the Sri Lanka Armys rehabilitation of near 13,000 LTTE terrorists, who had either been captured or who had surrendered to the Army.
Army under transformation
The three-decade conflict that concluded with the defeat of the LTTE in May 2009 stood out as a litmus test for brave soldiers of the Army who were the driving force behind the humanitarian operations. Not only that, the victorious Army personnel observed a 48-hour pause by silencing all guns as a mark of respect to all the victims. The maturity shown by the troops after their military dominance reaffirmed how much the Army was into human concerns.
At first, the Army turned its role towards a new dimension, based on the 5R Concept (Reconstruction, Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Reintegration, Reconciliation), just a few months after the conclusion of the war.
The Army assisted the people to get back to their normal lives and extended every possible humanitarian assistance in close coordination with different state and other agencies which came forward to help reconstruct the devastated North. The trust placed in the Army during both wartime and peacetime by all stakeholders displayed that the Army was treated as the inevitable land force, capable of managing any challenge for the benefit of the masses.
Nation re-building
The daunting tasks of nation-building, for the benefit of the masses, and reconciliation, to avert any recurrence of violence in future, is another landmark project that has now been undertaken by the Army since it possesses required manpower as well as the technical expertise.
After 2015, the Sri Lanka Army having engaged in bitter fighting for over 30 years has been instrumental in addressing their own structural and operational requirements to be in line with professional standards. Various new reforms are being executed with strict focus on extensive training modules and right-sizing of all units throughout the island to be in compliance with the incumbent Commanders vision in terms of nation-building, training and administration of the organisation.
At present, Army troops throwing their full weight behind national campaigns, are engaged in mammoth cultivation programmes, distributing coconut and other saplings in the North and East, renovating and constructing religious and public places and schools, renovating nearly 2,000 irrigational tanks, distributing drinking water to drought-hit civilians and distributing essentials, school accessories, and push bicycles to the people.
The Army is also building new houses for low-income groups, involved in environmental projects, donating blood to Northern and Eastern hospitals, conducting medical clinics, distributing free spectacles and medicine, supplying agricultural equipment, repairing abandoned waterways and canals, and cleaning sacred premises,
Further, the Army conducts reconciliation projects, conducts motivation lectures for rural youth, secures employment opportunities for the unemployed, distributes free fertilizer among farmers, constructs pre-schools for low-income groups, conducts leadership training programmes for civilians, to name some of its humanitarian projects.
Above and all, the quick and rapid deployment of Army troops in the event of large-scale national disasters and catastrophes like landslides, floods, storms, and garbage slides, has come in for praise from all quarters due to their unmatched skills to face any eventuality. The present-day Army has turned out to be the most sought-after service provider in the island which is capable of minimising wastage and estimated costs in an impressive manner.
Foreign recognition
The Sri Lanka Army, now gaining recognition at foreign levels as a matured entity, has been proud to continue with its mega annual flagship projects like the Defence Seminar, Field Training Exercise Cormorant Strike, Army to Army Staff Talks and Defence Dialogues. Its participation in overseas UN assignments as peace-keepers, observers or staffers has also brought fame and dividends to all ranks while achievements in the field of athletics and sports have also added special significance to the Army both at national and foreign spheres. Participation of its cultural troupes and bands in international events is another landmark achievement of the Army in the recent past.
Another important facet in the training modules that has been introduced by the incumbent Army Commander is the exchange programme of logistic knowhow of Warrant Officers in the Sri Lanka Army with regional armies like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, through which batches of Sri Lankan Non-Commissioned Officers are sent for training in those armies.
It is clear this reputed organisation which is enshrined with the sacred duty of defending the countys sovereignty, territorial integrity and the independence is well geared to take on any challenge whatsoever that would come along the way. As the Commander himself has repeatedly quipped, The Army is in its highest readiness more than ever to face any challenge while making every possible effort to avert any resurgence of violence in the country, displaying the maximum degree of its alliance for promotion of reconciliation and ethnic harmony wherever they serve.
As the Roman poet, Horace once wrote encompassing ethos of bravery, It is sweet and fitting to die for ones country and brave sons and daughters of the Army in future too would explicitly exhibit their valour and determination to safeguard the interests of this nation at this milestone 69th Army Anniversary, commemorated today. May our brave soldiers have strength and wisdom to steer clear of all hurdles and take this beautiful isle of ours to prosperity and righteousness.

SPECIAL OP. TO ARREST AAVA MEMBERS
A special operation was launched by the Jaffna Police yesterday to arrest suspects involved with the Aava gang and in respect of other gang activities, the Jaffna Senior DIG Roshan Fernando told the Daily News.
He said the special search operation has been launched in the Kopai, Chunnakam and Manipai areas especially targeting the Inuvil and Kokkuvil areas where most of the gang violence has been reported.
During the cordon and search operation yesterday the police officers had searched around 21 homes, while three suspects who had been involved with the Aava gang had been arrested.
The special operation took place with the participation of around 300 police officers including 200 from the Jaffna range, 50 from Mullaithivu, 50 from Killinochchi and the rest being intelligence officers, the Senior DIG said.
The police had also launched a vehicle search operation from 6.00 am to 11.00 am yesterday especially targeting motorcycles resulting in 81 traffic cases being filed.
Senior DIG Fernando noted that these mass scale police operations would be continued in order to curb gang violence in the North.
During a press briefing held by Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara last week, the Jaffna Senior DIG vowed to step up operations to curb gang violence in the North. However, he said these operations were targetted at apprehending those who commit violence and would not disrupt the lives of the ordinary people.
The majority of the people living in the North are peaceful and peace loving.
Hence, we do not want these operations to hinder their peaceful living and we conduct these operations only after intense intelligence operations. Our intelligence units first conduct investigations and once we have identified areas where these Aava and other gang members are residing, only then do we conduct these cordon and search operations,he said.
The Jaffna Senior DIG noted however, that sometimes even though the gang members are located, when the Police launch search operations the parents of these gang members claim that they dont live there anymore. But Senior DIG Roshan Fernando vowed to continue these special operations in order to eradicate these gang activities from the North.

Tambimuttus poetic voice
I remember well the day I met the poet Tambimuttu at his own publishing house named The Lyrebird Press in London as far back as 1969. This happened to be the launch of a new collection of Bangladesh poems translated into English by Pritish Nandy. The book is titled as Poems from Bangla Desh: The voices of a new nation (1970). The poet was also known by the shorter name Tambi. He happened to have several links with the BBC World Service.
As such he had a special admiration for those of us who came to see him. The copy of the collection of poems selected by him for the launching occasion gifted to all of us. I still have my copy which I fished out from the shelf and read from time to time. The poems are selected by Tambimuttu, who full name goes Meary James Thurajirajah Tambimuttu (1915  1983). The English-reading world came to know him as famous Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) born Tamil poet, editor and publisher known for his editions of Poetry London and Poetry New York.
Early poet
While being an undergraduate in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) attending the University of Ceylon based in Colombo, he left for London at the age of 22 and started the career of an editor solely responsible for bringing out the well-known poetry journal, Poetry London. He was helped by such poets as Lawrence, Darrell, TS Eliot and Dylan Thomas to name a few. Shuttling from the UK to the US, Tambi had the chance of bringing only his own poems but also o bring out many a collection of poems from others.
He arrived in London in 1968 and founded the Lyrebird Press to which we visited as cited earlier. Tambis name is identified with those poets who wrote poems during the period before and after the Second World War. In 1942, he brought out his anthology of poems titled Poetry in Wartime: An Anthology, which became known as an epitome of creative pacifism. Followed by the success, he compiled the companion volume titled Indian Love Poems.
As he told us on the launching day of the Poems from Bangla Desh: The Voice of New Nation, the aim in the founding of the Lyrebird Press is to help the wearied people of the west to gather and be influenced by the books on the prophetic vision of the East and more broadly the spiritualism in the Orient. Regarding the matter, he was a regular participant in the BBC Radio Broadcasts Talking to India commenced as far back during the few months of World War II.
Creative skills
Coming on to the topic of the poems from Bangla Desh, the 35 poems in the anthology in English translation represent the main trends in the creative skills of the poets living in East Bengal, which emerged as a new nation called Bangla Desh. Most of these poems were written in the early sixties and most of them too had come to be known since the declaration of the Independence in 1971. The themes in the selected poems cover such aspects as the day to day stories of the people, the pains in the living conditions, the need for social changes etc. The lines of the opening poem by Ahmad Mansur go as follows.
Every day this happensAnd it will happen again:This fire is fearlessIt will burn againWorkers are restlessAngry processions marchThe roads and the fields trembleWith the voice of the peasantEvery day this happensand it will happen again.
The need to live in a land that is loved a person the sense captured in the poem titled My Truth, This Land by Abuttena Mustafa Kamal:
The Mountains, the fields,And the orchards of my landThe ports, the farms andThe faces of her childrenAre all one with my bloodThey have mingledAnd are nowPart of my consciousnessWhen the beauty of a womanEnchants me, or when theThe magic of some lost songEchoes in my mind,I find O, my motherland!
The poem titled as Not War, We Want Peace captures the sense of misery caused by war tortures as composed by the poet Daud Haidar.
Not war, bring peace,We want to live, all our days togetherIn this same home,What shall we gainBy hoarding hate,Each in our private worldCome, let us be friends,Let us cross the mountains of grief,Not war, bring us peaceTo these two nations,So that we may live all our days togetherIn friendship
The preface to the collection of poems as written by Tambimuttu explains some of the inner textual meanings in his selections. He says that some poems date back to the period of the popular language movement when East Bengal was rocked by police firings on crowds who were demonstrating against the imposition of Urdu as the official language.
Reminiscing the poetic essence left behind by the great poet Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengal poet Nyamat Hussain writes the following lines:
If I am slaughteredAll that will remain of meMy blood, my flesh, my bones,Will be Bengal.Bengal has suffered greatlyAnd yet in spite of her suffering in her literatureAnd in her songsIs the passion for languageThis is the anguish we shareWe respect the memories of Shakespeare, Dante and Tolstoy. But in the blood of my heart remain Tagore. The poet Hussains point of illumination goes as:
Ours is the language of Tagore,This is the Language that is Tagore,Bengal.
The poem rests on two layers namely the patriotic vein as well as the sense of portrayal eyes of masses on the subject of love for ones nation.
It is recorded that most of Tambimuttus own works are difficult to access and his earliest works published before he came to London are untraceable and perhaps lost. His greatest influence was as an editor and publisher, especially during the 1940s. I am not soo sure whether the English literary scholars in Sri Lanka have devoted their studies on Tambimuttue in order to find the real portrait of Tambimuttu as a legacy.
But I faintly remember that the late English Professor Lyn Ludowyk devoting several pages of his work Marginal Comments on Tambimuttu and his works.

Police Sergeant Sanath Gunawardena who acted in an unruly manner over the releasing of a lorry transporting sand by the Thebuwana OIC on October 3 was granted Rs.50,000 surety bail by Matugama Magistrate Wasantha Kosala Senadeera yesterday.
When the case was taken up last morning, the Magistrate had to postphone it since senior Police officers were not present in Court and had to be taken again later.
When the case was taken up for the second time, the Defence Counsel Attorney-at-Law Gamini Nallapperuma submitted that although the Thebuwana Police filed the B-report under Penal Code Section 300, 386 and Section 44 of the Fire Arms Act for attempted murder, intimidation and levelling threats charges could not be filed against his under the same counts.
He pointed out that no body had made a complaint against him before he was arrested. However, the Thebuwana Police filed a second B report yesterday removing the attempted murder section and the defence argued that those charges too could not be accepted. He pointed out that only desciplinary action at department level could be possible.
The Magistrate thereafter granted him bail and postponed the inquiry for December 11.

They want to break free
Painters are bestowed with the talent of treading beyond norms demarcated by the society. They, being a rare breed, thus stimulate philosophical thinking within people with their vivid creations.
Yet, how does an Abstract expressionistic style of painting sans human figures appeal to people in this three-dimensional lonely planet People here are so accustomed to three dimensional and tangible objects and life forms.
The universe is enormous. According to Buddhist teachings, many galaxies and unseen worlds and beings with different dimensions prevail in this universe. If so how can we draw three-dimensional human figures and pronounce that they have universal appeal opines Sarath Gunasiri Perera, who is the Head of the department of painting, faculty of visual arts at the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Sri Lanka.
Must see
An exhibition of paintings named Trilogy consisting abstract expressionistic style of paintings done by the threesome, Sarath Gunasiri Perera, Dr R M Dharmasena and Honduras based Santos Arzu Quioto is now being held at the J D A Perera Gallery, Horton Place, Colombo 7.
The exhibition will remain open till October 13.
Trilogy could be endorsed as a must see exhibition of paintings for philosophical thinkers and truth seekers. The composition of the works of these three artists is food for thought for budding artists and students.
Our teaming up to hold this exhibition happened unexpectedly. Dr R M Dharmasena was my mentor at the faculty of visual arts. He guided me to move away from representing solid figures to indulge in this type of paintings.
I met Santos Arzu Quioto who is from Central America at an art symposium held in South Korea in 2014. On discovering our pursuit towards finding solace and happiness is so similar, we teamed up to unleash our inner feelings and philosophies via Trilogy exhibition, says Sarath Gunasiri Perera.
Mystical ability
Every brush stroke, every incident in a drawing isnt a coincidence for these three artists. They have the mystical ability to create matching dimensions with their original thoughts and philosophies.
By awakening to the path of innovation, Sarath has held his solo exhibition, In Search of Freedom in 2014.
Santos Arzu is a painter who has held solo exhibitions in many countries deriving enormous exposure. His academic background in sociology has contributed immensely towards his artistic creations.
Santos has more than 25 solo art exhibitions to his credit held in countries, Honduras, Estados Unidos, Repblica Dominicana, Argentina, Per, Colombia, Italy and China. He has had over 40 group exhibitions in Central America, Mxico, Cuba, South Africa, France, Spain, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea.
Dimensional universe
Geometric shapes and designs become a hoax when we think beyond a three-dimensional universe, says Santos.
Though there are various similarities between the works of these three artists, Sarath makes his works unique by selecting soothing colours while maintaining the composition in each of his paintings. Santos uses vivid colours and gigantic creations to express his feelings.
Dr R M Dharmasena, former lecturer and the Head of the department of painting, faculty of visual arts, at the University being the third member in the team says, I am very much concerned with the equilibrium of my paintings with the colour scheme so as to evaluate it in spite of not being titled.
Colour harmony and space can penetrate the human soul. A viewer should have an open mind to see the whole of a painting. He could also add his inner thoughts and expand the horizons of a painting which is not confined by lines, he adds.
These three artists are on a quest to find the hidden truth behind the nonfigurative in the language of painting. Their paintings are untitled and the viewers have the freedom to title them according to their whims and fancies by proceeding to new vistas of freedom.
Their paintings also are not price-tagged but collectors with a passion for real paintings could value them.

Thirty Articles in 20A needs passage by two thirds and at referendum
The Supreme Court (SC) has ruled that 30 Articles out of the all 38 Articles in the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A) need to be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament and approved by the people at a referendum. It has further determined that six out of eight remaining Articles must be passed with a two thirds majority.
Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri at the commencement of sittings in Parliament yesterday announced the Supreme Court determination on the 20A presented by the JVP MP to abolish the Executive Presidency.
The Deputy Speaker, reading out the Supreme Court ruling, said the Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36 and 37 of the Bill to provide for the 20A need to be passed with a special majority of Parliament and consequently approved by the people at a referendum as per the 84 (2) of the Constitution.
According to the Supreme Court ruling, Sections 17, 18, 24, 25, 31 and 33 of the Bill only need the special majority of Parliament as per the 82 (5) of the Constitution.
The 20A was presented to Parliament by JVP MP Vijitha Herath on September 5. The Bill has also made provisions to prevent the crossovers of MPs against the collective decision of the party.
Under the proposed 20th Amendment, the President will be appointed by Parliament, instead of a Presidential Election. The President will continue to be the Head of State and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, but he will no longer be the Head of Government and the Head of Cabinet of Ministers. The proposed 20th Amendment will be implemented only after the current term of office of President Maithripala Sirisena.
As per the draft bill, the Head of Government and the Head of Cabinet of Ministers will be the Prime Minister. The Presidents powers are distributed among the Cabinet, Prime Minister, Constitutional Council and independent commissions.
However, the President will continue to have the powers of appointing the Governors of Provinces as same as the 13th Amendment. The Presidents power to appoint Ambassadors and High Commissioners and grant pardons will be subject to Cabinet approval as per the proposed amendment. It will also remove the Presidents power to prorogue the parliament.
The 20A also requires the President to seek Cabinet approval when granting Presidential pardons. The number of Presidential Staff should also be approved by the Cabinet. The President, once elected by Parliament, cannot hold any position or membership of a political party during his/her tenure.

Trincomalee hosts UNESCO-APEID meeting on entrepreneurship education
Trincomalee is the first South Asian venue to host the 7th UNESCO-APEID meeting on entrepreneurship education.
National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) Chairman Dhakshita Bogollagama explained that the decision to host the international conference somewhere other than Colombo was intentional. Colombo is not Sri Lanka, he said, Its important to highlight the other parts of this country.
The conference is being held from October 9-11 in Trincomalee, and on October 12 in Colombo.
The UNESCO-APEID meeting on entrepreneurship education began in 2012.
Leycheng Tan, from the UNESCO entrepreneurship education network in Thailand, said that they chose Sri Lanka as a venue for this years conference, because we support member states.
She said that Sri Lanka had been vying to host the conference for a number of years, because entrepreneurship is a key facet of the nations development plan. Tan cautioned that government emphasis on entrepreneurship is a double-edged sword, because its still the governments responsibility to create jobs.
During the conference, delegates from 21 different countries will discuss multi-stakeholder engagement to nurture future entrepreneurs.
Eastern Province Governor Rohita Bogallagama, was the guest of honour and delivered the keynote address during the first day of sessions.
The Governor asserted that even under colonial rule entrepreneurship flourished in Sri Lanka, because Sri Lankans managed the network of their industries. They managed the plantations on behalf of the owners who lived in the UK.
Today, a lot of people feel frustrated when they cant achieve their set goals: teachers, parents, their own expectations, he said.
The Governor insisted that entrepreneurship lies in no universal textbook case. It is a cultural orientation, inculcated in the minds of people and specifically youth, pointing out a gap in Sri Lankas knowledge-based education system. The conference, he believed, would spark a change from knowledge-based education to execution-based education, which might include an entrepreneurial skills core curriculum.
Dhakshita Bogallagama noted that only 16 percent of the population of this country have the opportunity to go to university, and the remainder cannot afford to go to private university, perhaps pointing to the lack of infrastructure to practically implement entrepreneurial education in the country.
UNDP Youth Programme Coordination Consultant Varuna Ponnamperuma mentioned the emphasis on entrepreneurs in Vision 2020 and Enterprise Sri Lanka.

Fifteen percent of schoolchildren obese
Fifteen percent of Sri Lankan schoolchildren are obese and most are addicted to sugar, Director of the Non-Communicable Diseases Unit of the Health Ministry Dr. Thilak Siriwardana said yesterday.
Sugar is an addictive stronger than cocaine, he said, at a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo.
Dr. Siriwardana said that an individual should consume six teaspoons (30 grams) or less of sugar daily, but schoolchildren and adults in Sri Lanka are addicted to sugar and consume a lot more than this recommended level. It can lead to many health issues such as diabetes and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
According to Dr. Siriwardana, over 70 percent of deaths in Sri Lanka occur due to NCDs and there are four main factors which cause NCDs: smoking, consuming alcohol, leading a sedentary lifestyle and consuming sugar, salt and fat (oil) over the recommended levels.
A 330ml sweet drink with a red label contains six to nine teaspoons of sugar which is a large quantity. In addition, these drinks contain caffeine which causes kidney stones, tooth decay, sleeplessness, and mental stress, he said.
A short video film competition on the theme Bitter Sugar has been organised by the NCD Unit of the Health Ministry among schoolchildren with the coordination of the Education Ministry. Each video should be of five minutes duration and only schoolchildren and school staff can take part in the production.
Either a video camera or a mobile phone camera can be used to shoot the film. Valuable prizes will be awarded for the winners of the competition.
The closing date for the applications is October 15 and the closing date for handing over videos is October 26. The closing dates will be extended if necessary. More details can be obtained by calling 0012669599 during office hours, he said.

The battle within
The Battle is Within us says Head Girl of Buddhist Ladies College, Pradeeni Don Manuel whose attribute of endurance is her strength. Perfect Prefects features Don Manuel who looks forward to tomorrows opportunities.
The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated __________ Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhis belief has great relevance to the times we live in. One needs to only log onto FB and see stories about the vicious way animals are treated. For Don Manuel tomorrow is an opportunity to do something for them. For those like Don Manuel practices like trophy hunting and cruelty to animals is particularly detestable.
Better version
The battle is within us. We should learn to fight and be someone better tomorrow than we are today, not someone better than someone else. We should be a better version of ourselves. That is what really keeps us going. I am interested in wildlife conservation and environmental conservation. In todays society, there is a lack of love for nature within most people. They simply do not respect life. I think we need to take up the cause of endangered species and protect them. We need to understand that animals have the right to live as well. People can be heartless, explained Don Manuel.
Endurance is her strong point. This is because tomorrow will always have the potential for positive results and a better life. If you can endure till tomorrow, you will always have a chance for happiness. Tomorrow should be looked forward to.
When you live in the society you face a lot of pressure and tension. So if you can bear all that, that is ideal because bearing it is important. You have to learn to get along with different people because no one is the same and you need to cope with lifes situations, said Don Manuel.
Catalyst
She outlined the need to be noble, humble and genuine, saying that you dont need to be like the rest of the herd. She pointed out that anyone can be a catalyst in society.
When facing problems in life we need to be properly organized. The skill of organizing is very important in anyones life. When facing problems it is important that we dont fall down. We should not be stressed out and encumbered and impeded by pressure. We should learn how to strike a certain balance in our lives. I play the piano, sing and cook because that helps me cope with the pressure. I go on the net and find new stuff to cook! I also get the advice of my teachers and parents and that helps me out a lot, stated Don Manuel.
Meeting students from all walks of life has given students of Buddhist Ladies College a positive attitude and a willingness to live in harmony with one another.
I have been at Buddhist Ladies College since Grade 1. It has done a lot in making me who I am today. I am what I am today because of the love given to me by my parents. They gave me the gift of education. I cannot forget my Alma Mater and my teachers. Meeting students from all walks of life, we all learn to respect each other, added Don Manuel.
Moral values
Family life is important to Don Manuel. Families with good values coming together are what forms a nation that is progressive, forward thinking with solid moral values.
One leader in history I admire is Barack Obama. I admire how he balanced his political life with his family life. He was a loving and devoted father and I feel one can learn something from the unity in his family, said Don Manuel.
Her concern for children is evident from her choice of vocation.
I am interested in child psychology and education. I am also interested in interior designing. I hope to balance those two and carry on. I want to convince people to be more eco- friendly. Even at school, we are implementing nature-friendly projects. For example, Polythene is controlled with children bringing less polythene to school. We have separate dustbins for organic materials, polythene, cardboard and paper. We have also initiated planting projects in school and we have started a little garden. Starting small is important. You should start small and then accomplish something noteworthy, pointed out Don Manuel.
A die-hard Harry Potter fan, she is fascinated by the story of Harry Potter which appeals to both adults and children alike. Rowlings masterpiece has enthralled readers around the world. Though a work of fiction it offers very good advice.
Wonderful reading
I love the Harry Potter series. I have been a Harry Potter fan for a long time since I was a kid of 10 years. I still read the books and I never get tired of it, because I really love it. I love how J.K. Rowling weaves the plot. She has linked the stories together in a wonderful way. Her imagination is magical, stated Don Manuel.
She perceives life as an opportunity not to beat others but an opportunity to be the best that she can.
I have been hit down hard many times, but through that, I have realized the real competition is within us. When it comes to life I dont believe in running a race with those around me. My greatest inspiration in life is my parents because they have done a lot for me. Their strength is what I have, said Don Manuel.

The Sri Theatre team is back on stage with an all-new play for theatre lovers in Colombo. It has been a while since their last production took off in Colombo.
This year they have packaged a rib-tickling comedy about a young girl forced into marriage with a boy she barely knows. Rukaiya is ambitious and smart however she fears that marriage might dampen her spirits.
But what to do
The couple must get to know each other or they are to head for a divorce in no time. They must weigh love over the trust, destiny over free will, the new world over the old. The play revolves around a Muslim family. The Sri Theatre team claims that this is the first time in Sri Lankan theatre that non-Muslims have the opportunity to enjoy the inconsistencies and jolly traditions observed by Muslims. The writer who likes to call himself an Existentialist Muslim believes that it is the God-given right to man that he questions his environment. If God wanted blind followers he would simply have engineered automatic solar-powered robots, but then he didnt, according to a line from the play.
The first step to any form of reconciliation is to be able to laugh at ourselves believes Aslam Marikkar the writer of To be or Knot to be.
The play stars Ruwanthi as Zeena, Anaz as Feroze, Chanaka as Nazeer and Mithm as Rukaiya.
Sri theatre company believes that this play will change the way people think about another's religion and realize that in Sri Lanka all religions adhere to a uniquely Lankan set of taboos and traditions.

## Title: BEWARE OF DESIGN PROBLEMS AND RISKS
## Supertitle: SRI LANKAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM:
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, October 10, 2018 - 01:00
SRI LANKAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM:
BEWARE OF DESIGN PROBLEMS AND RISKS
From time to time, we hear losses of deposits and investments of various persons, rich and poor. We also hear financial crises from countries or regions or world that destroy economies of both rich and poor. The Asian currency crisis 1997/98 and the last global financial crisis 2007/09 are the most recent crises. It takes decades to recover from such catastrophes. Nobody can predict them even after early symptoms hit.
The fundamental cause of such losses and crises is the existence of risky financial systems in modern monetary economies. From time to time, the financial systems expand in bubbles with too much risks and fictitious confidence and burst suddenly due to bankruptcies if the bubble is too large beyond limits considered as prudent. Such bursts could be highly contagious across various layers of the financial system due to their inter-connectedness and various concentrations/excesses.
No one can practically escape from the financial system and live its life. However, we can minimize our losses/risks possible from the bursts if we know the design-features and risky nature of the financial system.
Design features of the Sri Lankan Financial System
In modern monetary economies, the financial system is a combination of several layers, possibly built/operated in form of a pyramid. I outline them in four in view of their different business profiles.
First - Central Bank
The first layer is the Central Bank. The Central Bank issues/prints currency as a liability of the government to facilitate transactions in the economy. The purchase of foreign currency (i.e., foreign assets) and grant of credit (domestic assets), both with banks and government, are the dominant means of printing money. Therefore, the accounting balance sheet of the Central Bank is the money printing ledger in the system. As at end of 2017, the Central Bank balance sheet was Rs 1.6 trillion with foreign currency assets constituting 83% which backed the money printing to that magnitude.
Therefore, foreign currency is the core pillar of the financial system. The main risk confronted by this layer is the possible difficulty to return or redeem foreign currency back to the system in emergency. In that context, the purchase of foreign currency is also credit grated by the Central Bank against the collaterals of foreign currency. The present tensions of excessive currency depreciation (exchange rate over-shooting) also could be an early symptom of default on foreign currency-based credit eventually by the Central. The greatest risk of possible default on currency is the collapse of currency systems during inflation crises as a result of reckless macroeconomic management as many countries have confronted in the past (Zimbabwe) and present (Venezuela).
Second - Banking
The second layer is the banking. A part of the money printed by the Central Bank remains as currency with the public and the other part reaches the banking system. Banks raise short-term funds (liquid liabilities) and lend long-term (non-liquid assets). In this business, more money is created in bank books on the top of the money printed by the Central Bank. Therefore, the total balance sheet of the banking system as at end of 2017 was Rs. 10.3 trillion, i.e., 6 times the Central Bank balance sheet. Banks keep only a small portion of currency/cash reserves to repay depositors and lend the majority to earn profits. Therefore, the core risk confronted at the banking layer is the possible default by borrowers on loans and by banks on deposits.
Third - Financial Markets
The third layer is the financial markets where savings are traded in financial securities/assets such as equities, government securities and private debt. In advanced market economies, this layer is very wide covering equites, bonds, hedge funds, exchange traded funds and derivatives. A part of printed and created money is transmitted to financial markets to buy financial securities. Therefore, the securities trade also is nothing but creation of money in books of those borrowers and investors. This is the layer that mostly mobilises foreign currency from participants/investors in the financial systems of other countries. The total of investments in the stocks and government securities was Rs. 10.2 trillion as at end of 2017. The risk confronted at this layer is the possible losses due to market slums (price collapses) and default by bankrupt borrowers.
Fourth - Shadow Banking
The fourth layer is the shadow banking. It contains a diverse set of institutions and persons who mobilize funds for lending and investment in various businesses. Financial intermediaries such as finance companies, leasing companies, thrift institutions, insurance companies, investment companies and pension/retirement funds are some of formal business players.
There is a large network of private businesses which canvas funds through various devices by promising attractive returns. Some operate in pyramidal forms prohibited under the Banking Act. Various businesses which recruit members by collecting various fees or contributions with high promises to provide valuable services through a network of profit-frenzied parties also are pyramidal operators. Microfinance appears to be an emerging social menace. One can count many such business/service networks operating to steal money cunningly from the public.
These business operators are de-factor deposit-takers and/or prohibited schemes without the approval of the Central Bank and they eventually end up in scams. A lot of black money (unlawful earnings and tax-evaded money) is parked or used in this part of the financial system until such money is cleaned up.
This whole layer is globally known as shadow banking as they in aggregate are tantamount to banking. A part of money gets transmitted to this layer which also creates further money in books. The total balance sheet of the approved shadow banking sector was Rs. 5.2 trillion as at end of 2017. The information on a large network of operators is not available to quantify the true size and spread of this layer. Globally, this is the riskiest layer. The last global financial crisis 2007/09 had strong links to the shadow banking. See graphic and Table
Inherent Risks and Returns
Returns
In normal times, almost all participants at the financial system earn profits/returns at various rates. The Central Bank also earns profit or losses or even may confront accounting bankruptcies as some analysts interpret. The greatest return the Central Bank can earn is the economic and price stability and financial system stability which provide the confidence to all participants in the system. The financial system provides unmeasurable benefits to the public by providing services of money to make payments, save and invest.
Inherent Risks
Financial systems have several inherently risky fundamentals. First, all layers exist on the general public trust that all funds/money in books in the system can be recovered in currency/legal tender, if necessary, although it is not so. Second, all layers are inter-connected to different extents through credit flows and their real businesses where some participants operate in several layers simultaneously. Third, the risk of default prevails in all corners as the system is built on credit. The mismanagement of credit/finance is the cause of the default. The losses and collapses we frequently hear are nothing but such defaults.
The Golden Key Credit Card Company which boomed on masked-security deposits taken to provide credit cards service was a large shadow bank that led to a wide contagion across the financial system in 2008. The Central Bank promptly and strategically defused its contagion on the banking layer. Although its contagion on the shadow banking layer was reduced, its resolution still remains unattended even after a decade.
Fourth, in general, all financial assets of participants are financial liabilities of some other participants. All attempt to maximise returns with different risk appetites. The general financial rule of thumb in normal times (when the general public trust remains strong) is; higher the return, the higher is the risk. The interest rate is the mostly seen risk-return indicator as the public do not have the financial know-how to assess and understand the risks and returns from readings of financial disclosures made by bigger participants.
Fifth, the excessive creation of money or leverage in the system is the major root of the risk of default and financial crises. At end of 2017, the leverage in the system (Rs. Rs. 27.3 trillion) was 17 times the Central Bank balance sheet (or money printing).
What if it rises to 34 Further, the total system was twice the countrys total annual income. Then, our dependence on credit and the financial system would be double in a big bubble calling for crises. We will live on too much credit with non-exiting value of financial wealth that can erode in few days.
The current exchange rate tensions also could be early warnings of a risky credit bubble built on foreign currency. The foreign currency is the conduit that connects financial systems and economies across the countries and transmit country bubbles. Already, the bottom of the system is too heavy towards foreign currency credit. This design-risks can cause currency and economic crises in the event the Central Bank defaults on redemption of foreign currency due to insufficient foreign reserve. Similarly, there can be several other points in the system that are burning under the ashes. Some raise grave concerns on heavy public debt stock. Therefore, we need to be mindful of early warnings of risky bubbles and control them if we are to escape from catastrophes.
Safety Nets and Risk Management
There are some forms of government safety nets such as regulations to protect the stability of the system. The Central Bank is the authority responsible to keep the system stable. It has the monetary policy and regulation with a big policy weaponry to control credit and enforce prudence. However, no governments can be prepared to subsidize all risks everybody takes as none is prepared to bear the cost of subsidy. The Central Bank cannot print money without limit to bail-out the system (Rs. 27.3 trillion) which is already 16 times greater than the Central Bank balance sheet (Rs. 1.6 trillion). The government also cannot borrow to bail-out because the system is nearly 3 times greater than the governments already high level of market debt (Rs. 7.3 trillion). Both may be able to pump only few billions of fresh money and interim guarantees to boost the confidence and calm-down panics.
The fact of the matter is that we all live on too much risky credit. Therefore, we all have to manage credit at prudent levels consistent with the current level or potential of the real economy if we are to avoid bursts of credit bubbles and economic catastrophes. In that context, it is our responsibility to understand where we are in the financial system, how much risks are involved, whether the risks are greater than what we would normally like to take and what early warnings are available. Then, we need to stay away from the complacence and control both risk and greed. In respect of the wider financial system, it is the public duty of the Central Bank to do this which will eliminate a lot of excessively risky business operators and make the system safe and sound. This is not a rocket science or a statistical model-based exercise, but a conscious, continuous and consistent act based upon already available real-world lessons and ample best practices.

After four years in development, the Very Good Bra is entirely made from sustainable Eucalyptus trees and natural fibres; its slogan is no wire, no toxins, no waste.
The more Ive learned about materials, the more Ive had to re-calibrate my thinking in terms of what is good. Once you discover that it takes 20,000 litres of water to produce a kilogram of cotton, organic or not, it really gets you thinking, she tells the Mail Online.
When you realise that apparel is the second-largest polluting industry in the world behind oil and gas, and that 40 percent of landfill is clothing, you realise that if things are going to change, you need to do your bit.
The fibre is knitted and organically dyed; tree-rubber and elastic is sourced at sustainably-managed plantations which are then knitted into strap elastic. All metals used are cadmium and nickel free.
Although Stephanie is not openly advocating for zero-waste wardrobes, she is hoping that her bra might inspire people to think a little harder about their buying choices. And, of course, shes hoping that the public thinks more carefully about their overall sustainable behaviour.
The Very Good Bra is supposed to be so eco-friendly that the brand claims its so clean it could even be buried in the garden after use.
Ditch plastic straws, bottles and bags to begin with, she says.
Invest in a keep cup and make it part of your normal coffee routine.
Wherever possible, dont take the packaging when shopping and where there are two comparable options, choose the one that is consciously trying to be clean.

Colombo Regeneration in an artists eye
The Barefoot Gallery will be exhibiting Shaanea Mendis DSilvas new series of work, Regeneration from October 12 to November 4. The oldest contemporary art gallery in Colombo, The Barefoot Gallery has been serving as a platform for artists, musicians, poets, and filmmakers since the early 1990s.
Regeneration is Shaanea Mendis DSilvas second exhibition at the Barefoot Gallery and heralds her return to Sri Lanka after being based out of Mumbai, India. Shaaneas Indian debut earlier this year saw her work exhibited at the Bombay Art Society in collaboration with Janata Seva Sangh, a non-profit trust in Mumbai, India, currently spearheaded by Dr Kavita Pai Vas, established by her father the former Mayor of Mumbai, Dr Prabhakar S. Pai in 1962.
Regeneration is a natural successor to Shaaneas previous series Cellscapes  which was exhibited in Colombo in 2017. While the title refers to the obvious biological evolution of cells and organisms, Shaaneas work also draws parallels to our ever-evolving urban landscape and the way in which it is moving away from nature, or where nature is forcibly evicted and replaced.
Shaanea has collaborated with Colombo-based researcher and activist Iromi Perera for the exhibition to highlight and draw focus to Colombos own regeneration process and what that has meant for the urban dwellers of Colombo. Through her art, she offers commentary on how structures of power, political and personal agendas and the greed for wealth control/dominate the larger picture of what is happening around us, and in our society.
One of the highlights is Shaaneas use of Gold metal leaf, which has the potential to oxidise and corrode over time. Shaanea uses this to represent these political power structures that are in fact corrosive to society. In contrast, she uses fine intricate black and white lines to represent the masses, the underprivileged, the tax paying, hard working folk. These exist side by side and all contribute in making up the current eco-system.
Regeneration will be Shaaneas fifth solo exhibition, following shows in Mumbai at The Bombay Art Society (2018), Colombo at Barefoot (2017), the Lionel Wendt (2015) and Harold Pieris (2012) galleries, as well as having group-exhibited in the past in Singapore and Sri Lanka.
In addition, a permanent exhibition of her work is installed at Kopi Kad, Stratford Avenue, Sri Lanka. Most recently, she has collaborated with Veronel - Art and People, Poland, who represent and promote her work in Poland and the EU.
Shaanea holds a BA (Hons) in Fine Art from The Lasalle College of the Arts, Singapore.
Regeneration previews on October 11 and will run from October 12 to November 1 at the Barefoot Gallery. Barefoot Gallery is open from 10 am - 7 pm Monday to Saturday and 11 am - 6 pm on Sunday.

Crop damage due to rains:
Compensation for big onion farmers
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had instructed Agrarian Insurance Board (AIB) officials to grant compensation for big onion farmers in Dambulla who lost their cultivation due to heavy rains.
The minister also instructed AIB officials to submit a comprehensive report on this within a week. Heavy rains started a few days before harvesting which ruined big onion harvests in Dambulla.
With the new crop insurance scheme implemented under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena, the AIB has decided to pay a compensation of Rs. 100,000 per hectare of big onion cultivated lands.
The new insurance scheme has been introduced for six varieties of crops including paddy, from Maha season 2018, without a premium from farmers.
Under the new crop insurance system introduced by the AIB, farmers can claim up to Rs. 40,000 for one acre or Rs. 100,000 per hectare of paddy, maize, big onion, potato, soya bean and green chili cultivations. The government has allocated funds totaling Rs. 5.228 billion to the respective banks.
The minister encourages farmers to grow the listed crops without fear of crop damage.
He assured that the government will take steps to protect the farmer community when the harvest is not sold or damaged.

Development projects not affected  Mangala
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday assured that public investment on development projects has not been hampered by the recent depreciation of the rupee.
The Kandy-Kurunegala Highway, Beliatta railway line, the Gamperaliya programme and Enterprise Sri Lanka were going ahead successfully, he said addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha.
The Minister explained that Gamperaliya currently had 33,875 programmes in operation in every village around the country with over Rs. 20 billion allocated for it. Its first phase would be complete by November, whilst the second phase would start in January 2019. Enterprise Sri Lanka which aims to create 100,000 entrepreneurs through the provision of interest-free loans had the government provide Rs. 5 billion for interest payments, in the last three months. As of October 1, the Minister said, 26,978 new loans worth Rs. 5.4 billion had been provided to entrepreneurs. A bankrupt government cannot do all this, only a people-friendly government can achieve this, said Minister Samaraweera.
In contrast, he observed that the previous regime had spent millions on roads in Hambantota only to be used by a few vehicles. But on the other hand, we have, in the same district, 15,000 houses with no toilets, over 2,000 lakes which need to be repaired, and 2,400 schools with no toilets. These were not priorities for the Rajapaksas.
He further stressed that statements made by the SLFP Group of 16 and the Joint Opposition with regard to the countrys political situation was adversely affecting investment into the country. When foreigners read what they say, they think that the situation is unstable, making them not want to invest.
Only we know that these people are jokers and should not be taken seriously.
Fake news should be checked thoroughly, you cannot believe everything the Opposition says, he said.

Docu-films, the US style
Brad Allgood is a US documentary filmmaker whose most successful and the award-winning documentary film is Landfill Harmonic.
Landfill Harmonic focuses on a group of youth in Paraguay who recycled waste from a garbage dump making musical instruments and forming their percussion band, Recycled Orchestra of Cateura.
The US Embassy in Sri Lanka hosted Brad Allgood in Sri Lanka from October 2 to 7.
His film was screened at the Jaffna Film Festival and at the Viharamahadevi open-air theatre in Colombo to spread awareness on effective waste management and inspire creative citizens to recycle waste in a similar manner.
On his arrival in Sri Lanka on October 2, Brad Allgood engaged in an exclusive interview with the Daily News T&C.
Q: What were your experiences with Landfill Harmonic
The film is about a youth orchestra having instruments made with recycled waste.
Orchestras are harmonious thus the name. The youth in the orchestra were inspiring with an amazing spirit.
Music is a universal language and I liked the theme.
The primary challenge was finding a structure during the edit. Since the film was shot over the course of more than five years, there was a mountain of footage.
Q: You won the Humanitas Prize for making Landfill Harmonic
This prize is bestowed on persons who make inspiring films to make the world a better place.
The Humanitas Prize celebrates television programs and films that affirm human dignity, explore the meaning of life, enlighten the use of human freedom, and reveal humanity.
The prize came as a surprise.
Q: We understand that you fancy making films with emotionally charged adventure, social issues and music. What is your philosophy in filmmaking
I like adventure and that is one reason I make documentary films. Experiencing different cultures, meeting people, finding new stories is my philosophy.
A documentary filmmaker always has to be emotionally charged. I like to challenge myself basically.
I like to visit extreme environments. There are lots of stories to be told about different places in this world that many people do not dare to go to.
It is also a learning process for me. I learn a lot while making films. I enjoy my work. To inspire an audience you need this emotional engagement.
Q: Were you adventurous from your schooling days
I grew up in a small town in Georgia. I have been a nature boy from my young age. Engagement with nature was my priority. I loved walking in the woods.
Q: You are a Four-time CINE award-winning and academically qualified documentary filmmaker with an MA in film and video production from American University and a BS in Biology and Geology from the University of Georgia.
Tell us how Sri Lanka could have an edge in documentary filmmaking
To reach a larger audience you need to find a story that speaks a universal truth. We can make films based on different cultures and subjects but they should have universal themes.
Stepping outside the boundaries and moving towards different forms is good.
Sri Lanka could position itself in the world map via documentary films. Sri Lanka has a rich history and the major parts of the western world dont know about it. But they could be yearning for that knowledge thus there is an opportunity.
Sri Lankan documentary filmmakers can focus on stories relating to subjects such as culture, languages, landscapes, indigenous people, wildlife, cuisine, music, folk life.
Q: Tell us about your latest venture, Patrol
This feature documentary project is taking place in Nicaragua.
We are working with a small indigenous group in the rainforests in south-east Nicaragua.
This group is fighting to protect the rainforests against illegal parties who move in to deforest. Rama Indians in Nicaragua as they call themselves depend on this rainforest for their survival.
Q: What role does the subject of marketing play as regards documentary filmmaking
Marketing is one of the first things and a key element any filmmaker should think about and it is incredibly important to know your marketing.
What will be your target audience should be given priority. Marketing is vital to reach a pre-determined audience and it should be number one priority.
Who is your audience, the best ways to reach them and making your film for that audience is an integrated process
Most filmmakers do not become marketing oriented at the inception and that is the reason their films do not make an impact when they are shown.
Q: There is immense potential within budding Sri Lankan documentary filmmakers. What is your advice to them as a veteran
Find a subject you are passionate about that has a universal theme. Find a story that is unique, emotional, inspiring.
You should be passionate about your work.
If you are not passionate about the subject matter you are working on, how can you expect an audience to be passionate about your work
Documentary filmmaking is a long process like a marathon which requires a lot of stamina.

E-module to combat human trafficking
The Foreign Affairs Ministry with Australian support launched an e-Module training programme for Sri Lankan officers posted abroad to help combat human trafficking.
In our daily lives, many of us may not realise the gravity and scale of human trafficking, said Prasad Kariyawasam, Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, speaking at the launch of the Ministrys Combatting Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) e-Module. In fact it is a scar on our common sense of humanity, he added.
Around the world, migrant workers searching for jobs are particularly vulnerable to trafficking in persons, or human trafficking. With over 200,000 Sri Lankans moving abroad each year for work, many are vulnerable to fraudulent jobs schemes and abuse.
The Australian government has deep co-operation with Sri Lanka in this space, Australian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson said. Globally, Australia is a very strong supporter of efforts to address human trafficking.
Given the vast, intercontinental nature of human trafficking, Kariyawasam, highlighted the importance of this sort of inter-country collaboration, no country is excepted, even developed countries, trafficking is around the world, he said. Partnerships are vital. Kariyawasam said the module is made for areas where human trafficking is particularly prevalent, but added that trafficked persons do not always to cross borders. According to Kariyawasam, a victim can be forced to move countries, cities, towns, or streets. He defines human trafficking as someone being forcibly moved and exploited, and said it happens domestically in Sri Lanka, too. Created by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the programme will be extended to officers of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, Defence Ministry and Commerce Department who may be points of contact for trafficked persons. Aiming to improve knowledge of officers so they can identify victims and train them to respond to victims sensitively, the e-learning programme is a part of a larger public information campaign, which has also included social media initiatives and TV commercials. The programme will teach officers legal framework; familiarise them with international processes and conventions; and train them to effectively identify and interview potential victims, refer cases for assistance, protection, and ensure victims safe return.
The UN defines Trafficking in Persons as, the recruitment, transport, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.

Englands got more experience, but weve got more mystery  Chandimal
DAMBULLA, Tuesday : The original rationale in building a cricket stadium in the dry zone Dambulla was that it provided Sri Lanka with the potential to host one-day matches throughout the year. But times have changed. Yesterday we saw both Sri Lanka and England cricketers being greeted with unrelenting rain at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium that deprived them of any practice ahead of todays five-match ODI series lung-opener.
The prospect of the game getting off the ground today seems rosy with the forecast for cloudy weather.
Sri Lanka face a daunting task of trying to regain some of their composure as a competitive one-day side  a title which has eroded over time and pushed them to the bottom half rung of the one-day rankings at 8.
First round elimination from the Asia Cup was a bitter pill for the team to swallow and the individual who had to cop the blame for that disastrous showing was the captain Angelo Mathews who not only lost the captaincy but was also ousted from the team with fitness being cited as the core issue.
Mathews no doubt is the key batsmen in the one-day team especially with his experience and in the absence of the richly talented Kusal Mendis and aggressive opener Danushka Gunathilaka (injured) Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to put up a total good enough to challenge the no. 1 ranked ODI side.
This England team led by Eoin Morgan is no ordinary one-day side that can be brushed aside as in the past. Since their first round exit from the 2015 World Cup, they have built up a team (over the past three years) that is capable of performing in all types of conditions including the subcontinent that puts them streets ahead as favourites to win the ODI series.
HAPPY WITH FAVOURITES TAG
Jos Buttler whos developed into a dangerous one day cricketer said that he was very happy of England being tagged favourites for the series.
It shows weve been doing good stuff and I like being favourites. Were very aware of Sri Lankas qualities in these conditions. They have some experienced players whove played well in these conditions.
Its been tricky in the past for England sides to come here.
But we are full of confidence, We look forward to adapting our play and pushing the boundaries, said a confident Buttler.
Having two quality spinners in their side in Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, Buttler said has helped them to tackle spin successfully.
Having those two guys in our team is great practice for us in the nets, said Buttler. Theyve been a big strength of the time and a huge part of the dressing room. Any time you put together a really good squad that means your practice is very good when you train.
Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal whilst paying a compliment to the two England spinners said, Moeen and Rashid bowled really well in the practice game. We have a really good challenge from both of them. At the same time as a batsman if there is a mystery spinner you have to try to innovative shots to put the pressure back on him. England also has a really good challenge. We have some mystery spinners and when the situation comes we have some game plans which we will have to execute. England has got more experience but we have got more mystery.
WERE IN SAME POSITION AS ENGLAND IN 2015
Comparing his team to the one England had for the 2015 World Cup Chandimal said, We all know that England is the no. 1 side in the world at the moment. They are playing really well and theyve got some really good players. At the same time theyve got lots of experience having played so much of international cricket around the world.
When you go back to 2015 and look at their side they have struggled during the World Cup.
The same thing has happened to us at the moment. England managed to change everything after the 2015 World Cup thats what we are looking at. If we can beat the no. 1 side in the world in this series that will be a great turning point going to the World Cup. Thats what we are looking at as a unit to compete with them in the middle. One of the core issues that has affected the Lankan team has been their inability to control the slow over rate that has led to two of their captains Upul Tharanga and Chandimal paying the penalty by being fined and suspended by the ICC in the past.
Chandimal on whos shoulders the responsibility falls during the series against England said, The last 2-3 years we have struggled with the slow over rate.
The main reason is that between overs we have been slow not changing quickly. Weve analysed that especially in the last couple of years where we have gone wrong and explained to the boys why we are getting slow over rates. They all know where we went wrong and I am sure for this tour they will do their best to avoid that.

Expats called to invest  to tide over dollar issue
Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the depreciation of the rupee to the dollar is nothing new since the Rupee value has been depreciating generally by 7% annually even during the Rajapaksa regime.
Addressing the media at the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) headquarters at Battaramulla yesterday, he said the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar is temporary.
It is significant that the value of many world currencies have depreciated, when compared with the dollar rate Minister Ranawaka said.
Ranawaka said that before the so called economic experts of the Joint Opposition, who made a big hue and cry, he predicted in 2015 in his booklet that there would be an economic crisis in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
Due to the world economic crisis, the value of a number of many world currencies, including that of India, Sweden, Pakistan, Australia, the Philippines, Turkey, Indonesia and many countries have depreciated when compared with dollar rate, he said.
During the Rajapaksa Regime, the Rupee value couldnt be protected from depreciation even by pumping US$ 4.2 billion. But some from the JO are now boasting that the Rupee value can be stabilised under their government.
Considering the world economic downturn, it is inevitable to contain the depreciation of world currencies.Ours are not an exception.The increase in US interest rates is the reason for this world economic crisis, he added.
He added that the JHU has suggested several measures to mitigate the rupee depreciation and strengthen the economy. It can be sorted out by implementing long lasting solutions. It is important to reduce trade deficit and the balance of payment, he said.
The JHU suggests it is better to invite Sri Lankan expatriates to invest in the country. This is only an issue of US$ 2 billion.There are around 2 million Sri Lankans abroad and if one person invests US$ 100 each the issue is over, he said.
Besides, the capacity of harbours and airports should be expanded aiming to cater to more services. Exports should be increased to gain more export income.The service sector should be broadened. The volume of exports should be increased while decreasing unnecessary imports. Local production should also be increased while encouraging value added productions the Minister said.
The Minister added that moves should be taken to protect the countrys resources. A huge sum of money is wasted when invoicing at the Customs and a large sum of money is wasted in maintaining SriLankan Airlines.
The Minister said the Rajapaksa regime took short term loans for high interest rates and invested in useless projects, which were not economically viable.
Funds obtained from loans by the Rajapaksa government was invested in the harbour, airport, convention centre and many more, which are not economically profitable. The present government has to pay back those loans now and a huge amount of state revenue has to be utilised for it the Minister said.

## Supertitle:

Exports up 5.7 % to US$ 1.07 bn in July
Earnings from merchandise exports surpassed US dollars 1 billion for the second consecutive month in July 2018.
Accordingly, earnings from exports increased by 5.7 per cent (year-on-year) to US$ 1,073 million. Earnings from industrial exports contributed to increased export earnings while agricultural and mineral exports recorded poor performance during the month. Under industrial exports, earnings from export of petroleum products increased significantly due to higher export prices of bunker and aviation fuel despite reduction in volumes. Export earnings from transport equipment increased considerably during the month owing to the export of a cruise ship to Singapore.
Reflecting the increase recorded in almost all sub categories, earnings from machinery and mechanical appliances increased substantially in July 2018. In addition, earnings from food, beverages and tobacco, gems, diamonds and jewellery, chemical products, base metals and articles and animal fodder increased in July 2018 contributing towards increasing industrial exports. However, export earnings from textiles and garments declined marginally in July 2018 due to the decline in demand from the USA and non-traditional markets such as Canada, UAE and Australia and the base effect which reflected significantly high export earnings in July 2017.
The deficit in the trade account continued to expand in July 2018 in comparison to July 2017 due to higher growth in imports. On a cumulative basis, the deficit in the trade account widened considerably during the first seven months of 2018 in comparison to the corresponding period of 2017.
Expenditure on merchandise imports increased by 10.3 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 1,754 million in July 2018.
The increased expenditure in all major import categories, on a year-on-year basis, as well as the effect of the low base in 2017, contributed to this growth. Under intermediate goods, expenditure on fuel imports increased significantly during the month owing to higher import prices of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Expenditure on textiles and textile articles imports increased in July 2018 due to higher expenses on yarn and fabric imports. Meanwhile, import expenditure on base metals increased during the month led by the high expenditure incurred on iron and steel imports. Tourist arrivals increased moderately by 6 per cent with 217,829 tourist arrivals in July 2018 despite July being the traditional off season period for tourists during the year. Total tourist arrivals during the first seven months of 2018 were 1,382,476 with a growth of 13.7 per cent in comparison to the corresponding period of 2017.
Earnings from tourism in July 2018 are estimated at US dollars 404 million, with cumulative earnings amounting to US dollars 2,564 million during the first seven months of 2018. Growth in tourist arrivals from India, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia and the United States contributed to the higher number of tourists during the period.
Meanwhile, workers remittances recorded a moderate decline of 1.6 per cent, year on year, to US dollars 619 million in July 2018. Consequently, on a cumulative basis, up to July 2018 workers remittances grew by 0.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 4,243 million. Foreign investments in the CSE, including both primary and secondary market foreign exchange flows, recorded a net outflow of US dollars 3 million during July 2018. Consequently, cumulative net inflows to the CSE in the first seven months of 2018 amounted to US dollars 50 million, with a net outflow of US dollars 16 million from the secondary market and an inflow of US dollars 66 million to the primary market during the period.
Recent developments in the global financial markets, particularly the strengthening of the US economy which prompted an increase in policy rates of the Federal Reserve Bank resulted in outflows of foreign investments from capital markets in emerging economies. This impact was also felt in Sri Lanka, leading to continuous foreign investment outflows from the government securities market particularly in the third quarter of 2018. Consequently, foreign investments in the government securities market recorded a net outflow of US dollars 53 million in July 2018, resulting in a cumulative net outflow of US dollars 229 million during the first seven months of 2018.
At end July 2018, gross official reserves were estimated at US dollars 8.4 billion, equivalent to 4.5 months of imports. Consequently, total foreign assets, which consist of gross official reserves and foreign assets of the banking sector, were estimated at US dollars 10.8 billion as at end July 2018, which was equivalent to 5.8 months of imports.
The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 10.2 per cent against the US dollar in the year up to 08 October 2018. Furthermore, reflecting cross currency movements, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated against other major currencies except for the Indian rupee during this period. The weakening of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar mostly reflects a broad based strengthening of the US dollar globally.

Fitch affirms CEB  at AAA(lka);  Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
CEBs rating is equalised with that of the Sri Lankan sovereign (B+/Stable), reflecting strong linkages with the parent, in line with Fitchs Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria.
The equalisation takes into consideration CEBs strategic importance to Sri Lanka in ensuring power security and supply of affordable electricity to the public as the monopoly electricity transmitter and distributor in the country. CEB also accounts for around 70% of the power generation in the country.
Fitch assesses the linkages between CEB and the state as strong, reflecting high ownership and management control, explicit guarantees and financial support through equity infusions and debt funding.
The government also implicitly guarantees CEBs project loans (about 80% of outstanding debt), which are extended by bilateral and multilateral agencies and routed through the government for development of power infrastructure. CEB provides electricity at subsidised rates, fulfilling an essential service for the government. CEB has almost full network connectivity and accounted for more than 70% of Sri Lankas generation capacity at end-2017.
We do not expect CEBs linkages with its parent to weaken in the medium term as the governments need to provide electricity at subsidised rates can be carried out only by a state entity such as CEB, as private companies would not be willing to incur losses. Fitch views CEBs standalone credit profile as much weaker than its support-driven rating and believes providing a notch-specific standalone credit view of CEB is meaningless due to poor margin visibility and the need for continued state support to sustain operations.

## Title: Happiness within reach

## Date: Wednesday, October 10, 2018 - 01:00
Happiness within reach
We do everything in life to reach that elusive goal  HAPPINESS. Wealth, fame, beauty, social position or passing examinations will bring you only a temporary form of happiness. Most wealthy people are unhappy in their lives. Fame is just a bubble. If you do something wrong, your fame will vanish. Beauty is only skin deep. Age will rob you of your beauty. Social positions will only bring you a limited kind of happiness. After passing an examination you will be happy for a short period. Then how to retain happiness throughout life
We are born with certain skills. Identifying them is a difficult task. Some of us consult astrologers in order to find out our lifes calling. Those who take part in reality shows will teach you a lesson or two. Very often we see young men and women who aspire to be superstars. But when they come on stage, they cannot sing or perform. Those who have no aptitude for singing or dancing try to be singers and dancers. Those who cannot write even a meaningful paragraph try to be journalists and authors. All these things happen when you fail to identify your real talents. A deputy principal of a well-known school sat the final examination in laws leading to the LLB degree on nine occasions. Although he got through the examination and started practising as a lawyer, some of his students were leading lawyers and judges!
If you can identify your real talents early in life, you will achieve your goal in the long run. Try to use your special skills and aptitudes as early as possible. We are made up of different characteristics both physical and mental. If your friends are attending law classes, do not follow them unless you have an aptitude for law. Even identical twins differ from each other. Therefore trust your gut feelings.
Greatness
Some people are born great. Some achieve greatness. Greatness is thrust upon the others. Greatness comes to those who have faith in themselves regardless of the fact that their opinions and ideas might be unpopular. Copernicus and Galileo were ridiculed for their theories that the earth and other planets moved around the sun. Martin Luther was persecuted because his religious opinions differed from those of the established church. Louis Pasteur faced bitter opposition before his views on protection against bacteria were accepted by the scientific community. World famous Beethovens harmonies were declared to be outrageous at the beginning.
Newton and Albert Einstein evolved scientific theories which were not understood by his contemporaries. What is more, Jesus Christ was persecuted and crucified because he challenged the established order.
One of the first lessons in philosophy is: Know thyself! We come to know ourselves through introspection. In other words, we should examine the motives of our actions and beliefs. The celebrated British philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote: Why I am not a Christian out of conviction. The established church hounded him, but he did not change his views. We should be frank enough to criticize ourselves. Self-criticism is the prime condition of self-knowledge.
To know yourself better, ask yourself: What is my real ambition If you have no ambition, you will never succeed in life. But your ambition can change when you grow up. A child may want to be a doctor when he grows up. However, when he becomes a young adult, he may want to be an engineer. Sometimes even after achieving your ambition, you might deviate from it. A young doctor who practised for a short time is a software engineer today.
Know yourself
If you wish to know yourself, you should have a firm stand as regards religion, art, politics, and music. Everybody needs to be familiar with such fields of study. Select your field of activity and stick to it early in life. If you are satisfied with your selection, you are on the correct path to happiness.
The other secret of happiness is to be yourself. If you have decided to follow a certain course of studies, stick to it. You should not waste time trying to experiment with many different fields of activity. Our life is relatively short and we have no time to learn everything under the sun. This is the Age of Specialists. Although there are some drawbacks of being a specialist, it is good to know one subject well. When the war-time British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was asked whether he knew French, he said he never studied it but he knew his English well!
Unhappiness creeps into your life when you start comparing yourself with others. Our paths to success in life are varied. Having assessed your capabilities, do your best in whatever you do. Many people who try to do certain activities without the necessary skills end up with a nervous breakdown.
Polonius advised his son, To thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night and day, thou canst not then be false to any man. These words contain the best advice for anyone who wishes to be happy throughout their lives.

Tissa Attanayake case:
HC re-issues summons on President and PM to testify
The Colombo High Court yesterday re-issued summons on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to appear before the Colombo High Court on January 22 to testify in the case filed against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then common candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday informed through their counsel explaining the difficulties in attending court since they were on official visits to the Seychelles and the UK respectively.
Meanwhile, defence counsel appearing for Tissa Attanayake moved court that the trial against his client be fixed for another date since his senior counsel Kalinga Indatissa, PC, was appearing for another case in the Kurunegala High Court.
Thereby, the case against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then common candidate Maithripala Sirisena was fixed for trial on January 22 by Colombo High Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appearing for the Attorney General complained that Tissa Attanayake made comments regarding case delays during a radio programme aired last Sunday.
He questioned as to how an accused in a case makes comments regarding case delays while making application to postpone trial on the following day.
DSG Peiris further said the witness number six, a journalist at a private television station, is to testify on the next trial date.
UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake had been arrested and held in remand custody for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities. He is currently on bail.
The accused had been charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007. This is the first time in Sri Lanka that an accused has been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake had publicly announced on December 22, 2014, that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Attorney General alleged Tissa Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility or violence.
The AG further alleged that Tissa Attanayake had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate.
The AG has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim as witnesses in the case.
Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Chaminda Athukorala with counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for Tissa Attanayake.
Counsel Yasas de Silva with Navin Shanaka appeared for the Prime Minister and UNP General Secretary.

JO's doomed project
The whole country, or, at least the politically alive segments of the community are today all agog about speculation on the formation of a Caretaker/Interim Government to replace Yahapalanaya (Good Governance Government). This followed reports in certain weekend newspapers of a purported meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at a dinner hosted by SLFP rebel MP S. B. Dissanayake at his Battaramulla residence. The National List MP has since denied such a meeting took place at his residence, in a media release issued yesterday, and so did Rajapaksa himself.
However, the cat has been set among the pigeons and the UNP has taken up the gauntlet with its firebrand backbenchers daring the Joint Opposition (JO) to go ahead. What is more, these vociferous UNPers have expressed their readiness to form a Government of the Greens with the support of some SLFP ministers.
UNP backbencher Thushara Indunil, at a media briefing at Sirikotha on Monday said they were not in the least daunted by talks of forming a Caretaker Government since the party has 106 Members in Parliament and is assured of the support of at least six more SLFPers to secure a majority. He also challenged the JO to defeat the Government at the upcoming Budget if it is keen to topple the Government. The JO members were to meet yesterday at the residence of Pohottuwa Chairman Prof. G. L. Peiris, ostensibly to map out strategy in their quest for a Caretaker Government.
The formation of a Caretaker Government, with Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, is apparently the brainchild of S. B. Dissanayake. It is this self same Dissanayake was took upon the task of assembling the numbers to oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in April this year. After the whole project came a cropper S. B. declared that since the Premier has the confidence of Parliament he should be allowed to continue in office for the rest of his term.
Now apparently he still wants the Prime Minister out before the completion of his term, contrary to his earlier stand. And this is an individual who lost his electorate at the last General Election and crept into Parliament from the backdoor, read the National List, thanks to the munificence of the President. Ditto for Dilan Perera who the other day forecast that Ranil Wickremesinghe will be history come April (Sinhala New Year) next year and the country will have a new Prime Minister in the form and shape of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Both these personages have lost sight of the fact that Caretaker or Interim Governments cannot be formed without the dissolution of Parliament and no dissolution could take place until the present Parliament completes four years. Besides, the present Prime Minister cannot be changed according to the whims and fancies of the likes of S. B. Dissanayake and Dilan Perera. The only way for such an eventuality is when the Premier either resigns on his own accord, gets defeated in a No Confidence Motion, or the National Budget gets voted down.
Besides, the removal of the Prime Minister is a complex and convoluted process under the 19th Amendment, as the Joint Opposition was to learn when there was an outcry to oust Wickremesinghe following the February local polls.
On the other hand, the President has already put paid to the expectations of those clamouring for a General Election by stating in no uncertain terms that the Yahapalanaya Government would run its course. Hence, it could be safely assumed that the President wants the present composition of Parliament to remain intact. Whatever ills the country may be going through at present will not change overnight with the appointment of a Caretaker Government with Mahinda Rajapaksa et al.
Besides, the serious accusations made against the Rajapaksa family, the court cases pending against the former first family and their associates, the claim made by President Sirisena that he would have been six feet under terra firma had he lost the election, certainly would not be lost on the President. The formation of a caretaker Government with Rajapaksa as Prime Minister would also mean a discontinuation of all the ongoing court cases and an admission that all allegations could be false which would not be a prospect the President would entertain.
Be that as it may, all speculation of an impending regime change is not going to be the ideal recipe for a country that has to contend with a tumbling rupee and the attendant consequences to the economy. Besides, the entire administration and the state machinery is bound to collapse under a state of suspense where public servants will play the waiting game, not willing to stick their necks out for fear of repercussions in the event of a regime change or Caretaker Government. This is a fear they are bound to entertain whether or not they have any validity. We witnessed this state of affairs following the LG Polls. Hence it will be prudent if the President goes public and clears the air in this regard.

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake urged all political parties not to block the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A) in Parliament and let it be referred to the people at a referendum.
The MP, taking the floor after the announcement of the Supreme Court (SC) determination on the 20A, said that his party is confident that the 20A would muster the peoples support at a referendum.
We welcome the SC decision that the 20A must be approved by the people at a referendum. Prior to going before the people, the Amendment needs the two thirds majority of Parliament. I request from all of you not to block the Amendment in Parliament. Let the people decide on it at a referendum, he urged.
There are groups led by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in this Parliament. All of them had asked for the peoples mandate to abolish the Executive Presidency. They can lead their groups to support this Bill, he noted.
He pointed out that neither the 1978 Constitution nor any of its 19 Amendments were approved by the people at a referendum and therefore the existing Constitution was not in any way in conformity with the peoples expectations.

Lankan arrested in Korea over oil storage tank fire
The Korean police have arrested a Sri Lankan national in its probe of a recent explosion at an oil storage facility, Korean police officials said Monday.
The arrest came one day after an explosion at the oil storage facility in Goyang, north of Seoul, which consumed a large storage tank with 2.66 million liters of gasoline, enough to fill 250 tank trucks.
The police said the 27-year-old Sri Lankan is believed to have accidentally caused the fire by releasing a sky lantern in the vicinity of the oil storage facility.
The police believe the sky lantern may have started the fire when it fell on the lawn of the oil storage facility, causing flames that later spread into the ventilation system of the oil tank, leading to the explosion.
The 27-year-old is said to be a construction worker at a site near the facility.

Currency depreciation management:
Lankan Govt. the most successful in Asia -FM
The Sri Lankan government has been the most successful in Asia when it comes to managing the current currency depreciation crisis affecting countries in the region, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sirikotha UNP party headquarters, the Minister explained that the Central Bank had successfully limited spending of foreign reserves to USD 250 million in order to manage the depreciation of the rupee to the dollar.
In comparison, in 2012 when the rupee had depreciated by 14 percent in three months, the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime had spent USD 4 billion to stabilize the rupee against the dollar, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Sri Lankan Rupee which stood at Rs 170.60 to the dollar on Monday (8) dropped to Rs 172.34 to the dollar yesterday.
Explaining the reasons for the current rupee depreciation, Minister Samaraweera stressed there was no correlation between the falling rupee and the state of the economy.
It is only the Joint Opposition which is using the rupee to spread rumours that the economy is failing.That is false. I would like to say that our economy is stable and it will not collapse under our watch, the Minister said.
The weak rupee, he further said ,would not affect the lives of the average people who do not depend on imported goods for their daily needs, People who eat rice, some vegetables and fish from their village wont be affected by this. The increasing fuel prices, I admit may have an impact, he added.
This proves that our vision for an export oriented economy is right. If we take that path, we will not be affected by currency fluctuations, Minister Samaraweera said.
The governments decision to reduce taxes on the import of small vehicles however had also exacerbated the issue. In the last 10 months of this year alone 1.4 million LC (letters of credit) accounts had been opened to import vehicles, but the Ministers recent ban on vehicle import permits and the restructuring of the tax on small vehicles, he assured would arrest the fall further,
We can no longer afford car permits and I think we have come to a point where we can put a stop to it. Even new MPs will not be given any car permits, he stressed.
When asked about whether the decision to provide government servants a salary increase of Rs.10,000 was wise at a time when the government had just taken over a failing economy, the minister said; I dont think it was wrong as public servants had not been given an increase for 10 years, but if I was the Finance Minister at the time, I wouldnt have given such subsidies. In hindsight we gave too many subsidies, the Minister added.

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday challenged the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to manage their garbage collection in the Colombo Municipal area from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC).
Let the CMC undertake its garbage management if it is strong enough to do so, the Minister said.
The Minister was responding to the allegations levelled against the SLLRDC by Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake that the SLLRDC is extorting payment for garbage management.
Minister Ranawaka said that the Ministry would not hesitate to immediately hand over the responsibility of garbage management to any Local Government authority.
Not only the CMC, but also any other Local Government authority including the Kaduwela Town Council can undertake the responsibility of managing their own garbage. We would never hesitate to hand over the responsibility to those authorities, he said.
At the time Colombo was affected by mountains of garbage, our Ministry came forward and took the responsibility of garbage management. Because of our intervention, Colombo is free from dengue and garbage now. We should be praised for it, the Minister said.
However, if the Colombo Mayor and the CMC has any mechanism to manage the garbage collected from the Colombo Municipality, the Ministry is ready to hand over that responsibility even from today, the Minister said.

Trying to bring in a new Medical Ordinance to replace the current one which has a 90 year history, challenging technical decisions made by the SLMC, presenting a pro-SAITM stand to the judiciary going against the SLMC, letting down the SLMC by obtaining private legal services, influencing in every possible way to make the SLMC weak and idle are some of the actions taken by the Health Minister to destroy the SLMC, he added.
He said the SLMC had a 90-year history and was established by the Medical Council Ordinance No 24 of 1924. This is only a part of the anti-establishment campaign in implementation which is aimed at destroying all official and state procedures and establishments.Destroying the free health service,establishments and procedures is part of it, he said.

Admit it, if you saw a person who looked exactly like you, youd at least walk up to them to say hi. So when Bethany Coleman took her dog, Rogue, for a walk and they noticed a pup that looked identical to the one she had on a leash, naturally, they introduced themselves.
Rogue and I were out for a nice long walk to our local farmers market when we saw Beast, Coleman told Bored Panda. He was there with Last Hope K9 Rescue and a bunch of other dogs that were all up for adoption. What made me want to rescue Beast over the other dogs was that he looked just like Rogue. Theyre both cairn terrier mixes, Rogues mom was a lab/pit mix and her dad a cairn and with Beast were just not sure, it just has cairn mix I. His paperwork but we think hes mixed with Basset due to his body type, he looks like a pig and has even been mistaken for a pig a couple times.
At the time, Bethany wasnt really thinking about getting another pet.
Tyson, my boyfriend aka the dad, really wanted another dog but I was so against the idea. We already had two senior cats that I brought into the relationship and our puppy Rogue. I was not about to add one more animal to the mix, who in the right mind would ever let us rent an apartment from them.
But she couldnt help it.
I just instantly fell in love with him! she added. He was Rogues twin! They also got along and immediately started playing with one another. So right then and there I started filling out the paperwork. I even have the first picture ever of him when he was at the market. After they took Beast home, the big boy started to assert dominance but was instantly put in his place by the tiny pup. It took about a month for everyone, including the cats, to find their groove, Bethany said. To be fair we got them the same exact toys thinking that would solve everything. Nope! Rogue always and actually to this day wants whatever Beast has. Its funny to watch when we give them treats. Halfway through whatever it is theyll switch and go for each others toy. But at heart, theyre best friends!
Now living in Hawaii, the family couldnt be happier. Playing in the sand and waves, Beast is the perfect beach dog. Rogue loves annoying the crabs but if she will runs into the ocean, she swims and swims.
Were gonna also get her a life jacket but teach her how to surf on a boogie board.

Murunga leaves garland sparks free for all in SPC
In what could be termed as a shameful piece of conduct in the presence of schoolchildren and the public, Southern Provincial Councillors threw punches, hurled abuse and threats at each other as complete chaos erupted in the council assembly yesterday morning.
Members of the Southern Provincial Councillors who gathered for the monthly meeting held yesterday went berserk in this manner in the presence of schoolchildren and members of the public who were in the gallery.
The school children and members of the public made a hurried exit unable to bear the chaotic and rowdy behaviour of their elected representatives.
As the Council members were arriving for the scheduled monthly meeting, UPFA Councillor and Joint Opposition loyalist Channa Saliya Mendis entered the Chamber with a bundle of Murunga leaves which provoked a group of United National Party members as a result of which a brawl between them erupted. Finally, councillor Mendis was prevented from entering the Chamber with the Murunga leaves.
However, as the Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda commenced the proceedings of the meeting, Leader of the House Chamly Withanachchi alleged that the UNP councillors assaulted the UPFA member at the entrance to the Chamber and demanded an investigation into the alleged incident.
Later, a frenzied argument over the issue continued among the councillors of both sides. Consequently, some United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) members who were Joint Opposition loyalists came to the Well of the Chamber and shouted and behaved offensively in protest against the alleged assault. Subsequently the UNP councillors who could not endure the disruptive conduct of the UPFA group also rushed into the Well resulting in a free for all. The fisticuffs continued for some time disrupting the proceedings of the House. UNP Councillor Chandana Priyantha is a raised voice rejecting the allegations of assault challenged the other side to come out of the Chamber if they wanted a real fight.
At this stage the school children and members of the public who condemned the disorderly conduct of their elected representatives left the Council Chamber expressing their disgust .
The Chairman failing to control the House suspended proceedings for 15 minutes.
