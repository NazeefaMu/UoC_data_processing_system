No  Kunu  A massive citizens campaign  to clean Beira Lake
No Kunu a massive citizens campaign is set to be launched to clean up Colombos Beira Lake located at the centre of the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.
There have been numerous complaints over the years that the Beira Lake  built by the Portuguese during the 16th Century is at the centre of Colombos environmental and health problems. Calls for a comprehensive initiative by the state to clean up the lake and its surrounding areas fell on deaf ears for several years.
It is in this context that the No Kunu campaign has been launched by Sumi Moonesinghe, a prominent business leader, with the support of various private business establishments situated along the canal banks and surrounding the Beira Lake; and the relevant government authorities namely the Presidential Secretariat, Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), Urban Development Authority (UDA), Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLRDC), the Sri Lanka Navy, Ports Authority and the Police.
The first clean-up programme under the No Kunu initiative will take place on Saturday, July 21 in Colombo.
Under this programme, volunteers will clean the designated parts of the canal banks in their vicinity, with the support of designated CMC officials, NO KUNU team members, Navy and Environment Police officers. In addition to that, the water surface of the canals and the lake will be cleaned by the Navy and the SLDRC while CMC and Abans workers will support these teams.
The wind dried waste would be sent to the Kerawalapitiya garbage collection point with the guidance of the Urban Development Authority (UDA). Plans are afoot for dredging and deeper cleaning of the Beira Lake and canals, after the superficial cleaning of the Beira lake on Saturday (21).
Commenting on the initiative, Moonesinghe said the cleaning would not sustainable until the country a lasting solution to the problem of illegal dumping of sewage in the canals.
This can only be done by the active involvement of relevant government authorities and citizens, she explained, adding that No Kunu campaign will turn out to be a rallying point for concerned citizens, intellectuals and businesses to work towards a better future for Sri Lankas commercial capital.

2,474 solves in 24 hours
An Indian Rubiks cube master broke a Guinness World Record by solving 2,474 of the puzzles in 24 hours while using only one hand.
Krishna Sai, 20, of Chennai, said he has submitted documentation to Guinness World Records showing how he solved the 2,474 Rubiks cubes one-handed in 24 hours, beating the record of 2,174 cubes set by fellow India resident Krishnam Raju Gadiraju in 2014.
Sai said he started solving Rubiks cubes under a friends instructions as a child and he became interested in solving the puzzles competitively in 2014. He said he watched YouTube tutorials to get his average solving time to about 10 seconds. In competitions I was averaging at 15 seconds and once when I was solving at home, I hit a 10 second average - that has been my best record yet. When I knew this, I was positive that I could break it, Sai told The News Minute of the one-handed record.
He said he worked to give himself a comfortable lead in the first few hours of his attempt.
On the day of the challenge, I only took 2-5 minute breaks for the first few hours. I ended up solving 600 odd cubes in 4 and a half hours, he said.
Sai said the documentation he submitted to Guinness includes a video of the entire 24-hour event. UPI

If prisoner has to be supplied with outside food, the visitor will have to deposit money with the relevant prison office and then they will take steps to deliver food to required inmates.
The Department had also separated the convicted drug traffickers from other inmates to stop their supplies and connections with other prisoners. He added that the Department expects to commence an awareness programme to educate convicted drug traffickers about the harm of narcotics and discourage them from drug-trafficking.

Beat that beat!
Sri Lankas dance narrates an extraordinary tale. Its timeless allure continues to inspire us. It does not just show us the move. It celebrates the move of the countrys aesthetic wheel.
Long before the Indian edition of this perpetual art called dance reached the shores, this land housed its own traditions. Kandyan and Low-Country dance traditions have been spoken of in the same breath. Though not spoken of in the same weight, the Sabaragamuwa dance tradition has also completed some chapter in Sri Lankan aesthetic history.
The Sabaragamuwa tradition has received the step-motherly treatment though. It remains largely undocumented to this date. Interested in studying this less-spoken tradition No direct flight is available, unfortunately. Unless you pick Saman Kumaratungas latest research work.
Apart from being a practical dancer, Kumaratunga is Head of Sabaragamuwa Dance Studies Department of University of Visual and Performance Arts. Years of his experience and experiment with the subject is now available in the form of two books: one dealing with the history of the tradition, while the other dealing with the instrumental instrument of the tradition, davula.
The three major dance traditions of Sri Lanka, upcountry, low country and Sabaragamuwa are significant because of their unique features. The Sabaragamuwa tradition originates from jith thong nan. The uniqueness of the Sabaragamuwa tradition depends on the physical features, drum tunes, davul tunes, melodies and theatre costumes, Kumaratunga assesses.
Davula is an instrument unique to the Sabaragamuwa dance tradition. The instrument has its own share of contributions at ceremonial occasions such as Shanthikarma (rituals performed for healing purposes), dance and temple processions.
The Sabaragamuwa dance tradition is stretched across Ratnapura and adjunct areas such as Ruwanwella, Deraniyagala and Yatiyantota. Much akin to its counterparts, the Sabaragmuwa tradition is named after the place of its origin  the Sabaragamuwa province.
Saman Kumaratunga
You cannot find any specific or specialised group interested in the Sabaragamuwa tradition, unlike the other traditions. That is why this tradition is not quite popular, Kumaratunga notes.
But thats not the only reason. The intricate rhythmic structure of the tradition has made itself the unsightly lass. A vast swathe of students seems to be satisfied with the five mainstream melodies of the tradition though there is more to it than they could imagine. The subject is much larger than you think. So to say, it needs a deeper crackdown. This call for a deep study does not hold much water in the popular territory. If your knowledge on the subject is half-baked, then the need to delve deeper into the subject recedes.
The genesis of the Sri Lankan dance rests in the healing rituals. However, the Sabaragamuwa tradition goes beyond the mere rituals, Kumaratunga anatomises. The tradition had also been practised in the presence of the royalty. However, a profound research is yet to take place on the real genesis of the tradition. If someone does not take up that responsibility, the tradition will soon die away, Kumaratunga warns. That is exactly why the Sabaragamuwa dance has become his sole preoccupation.
That fear led me to compile these two books. I opened the pathway. Anyone can delve into deeper studies.
Although choreography is a marked presence in many functions, Kumaratunga points out that the traditions are not properly upheld.
The traditional artistes preserved it. But that preservation does not seem to take place in todays context. Therefore the University of Visual and Performance Arts has initiated that project of preserving the traditional dances. Yet most traditional dancers have shied away from the art, Kumaratunga laments.
Although the healing ritual of the good old times is not prevalent today in abundance, various other methods of practice used for exorcist-related activities could still be seen in certain domestic environments. Yet whether these rituals are conducted in the proper way remains a question.
Any expert drummer of an offering ritual artiste should be able to recite the verses for 60 hours in one go. There are no repetitions in the ritual literature. You are required to memorise the verses of every kind. But most of the younger generation is lazy to memorise them, Kumaratunga explains.
Laziness is not the only aspect. The supply of the rituals has no social demand. That said, no stimulation or catalyst is available for the modern generation to take up the ritual studies seriously. On the contrary, the dancer of the yesteryear was versed not only in singing, instrumental music and dance, but he was also a master of medicine, carpentry, architecture and engravings.
The ancient dancers have used various medicinal techniques. A ritual is beyond a mental relief. But what is required of the modern dancers is to have a traditional procession or some choreographic event for a special function. Even if it is a special occasion, they pay special attention to the upcountry dance.
If Sabaragamuwa dance tradition prevails that is mostly because it is a subject taught at the university. There is a considerable growth in the Sabaragamu tradition since 1980. But the knowledge does not disseminate properly, Kumaratunga said.
Knowledge falters when interest dies down. But when someone comes forward to re-ignite a dying interest, exclusivity barges in and finds its own way to a novel uniqueness. May Kumaratungas work offer chapter and verse to that phenomenon!

Black Panther is a cruel experiment
Sean Diddy Combs called Black Panther a cruel experiment.
The Marvel movie, starring Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan, and directed by Ryan Coogler, was praised for having a predominantly black cast, and has grossed more than $1.3 billion (984 million) at the box office worldwide.
However, the rapper and music producer is skeptical about what the critically-acclaimed film did for the future of diversity in Hollywood.
Black Panther was a cruel experiment, the 48-year-old told Variety. We live in 2018, and its the first time that the film industry gave us a fair playing field on a worldwide blockbuster, and the hundreds of millions it takes to make it.
Diddy went on to complain about the financial discrepancies that result from powerful companies across the world turning black culture into successful products.
We only get 5 per cent of the venture capital invested in things that are black-owned  black-owned businesses, black-owned ideas, black-owned IP, he said. You cant do anything without that money, without resources. But when we do get the resources, we over-deliver.
When Adidas invests in Kanye and its done properly, you have the right results. When Live Nation invests in artists and puts them in arenas the same way U2 would be, you have the right results. Black Panther, Black-ish, fashion; its all about access. If youre blocked out of the resources, you cant compete. And thats my whole thing  to be able to come and compete, he explained.
The music producer, who founded label Bad Boy Entertainment back in 1993, also blasted the music industry for its lack of diversity, and told Variety that theres no black CEO of a major record company.
He continued: For all the billions of dollars that these black executives have been able to make them, (theres still hesitation) to put them in the top-level positions. It makes sense to give (executives of colour) a chance and embrace the evolution, instead of it being that we can only make it to president, senior VP.

Veere Di Wedding
The bold and  the beautiful
Four friends get together to see one of their besties make it down to the aisle. On the days which lead to the nuptials they encounter many dramas, catfights and change of heart. This is familiar territory in a few Hollywood films like 2011s Bridesmaids and Mean Girls.
Shashanka Ghosh has taken a less trodden track in filmmaking with an out of the box concept in Bollywood standards. Though it cannot be titled as a chick flick Veere Di Wedding sees Kalindi struggling to come to terms with marrying her beau Rishabh. She banks on her all time best friends to help her overcome her nerves in making it down the aisle and in facing other challenges which comes with marriage. Meantime Avni cannot seem to find her soul mate though she and her mother try desperately to find her perfect match. Sakshi is a little too fiery. Though she has gotten married in a rush she is now on the brink of divorce. Though she appears to be cool and untamable on the inside she has an Achilles heel. Meera has her hands full with her family. Married to a foreigner she has her wife and mothers act down to a pat. But is she really happy with the choices she has made in life Only time will tell.
The four buddies find answers to their problems on this soul searching journey filled with laughter and tears. The bond the girls who lovingly refer to each other as brothers is the best thing about this movie. They manage to match each other with wit and charm. Even the chubby and matronly type Meera does not fail to keep the audience captivated.
This is a picture of the modern women  unbashful, unedited and free. They are not afraid to try out new things, trend into male territory and swear in public.
However we do get a glimpse of the stereotype in little glimpses like in instances that Avni worries about her marriage and how Kalindi is forced to undergo various rituals to please her elders. On the downside the filmmaker could have paid more attention to bringing out the characteristics of the individuals so that the audience can relate to them.
Though we laugh and see the problems from their point of view we cannot but help feeling detached from them.
A little more detailing could have made a huge difference to the project. It has the punch but lacks heart. Though the girls are glamorously dressed, the music is foot tapping, the jokes are rib tickling and the background scenes are easy on the eyes, Veere Di Wedding lacks the zest to make it a memorable production and a story which will take the legacy of the modern women forward.

Chinas second  quarter growth meets  expectations at 6.7%
Chinas economy grew at an annual pace of 6.7% in the three months to June, official data showed, meeting forecasts for the period. That marked a slight slowdown from a 6.8% expansion recorded in the previous quarter. The data comes as the government attempts to curb growing debt and as trade tensions with the US escalate.
The US raised the stakes in a trade war last week, listing another $200bn worth of Chinese goods to be hit by tariffs.
Chinese stock markets, which have struggled recently amid the escalating trade dispute between the US and China, traded down slightly on Monday.
GDP growth eased on softer global trade and the tightening of financial policy since early 2018, Oxford Economics said in a research note. It expects slow credit growth and softer real estate activity - along with the intensifying trade conflict with the US - to weigh on Chinas growth in the second half of 2018.
The US slapped tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods on 6 July, opening the way for a tit-for-tat trade war with the worlds second-largest economy.
China retaliated, saying the US had launched the largest trade war in economic history.
However, Tom Rafferty from the Economist Intelligence Unit said there were also worries about the strength of Chinas domestic economy. BBC News

Chinese canned fish manufactures invited to SL
Ministry of Industry and Commerce is inviting top Chinese canned fish manufactures to set up factories in Sri Lanka.
We invite a canned fish supplier delegation from China to Sri Lanka for discussions, said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the Second Secretary of Chinese Embassy in Colombo Ran Xiong.
Canned fish is a heavy use item by local consumers and an essential item in the management of day to day cost of living. 60 Lankan companies annually import 40 million Kilos (Kgs) of canned fish for the local market.
Since May 2018 no canned fish consignments from China have been received by Sri Lanka. It has been widely reported in media that worms were detected by Lankan authorities in some imported canned fish tins to Sri Lanka and consignments were held back at customs -and some even ordered to be re-exported.
As a result, since February Lankan authorities have been detecting unfit canned fish destined for local markets landing in local ports. Both SLSI and the Ministry of Food Control Department under Heath Ministry decided that 31 canned fish consignments imported from Chinese suppliers were unfit to be released to local markets due to the presence of more than 3 parasites in them.
Sri Lanka has been importing fish from China for the past 8 years. According to the Department of Commerce under Minister Bathiudeen, Sri Lankas US $2 million canned fish imports (2013) from China steadily increased over the recent yearsto $ 4.85 in 2014, US $ 9.65 in 2015 and in 2016, surged by eight-fold to a massive US$ 16.85 million.

CMCs priorities gone topsy-turvy!
Yesterday, when I visited my daughter who is residing at Armour Street Flats, I noticed that the CMC has fixed a completely new assessment number. The new number 40/228 printed in black on a goldish colour metal plate cut to an elliptical shape has been affixed to the wall. This has been fixed when the present number B1 F26 is already there. Now, all the houses have two Assessment Numbers on the wall which is not only odd but also can create confusion.
The Municipality, when it should focus more on the disposal of garbage as for the slightest shower of rain, the drains overflow and the roads get inundated in and around these flats. I have noticed a lot of garbage in the drains which the Municipality do not care about.
My daughter wanted to know whether we are to insert the new number when taking ID cards for the first time, when taking new IDs, birth-certificate for the newborn child, etc What is the number we are supposed to use in the future
The utility bills will carry the former address and any mail received will have only the former address. Are we to inform the service providers about a change in the number Are we supposed to keep both the addresses on our wall
I think the CMC has wasted invaluable funds by printing these numbers, for the condominium buildings in particular, which could have been put to better use. Over to the Mayoress to spend the CMC funds prudentially.

And the comeback album, her first since Only Human back in 2014, is almost ready to be released.
Nicola and I wrote every track together. Its been great working with one of my best friends, but Im really proud of the album and excited for people to hear the new music, Cheryl told British newspaper The Sun.
Its pretty much finished. At this stage were deciding what will be the first single. Were choosing between about three songs, but thats quite a nice problem to have.
Thankfully Im not looking at it, saying, Oh God, all this work and we dont have a hit record. I think we do, she gushed. I cant wait to get it out there for people to hear. We dont have a date yet but Ill tell you more soon.
Cheryl sweetly revealed that her 15-month-old son Bear, who she shares with the One Direction singer, has already heard tracks from the new album, and immediately recognised his mums voice.

Court allows Basil to travel to USA for three months
The Colombo High Court yesterday, permitted former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa to travel to USA for a three-month period.
Basil Rajapaksa, a member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP), whose passport was impounded by court in connection with the alleged fraud at the Divineguma Department, had sought the Colombo High Courts permission to temporarily lift his travel ban.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi ordered the release of the former ministers passport on a personal bond of Rs. 200,000.
Deputy Solicitor General Asath Navavi, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, did not raise objections to the request since the defence agreed to represent a lawyer in court if the case was taken up during the period the accused is absent.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, appearing for the former minister, moved court that his client be allowed to travel to USA for medical treatment. He submitted in court the relevant documents and flight travel information including departure/arrival time.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against four accused, including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 2,991 million of funds belonging to theDivineguma Department while distributing roofing sheets and other housing materials among Divineguma beneficiaries during the previous Presidential election. Meanwhile, Colombo High Court Judge A. A. R. Heiyanthuduwa also permitted the former minister to travel to USA in relation to a case over an allegation of misappropriating of Rs.36.5 million of funds which belonged to the Divineguma Development Department to purchase and distribute GI pipes during the last Presidential election.

David Heyn
I met David Heyn at Harmers Aveneu, Wellawatte where he resided. David and Anura Tennakoon showed a lot of promise in the early sixties. They showcased their batting talents whenever the limited opportunities that came their way.
David gave me the impression that he was bitter and rightly so because he was at the receiving end of cronyism and politics. Make no bones about it stated David; even in those days they had ways and means of engineering their near and dear ones into the teams that mattered. David was unfortunate to be embroiled in this. And in his very words underhand stuff were used to nullify the deserved ones getting into the team..
The happenings prior to the aborted tour of England in 1968 written by non-other than Chandra Schafter gave it all in a nutshell which appears later in this article. David although was in England playing for the club Richmond in the Middlesex league, and was always in touch with Sri Lanka cricket.
His lineage is something to be admired, his father Late Major B.R. Heyn and his great uncle Charles Heyn, all played for Ceylon. His daughter Georgina kept up the family achievements by representing Great Britain in swimming. This should go into the record books. David was light skinned and grey eyed and spoke with a drawl which brought back memories of my friends in Hendon London.
David showed his prowess at a very young age from under 12 onwards, he played for BRC at the tender age of 14 for the Daily News Trophy. From 1961 to 1964 he blazed a trail at St Peters as a brilliant fielder and a free scoring batsman, he was the runner up to Vijaya Malalasekera in the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest held in 1963 where he was the best fielder. Even during his school days he was a brilliant fielder, his low center of gravity of being short and stocky would have helped him in swooping down on the ball and whipping it just an inch over the bails, be it at covers or out in the country.
At this juncture I would like to insert what Chandra Schafter wrote which I have to insert in a concise form due to space restriction and hope I have done justice to his report.
SCHAFTER CLEARS HIMSELF
Schafters attention was drawn to an interview given by Dhanasiri Weerasinghe regarding the English tour of 1968 which was aborted. Schafter intended to clear his name. He was a selector at that time together with D.D.Jayasinghe, Bobby Schoorman and K.M.T.Perera. They were honest and non-tolerant.
They felt that C.I. although an outstanding product of Sri Lanka was no captaincy material and opted to give Michael Tissera the captaincy. Schafter was of the view that Michael was a better bet although young in age. To prove a point, under Michaels purview they beat both India and
Pakistan. In 1968 a selection committee comprising of Sam Abeysekera, Dr H.I.K Fernando, Dhanasiri Weerasinghe and himself were elected at the AGM.
Schafter felt that this was orchestrated by late Abu Fuard. Weerasinghe was also a player and this was questioned at the AGM and then Weerasinghe stated that he would not be available for selection. There was a turnaround when Joe Listers team came from England and Schafter was dumbstruck when HIK was proposed as captain and he mentioned his disapproval to his fellow selectors. HIK replaced Tissera and captained the Board eleven.
The UK tour was in the offing and all the players looked forward for selection. The selectors again opted for HIK much to the chagrin of Schafter and he stormed out of the meeting. The selectors were Weerasinghe, Fernando and Gamini Goonasena who withdrew
due to Tisseras non selection.
There were rumblings from the press Selectors capers shock public (Daily Mirror), the selection of Weerasinghe was the last straw that broke the camels back. Here was a straw no one could justify. (The Corner Flag Sunday Times).
It is a pity that I have to cut short Schafters elaborate article due to space restrictions, however in fairness to him I would like to conclude with The final word of this episode was a statement from the Minister which said that, taking into account the agitation over selectors selecting themselves and the threatened injunction (by Dhanasiris lawyer), he reluctantly came to the conclusion that the atmosphere created was not conducive to sending the team. What a pity!
David noted that from 1969 onwards there were more opportunities to represent Ceylon in the Gopalan Trophy matches, and there were several visiting sides and tours to India and Pakistan. He was by then a regular in the side until he emigrated in 1976.
When Ceylon became Sri Lanka in 1972 David recollected that Mike Tissera captained against a Pakistani team which toured Sri Lanka. In that game Duleep Mendis made his debut with a half century.
By 1974 David reminisced that the whole scenario changed and a lot of Anandians and Nalandians came into the scene and as a result the late Abu Fuard and the late Neil Chanmugam were side lined along with others from the previous era.
David vividly recalled the tour to India in 1975 where he got a 100 and a 84 in a single unofficial test. In that match he put to the sword bowlers of the caliber of Bishen Singh Bedi, Baghwat Chandrasekar, Erapalli Prasanna and Venkatraghavan. David with his quicksilver footwork counteracted Bedis dip, flight and spin as if it was another day in office. Bedi was so perplexed by Davids somewhat unorthodox lateral movements on the crease and his sweep shot taking the ball from outside the off stump. He turned to Sunil Gavaskar and said, How to bowl to this guy who is dancing and prancing all over the place. This in reality was conveyed by Sunil Gavaskar himself who met David here in Sri Lanka when he was on a commentary stint here.
David toured England with the 1975 team and hung around there for some time where he got to know Dusty Miller who was the liaison officer to that team, and the ICC representative for Sri Lanka. After some time David was on friendly terms with Miller and he mentioned to David that the chances of achieving test status to Sri Lanka is practically nil since they cannot afford to finance teams like England and Australia who were true professionals and well paid. With our exchange control restrictions things were scuttled.
However when late Minister Gamini Dissanayake came into the scene he broke the shackles and Sri Lanka achieved test status in 1981, and played their first official test against England in 1982.

Death sentence list: First is a woman
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, acknowledging that the list of names comprising 18 prisoners, who have been sentenced to death for drug trafficking, had been received, said the first name in the list was that of a woman.
I am sad to say that the first name in this list is that of a woman. However, as a government, we are determined to take the strictest action possible to eradicate the drug menace, Minister Athukorala said, addressing an event in Kahawatta, yesterday.
The Prisons Department on Sunday, handed over the list of names comprising 18 prisoners convicted for drug trafficking and sentenced to death, to the Justice Ministry.
Minister Athukorala added that when the government took over, the country had become a hub for drug trafficking.
She charged that the underworld was involved in the illicit drug trade under the patronage of powerful politicians at the time.
She said the government was determined to eradicate, not only drugs but also the so-called underworld as well.
The minister stated that irrespective of status or other reasons, those involved in drug trafficking cannot be pardoned.
With the government battling to eradicate a growing narcotics problem, President Maithripala Sirisena said recently that he would sign the required orders to execute the capital punishment for convicted drug traffickers who carry out large-scale drug smuggling operations while in detention.

A training program was conducted to educate teachers of Dhamma Schools in the Central Colombo area. The event was organized by the Sasanarakshaka Bala Mandalaya and the Faizer Mustapha Foundation at the Sri Somananda Temple, Colombo recently.
Minister of Provincial Council, Local Government and Sports Faizer Musthapha distributed certificates to the Dhamma school teachers. He said Dhamma education is required to protect the culture of the country.
Today we see that parents forget about religion and show their children that they are only interested in their studies. Without proper knowledge of Dhamma education, it can not be given to the next generation. A Dhamma school teacher is responsible for giving the Dhamma education to increase the literacy of the children, he said.
He added that he has launched a massive program for the Daham Pasal teachers in the Kandy district by centering the Malwathu and Asgiriya temples.

Discussions on for Thai managed export processing zone
A Thai delegation consisting of 35 leading entrepreneurs from the Thai Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok visited Sri Lanka as part of the business delegation accompanying the Prime Minister of Thailand on a State visit to Sri Lanka.
The delegation which was accompanying Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-O-Cho included the Thai Chamber of Commerce, Board of Trade of Thailand , The Federation of Thai Industries, Mitr Phol, Siam City Cement, Bangkok Dock Company Limited, Thai Airways International Minor International and others.
A round table forum was organized by the BOI, Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade at the Ministry. Minister Malik Samarawickrama said, Sri Lanka and Thailand have had a long history for friendship as both are predominantly Buddhist and have a long tradition of tolerance towards other faiths. There are ancient records of trade between Sri Lanka and Thailand. we are looking at attracting a greater quantum of FDI from Thailand.
The Minister added Our policy now is to build up our trade and investment with the East. In fact it would be correct to say we are now looking East and recently Sri Lanka entered into an FTA with Singapore. The visit of the Prime Minister of Thailand is expected to lay the foundation for a future FTA between Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Samarawickrama added, The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, an agency that come within the purview of my Ministry, is here to help any interested investor in establishing themselves in Sri Lanka for starting projects. We are particularly interested in FDI which will bring know how to the country. In addition to that there is an ongoing discussion on the establishment of a Thai managed Export Processing Zone.
Director General of the BOI Duminda Ariyasinghe also addressed the delegation. He said We are now looking at taking commercial relations with Thailand further. BOI is a one stop shop for FDI and we are establishing a virtual one stop shop that connects all the key agencies that are needed to provide the required approvals for a foreign investor to start projecs.
He added that almost all sectors are opened for business and companies can be the sole owners of their investments in Sri Lanka, but they also have the option of entering into a joint venture with a Sri Lankan company.
The leader of the Thai delegation Kalin Sarasin said Sri Lanka is a hub for South Asia and has an excellent connection to the Middle East, East Asia and Europe. Indeed there have been very strong ties in the past but now we must explore the future opportunities that may exist between Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Kelvin Tan, Regional Sales Director of Port City addressed the visiting delegation and briefed them on the potential for investing in the future Colombo Business District. Tan stated we are building a world class city for South Asia. It is important to understand that South Asia is a region which has 1.7 billion people. It is therefore a huge market at our doorstep. By the middle of 2019 all reclamation will be completed. And the first age of construction will begin by early next year. He added You look at the map you will see that the Shangri La Hotel will be facing in the CHEC Port City. And this area will be part of the new Colombo Business District. When the project is completed we estimate that it will have a population of 250,000. An estimated US$ 15 billion would have flowed into the project and 5.7 million square meters of real estate would be developed as a consequence of setting up Port City.
Tan also stated that the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka had wanted to build a financial city in South Asia located between Dubai and Singapore. Port City will also be connected to Chinas One Belt and One Road project. (OBOR). In South Asia there would be about 300,000 high valued individuals who would be interested in investing and in some cases residing in CHEC Port City. Tan also said that Port City would infuse a lot of modernity into the city of Colombo and there would be an international Marina, an international health centre, world class international school and a world class international convention centre, located within the CHEC Port City area.
The next phase of the meeting was the signing of an MOU between the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Thai Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Dumindra Ratnayake, Chairman of the BOI hosted this event and stated that it reflected the close relations between the two countries and it was the right time to sign this agreement given the considerable opportunities that exists for investing Sri Lanka.

Sarasin concluded by stating that the agreement built up ties between the private sectors of the two countries and will drive the promotion and collaboration in developing key sectors such as the Gem Industries, Jewellery industry, tourism, agriculture, Agro industries and fisheries. He also invited a Sri Lankan delegation to attend an exhibition on the food industry where Thailand is a world leader.
The Forum therefore, will greatly promote the development of relations between Sri Lanka and Thailand in key areas of economy such as investment, trade and tourism.

Do cats actually like being hugged
Do cats even like being hugged Will they just put up with it to please us lonely humans When we hug our cats in a loving embrace, do they secretly resent us
The idea that our cats may not even like a cuddle is a little heartbreaking, so we chatted to an expert to find out the facts.
Anita Kelsey is a cat behaviourist with a degree in feline psychology, so she knows her stuff.
Anita tells Metro.co.uk that all cats are different, and that some will like hugs while others wont  so no, theres no definitive declaration that cats hate hugs and we shouldnt be clutching them to our chests.
Some like physical contact and others hate the feeling of entrapment and not being in control, says Anita.
Theres a high percentage of cats that do not like being picked up and we are learning it is more common than we thought.
Her advice is to assess your cats behaviour, read their signals, and dont force a hug with your cat if they dont seem into it.
A cat that doesnt like being held or picked up will struggle to get away or hiss to tell you it is not happy, Anita tells us. One could even get a nip to say put me down. Other signs are the body going stiff and feeling tense until the cat is put down again.
Hissing, scratching, or wriggling out of your grasp are all pretty obvious signals that the cat youre hugging doesnt want to be hugged at the moment. Dont ignore those signs  put the cat down.
Signs a cat does like being hugged: Theyre purring, theyre nestling in closer, and if you stop the cuddles theyll tap you with their paw.

Environment friendly  substitute for Glyphosate
The Government has expedited research work towards producing a more environment friendly weedicide to replace the glyphosate chemical. It has also decided to phase out the use of glyphosate which has been permitted in respect of tea and rubber plantations within the next three years and introduce the new environment friendly weedicide found through research, in its place.
Plantation Industries Ministry Secretary J. A. Ranjith said the ministry had devised a systematic plan to ensure that glyphosate permitted for use in tea and rubber plantations were not released for other agricultural crops in the country.
Accordingly a decision had been taken to collect data about the total extent of tea and rubber plantations and the number of applicants involved before issuing the glyphosate chemical to users in the estate sector, he said. Although the ban on glyphosate had been lifted on tea and rubber by Gazette Notification dated July 11 distribution had still not taken place, he said.
He said distribution would commence on August 15 according to the exact requirement.
He said The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation would handle the issuing of glyphosate to large scale tea and rubber estates.
If tea and rubber smallholders needed to use glyphosate they should apply through the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority.

Ethics of bourgeois democracy
The New York Times (NYT) story that President Mahinda Rajapaksas presidential election campaign was funded by China through the China Harbor Corporation raised eyebrows in many circles. The sensation it created did not last for several reasons. First, former Deputy Ministers reference to a resurrection of the LTTE gave the opposition ammunition to drown the opposition to Chinese funding by creating a bigger furor by invoking racist sentiments.
The United States has accepted that it had funded democracy building exercises in three Asian countries including Sri Lanka. Previous examples of open interference was seen when it funded the Opposition election campaign following the nationalization of petroleum distribution by the Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Much more overt interference was legend in Latin America and elsewhere in the Third World.
Incidentally the NYT story had the unexpected result of taking the wind out of the Opposition accusation that the 2015 presidential election result was an international conspiracy for what has been unearthed is a much more substantiated conspiracy claim.
Though how far these accusations and counter-accusations are true is not clear or can be ascertained, it is a fact of modern politics that world powers continue to interfere in political developments in other countries with impunity. It is an ingrained trait in their ethical behaviour.
US interference
In an extraordinary labyrinth Russia is accused of interfering in US politics, the US of intruding into election campaigns of many countries throughout the world, the US blaming China for similar behaviour, India being accused of interfering in the affairs of neighbouring countries including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Maldives, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council in fermenting and participating in the civil war in Yemen, Germany and France trading accusations of interference in internal politics of each other and so on.
All politicians alleged of receiving money from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. accused of collusion in the Treasury bond scam had a common excuse. They all said the money was given to their election campaigns, giving the impression that it as a perfectly legitimate business. It does not prick their conscience that such grants are advanced bribes for anticipated favours or privileges once in office, for no businessmen throws money just like feeding crows in the streets.
A news item in the media recently confirmed that the Commission Investigating Allegations of Bribery and Corruption had decided that Members of Parliament could sell their duty free vehicle permits. This gives the MPs a chance to earn an additional amount of money by denying the State custom duties on the vehicles. In other ways it is a devious method of stealing from the State coffers. MPs get vehicles for their use when conducting official duties and not to make business or profit making deals. The allocation of vehicles with freedom to sell them is actually a bribe given to MPs at the expense of the man in the street.
In Sri Lanka it is our experience that even politicians who were known criminals  murderers, rapists and swindlers, get elected to Parliament or provincial representative bodies with huge majorities. This shows that in the common psyche such crimes are excusable. It is an aberration of political ethics.
Commissions and kick-backs on commercial deals and award of tenders have become so widespread that it is taken as a way of life. Politicians have become so insolent that they openly demand commissions as if it is a right. Their ethical degeneration has no limits.
While all these and much more are not unique to Sri Lanka their exceptional high incidence is a sign of our under-development where opportunities for employment and satisfaction of necessities of life are scarce on account of long colonial plunder.
Ethics, however, are not the same throughout the ages. Being a product of historical development it varies according to the mode of production or how humans obtain their basic necessities of life  food, clothing and shelter. Slavery differs from that of ancient communal society or that of present day bourgeois society. There was a time when cannibalism was considered ethical or when the Victorian family was unknown.
Wealth over-rides human values
Today when capital or money rules the world ethics is also governed by it. Man to man competes for possession of money and selfishness replaces altruism or human solidarity. Wealth over-rides all human values religious or otherwise and earns social recognition.
An English writer of the 19th Century T J Dunning wrote over 200 years ago, With adequate profit capital is very bold. A certain 10 percent will ensure its employment anywhere; 20 percent certain will produce eagerness; 50 percent positive audacity; 100 percent will make it ready to trample on all human laws; 300 percent and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged. If turbulence and strife will bring profit it will freely encourage both. Smuggling and the slave-trade have amply proved all that is here stated. (Incidentally here is the secret of mayhem in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine et al)
The failure of religious sermons and teachings to tame the Sri Lankan society into a law-abiding community is not the fault of the teachings or the conduct of its preachers. Nor could it be attributed solely to the antics of politicians. It should be seen in the basic socio-economic relations that define the bourgeois rule in the country.
As long as it promotes selfishness and individualism and consumerism it will not be possible to create a democratic and just society. Only a society in which man to man is a brother and they cooperate in producing their means of livelihood in common could become such a society.
That is why a political and economic revolution should precede and not follow a moral re-armament drive.

Everyone should own a land and house  Minister Hashim
The policy of the government is for everyone to own a land, a house and income said Minister of Highways and Road development, Kabir Hashim.
A meeting participated by Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Gayantha Karunatileka under the programme of one million land deeds granting to the landless people launched by the government was held at the Kegalle Kachchari last Friday.
Addressing the media after the discussion, Minister Kabir Hashim said that although the people in Kegalle District suffered from a land ownership problem in the past, some politicians grabbed the lands of the people for their benefits.
At present some people do not even have an inch of land although the system of gifting deeds of lands as well as the ownership of lands to the people was introduced by Portuguese, the Minister said.
The present government however is fully aware of the abysmal sufferings of the people who are without deeds for their lands but having only land permits.
This helpless group was therefore unable to apply for loans and was not entitled to the benefits of deed holders. After having realized this unfair treatment, my earnest anticipation for a long time even when I was in the opposition and an MP was to remedy this injustice as soon as the first opportunity knocked on my door. That moment of joy had now arrived. The people of Kegalle district who had no deeds and only permits for their lands have been granted title deeds. This has enabled the permit sans deed holders to overcome great obstacles. They are now given unencumbered title deeds to their lands, the minister who always thinks peoples happiness is his, gleefully pinpointed.
Minister Kabir Hashim appealed to the Land minister who is fully aware of the sad side of the landless problem of the masses to solve the problems of the people of Kegalle District, who are eagerly waiting for land deeds from the authorities. Referring to the Estate sector workers, the Minister requested the land Minister to take action to grant land from the estate companies to the estate workers.

Five hundred clay  puppets created for  Isle of Dogs
This monsoon is going to be a nostalgic extravaganza for all dog lovers out there with filmmaker Wes Andersons upcoming stop-motion animation venture Isle Of Dogs.
The English stop animation film is set in a fictional Japanese town of Megasaki, which is hit by a canine flu forcing the Mayor to shift the canine population to a barren island. Thereafter begins the story of a young boy in search of his dog. Humans play integral characters in the story.
However, its the dogs who rule the film.
Isle of Dogs, with a star-studded cast, 1,000 puppets and 240 micro sets is a wonder to behold. Anderson, who has written, directed and produced the film, wanted to keep the look of all the dogs authentic.
Hence, he filmed all kind of pups in order to analyse their behaviour. The director then began sculpting clay dog puppets based on his observations and analysis. With more than 70 artists on the puppet team, a total of 1000 clay puppets were created out of which 500 puppets were humans and 500 were dogs.

Food focus
There has been much controversy about the Sri Lanka Army engaging in farming activities in the North, especially in Jaffna. However, despite the outcry of the Tamil politicians about the army engaging in farming activities, the Tamil youth, especially those rehabilitated ex-rebel cadres who are given employment at these farms feel that it has given them an opportunity to earn a decent living and live with dignity in society. The benefits they enjoy does not merely mean their salaries, they are also entitled to all the medical and welfare facilities enjoyed by the rest of the army and even their families are provided with free medical assistance, which according to them, is a great blessing.
There are also allegations that the army-run farms are posing a threat to the local farmers and that they have to compete with the military-run farms. However, the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters Commander Maj. Gen. Dharshana Hettiarachchi, vehemently denied these allegations and added that the produce from these farms are not sent to the open market, but instead they are solely for the consumption of the military establishments and the military personnel.
Earlier this year, fifty unemployed youths in the Jaffna peninsula, including rehabilitated former LTTE combatants, were recruited by the Sri Lanka Army for non-military duties in a gesture of goodwill, understanding and reconciliation between civilians and members of the Security Forces.
The new initiative was launched by Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, Commander, Security Forces-Jaffna (SF-J) in close coordination with the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation and other state officials in the peninsula with the blessings of the Commander of the Army who pioneered the project in the peninsula when he was the Jaffna Commander.
Rehabilitated ex-cadres
These recruits are entitled to a monthly salary of Rs. 40,000 in addition to many other privileges. They are provided with meals, transport, medicine and pension rights in the Army on retirement. Their family members including parents have access to Army medical facilities depending on their marital status.
These new recruits were mainly recruited for the coconut cultivation project in the Army farm in the Palaly Army Cantonment.
These recruits are required to work a regular 8.5-hour work shift and have the privilege of travelling from their homes daily rather than being confined to living within the facility. This also gives them the opportunity to spend time with their families and also take care of their children.
The Jaffna Commander, however, requests the young men and women to work with commitment as Sri Lankan nationals of one family while taking care of their own future.
The Daily News visited the Army-run farm close to the Palali runway in Jaffna, where around 150 rehabilitated ex-cadres are being provided employment.
In the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters held area there are around 3,376 ex-LTTE cadres and of them, 3,097 have undergone the rehabilitation programme, as opposed to only around 279 have not. Of them, around 1,775 of them are available for employment in addition to the 189 non-rehabilitated personnel.
Among these ex-combatants, there has not been any major incident reported while these people who have undergone many hardships during the war, have no desire to return to such violence and are very keen in social integration.
These ex-combatants, who were actively engaged during the war, have found it very hard to be accepted into society once the war ended. As much as they were hailed and feared during the rule of the LTTE, once the war ended these very combatants were shunned by the general public. As a result of it, they were not given employment by society as they were perceived to be violent. This situation left many of these ex-combatants unemployed further aggravating their trauma and frustration, in addition to the trauma and hardships they had to undergo during the conflict. This also left many of them with long-term health issues as well.
Among the ongoing projects is the coconut plantation in collaboration with the Coconut Development Board, Palmyra plantation in collaboration with the Palmyra Development Board, Reforestation, in collaboration with the Forrest Department etc.
The Jaffna Commander said that most of the army personnel remain in the North for only a specific period, but he said the work that the military does is an investment for the future of the people in the region. They are the ones who will reap the benefits of all the projects that we do, he said.
However, during a meeting held recently with the United Nations Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka Terence D. Jones, the Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance R. Sampanthan said he was not happy with the army being engaged in farming activities in the North. We dont want the Military to run farms on our lands which they are doing now; we want them to be out of these commercial activities which hinder the livelihoods of our people.
Financial assistance
In addition, TNA spokesman and Jaffna District Parliamentarian Sumanthiran pointed out that decisions of releasing lands should not be left alone to the armed forces but the government must decide and implement.
But, the ex-combatants who are employed on the Palaly farm speaking to the Daily News did not share the same sentiments as the TNA representatives. Instead, they were appreciative of the fact that the Army had given them back their dignity by providing them with the opportunity to be productive citizens of the country and a steady source of income for their families.
Speaking to the Daily News Rasiah Lochana, who had been employed by the Army for the past five years said she was a teacher previously and had served in the LTTE during the war and after the conflict ended, she had not received the acceptance of her people. In a family of four, she is now married and is the mother of two children. Lochana noted that initially, she and her family had reservations about joining the army and her parents were scared. However, after I joined, I realised that the army personnel are not bad at all and they, in fact, accepted us and treat us better than our own people.
However, admitting that working on the farm in the hot sun is rather tiring, but said the remuneration she received for it, more than compensated for her efforts. After the war, I obtained a loan and constructed a house for my family. My older daughter attends Montessori and my younger daughter is just six months. My husband was also employed by the Army previously. In fact, I earn more than my daughters school principal does by being employed by the Army, she joked.
Lochana, however, lamented that rape has increased in the North and she was worried about the future of her daughters.
Sudhakaran Navaneethamalai, another employee engaged in farming activities on the Army farm in Palali said, I have also been in the army for the past five years. They have treated me well and I am happy. My family is also accepting of my job. I have four children and the oldest son is 14. My husband does not provide for us and I run my family with what I earn from this job. When I am at work my sister looks after my children and since I get to go home every evening, it is easier for me to take care of them. I am originally from Kilinochchi and as an active member of the LTTE, I know how much we suffered as we were the ones who had to go to war. Both my parents were killed during the war and all I want is to ensure that my children never have to undergo the same hardships as I did.
The army says that their intention is to help these people manage their daily lives and these farms and gradually, they would step back from these civilian activities and hand them over to the people of the North to carry on these activities.
Kirindika Jeganathan who had joined the army just three months ago said she was still adjusting to the work. At 21 years, she was initially employed elsewhere but had later decided to join the army as she could earn better and the army provides better facilities. She is unmarried and even her family was initially afraid to send her to the army. However, having seen the progress of those already in the army and hearing their stories, she too had eventually decided to join. Now, she says she feels safer with the army than with civilian organisations. Earlier, we were scared to death of the army after the stories we had heard. However, now that I am with them, I realise that all that we were told are not true. I feel very safe here and even the Sinhala soldiers and superiors are very kind to us and we dont face any discrimination or harassment. We work together on the same farm as brothers and sisters, share our meals and work happily. Now I see that they are no different to any of us, but we were initially scared because of all the wrong impressions that we had about them, she added.
Free and safe society
Nidharshan a 24-year-old youth had joined the army just two months ago. I worked in a lathe workshop earlier. My friends who were in the army told me of the many benefits they receive and I too decided to join. When I first came, I was sceptical, but now that I am here with the army, I have a totally different opinion of them. I have lost all that suspicion and I am comfortable working with the Sinhalese soldiers and I see no difference among us. Now when we go out, I always tell the people that army treats us well.
There is over 20,000 youth without jobs and I hope the army can provide more employment opportunities so that these youth too can find proper income and rebuild their lives. Being unemployed only makes them vulnerable to engage in unlawful activities. Hence I personally would encourage anyone among my people to join the army without any fear of all the negative things we have heard about them are all fabricated lies. There is no issue working with the army and it is a safe and secure place to work in. We never ever want a war again and all I want is to educate my sisters and see a free and safe society once again in the North, he said.
Rahul too has served in the army for the past five years. Initially it was hard to adjust, but now I have got used to the work and it gives me a good income to support my wife and children. Most importantly, it has given me confidence and dignity in society. However, there are some who try to ridicule us that we are with the Sinhala forces, but I just avoid them because I know that there is no difference and we too need to trust them as much as they trust us. It is the army that has given us the opportunity and I am grateful for it.
Karan, (30) is another employee of the army who has been serving for the past five years. My wife too is employed with the army and we earn very well and we are in a good position to assist our families. The hot weather makes it a bit hard for us, working on the farm, but we have to get used to it as we cant do anything about the weather. The main thing is that we have been given dignity and self-worth and we can live in the society with our heads held high. All these people who criticise us for joining the army did not come forward to help us. Now that they see that we are living well, they are coming behind us asking us to help them get employment within the army too.
There are about 120 Tamils working within the army farm and for them, although they do have to battle with the hot Jaffna weather, it makes it worthwhile considering the benefits they receive. For these females, they need to serve for a period of just 15 years in order to be entitled to a pension. This, they say, is a great blessing for them. Despite what is being said by the Tamil politicians, for these Tamil civilians recruited by the army, life for them has changed dramatically and so has their perception of the army and the Sinhalese people. There is trust among the Tamils and the army and the Sinhalese which is no doubt the most vital component in the reconciliation process.

Genius  make-up tips  no one told  you about
When it comes to make-up, theres a lot of ways you can make the most of your products! From experimenting with products to make-up techniques, the beauty world is filled with a lot of hacks that you might not be aware of!
The concealer hack
Applying concealer on just the under-eye circles is so old school. The new way is to apply the concealer in a triangular shape. The base of the triangle should be below your lashline and the point should be on the cheeks. This hack will give your face a lift and make your skin look more youthful.
Revive your mascara
You dont need to throw away your dried-up mascara unless they are really old! If you want to revive and de-clump the texture, all you need to do is add a few drops of lens solution. This way you can break the dried texture and revive it to use it yet again!
Fix broken products
Nothing breaks your heart more than broken make-up products. If your compact powder, blush and any powder-based product have broken, you can easily fix it. All you need is some rubbing alcohol. Pour a few drops of it on the powder to smooth it out.
Coat lashes with baby powder
If you want to get voluminous lashes, try the powder hack. Use a lash brush to apply baby powder and then apply mascara, this way you will notice instant volume.
Make eye pencil a gel liner
You can make any eye pencil to work like a gel liner. All you need to do is heat the tip of the pencil with a blow dryer. This way it will melt a bit and will be smooth like a gel liner.

GMOA to decide on strike on Thursday
The final decision on launching a strike will be made after the emergency General Committee meeting of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) on Thursday (19), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that one of the main reasons for the strike is the unfair tax policy implemented by the government. The President should intervene and solve this issue immediately.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the issue has already been brought to the notice of the Health Ministry Secretary and all relevant officials. The Health Ministry is now taxing doctors in an illegal manner using various new rules and regulations. The Health Ministry is taxing the salaries and allowances yet to be paid to doctors. The salaries and allowances were not paid due to the inefficiency of health officials.
One of the main demands presented by the GMOA was imposition of a maximum limit of 12 percent on the tax imposed on doctors and professionals. Establishing a system to maintain the transparency of expenses (using revenue from taxes) of the country is another demand presented, he said.

President tells FAO Parley in Rome
Govt. mulls massive reforestation drive
The Government plans to plant five million trees by 2020 and increase the forest cover to 32 percent, President Maithripala Sirisena told the 24th Session of the Committee on Forestry, of Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome yesterday.
Delivering the parleys inaugural address, President Sirisena pointed out that more than 50 percent of the land area in Sri Lanka was covered by forests two centuries ago and now the total dense forest cover of the island is only estimated at 29.7 percent of the total land area of the country.
Sri Lanka is now highly committed to conserve its existing forest cover and enhance to 32 percent by adopting better practices, to improve land governance, as a key measure to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals target, the President added.
The Government was keen to raise the forest cover and manage the forests sustainably since they provide many socio-economic benefits, including food, energy and shelter which are basic human needs. In order to conserve the environment and the waterways the government banned felling of trees over 5,000 feet elevation. Reforestation has been the responsibility of the Forest Department.
With the coordination of many other Government Ministries, Local Government institutions and cooperative societies we have commenced a project to plant five million trees by 2020, the President said.
The President stressed the need to involve the younger generation in this effort.
We are commencing a project to motivate and encourage the countrys 4.3 million schoolchildren to plant at least one tree in their home garden, school premises or wherever possible. We will help and support the plant growth by helping the children financially.
We will allocate to them by their personal name. We will persuade them to plant trees that could bring some income to the children and the households. This will encourage and make the children aware of their duty to conserve and preserve Nature,President Sirisena said.
The President noted that more than 50 percent of the forest cover in Sri Lanka was lost due to clearing of forests to be used for export oriented agriculture, and large agricultural land settlements.
Forest destruction has caused severe environmental hazards in many parts of the country. It has affected rainfall patterns, soil erosion and destruction of agricultural products.
He thanked the FAO for the assistance given to Sri Lanka and its people, especially during periods of national disasters such as floods, drought and landslides that occurred causing much damage especially to poor farming communities, by providing them with urgently required food and provisions.
The President also thanked the FAO Director General for inviting him to address the opening session of the 24th Session of the Committee on Forestry and described it as a great honour to Sri Lanka, and personally to him.
As the Minister of Agriculture and later as the Minister of Environment and Natural resources, as at present, I had very intimate relationship with FAO, he recalled. And now is my turn to address this august assembly as the Head of State.
I am aware that, the Committee on Forestry is the right platform for you to share your knowledge, discuss, debate and take decisions for the progressing of global forestry sector.
The agenda ahead of you is very comprehensive and challenging, he told the experts gathered in Rome.

Harvesting for Yala season commences
Harvesting for the 2018 Yala season commenced in the Ampara district, recently and the process is in in full swing in the Pottuvil, Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, Alayadivembu, Thirukkovil, Sammanthurai and Irakkamam Divisional Secretariat divisions.
Farmers said they expected to reap a better harvest this year compared to that of last year, adding that they acquire an average yield of 100 to 130 bushels per acre.
The price of rice in the district had also been reduced due to the Yala harvest.
Farmers had complained that their produce could not be sold under the prices set by the government and were hence, selling paddy to private rice mill owners. Private millers offer money immediately, they added.
Previously, the price of one bag of paddy (66 kilograms) was Rs. 2,300, but at present, that price had dwindled to Rs. 1,800.
Manual harvesting processes carried out by agricultural labourers are no longer in practice. Combine harvesters are utilised to carry out harvesting activities in an area spanning five to six acres per day.
Paddy crops in certain areas had been affected by leaf-roll disease, among other blights and as such, their yields had declined.
About 26,000 acres of selected paddy lands were cultivated in the Ampara district during the Yala season. However, several areas in the Ampara district were affected by the prevailing drought as well.
Usually, 120,000 acres of paddy lands are cultivated during the Yala season. Due to insufficient rainfall during this year, however, the entire extent of paddy lands in the district cannot be cultivated.

Construction sites are the other popular dengue mosquito breeding sites. It is discovered that around 4,000 construction sites in the country at the moment are targets of dengue mosquito breeding. Arrangements will be made to implement a special programme to destroy mosquito breeding sites located inside construction sites under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, he said.
Special training and another allowance will be given to the 1,500 field assistants recruited to control dengue. Cabinet approval had been received to purchase 50 more vehicles for mosquito control activities, he added.

The hip duel queen who shoots wit from the lip!
We were all gathered at the posh Colombo five-star hostelry for the ceremonial launching of a quality coffee-table pictorial tome. I was in charge of the presentation. The book depicts a once tranquil Sri Lankan district which became a springboard for a senseless secessionist conflict.
The quality compendium had been commissioned and published by one of the countrys elite conglomerates. The book contained a veritable assortment of topics ranging from personality portraits to landscapes, devotees, places of religious worship and spices.
In keeping with the colourful Yarlparnam culture and time-honoured traditions every guest was marked with a pottu or thilak at the entrance. You know what I mean, the little forehead dot with sandal paste that means a lot to all our Tamil brethren. It all helped to embellish those special elements of atmosphere and mood that pervaded the occasion.
I was late for the occasion and had misplaced my notes. But as I stepped on to the podium I was handed a slip of paper by my old pal Malka who has always come to my rescue more times that I can remember. Malka had actually prepared the text for me keeping it short, sharp, snappy and sweet.
I glanced at the gathering of privileged corporate leaders telling them that they would be sending out ripples of hope to the marginalised. Taking a cue from Malkas draft I said: We are not concerned about what religious denomination you belong, other than the fact that your donations be of high denomination notes. I have good news and bad news. The good news is the charities have enough money to fund the northern childrens programs. The bad news is its still out there in your pockets and corporate kittys.
Malka had made sure that I would convince them to generously open their corporate purse strings by tugging at their heartstrings with an emotional appeal. She was right because by the time I had finished there wasnt a dry eye among that distinguished gathering.
I have told you before about my childhood friend Malka who is no ordinary person. She always hung around with the boys and was an outstanding marble player. She was such a specialist shooter at the game that she was dubbed The marvel with marbles. In other words, given the license to mix the Sinhala and Anglo-Saxon idioms she was an Attagirl at Atta Bola.
She has always maintained a curious, almost unforgettable closeness among her childhood friends and playmates. Malka was sizzling with mischief and even at that tender, impressionable age was practical and wise beyond her years. She was brimming with wit and could ad-lib one-liners with the panache of a professional comedienne. Even as a child her verbal gymnastics were legendary. She is astonishingly articulate and brilliantly fast on the uptake.
She certainly would have been more than a match for presenters and moderators such as Tim Sebastian and Stephen Sackur of BBCs Hard- talk or any other interviewer. They might have had some words with her but they would certainly have been repaid with some scathing paragraphs from the interviewee. I cannot actually quite figure out why I am an exception but she appears to have some sort of resentment against media men.
Her favourite jibe at me is to address a third party in conversation with me saying : Hey, you are speaking to a high and mighty journalist. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be misquoted, then used against you.
Now as I have mentioned Malka is pretty nice and a loyal friend, and most of the time she can be an angel. But break her wings or try hurting her or her family or friends and she will fly anyway. Not fly off the handle but on the handle of her broom. She can be witchily mercurial when annoyed, quite flexible really. But unlike fools such as some of us she doesnt get mad. She gets even.
She can change when the occasion warrants it from being a ray of sunshine into a shaft of sarcasm in the glimmer of a second. I am glad she is my friend because she always says that some people she meets in life have left footprints on her heart. But as for the others she quips with that dangerous glint in her eye: I want to leave a footprint on their face!
Malka was at her charming best during the cocktail reception following the pictorial book launch. Several Western embassy and NGO personnel, obviously new to their Sri Lankan postings were lounging around asking questions. They barged in on a group being entertained by Malka. One of them queried: What does that coloured dot on your foreheads mean Malkas eyes narrowed and she answered with all seriousness: Well, its something like the old William Tell story. In ancient times, Sri Lankan men used to practice archery skills by aiming at the bulls-eye which was the dot on their wives foreheads.
Staring incredulously at Malka the visitor drawled: Well Ill be  But he was cut short in mid sentence by Malka: What A son of a gun! Yes but I was talking about archery, medieval bow and arrows stuff.
This was the same Malka who as a student in America in the seventies had answered her colleagues questions with brilliant riposte. Does Sri Lanka have cars Malka is said to have answered with a serious demeanour: No. We ride elephants to work. But the problem is that elephants have emission problems so the government is trying to encourage ride-sharing schemes.
As I said before her sunny disposition is hard to contain. Clan legend has it that on a student exchange program in London she was asked whether all Sri Lankans were vegetarian Malkas answer: Yes I suppose so. Even our leopards are vegetarian!
And then when some patronizing foreign student colleague dared to ask her: Why do you sometimes wear Sri Lankan clothes to lectures Eyeing him intently Malka showed no mercy. She simply fired pointblank: I prefer it to coming naked!

His Lordship Oswald Gomis: A Bishop for 50 years
Archbishop Emeritus Rt. Rev. Dr. Oswald Thomas Colman Gomis celebrates the Golden Jubilee of his consecration as a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church, today.
He was consecrated an Auxiliary Bishop of the Colombo Diocese at the age of 36, along with Very Rev. Fr. Edmund J. Fernando OMI, by the late Thomas Benjamin, Cardinal Cooray, now referred to as Servant of God. They were nominated to be Auxiliary Bishops by Pope John Paul II, now a saint of the Roman Catholic Church.
The celebration to mark his Golden Jubilee will be held on Sunday, July 22, at 5pm, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH). A thanksgiving Holy Mass will be offered on Monday, July 23, at 5pm, at All Saints Church, Borella.
Oswald Gomis was ordained in 1958. From 1961, Fr. Gomis served as the Editor of the Gnanartha Pradeepaya - the Catholic weekly  and as the Director of the Colombo Catholic Press. In 1968 he was chosen to be one of the two Auxiliary Bishops of the Colombo Archdiocese.
Bishop Gomis has contributed immensely to all sections of society while working as a member of a number of committees, both religious and secular, and has won the praise and admiration of all communities and religious leaders.
Bishop Gomis was appointed Chancellor of the University of Colombo in 2001, a post he holds to date.
Even to this day, he lives in the hearts of the Buddhists of this country, as a very close friend and a brother to the Maha Sanga, with his meritorious act of offering dana to the Venerable Buddhist Clergy at the official residence of the Colombo Archbishop, for the first time in the history of the country.
The Colombo Diocese was created a See by Pope Gregory XVI on December 03, 1834, by the decree Exmunere Pastorale and renamed the Archdiocese in 1947. The then Coadjutor Bishop was Rt. Rev. Dr. Thomas Cooray OMI.
Rt. Rev. Dr. Mary Masson OMI was the last European to serve the Colombo Diocese as Archbishop. With the demise of Bishop Masson, the Coadjutor Bishop Thomas Cooray OMI assumed the See of the Colombo Archdiocese as the first Sri Lankan Archbishop.
His Lordship Rt. Rev. Dr. Gomis served 28 years as Auxiliary Bishop in the Archdiocese of Colombo and was made Bishop of Anuradhapura, the portal of Buddhist heritage, in 1996.
Bishop Gomis, who served as the shepherd of the Anuradhapura Diocese for close to six years, assumed duties as the Archbishop of Colombo in 2002, succeeding Rt. Rev. Dr. Nicholas Marcus Fernando, who went on retirement at the end of his Canonical term of service.
With the passage of time, His Lordship Rt. Rev. Dr. Edmund Fernando OMI assumed duties as the Second Bishop of the Badulla Diocese, carved out from the Diocese of Kandy, with the passing away of Rt. Rev. Dr. Leo Nanayakkaara OSB, the first bishop of the Badulla Diocese.
Although Bishop Gomis retired from active service after serving seven years as the head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka from July 6, 2002 to June 11, 2009 and now lives in the quiet surroundings of the Tewatte Basilica, he has not giving up his research or his writing.
Archbishop Gomis is held in high esteem among the elite, scholars and intellectuals, for his professionalism, knowledge, lucidity and clarity of thought. Thanks to Fr. Jacome Gonsalvez, the efforts of Saint Joseph Vaz in implanting the Catholic Faith in Sri Lanka has been well documented.
In similar fashion, the continuing research and education of the public by Bishop Gomis reminds us of the service rendered by Bishop Edmund Peiris, Frs. Nicholas Perera, Don Peter, D.J. Anthony, Andrew Peter Fernando, Joseph Jayasuriya, Marcelline Jayakody and other priests and religious who faithfully trod the path of the erudite scholarly Goan priest Jacome Gonsalvez, and made their mark in their respective fields.
The initiative and the leadership of Bishop Gomis to present the modified Cross of St. Thomas, used in introducing the Catholic faith to Sri Lanka, as the symbol of the Catholic flag in the country won high praise from those who are familiar with the work of this prolific writer who has authored several books in Sinhala and English to prove the Catholic presence.
Bishop Gomis was born on December 12, 1932, to the family of Vincent and Rosaline of Sinharamulla, Kelaniya, and grew up in the midst of Catholic and Buddhist influence. He took his first steps to learn to read and write at St. Pauls Roman Catholic Sinhala School at Waragoda. He then came under the guidance of the De La Salle Brothers while at St. Benedicts College, Kotahena and later studied at St. Joseph s College, Maradana.
He entered St. Aloysius Minor Seminary at Borella on January 16, 1950, as an 18-year-old youth when Rev. Fr. Sevarines Fernando OMI was Rector of that institution.
Within a very short period of time, he entered St. Bernards Major Seminary, which was housed in the present Aquinas College. The seminary is now at Ampitiya, Kandy, and stands as the major seminary in the island, dedicated to Our Lady of Lanka. Bishop Gomis was ordained at the age of 26, on February 3, 1958, by Rt. Rev. Dr. Thomas Benjamin Cooray OMI, the then Archbishop of Colombo.
Bishop Gomis imprinted his impeccable, irrevocable Gomis sign as the Editor of Gnanartha Pradeepaya and played the lead role in celebrating its centenary, in 1966.
He took the initiative in introducing Lama Pradeepaya for children, as a supplement to the Catholic weekly. His introduction of the Pahan Poth series, Pradeepa Poth and Minipahana Poth, as the then editor, won him high regard and recognition.
Bishop Gomis, well versed both in Sinhala and English, has contributed valuable articles to other newspapers and periodicals. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Fu Jen University, one of the ancient universities in China, in recognition of his service to humanity and obtained his Doctorate in Education from Adamson University in the Philippines.
Bishop Gomis who assumed duties on July 27, 2002, as the third Archbishop of Colombo has won the love and appreciation of the Maha Sanga and other religious dignitaries and leading figures in society.
His contribution in the field of education is noteworthy. He is responsible for establishing a number of branch schools of the leading Catholic colleges in Colombo.
Bishop Gomis served as Secretary General of the Asian Bishops Conference on two occasions. Thanks to his efforts, Catholics the world over have the privilege of listening to Radio Veritas, the Catholic news service, in 14 languages, from Manila, Philippines.
Bishop Gomis shared the responsibility with the media personality, recognized author and the Diamond Jubilarian Fr. Ernest Poruthota, in introducing and opening a branch of the prestigious OCIC which caters to the progress of electronic media and cinema. They were both influenced by the role played in this regard by the ex-Oblate priest Noel Cruz.
Bishop Gomis imprinted his mark in the hearts and minds of those who were affected by the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004, in helping them to obtain permanent shelter by encouraging every segment of society here and overseas to assist.
He also initiated scholarship programmes to assist children living in dire poverty. He has donated 14 acres of land in Kelaniya to set up a home for the aged and a medical centre, close to his hometown for tsunami victims.
The Bishops Conference Secretariat at Balcomb Place, Borella, stands out as a monument to his effort and dedication to service while playing the role of Secretary General of the Sri Lanka Catholic Bishops Conference.
Archbishop Emeritus Rt. Rev. Dr. Oswald Thomas Colman Gomis who has travelled to nearly 50 countries will celebrate his 87th birthday on December 12. May he enjoy the love and protection of the Divine Lord, good health and live a trouble-free life full of happiness in the days to come.

Honouring late fathers strength
Janet Jackson decided against cancelling her headlining set at the 2018 Essence Festival following the loss of her father, because its not what he would have wanted.
Family patriarch Joe Jackson lost his battle with cancer on 27 June (18), at the age of 89, and some fans were concerned the superstar would pull out of her summer tour dates, including a weekend performance at the New Orleans, Louisiana festival, to grieve his passing.
Janet assured devotees the show would go on in a video posted to Instagram last week, although she admitted it had been a pretty rough week for her loved ones.
As promised, the Nasty hitmaker returned to the stage for the Essence Festival on Sunday (08Jul18), but during her set, the singer paused the music and opened up about her decision to play through the pain. To be quite honest, it was really hard for me, Janet told the crowd. I didnt know what to do. I didnt know how to move forward, if I should cancel this festival or cancel the entire tour.
Growing emotional, the 52-year-old revealed a heart-to-heart with one of her brothers inspired her to do what she does best, and honour her father, who masterminded his childrens early musical success, in the process.
He was very strong, and... without his drive, his strength... we wouldnt have this success, Janet continued. We are a black family that came from Gary, Indiana and we broke all kinds of records around the globe. Thats truth.
And when her brother asked her to consider what Joe would have told her to do, she realised she couldnt let her fans down.
I think my father would have said, Janet, please, finish what you started, and I will be there with you every step of the way in your heart, so here I am, she concluded tearfully.

Human - elephant conflict:Protect both parties
The human - elephant conflict in Sri Lanka is another type of war. This conflict should be overcome by protecting and safeguarding both parties involved, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
Field Marshal Fonseka made this observation when he spoke to the media during an observation tour undertaken in Sooriyawewa - an area worst affected by the human-elephant conflict, recently.
Field Marshal Fonseka said the responsibility of the Wildlife Ministry was to protect and conserve wildlife. The biggest problem in this subject area is the problem concerning elephants. "The elephant herd is a national asset. Elephants cannot be conserved without resolving the human - elephant conflict. This problem had assumed national proportions, he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka said certain environmentalists in Colombo are unaware that the elephant is a fearsome animal. Others talk about using an elephant collar to keep animals under surveillance to learn about their whereabouts. These are not practical. The solution to the problem is the segregation of elephants and people by erecting fences. He said the most fearsome elephants rounded up are being relocated in the Horowpothana area. However, the two electrified fences available there are not strong enough. Therefore, those fences should to be further strengthened. A sustainable solution should be found for the human - elephant conflict without trying piecemeal solutions, he added.
Therefore, erecting strong electrified fences is a must. Farmers cannot be called upon to look after the fence.
There should be a cadre of legally responsible persons to protect and safeguard the electrified fences, Field Marshal Fonseka said.

From crisis to sustenance  part 34
If youre in product development team, stop running the relay race and take up rugby
In todays fast-paced, fiercely competitive world of commercial new product development, speed and flexibility are essential. Companies are increasingly realizing that the old, sequential approach to developing new products simply wont get the job done. Instead, modern companies are using a holistic methodas in rugby, the ball gets passed within the team as it moves as a unit up the field.
This holistic approach has six characteristics: built-in instability, self-organizing project teams, overlapping development phases, multi-learning, subtle control, and organizational transfer of learning. The six pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, forming a fast and flexible process for new product development. The new approach can also act as a change agent: it is a vehicle for introducing creative, market-driven ideas and processes into an old, rigid organization
Under the old approach, a product development process moved like a relay race, with one group of functional specialists passing the baton to the next group. The project went sequentially from phase to phase: concept development, feasibility testing, product design, development process, pilot production, and final production. Under this method, functions were specialized and segmented: the marketing people examined customer needs and perceptions in developing product concepts; the R&D engineers selected the appropriate design; the production engineers put it into shape; and other functional specialists carried the baton at different stages of the race.
Rugby approach 
Under the rugby approach, the product development process emerges from the constant interaction of a hand-picked, multidisciplinary team whose members work together from start to finish. Rather than moving in defined, highly structured stages, the process is bon out of the team members interplay. A group of engineers, for example, may start to design the product (phase three) before all the results of the feasibility tests (phase two) are in. Or, the team may be forced to reconsider a decision as a result of later information. The team does not stop then, but engages in iterative experimentation.
One of the charms of the Rugby game is the infinite variety of its possible tactics. Whatever tactics a team aims to adopt, the first essential is a strong and skilful pack of forwards capable of winning initial possession from the set pieces. For, with the ball in its hands, a team is in a position to dictate tactics which will make the best use of its own particular talents, at the same time probing for and exposing weaknesses in the opposing team.
Let us take an example. Years ago, Fujis top management asked for a radically different copier and gave the project team two years to come up with a machine that could be produced at half the cost of its high-end line and still perform as well. Let us see the process worked.
1. Built-in instability 
Top management kicked off the development process by signaling a broad goal or a general strategic direction. It did not hand out a clear- cut new product concept or a specific work plan. But it both offers a project team a wide measure of freedom and also establishes extremely challenging goals.
Top management created an element of tension in the project team by giving it great freedom to carry out a project of strategic importance to the company and by setting very challenging requirements.
2. Self-organizing project teams 
A project team took on a self-organizing character as it was driven to a state of zero informationwhere prior knowledge did not apply. Left to stew, the process began to create its own dynamic order. The project team began to operate like a start-up companyit took initiatives and competing through New Product Development risks, developed an independent agenda. The group possessed a self-organizing capability when it exhibited three conditions: autonomy, sell-transcendence, and cross-fertilization.
Autonomy. Top managements involvement was limited to providing guidance, money and moral support at the outset. In a way, top management acted as a venture capitalist. Or, as one top executive said, We open up our purse but keep our mouth closed.
Self-transcendence. Starting with the guidelines set forth by top management, the project team began to establish their own goals and kept on elevating themselves throughout the development process. By pursuing what appeared at first to be contradictory goals, they devised ways to override the status quo.
The project team consisted of members with varying functional specializations, thought processes, and behavior patterns. But they carried out new product development in unison.
3. Overlapping development phases 
The self-organizing character of the team produced a unique dynamic or rhythm. Although the team members started the project with different time horizonswith R&D people having the longest time horizon and production people the shortestthey all worked toward synchronizing their pace to meet deadlines. Also, while the project team started from zero information, each member soon began to share knowledge about the marketplace and the technical community. As a result, the team began to work as a single unit.
4. Multi-learning 
Because members of the project team stayed in close touch with outside sources of information, they responded quickly to changing market conditions. Team members engaged in a continual process of trial and error to narrow down the number of alternatives that they needed to consider. They also acquired broad knowledge and diverse skills, which helped them create a versatile team capable of solving an array of problems fast.
5. Subtle control 
Although project teams were largely on their own, they were not uncontrolled. Management established enough checkpoints to prevent instability, ambiguity, and tension from turning into chaos. At the same time, management avoided the kind of rigid control that impairs creativity and spontaneity. Instead, the emphasis was on self-control, control through peer pressure, and control by love, which collectively we call subtle control.
Subtle control is generally exercised in the new product development process in seven ways:
1. Selecting the right people for the project team while monitoring shifts in group dynamics and adding or dropping members when necessary. The different personalities are analyzed to see if they would get along.
2. Creating an open work environment.
3. Encouraging all members to go out into the field and listen to what customers and dealers have to say.
4. Establishing an evaluation and reward system based on group performance.
5. Managing the differences in rhythm throughout the development process. As mentioned earlier, the rhythm is most vigorous in the early phases and tapers off toward the end.
6. Tolerating and anticipating mistakes.
7. Encouraging suppliers to become self-organizing. Involving them early during design is a step in the right direction. But the project team should refrain from telling suppliers what to do.
6. Transfer of learning
Transfer of learning to subsequent new product development projects or to other divisions in the organization takes place regularly. The transfer took place through osmosisby assigning key individuals to subsequent projects. The knowledge was also transmitted in the organization by converting project activities to standard practice. As the state-of-the-art in product development is turning its attention from efficiency to capability building and organizational learning, operations management needs to shift its focus from static efficiency to dynamic capability building. In light of the evidence that rugby approach is closely connected with how organizations solve problems and spread knowledge, there is reason to believe that this paradigm shift will open up many opportunities for further research on this holistic approach for years to come.
Some limitations 
Some words of caution are in order. The holistic approach to product development may not work in all situations. It has some built-in limitations.
It requires extraordinary effort on the part of all project members throughout the span of the development process. Sometimes, team members record monthly overtime of 100 hours during the peak and 60 hours during the rest of the project.
It may not apply to breakthrough projects that require a revolutionary innovation. This limitation may be particularly true in biotechnology or chemistry.
It may not apply to mammoth projects like those in the aerospace business, where the sheer project scale limits extensive face-to-face discussions.
It may not apply to organizations where product development is masterminded by a genius who makes the invention and hands down a well-defined set of specifications for people below to follow.
Why should you take rugby 
One of the charms of the Rugby game is the infinite variety of its possible tactics. Whatever tactics a team aims to adopt, the first essential is a strong and skillful pack of forwards capable of winning initial possession from the set pieces.
For, with the ball in its hands, a team is in a position to dictate tactics which will make the best use of its own particular talents, at the same time probing for and exposing weaknesses in the opposing team.
The ideal team has fast and clever half-backs and three-quarters who, with running, passing, and shrewd kicking, will make sure that the possession won by the forwards is employed to the maximum embarrassment of the opposing team.

Imposition of death penalty: EU, Norway, Canada latest to join outcry
The European Union (EU), Norway and Canada have joined the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) in opposing the decision to implement the death penalty.
The delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka, in agreement with the EU Heads of Missions, the High Commissioner of Canada, and the Ambassador of Norway, has written a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the issue.

In a statement, the EU said that the letter was written to verify the worrying information in the public domain about the intention of the Sri Lankan government to resume implementing the death penalty after a moratorium of more than 40 years.
The death penalty is incompatible with human dignity, does not have any proven deterrent effect, and allows judicial errors to become fatal and irreversible, the statement said.
This comes on the heels of the Human Rights Commissions letter to President Maithripala Sirisena, urging him to reconsider imposing the death penalty. Speaking to the Daily News, Dr. Deepika Udagama, Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, was adamant that nowhere in the world the death penalty works as a deterrent for crime. Even in the U.S., the federal states that retain the death penalty still have very high crime rates as opposed to states that have abolished it.
There is an appearance of being effective, but our position is that as a democratic society, we should look at crime prevention and crime control in a deeper way. We should look at the root causes rather than trying to treat the symptom, argued Udagama.
The Human Rights Commission has listed numerous national and international resolutions opposing capital punishment: the UNs calls to issue a moratorium on the death penaltyArticle 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Second Option Protocol adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989as well as Sri Lankas Supreme Court decision that Article 11 of the Constitution prohibits torture and inhumane treatment or punishment, and the precedence of Sri Lankas previous governments of not implementing the death penalty.
The Commissions views have been conveyed to President Sirisena in another letter from January 2016, in which they stated, There is no empirical data, to show that the death penalty has caused a reduction in crime or has a deterrent effect on crime.
In its January 2016 letter, the Commission points out that Sri Lankas criminal justice system does not have a process that permits criminal cases from being reopened after appeals are exhausted, creating a serious risk of a miscarriage of justice. Although due process in criminal proceedings are guaranteed by the Constitution and statutory law, there is always the possibility of human error distorting the final outcome.
The previous letter highlighted one instance of prosecutorial misconduct in Sri Lanka, Wijepala v Attorney General (2001) 1 SLR 42. In that case, the Supreme Court found that insufficient evidence led to the appellants conviction: The evidence of Senaratne who was the sole eyewitness to the incident is open to suspicion. The trial judge had failed to appreciate that his evidence in regard to the identity of the appellant has not been supported by any other item of evidence. Additionally, the Commission pointed to the possibility that economics plays a role in the justice system, where underprivileged people have limited means to hire competent or experienced defence counsels.
With the government battling to eradicate a growing narcotics problem, President Sirisena said recently that he would sign required orders to execute capital punishment for convicted drug traffickers who carry out large scale drug smuggling operations while in detention.

Incredible martian-like acid pools
These incredible pictures may look like stills from some bizarre space-themed film, but they actually show a landscape much nearer to home. These are pools of brightly coloured acid, deep in the heart of the Danakil Desert in East Africa.
Theyve been taken by Israeli photographer Neta Dekel, who says that the pools are one of the most extraordinary sights hes ever seen.
The acid pools were something out of this world, he says.
The acid is extremely dangerous since a drop of it can burn your flesh to the bone, and there were no trails or barricades that can protect the visitors.
The pools lie close to the Erta Ale volcano and are surrounded by volcanic ash. And apparently, they stink to high heaven.
The smell was horrible and it was difficult to breathe, Neta explains.
The Danakil Desert stretches over 100,000 square kilometres across three different countries  northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Dijoubti.
With live volcanos and blistering heat, its one of the hottest places on earth, with daytime temperatures often going above 50C.

Re-imposition of liquor ban on women
Interim Order seeking suspension fixed for support on Oct. 4
Four Fundamental Rights petitions filed by several social activists including popular actress Samanalee Fonseka seeking an Interim Order to suspend the re-imposition of the liquor ban on women by the Gazette Notification dated January 18, 2018 was yesterday fixed for support on October 4 by the Supreme Court.
The petitioners had also sought a declaration that the Ministry of Finance or the State are not entitled in law to revoke the Excise Notification in a manner which prevents female persons from lawfully being employed at a place of production and sale of liquor.
The petitioners cited Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera, Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and Attorney General as respondents.
The Petitioners state that by Excise Notification No.02/2018 dated January 10, 2018, the Minister of Finance has inter alia revised the Excise Notification No.666 by inter alia repealing paragraphs 5(v) and 11(c) of the said Excise Notification No.666.
The petitioners said Paragraph 11(c) indicates - Persons to whom Liquor is not to be sold or given - No liquor shall be sold or given.. (c) to a woman within the premises of a tavern
The Petitioners state that this prohibition was a draconian measure that was arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable and discriminatory of female citizens of the Republic.
The Petitioners state they were reliably informed that at a media briefing, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Mahinda Samarasinghe has declared that at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers ostensibly held on January 16, 2016 the Cabinet of Ministers has purportedly decided to revoke the recent gazette allowing women to purchase alcohol which the Petitioners verily believe refers to the said Excise Notification.
The Petitioners state that the above circumstances gives rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the Petitioners right to equality and equal protection of the law guaranteed to them by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution in as much as-
(a) Any revocation of the said Excise Notification would be unreasonable.
(b) Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who have attained the requisite age specified by Law from being lawfully employed at places of production and sale of liquor.
(c) Any such measure would deprive the members of the female gender who has attained the requisite age specified by Law from lawfully purchasing liquor which is a legal product that can only be manufactured, distributed and sold with the express regulation and control of the State.
(d) An imposition of a prohibition applicable to members of only one gender would be tantamount to unequal treatment of the members of such gender.
The Petitioners state that the above circumstances gives rise to a reasonable apprehension regarding an imminent infringement of the Petitioners right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of their sex guaranteed to them by Article 12(2) of the Constitution.
Counsel Viran Corea with Thisya Weragoda and Thamali Dinushi Perera appeared for the petitioners. Additional Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Mattala will not be sold: Deputy Minister
Deputy Transport Minister Ashok Abeysinghe yesterday assured that the Mattala Airport would never be sold and it will function as a joint venture between the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of Sri Lanka and the Airports Authority of India (AAI).
Addressing the media at Sirikotha, the Deputy Minister said the agreement in this regard is scheduled to be presented to the Cabinet in the near future. After that, the agreement will also be presented in Parliament for ratification.
The government invited prospective investors to transform the loss making airport into a profit-making joint venture. But no such proposal was received. Finally, the AAI agreed to operate the Mattala Airport as a joint venture.
The Mattala Airport was constructed with an investment of 252 million US dollars which was made out of a 190 million US dollar loan from the China Exim Bank and China Harbour Engineering Company spending approximately 40 million US dollars and the Lankan government spending 22 million US dollars for the project. The Deputy Minister said the Chief Valuer has estimated the current value of the MIA as 320 million US dollars.
The monthly average income of the Mattala Airport stands at only Rs. 6.5 million against an average monthly expenditure of Rs.290 million.
He further said the airport has to pay debt servicing of Rs 1.7 billion per a year and the government has already paid three installments for 2015 to 2018 using funds generated from the Katunayake International Airport.
The joint venture with the Indian party would be a win-win situation for both parties because the profits as well as the losses will be borne by the parties at a ratio of 70 to 30, he added.

He said that there may be some individuals in society that join various organizations for such reasons. The Minister stressed that this does not in any way diminish the noble charitable work which has been and continues to be done by these organization throughout the country.
The full statement:
In response to a question on the restoration of Capital Punishment for drug dealers at a press conference last week, while reiterating my opposition to Capital Punishment, I said that certain individuals connected to the drug trade try to cover their sins by being benefactors of society, holding high positions in various organizations or as philanthropists in religious organizations. Inadvertently, I also mentioned Rotarians and Lions Clubs, which I deeply regret.
There may be some individuals in society that join various organizations for such reasons. However, I fully recognize and acknowledge that this does not,in anyway, diminish the noble charitable work which has been,and continues to be done by these Organizations throughout the country, especially for the poor, needy, destitute and the vulnerable.
I understand that my comments would have resulted in causing pain of mind to many. To all of them, I express my sincere apologies.

Minister urges public servants to give back to country
The yahapalana government increased the salaries of the public servants by Rs 10,000 and public servants should assess whether their productivity has increased in return, said Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera yesterday.
He said that there has been a flaw in that the country which was second to Japan in the region at the time of independence where per capita income was concerned, has dropped its position pathetically. There are many protests staged in the country causing inconveniences to the public. It was not the case in other countries like Japan where the people worked hard to uplift the countrys economy since World War II.
He made these observations at the launching of the Productivity Promotion Guide at the Employees Trust Fund Department auditorium in Narahenpita.
He said that the people protested against SAITM even after the issue was solved. His personal view was that the country should have private universities.
The Minister said a political party used a chit in the 1988-1989 period to close public offices. Why cant they use all these forces to uplift the public service, economy and develop the country
Minister Samaraweera said that five institutions which were under his Ministry in 2001 are now five separate ministries. Thats no problem, but the productivity should be increased.
He also said that paying the pension after 25 years could be a problem, due to the increasing ageing population. This issue should be addressed, but some do not allow the solving of such issues. They stage protests.
The Minister said further that the Japanese government was ready to develop the Railway service in Sri Lanka. But according to their law, they could do it if the Railways is an institution and not a department. So we attempted to make it an authority, Minister Samaraweera said. But some protested against it. The issue is some people cannot stand to see the country being developed. That is their hypocrisy.
The Minister said further that it is important that the public service improves its customer satisfaction levels. There should be a mechanism to achieve this target.
Public administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Employees Trust Fund Department Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mahinda Madihewa and National Productivity Secretariat Director Suranga Gunaratne also participated in the event.

Ministry procedures to be streamlined: Duminda
The present procedures of the Disaster Management Ministry would be streamlined in order to execute a wider range of services to disaster victims, Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said recently.
Referring to the reforms intended to be introduced, the minister told the Daily News that the public had complained that the Disaster Management Ministry had so far only been functioning to address disasters when they struck, and had not taken the necessary steps to prevent them from occurring.
So far, affected persons had only been transported to emergency shelters. Under the second phase of traditional disaster relief services, housing compensations as well as gratuities for buying kitchen utensils are provided, leaving the victims satisfied only until the next disaster occurs, he said, adding that the said practice would be done away with.
Dissanayake said that the Disaster Management Ministry would aim to carry out anticipatory preparations in order to prevent or minimise the damage caused by disasters, adding that top-priority would be given to establish an information centre at which such improvements could be made to thwart any disaster.
It would include the evacuation of encroachers through provisions of alternative living facilities, broadening narrow culverts and minor bridges as well as the construction of new culverts and bridges, aside from educating those who live in areas prone to disaster, he said, adding that it seemed that the mentality of the majority of disaster officials was that their duty was only to offer relief.
They have not been properly trained or briefed about disaster-prevention. Under these circumstances, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) would have to be amalgamated to strengthen disaster-management services, Dissanayake said. He said that as an example, if 10,000 persons were at a temporary camp during the next disaster, with proper information-gathering and execution, that number could be halved if another disaster were to occur in the future.
The minister said that the lack of cooperation and coordination between the Disaster Management Ministry and its stakeholders had been a hindrance in the minimisation and prevention of disasters.
Healthcare services, insurance agencies and banks as well as irrigation, land, housing and social service bodies and divisional secretaries were required to work together, which was at present, not being practiced to a satisfactory level, he said, adding that officials should always be vigilant, while maintaining close ties with people living in disaster zones.

Pakistan beat Zimbabwe by  nine wickets in second ODI
Bulawayo, Monday: Pakistan continued their dominance with both bat and ball to win the second of five one-day internationals against Zimbabwe by nine wickets.
Opener Fakhar Zaman eased to his second ODI century, finishing with a career best 117 not out, to seal a win that had been set up by Pakistans seam attack, who bowled Zimbabwe out for 194.
Usman Khan took four wickets and Hasan Ali chipped in with 3 for 32 to bowl the hosts out, Pakistans top order batsmen then capping a commanding performance.
Zimbabwe won the toss and opted to bat first on another cold morning in Bulawayo, They were put under immediate pressure by Pakistans new ball attack, and in particular Khan. He had both openers caught behind in his first spell. Zimbabwe briefly rallied during a 62-run partnership between Masakadza and Tarisai Musakanda. but that was their best stand.
After Khan took two wickets with consecutive deliveries in the 44th over, the hosts were 166 for 7 and sinking fast.
Moor cobbled together stands with the lower order to keep his side ticking along, and brought up a third ODI fifty in the 48th over. But after he fell attempting to up the run rate, Pakistan made short work of Zimbabwes tail to bowl the hosts out four balls short of a completed fifty overs.
Zimbabwe could not match Pakistans precision and menace with the ball and openers Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq took 54 from the powerplay without ever giving more than a half chance to the fielders. The pair took their opening stand to 119 before ul-Haq was run out, against the run of play, for 44.
At the other end, Zaman raced past a run-a-ball fifty untroubled by the Zimbabwean attack and reached three figures in the 32nd over.
With Babar Azam for company, he quickly knocked off the runs required for victory, sending Pakistan 2-0 up in the series.

Paris renames metro stations to honour  WC stars
Paris, Monday: Six Paris metro stations were temporarily renamed in honour of Frances World Cup winning champions after their 4-2 rollercoaster victory against Croatia.
Among the changes, station Victor Hugo became Victor Hugo Lloris, named after the teams captain and goalkeeper, whose second half mistake gave Croatia faint hopes of a late comeback.
The metro stop at Bercy has become Bercy les Bleus, a play on words to thank the team. The station Avron has taken the name Nous Avron Gagne, a play on the French to mean We have won.
Charles de Gaulle-Etoile was turned into On a 2 Etoiles, meaning We have two stars -- referring to the countrys first World Cup win on home soil in 1998 and last nights victory in Russia.
Notre-Dame des Champs has become Notre Didier Deschamps, while Champs-Elysees- Clemenceau has been changed to Deschamps Elysees-Clemenceau -- both stations pay tribute to the teams coach Didier Deschamps, who was also a midfielder in the 1998 side.
The changes represent winks to the team, Paris transport operator RATP said Monday.
It said the squad will use an open top double-decker electric bus to greet fans between the Place de lEtoile, site of the Arc de Triomphe, and the Elysee Palace.
The players are expected to land at Roissy Airport on Monday afternoon and will be taken directly to the celebrations before being received by President Emmanuel Macron.

Politics in the drug war
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is today shedding copious tears over the drug menace that has gripped society and the danger posed to the younger generation due to the governments inability to stem the tide. Speaking to journalists at Abhayaramaya, Rajapaksa said that today even an innocent child is not in a position to walk the streets without being a victim of the rapid spread of drugs in the country. He said the same accusations leveled in the North against the government over its inability to control the drug situation is being leveled in the South too and this call needed to be heeded in all seriousness. Then comes the piece de resistance.
The former President says, during his time, the drug business was not widespread nor established like today and that currently large drug hauls are being seized from all over the country.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Narcotic drugs would not have reached the villages if law and order was properly administered in the country before 2015. Whenever a suspect in possession of drugs was arrested in a raid, politicians at that time spoke over the phone and ordered the release of the suspect, the Premier said. Drug racketeering and sexual abuse of women were considered as qualifications to become a Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman then, he noted. But since 2015 we have issued strict orders to the police to act firmly to combat drug trafficking and racketeering, he observed, addressing a meeting after opening a newly built auditorium at Ibbagamuwa, over the weekend.
The PM went onto state that the government decided to break the drug supply chain because once it is done, there won't be any drugs available for distribution. Two things happen when there is a shortage in supplies. One is the increase in price due to short supply and the second is the decrease in supplies resulting clashes among distributors. He attributed the frequency of the clashes among distributors that is being witnessed today to this phenomenon, making it easier for the police to apprehend the kingpins.
Be that as it may, Mahinda Rajapaksa is the last person who can claim to have taken stringent measures to control the drug mafia, during his time. The drug trade flourished in leaps and bounds during his tenure and like the Prime Minister stated, Chairmen of the Pradeshiya Sabhas owed their appointments to being notorious drug peddlers. This was borne out by the fact that the former President visited the home of a slain Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman in the South to pay his respects. Needless to say the killing was a result of a drug war between rival traffickers. Nay, the Monitoring MP for the Ministry of Defence, no less, was a well known drug baron who openly plied his trade even using state vehicles of his ministry for this purpose. This politico, who crossed over to the Rajapaksa camp from the UNP, had a rape a case against him, pending in the Attorney General's Department, withdrawn, pronto, and assigned to an electorate in the Colombo district which was soon to become a drug haven, that eventually led to the murder of a Presidential Advisor, no less, on the day of the local government elections in 2013.
That Rajapaksa paid only lip service to combat the drug menace was also borne out when he lost no time in going to the rescue of a notorious drug dealer politician from Negombo in whose home a large quantity of drugs was seized by the STF. One could still recall Rajapaksa, donned in a track suit, alighting from the Chopper, making his way to the home of the besieged politician accompanied by the supporters of the latter, as shown on television. Needless to say the STF Officers who made the detection received transfer orders for their trouble.
To be fair, all governments prior to 2005, (when MR first became President), failed to take adequate measures to deal with the drug menace. During the time of the late President Premadasa there was a story doing the rounds of a government minister paying his last respects to the well known drug kingpin Kudu Raja, in Slave Island, who was killed in a drug related incident. That ex-minister is today still an MP and a prominent member of the Joint Opposition. Nay, an Inspector General of Police, no less, was seen at a birthday bash thrown by a drug lord at a five star hotel in Colombo, as was prominently reported in the vernacular media, at the time.
Hopefully, all political leaders will make amends for their lapses in allowing the drug situation to grow to the current proportions and take concrete measures to eradicate the menace. The Police and the security forces, that are due to assist it in the war against drugs, should be given a free hand in this respect. Politicians, of all hues, should also desist from attempting to score political points with the drugs problem which is a cancer affecting the entire society. The various anti-drugs programmes that are currently being launched from school level under the guidance of the President, should be expanded and given full impetus to succeed.

Proposals to transform lives of children,  and drive Sri Lankas economic growth
Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Mangala Samaraweera yesterday, reiterated that the government is committed to create an economy where citizens are able to take their economic destiny into their own hands without relying on state benefits or handouts from cradle to the grave.
The government is committed to increasing and enhancing education policy and the commitment is reflected in two main initiatives; the 13 years of education program and the budget proposals for a public private partnership model for child care facilities, the Minister noted.
The Minister made these views at the Sri Lanka Early Childhood Development (ECD) High Level Meeting under the theme, Building Brains, Building Futures in Colombo yesterday. Speaking further he said, The 13 years of education program aims at adopting proper school curriculum system to enhance the different types of skills children have and also to adequately respond to the needs of the labor market.
Accordingly he said, it is important to modify the school curriculum to enhance technical skills of children as well as to better exploit their full potential.
In that sense, ECD is a perfect complement to really achieve the proposed goals in the education front.
As Sri Lanka positions itself as a highly competitive knowledge based economy, robust development in early childhood stage becomes essential. By preparing children from young age, ECD enhances school readiness, increase childrens retention rates and help them achieve better results.
He said child care facilities will be the first step in promoting the quality services for the early childhood stage and the initiative also has a gender empowerment component as the government intends to fully facilitate women to re-join the labor force sooner post childbirth. This is particularly important for Sri Lanka where female labour force participation is only 34%.
Several decades of extensive state investment in education has yielded successful results in terms of successful education and increased university literacy, the Minister said adding that there is much more that need to be done to keep up with global education standards.
The Minister also reiterated the governments commitment to invest in education sector with renewed focus on early childhood development.
The government has also increased the money invested in education as a percentage of GDP from 1.46% in 2015 to nearly 3.5% in 2017 and the objectives is to raise this to 6% by 2025, the Minister noted.
In line with the event, ECD centric budget proposals were presented to Minister Samaraweera, for his consideration in the 2019 National Budget.
The budget proposals, focused on Health and Nutrition, Protection and Early Childhood Education were presented by the Ministries of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Women and Child Affairs and Education, to the Minister.
The Minister also assured that many of the proposals submitted to him will be considered carefully and included in this years budget and also noted that the government will commit necessary resources to support such programs.

Raw material shortage forces matchstick producers to put up shutters
local matchstick factories have put up shutters due to a shortage of potassium chloride and red phosphorus needed as raw material for matchstick production. The closure of factories has thrown nearly 800 workers out of employment.
This was disclosed by a delegation of the Sri Lanka Matchbox Producers Association and the All Ceylon Matchbox Industrialists Association, which called on the Malwatte Mahanayake Thera Most Venerable Thibottuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera in Kandy to apprise him about their problems, yesterday.
Speaking to the media after meeting the prelate, representative of the Sri Lanka Matchbox Producers Association Dhammika Walisundara said the country may encounter a severe shortage of matchsticks next month as a result of the closure of these factories. He said this crisis occurred due to the stoppage of potassium chloride and red phosphorus imports a few months ago. Non-import of this vital raw material forced match factories which were nearly 30 years old, to close down.
He said due to this crisis, with depleting stocks, there is a possibility that the price of a box of matches would rise to Rs. 100 in the near future.

Reaching the worlds top ten
Elizabeth Moir School students have been offered places at six of the worlds Top Ten universities. This includes the current top three in The Times Higher Education World University Rankings  Oxford, Cambridge and Stanford  as well as UPenn, Imperial and UCL. Other students have won scholarships to Cornell, another Ivy League college, and NYU Abu Dhabi, each worth over Rs. 10 million per year.
It is immensely rewarding for educators to be able to find financial assistance for students who would otherwise not be able to get the opportunities their talent and hard work deserves, says Head of School Elizabeth Moir.
I was recently told by a university admissions officer that many of the applications and essays from Sri Lanka are similar in theme, style and content. We encourage our students to avoid clichs and to stand out even if it means taking a risk or two, because the competition for places at top universities is so stiff. In addition, our past students are willing and able to assist our current students. They encourage them to grab any opportunity they can to challenge themselves to grow as people and applicants.
Last year, a team of Moir students represented Sri Lanka in the inaugural First Global Robotics Olympiad in Washington, D.C. This may have helped the students applications stand out over others with top academic results. Team member and Moir Head Prefect Akash Gnanam won a place on Stanfords renowned Computer Science course, Vinidu Jayasekera will be studying Computer Science at Ivy League UPenn, and Ishini Gammanpila, has been awarded a 90 percent scholarship at Cornell.
The schools other Head Prefect, Aanya Gunawansa, who achieved 11 A* grades in her IGCSE examinations and won the World Prize for English Language, has been offered a place to study Veterinary Science at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. Anjali Attygalle will read Chemistry at Magdalen College, Oxford.
Two students have been offered coveted places to study Medicine in the UK. Arshad Dahlan has been offered a place at Cardiff and Naveen Kulasingha at Queens University Belfast. Both epitomise the all-round ability that medical courses look for: Naveen is both one the stars of the schools football team and a brilliant violinist, with an A in A Level Music to accompany his 10 A* grades at IGCSE, while Arshad is President of the Debating Club.
Many students face tough choices. Arpana Giritharan had to reject Imperial College London in order to accept an offer from UCL to read Human Sciences. Amjad Hamza also has to choose between two Top Ten universities, UCL and UPenn, to read Politics, Philosophy and Economics; while Maya Weerasinghe has a choice between New York University and UCL to read Economics.
Many top US universities now have branches in Asia. Tripti Mathews was offered a place at Yale-NUS while Asel Kularatne has become the schools 10th student to be offered a full scholarship at NYU, Abu Dhabi in the past seven years.

According to reports, the makers have been discussing the project with the star for quite some time now. However, it was finalised only after Race 3s release.
Dhoom 4 will, reportedly, be helmed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has helmed the previous Dhoom films and is currently busy shooting Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan starrer Thugs Of Hindostan. There is also speculation that Ranveer Singh will also come on board the project.
An insider also stated that Katrina Kaif has been approached to play the female lead in Dhoom 4. If Katrina and Salman come together in the fourth installment of Dhoom, it will be their sixth film together.
Lets wait and watch when the makers will finally announce the cast of Dhoom 4. TNN

Off to a scorching start
An annual chili pepper festival kicked off last week in central Chinas spice-loving Hunan province with a chili-eating contest in which the winner set a blistering pace by downing a gut-busting 50 peppers in just over a minute.
Local boy Tang Shuaihui took home a 3-gramme 24-karat gold coin for winning the competition, which is put on by a local theme park in the county of Ningxiang and now in its second year.
With doctors on hand just in case, ten contestants each held plates heaped with 50 Tabasco chili peppers, racing to be the first to finish off the red-hot fruits.
Tang cleared his plate in just 68 seconds in a contest held in nearly sweltering temperatures weather and as competitors sat in a shallow pool filled with water and three tonnes of floating chilis.
He finished them at an amazing speed, barely after the emcee had finished speaking, said Sun Minying, an employee at the theme park, called the Tanhe Ancient City.
The Tabasco pepper has a rank of 30,000-50,000 on the Scoville Heat Scale that measures the piquancy of chilis, which puts it somewhere between a jalapeno and a habanero. The peppers bobbing in the pool, however, were of a far weaker variety, partly to avoid irritating the contestants skin. Hunan cuisine is marked by its fiery peppers and richly coloured dishes and is considered among Chinas eight great food traditions along with Sichuan, Cantonese and other cuisines. The festival lasts until the end of August, with a fresh chili-eating contest held daily. AFP

Second cancer surgery for NZ great Hadlee
WELLINGTON, Sunday - New Zealand bowling great Richard Hadlee is to undergo another operation after tests showed a secondary cancer was found in his liver, his wife said on Monday.
The 67-year-old Hadlee had surgery last month for bowel cancer.
This week, Richard will undergo further surgery after secondary cancer was discovered in his liver, his wife Dianne said in a statement issued by New Zealand Cricket. Medical advice is that its still at a very early stage and is operable.
Once he has recovered from the operation, Richard will undergo further chemotherapy treatment. Hadlee, who is considered one of the finest fast bowlers of all time having retired in 1990 with 431 test wickets, had the first surgery after a routine checkup discovered the tumour.
He was the first player to take 400 test wickets and held the record for most wickets until Indias Kapil Dev surpassed it in 1994. - Agencies

The Sri Lanka IBF Industry Conference (SLIBFI X) will be held for the 10th consecutive year on July 18, 2018 at the Ramada Colombo Hotel.
The 10th installment of any event evokes many a sentiment, ranging from a sense of nostalgia to a feeling of accomplishment in being an integral part of a key industry event that encapsulates the various stakeholders at a single forum and in an unbroken sequence straddling a decade. Whilst challenges abound, it is heartening to note that the industry continues to attract new players.
The robust performance of some of the players that entered the industry over the past few years is a significant contributory factor to attracting new players, thus enhancing the lustre of an industry that has undoubtedly captured the attention of nearly all the institutions that constitute the financial industry in Sri Lanka, not just from Banking but also from the NBFI, Insurance and Capital Markets segments.
Aptly titled SLIBFI X, given the 10th anniversary of the event, the Conference will focus primarily on an aspect that seem to have been forgotten in an era of phenomenal growth of the overall industry; Creating an impact on Society.
The Conference Plenary Sessions will include a CEO Roundtable, a presentation on Takaful as well as a discussion on Cryptocurrencies but the overriding theme would be Social Impact Investing.In fact, a new venture to focus on assisting the lesser fortunate is expected to be announced during the course of the day.
Post-Lunch, the Technical Sessions, hosted by Adl Capital Ltd, will cover Islamic Credit Cards, Wakalah, Islamic Overdrafts and the Impact on the New Tax Laws on the IBF industry.
The speakers at the various sessions will straddle many facets of the IBF Industry.
The keynote address will be delivered by Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner, KPMG whilst the CEO panel will include Mohamed Azmeer of Amana Bank, Fazal Ghaffoor of Amana Takaful, Krishan Thilakaratne, of Commercial Leasing & Finance & Ishrat Rauff of Adl Capital.

SLTB launches e-ticketing for long-distance travel from Pettah
Anyone who has a telephone or computer with internet facilities can now use the SLTB Express app from home to buy a ticket for an SLTB long-distance bus starting from the Pettah Central Bus Stand. Commuters can also use this facility to reserve a seat of their choice, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said.
The Minister said this at a ceremony at the Pettah Central Bus Station to introduce the SLTB Express app yesterday.
Minister de Silva said this new app would streamline the buying of tickets in SLTB long-distance buses without any hassle to commuters. Now anyone could buy a ticket from his or her home or office by using this app, without wasting time in queues or seeking the assistance of brokers.
The Minister said the SLTB had decided to introduce this technology to help commuters to save their time. This system would also help the SLTB to minimise administrative expenses involved in maintaining ticket counters.
He said the SLTB had prepared this data network in collaboration with Express 418, a private company. A commuter who has made the booking could obtain his or her seat by showing the reservation on the mobile phone to the conductor. The commuter would also be issued an e-ticket.
Under the second stage of this programme, this e-ticketing facility would be available for long-distance buses operating between main outstation towns too. A commuter using this facility would be required to pay an additional sum of Rs. 80 apart from the usual fare.
Minister de Silva said the private transport sector too could implement this technology through the National Transport Commission.
He said the SLTB has now been transformed into a profit-making concern. Steps should be taken to bring conductors engaged in ticket fraud to book.
Steps would be taken to fix global positioning systems on all SLTB buses before the end of this year. The SLTB needed the services of disciplined bus drivers and conductors. Today, the SLTB had succeeded in minimising bus accidents so that a majority of commuters preferred to travel in SLTB buses, the Minister said.

The three were charged by the ICC Chief Executive David Richardson on 19 June and had pleaded guilty to breaching Level 3, Article 2.3.1, which relates to conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game, during last months St Lucia Test against the West Indies.
The Chairman of the ICC Code of Conduct Commission had held a hearing over videoconference on Wednesday, 11 July, to determine the sanction, and, after more than six hours of hearing, which was attended by legal counsels of both the sides, had reserved his decision.
During the hearing, however, it was mutually agreed that, since the minimum sanction for a Level 3 offence was suspension from two Tests, the three will not participate in the Galle Test (played from 12-14 July) and Colombo Test (to be played from 20-24 July), and these will be credited against the sanction imposed by the Judicial Commissioner.
As eight suspension points equate to a ban from two Tests and four ODIs/T20Is or eight ODIs/T20Is, whatever comes first for the player or player support personnel, the Judicial Commissioners ruling means the three will also remain suspended for the Dambulla ODIs (29 July and 1 August) as well as the Kandy ODIs (5 and 8 August).
Furthermore, six demerit points each have been added to the disciplinary records of Chandimal, Hathurusingha and Gurusinha.
While these are first offences for Hathurusingha and Gurusinha, this is the second time Chandimal has been sanctioned since the introduction of the revised Code in September 2016. Chandimal received four demerit points for breaching Article 2.2.9 in the same Test, and, therefore, he now has 10 demerit points against his name.
All Level 3 breaches carry an imposition of between four and eight suspension points.
NOTES
*Any suspension imposed for crossing the demerit point threshold will run concurrently with the suspension points and therefore the trio will not face any additional suspensions
*The suspension for Chandimal means he can neither be nominated as a substitute fielder nor can he enter any part of the playing area although he will be permitted to enter the players dressing room (providing it does not form part of the playing area)
*The suspension for Hathurusingha and Gurusinha means they will be barred from entering the players dressing room and attending post-match ceremonies and presentations
*If Chandimal reaches 12 or more demerit points within a 24-month period, he will be suspended from either three Tests or 6 ODIs/T20Is or a combination thereof, whatever comes first for him
*The three had been charged by the ICC Chief Executive David Richardson on 19 June for their involvement in the Sri Lanka teams refusal to take the field at the start of the third days play. This action was alleged to be a serious breach of the Laws of Cricket and contrary to the spirit of the game.

This summers blockbuster movie Skyscraper centres around a fictional megatall tower that is intended to be as realistic as possible, according to architect Adrian Smith, who was consulted during its development.
Drama in the action-adventure film revolves around an imaginary 240-storey skyscraper in Hong Kong, called The Pearl, which catches on fire.
The movies director Rawson Marshall Thurber wanted to make the building believable, so enlisted Chicago-based Smith  whose firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture is behind some of the worlds tallest structures  to advise on the project during the writing process.
Fictional skyscrapers in theory have no limits and can be designed using systems and materials that do not currently exist, Smith told Dezeen. This was not the case with the skyscraper in the movie since the producer wanted this to be a tower based on real possibilities.
Smiths portfolio of skyscrapers includes the 828-metre-tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which currently holds the title of worlds tallest tower. This is set to be surpassed by his firms Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, which is under construction and set to rise over 1,000 metres once complete.
To help Skyscrapers director and writers, Smith provided information about these projects and others for them to reference when creating the story around The Pearl.

TRUMP, PUTIN VOW TO RESET TIES AT SUMMIT
FINLAND: Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held an historic summit on Monday vowing their determination to forge a reset of troubled relations between the worlds greatest nuclear powers.
Trump, bent on forging a personal bond with the Kremlin chief despite allegations of Russian meddling in US politics, went into the summit blaming stupidity by his predecessors for plunging ties to their present low.
Looking sombre, the two leaders exchanged a few opening remarks in front of the press at the start of their summit in Helsinki.
Putin, basking in congratulations from Trump and other world leaders for the successful staging of the World Cup in Russia, said: The time has come to talk in a substantive way about our relations and problem areas of the world. Before the two leaders went into a first session between just themselves and their interpreters, Trump said the summit would cover everything from trade to military to missiles to nuclear to China.
Frankly, we have not been getting along for the last number of years. And I really think the world wants to see us get along. We are the two great nuclear powers, he said.
Ive not been here too long (as President), its getting close to two years, but well be having an extraordinary relationship, I hope so. Shortly before the summit opened, Trump was asked if he would press Putin over Russias alleged manipulation of the 2016 election that brought the mercurial property tycoon to power. He said only: Well do just fine. Many US critics had called for the summits cancellation after new revelations surrounding the alleged election meddling.
But Trump has insisted it is a good thing to meet, as he attempts to replicate with Putin the sort of personal rapport he proclaims with the autocratic leaders of China and North Korea.
If the pair do find common ground, the summit may take the heat out of some of the worlds most dangerous conflicts, including Syria.
But there are many points of friction that could yet spoil Trumps hoped-for friendship with the former KGB spymaster.
Trump began the day by firing a Twitter broadside at his domestic opponents, blaming the diplomatic chill on the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling.
Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of US foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! Trump tweeted.
Russias foreign ministry tweeted in response: We agree. Trumps US opponents tried, in turn, to gain traction for the hashtag #BAF (Blame America First).
After a stormy NATO summit in Brussels last week, Trump was accused by critics of cosying up to Putin while undermining the transatlantic alliance.
But over breakfast with Finlands President Sauli Niinisto, he insisted NATO has never been stronger and never been more together thanks to his insistence on all allies paying their fair share.
Trump, a brash 72-year-old billionaire, has been President for 18 months while Putin, 65, has run Russia for the past 18 years. In a weekend interview with CBS News, Trump admitted that Russia remains a foe, but he put Moscow on a par with China and the European Union as economic and diplomatic rivals.
The Kremlin has also played down hopes that the odd couple will emerge from their first formal one-on-one summit with a breakthrough.
On Friday Putins adviser Yuri Ushakov said: The state of bilateral relations is very bad.... We have to start to set them right. Indeed, after the bad-tempered NATO summit and a contentious trip by Trump to Britain, anxious European leaders may be relieved if not much comes out of the Helsinki meeting.
Those leaders are already fuming over Trumps imposition of trade tariffs on various countries, including Russia.
Turning the tables, European Union President Donald Tusk said Trump was guilty of spreading fake news with his remark about foes, and warned that the trade tensions could spiral into violent conflict and chaos.
Europe and China, America and Russia, today in Beijing and in Helsinki, are jointly responsible for improving the world order, not for destroying it, he tweeted.
I hope this message reaches Helsinki. Protesters have been on the streets of Helsinki to denounce the policies of both Trump and Putin. Greenpeace draped a giant banner down a church tower urging: Warm our hearts not our planet.
Trump is also under pressure from Britain to press Putin over the nerve agent poisoning of four people in southern England.
One of the victims, Dawn Sturgess, has died and her 19-year-old son Ewan Hope told the Sunday Mirror newspaper: We need to get justice for my mum. Many fear that Trump -- in his eagerness to prove he was right to seek the summit despite US political opposition -- may give up too much ground.
Trump has refused to personally commit to the US refusal to recognise Russias annexation of Crimea, leaving open the possibility of a climbdown linked to a promise by Putin to somehow rein in Iranian influence in Syria.
If Washington were to acquiesce in Russias 2014 land-grab, this would break with decades of US policy and send tremors through NATOs exposed eastern flank. And there will be outrage at home if Trump does not confront Putin over the election scandal.
But the US leader would not say whether he would demand the extradition of 12 Russian intelligence officers who were indicted last week by US special prosecutor Robert Mueller.

Two people dead  in Paris violence
Two French football fans have died as violence erupted across the county following Les Bleuss World Cup victory over Croatia.
After the team celebrated their second ever World Cup win in Moscow, there were jubilant scene across France.
In Moscow, Emmanuel Macron was memorably pictured leaping onto a gantry to wildly celebrate a goal in a break from the usual presidential reserve.
But back at home, the joy turned to violence in several areas.
A total of 292 people were placed in custody across France, the Interior Ministry revealed.
The most violent disturbances took place in Paris on Sunday, where 102 people were arrested, and 92 taken to cells.
Michel Delpuech, the Paris Prefect, said: Given the crowd present and despite unacceptable disorder, we have record a measured balance sheet.
Some of the worst scenes were in central Paris, where celebrations turned into widespread rioting, looting and ugly clashes with cops.
French police fired tear gas and dispersed crowds from the Champs Elysees late yesterday following the 4-2 triumph in Moscow.
Meanwhile, in nearby Saint-Felix, a man in his 30s was killed when his car crashed into a tree as he celebrated his teams win.
Such accidents were accompanied by baton charges by CRS riot squads, as officers desperately tried to keep crowds in order.
Rioting broke out soon after midnight as large crowds refused to disperse, a police source in Paris said.
Shops including the Publicis Drugstore close to the Arc de Triomphe were ransacked. Windows were smashed and officers who intervened were attacked.
There have been scenes of absolute chaos that have spoiled the party.
Millions of French fans had taken to the streets in joy after the final whistle, with thousands gathering along the Champs Elysees. Even President Emmanuel Macron had been earlier seen punching the air at Luzhniki Stadium as his countrys team scored a goal. But as the evening wore on, a small number of fans clashed with police, damaging some businesses and properties along the avenue. Some threw stones and other projectiles at riot officers. And in response, tear gas was deployed.

When anxiety became physical
Ariana Grande doesn't talk about the Manchester Bombing very often, but in a recent interview with Elle, she said although "everything is different" since the attack, she was never going to let it keep her from doing what she loves.
"You hear about these things," she said. "You see it on the news, you tweet the hashtag. Its happened before, and itll happen again. It makes you sad, you think about it for a little, and then people move on. But experiencing something like that firsthand, you think of everything differently. Everything is different."
In the immediate aftermath of the incident, which left 22 dead and another 500 injured, Ariana and her mother Joan hopped on the first flight home to Boca Raton, Florida. Ariana didn't talk for two whole days, Joan said, but when she finally did, she wanted to return to Manchester.
It was two or three in the morning; she crawled into bed and said, Mom, lets be honest, Im never not going to sing again. But Im not going to sing again until I sing in Manchester first.
That's how the One Love Manchester Concert was born. The two called Ariana's manager, Scooter Braun, and started planning the concert, which ended up raising $23 million for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund.
Ariana said getting back onstage after the attack was terrifying, and to this day it still can be, but her fans are a source of inspiration for her and the main reason she does it. They still pack stadiums to watch her sing, and bring signs that say "Hate will never win."
Why would I second-guess getting on a fucking stage and being there for them That city, and their response That changed my life. she said.
She completed the rest of her tour after the benefit concert, but she said when she got home she had dizzy spells, often feeling like she couldn't breathe. "There were a couple of months straight where I felt so upside down, she said.
Before Manchester and even since, Ariana has been a goofy person. Her mom described a birthday party when she was younger that was Jaws-themed, which freaked out every kid in attendance.
Most of the kids were running, screaming, because I had Jaws playing on a huge screen, Joan remembered. The parents were like, Are you crazy Our kids dont watch that! But it was [Arianas] favorite movie.
During Halloween, Joan would decorate the house with actual animal organs that she got from the butcher, and the kids would paint blood on the walls. They went to Disney World often, and Joan insists Ariana was never the princess type.
If we had a choice of going to the Disney princess store or the villain store, it was always the villains, Joan said.
That weird streak is still present in the pop star today.
During her interview, she went on a tangent about how she's been watching Planet Earth a lot recently.
Have you seen those fish with the transparent heads Those are aliens! Thats where they are! Theyre here.
Not only that, but she talked about how the planet is a really big place, and it's almost crazy how small people are in comparison. The planets, the stars, theres nothing more humbling than that shit," she said. "We get so stressed about little things when, in the big picture, were just a speck of dust on this tiny planet in this enormous solar system that is also a speck in a huge, mysterious black hole situation, and we dont even know what it is!
That mentality of not getting stressed over the little things may be part of why she feels like it's important to be political and outspoken as a celebrity, as opposed to, the writer of the profile notes, other celebs with a Reputation for not saying anything.
"Theres a lot of noise when you say anything about anything. But if Im not going to say it, whats the fucking point of being here Not everyone is going to agree with you, but that doesnt mean Im just going to shut up and sing my songs," Ariana said. "Im also going to be a human being who cares about other human beings; to be an ally and use my privilege to help educate people. Elle

Wimbledon magic moments - week 2
LONDON, Sunday - Magic moments from the second week of Wimbledon:
MONDAY, JULY 9
Sweet 16 for Federer
l Roger Federer needed just 16 minutes to win the opening set in a 6-0, 7-5, 6-4 defeat of Frances Adrian Mannarino to reach his 16th Wimbledon quarter-final and 53rd at the majors.
I think its a tough matchup for him maybe against me, said the Swiss.
TUESDAY, JULY 10
Nice ice baby!
l Jelena Ostapenko became the first Latvian woman to reach a Wimbledon semi-final as the former French Open champion beat Dominika Cibulkova 7-5, 6-4 -- but she suffered a bizarre minor injury in the process.
She ice on her leg in between games after slapping herself with her hand in frustration at a missed chance.
I hit myself when I missed a shot. It was too hard so I had to ice it, she said.
WEDNESDAY, JULY 11
Double epic as Federer out, Nadal triumphs
l Federer was sensationally knocked out by Kevin Anderson 2-6, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 6-4, 13-11 as the 32-year-old became the first South African in the Wimbledon semi-finals since Kevin Curren in 1983. Three-time champion Novak Djokovic reached his first semi-final at the majors in more than two years by seeing off Japans Kei Nishikori 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. The 12-time Slam champion booked a semi-final clash against old rival and world number one Rafael Nadal who saw off Juan Martin del Potro 7-5, 6-7 (7/9), 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 after four hours and 48 minutes on Centre Court.
THURSDAY, JULY 12
Serenas traumatic thoughts
l Serena Williams said it was crazy to reach a 10th Wimbledon final, 10 months after a series of life-saving surgeries which followed the birth of her daughter and that she still has traumatic thoughts over her own mortality.
Its no secret I had a super tough delivery. I lost count after, like, four surgeries. I couldnt even walk to my mailbox.
I didnt know I would have such kind of traumatic thoughts, especially now that I have a daughter.
FRIDAY, JULY 13
Have mercy! Lets have final set tiebreak
l Anderson and John Isner called for tiebreaks to be introduced in the final sets at Grand Slams after their semi-final entered the record books as the second longest ever singles match at a major, lasting 6 hours and 36 minutes.
Anderson won 7-6 (8/6), 6-7 (5/7), 6-7 (9/11), 6-4, 26-24 with the final set lasting just five minutes short of three hours.
I hope this is a sign for Grand Slams to change. I really hope we can look at this, because at the end you dont feel great, said Anderson.
Isner previously won the longest ever Grand Slam singles match against Nicolas Mahut, lasting 11 hours and five minutes over three days in the 2010 Wimbledon first round.
SATURDAY, JULY 14
Kerber stuns Serena Slam dream
l Angelique Kerber became the first German woman to win Wimbledon for 22 years as the 11th seed shattered Serena Williams bid for Grand Slam history with a shock 6-3, 6-3 victory in the final.
I knew I had to play my best tennis against a champion like Serena, Kerber said.
Williams had hoped to equal Margaret Courts record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles by winning her first major prize since becoming a mother in September.
Its obviously disappointing but I am just getting started, said an emotional Williams.
For all you mums out there I was playing for you. I really tried.
The final was delayed by Nadal and Djokovic finishing off what turned out to be a 5-hour 15-minute semi-final, the fifth longest singles match at the tournament.
SUNDAY, JULY 15
Djokovic eats his greens!
l Novak Djokovic celebrated his fourth Wimbledon title -- by munching on the Centre Court grass.
Djokovic defeated a battling but exhausted Kevin Anderson 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) to add the 2018 title to his wins in 2011, 2014 and 2015. He also took his Grand Slam total to 13 after a year which had seen him struggle with form and confidence, sending his world ranking to its lowest in over a decade.
The grass tasted really well. I had a double portion this year to treat myself, said the 31-year-old.  AFP

International student exchange programs are quite common in developed countries in Sri Lanka. We get news of such exchange programs usually taking place in top schools in the country.
A school in Beruwala has taken part in such a program with a high school in Germany. Wisdom International College, Beruwala, has come up successfully with this great feat.
They have commenced student exchange programs with Albert Einstein High School of Maintal, Germany. The first batch of 10 German students and teachers spent two weeks in Sri Lanka recently. They studied alongside their local counterparts at Wisdom and even got the opportunity to tour many important places in the country, including the Peradeniya University, where they were able to have an audience with the Vice chancellor, Prof. Upul Disanayaka.
Now, nine local students from Wisdom International College - Imam Ashmal, Umar Ahmad, Umar Ayyash, Mohammed Haseen, Yusuf Ahmad, Mohammed Aamir Abdullah, Aisha Safa, Chamalee Pabasara and Fathima Nihla - with their chaperones - Samgeeth Samarajeewa and Chamoda Nilukshi - their Managing Director, Fowsar Hussain and Principal Shakeel Ismath left for Germany in April.

Yogalebrity!
The latest breed of star to come out of social media is the so-called yogalebrity - theyre young, lithe, lycra-clad and all over Instagram in bendy positions.
But theres one who is very much the exception to the rule: 98-year-old To Porchon-Lynch from Hartsdale, New York.
And unlike the majority of all-natural, vegan yogis, Porchon-Lynch wears big earrings, has brightly-painted nails, is always in high heels (well, except for when shes doing yoga) and she loves wine.
In fact, Porchon-Lynch drinks just two beverages: wine and tea (never water). So into her vino is the nonagenarian that she founded the American Wine Society with her late husband in 1967.
After he died in a motorcycle accident in 1982, Porchon-Lynch threw herself into yoga - she now teaches five times a week and travels round the world leading workshops in exciting places.
Porchon-Lynch has always led an exotic life though - she was born in India, moved to London in 1940, danced for soldiers in Europe and then moved to Hollywood. Over her years, shes spent time with Mahatma Gandhi, Nol Coward, Marilyn Monroe and the Dalai Lama.
It was growing up in India, however, that Porchon-Lynch discovered yoga: at the age of eight, she spotted boys on the beach contorting their bodies into strange poses. I went to my aunt and said, Can they let me be part of it And she said: That isnt a game, it is yoga and its not for girls. Its not ladylike. So I started doing it, Porchon-Lynch told the New York Times.
She may have had three hip-replacements but still drives herself around in her Smart car and is frequently recognised in the street.
Porchon-Lynch rose to public attention in 2012 after photographer Robert Sturman shot pictures of her in Central Park, New York, and posted them online. They went viral and she became a social media sensation.
Three years later, Porchon-Lynch appeared dancing with a 26-year-old on Americas Got Talent - her performance was described by the judges as too mind-blowing for words. She dances competitively when shes not teaching yoga, mainly with men 75 years her junior.
In a world where few things seem as valuable as youth, Porchon-Lynch is a breath of fresh air, which has not been lost on brands - she recently took part in a photoshoot for Athleta, an athleisure brand owned by Gap Inc.
IndependentShes the glamorous, wine-drinking, yogalebrity the whole world wishes was their friend.
