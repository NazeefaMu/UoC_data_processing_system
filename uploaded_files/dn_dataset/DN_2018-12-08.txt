NHDA puts public servants in jeopardy
Public servants in Kurunegala said the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) had put many of them in jeopardy by not taking measures to recover the housing loans from borrowers but from guarantors.
They said that during previous regime thousands of houses were constructed under the government housing development policy on lands granted by the government.
Those houses were constructed under a loan scheme which required a public servant as a guarantor, they said.
The public servants said many of those borrowers have defaulted their installments. The National Housing Development Authority, despite having many loan recovery officials to urge the borrowers to pay their loans, has taken measures to recover the loans from the public servants who signed as the guarantors taking the cover of the clause 72 of the Housing Development Act. They said they were facing a grave injustice due to the act of the National Housing Development Authority.
The public servants said the borrowers have the land granted by the government and the houses constructed on them with the loans while the public servants have had to settle the loans.
They said the Authority does not urge the borrowers to settle the loans by warning them to acquire their assets.
The public servants said that since the Authority was set up by way of a separate and different Act, the public servants are helpless for there is no way to take action against it.

Absurdly fantastic:
The 1939 Timeless Test
Never before, or since, has 22 yards of a cricket pitch ever been so absurdly perfect.
So minimal was the movement that even Ken Farnes and Hedley Verity, two of world crickets most outstanding bowlers, could hardly make an impression.
Twelve new balls were used as crickets most epic Test match meandered 10 days from one week into another without result.
Played in a backdrop of an impending World War  Hitler was just months away from invading Poland  Durbans 43-hour marathon was decided eventually by a steamships timetable.
Neville Cardus dubbed it an absurdity. Jack Hobbs called it a game killer.
The scoreboard of the Timeless Test
Yet others, like South Africas most celebrated writer Louis Duffus reckoned it was fantastic and the father of all Test cricket freaks.
Set 696 to win, England was agonisingly close just 42 runs short at 5-654 when rain interfered and travel itineraries re-consulted.
Thirty-six bottles of the best champagne had been iced for the victors and were eventually to be hurriedly shared between the two exhausted XIs as the English began the two day railway journey to Cape Town to rendezvous with the Athlone Castle taking them home.The longest match of all was over. Cricket, like the rest of the world, was edging towards darkness.
South Africas captain Alan Melville initially claimed the match, saying England was forfeiting by leaving early.
While South African administrators were grappling over this one, several of the Englishmen including new world record-holder Len Hutton rifled some of the match stumps, realising they could be significant momentos.
Rules of the time permitted the rolling of the wicket after rain and at first light most mornings Kingsmead curator Vic Robins was able to erase all the imperfections and effectively create a new wicket.
Even after three days play, the rich soil from the nearby Umgeni River showed hardly any sign of wear and tear.
Author John Lazenby says Dudley Nourse inspected the wicket on the 11th morning and found it still rock-hard and impervious.
South Africas first innings meandered 13 hours. It was a go-slow on an over-prepared wicket which highlighted the futility of deciding matches in a rubber being played without limits.
The colorful RC Robertson-Glasgow said some of the batsmen were so marooned in a defensive psyche they nearly slept on the pitch.
The wife of South African allrounder Eric Dalton grumbled that he kept waking her most nights appealing for wickets in his sleep.
More runs (1981) were made and more balls (5447) bowled than in any other Test.
Its a fascinating story, beautifully told.
Scores: South Africa 530 in 202.6 overs (Alan Melville 78, Peter van der Bijl 125, Dudley Nourse 103, Eric Dalton 57, Ronnie Grieveson 75, Reg Perks 5/100) and 481 in 142.1 overs (Bruce Mitchell 89, Peter van der Bijl 97, Ken Viljoen 74, Alan Melville 103, Ken Farnes 4/74)
England 316 in 117.6 overs (Eddie Paynter 62, Leslie Ames 84, Eric Dalton 4/59) and 654-5 in 218.2 overs (Sir Leonard Hutton 55, Paul Gibb 120, Bill Edrich 219, Wally Hammond 140, Eddie Paynter 75)

81 declared: a tale of torrential rain and two extraordinary Tests
In only two Test matches have both captains declared with scores below 150 and in those games, by definition extraordinary, the higher of those totals was a mere 81. Both involved England and both had one other thing in common: rain, plenty of it, and pitches at best partially protected and massively affected.
The two third-innings declarations remain the two lowest such totals in the history of Test cricket and they set the two lowest fourth-innings, post-declaration targets ever, though one was almost three times as big as the other.
The more recent ended in Brisbane 68 years ago on Wednesday but the first was played in Barbados at the start of 1935 and, in a taste of what was to come, the start was delayed by 20 minutes because of light morning rain. Soon it was wickets that were falling.
Ken Farnes Englands 6ft 5in fast bowler.
Ken Farnes was a 6ft 5in fast bowler who was to die in 1941, two years after being named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year, when his first solo night flight after volunteering for the RAF ended in a crash moments after he took off from Chipping Warden airfield. By lunch he had taken four wickets for 15 in nine overs and West Indies were five down for 31. They recovered to reach 102 and by stumps on the first day England were 81 for five, with Wally Hammond unbeaten on 43. That night it rained long and hard, and on day two things got really interesting.
It took until tea for the groundstaff to make the surface playable and even then it was only just worthy of that description. Englands innings lasted three more balls, with Hammond falling to the second and Errol Holmes to the third, at which point Les Ames decided they would be better off bowling than attempting to score the 21 runs they still required to draw level.
West Indies opened with Les Hylton and Rolph Grant, No 7 and No 8 in their first knock, and as the team tried to survive until stumps they were followed by Nos 11, 10 and 9. Hylton, a fast bowler, was to record his two highest Test scores (he played only six times and was hanged for the murder of his adulterous wife 20 years later). He was still there at the close of play, with his team on 33 for three.
That night it rained long and hard, and again the next day it was nearly tea before the groundstaff, with the help of an obliging sun, made the surface playable. Three more wickets fell, including Hyltons for a career-best 19, before Jackie Grant, Rolphs brother, declared at tea. This must be considered among the most daring declarations of all time: there were four sessions still to play, his team had four wickets in hand and three top-order batsmen yet to bat, and they led by only 73.
England sent in Farnes and Big Jim Smith, at 6ft 3in the shorter of the pair, specialist bowlers who had already taken 10 wickets between them, to open the batting, a gambit that crumbled as both were out before the team reached double figures. Excitement was now intense, and the fieldsmen were on their toes, eager to press home the advantage, the Guardian wrote, but Patsy Hendren came out and scored 20, including a six, and after a couple more quick wickets left England still in some concern at 48 for six, Hammond took control and settled the issue with another six, concluding what it called one of the most amazing Test matches played in recent times.
Which brings us to the first Ashes Test in Brisbane in 1950, a game whose first day  by some margin the least remarkable, discounting the entirely rained-off second  featured, in the words of the Observers report, cricket of an interest not seen since that match between England and Australia at Leeds in 1938. At its end the Guardian described a wicket so easy in its pace that when Hassett won the toss he hardly could have imagined that his batsmen would score less than 500  It was a batsmans rather than a bowlers wicket to the end. It went on to predict  and bear in mind that the game had started on a Friday  that, if England can score 500 runs before the close on Monday they should win the match, and declared the hope that, if they are 50 runs ahead tomorrow night with most of their wickets in hand, they have a good chance of victory whatever the weather does.
In fact England were batting at the close on Monday but that is as close as they came to fulfilling that prediction: by then, on the archetypal Brisbane sticky, they had lost 16 wickets, still not scored 100 runs and were heading for near-certain doom. On that day 20 wickets fell at an average of 6.4 apiece. The scene was like a circus, and the players like unwilling clowns, wrote the Observer.
England had reached 68 for seven when they declared, still 160 runs behind, in order to attempt to skittle Australia cheaply and have a decent go at reaching whatever target remained on day three. Batting conditions improved from here, with the Guardian describing the taming influence of a tiny garden roller that left the pitch still disconcertingly lively, but now it was possible to play some orthodox shots. This did not seem so clear to the Australians, who lost their first three wickets before a run had been scored. After less than 14 overs they too declared on 32 for seven.
After application of a heavy roller the wicket was further calmed but England gave their wickets away too easily  Arthur McIntyre particularly culpable, run out while attempting to sprint an unnecessary fourth  and on the third day Len Hutton, playing brilliantly, ran out of partners and England were all out for 122, 70 runs adrift. England have been their opponents betters in every department of the game under all conditions, wrote the Guardian, and yet they had lost what RC Robertson-Glasgow in the Observer called a struggle against natures cruelty as much as Australias skill.
One point that arises for consideration is whether slapstick of this sort is Test cricket, he wrote. Test cricket surely means a trial of cricket strength or nothing. Any team can put up with the fortune of war. But this was the fortune of farce. Such pitches mock the art of bowling as well as of batting.
England went on to lose the series 4-1, winning the final Test with the Ashes long gone, and have won on only two of their 17 subsequent visits to the Gabba. At least in 1950 they were able to blame defeat on something other than their own inferiority.  theguardian

Kandy Sports Round up:
CH to suffer another blow on Sunday
Kandy Sports Club who have claimed the upper hand in club rugby head into their fifth game of the first round tomorrow at Nittawela against the sixth placed CH & FC, which will be a win or go home scenario. CH and FC in four games have won one and lost three and their chances of advancing to wins, after losing three games is definitely not part of their game plan. The team needs Lady Luck to help them build to make sure they are in the top three of the first round. Table leaders Kandy SC have won all four games they have played. Last Sunday's victory over CR & FC at the same venue was a confidence booster in the context. Sundays game against CH they should win comfortably to give themselves a chance of finishing first in the standings. That finish would ensure that they take some momentum and confidence into the remaining two games in the first round.
Five ruggerites from Kandy
There are five rugegrites from Kandys Trinity, Kingswood and St. Anthonys College in the 26-member under 19 squad, who are now in Chinese Taipei to play in the Asian rugby championship, which is the qualifier for the World Cup to be held in Brazil in 2019. The Trinitians in the squad are Pravenda Wijetilake and Visha Ranaraja, the Kingswoodian is Rashmika Ganithagedera, and the Antonians are Ishara Liyanage and Shabeer Iqbal.
Athletics
The early history of Kandy athletics is lost in the midst of time. Records are unavailable and people associated with early years are long since dead. Almost up to 1925 athletics as such, was not given much importance as it is today nor did our athletes be interested. Today athletics has a special place in schools and recently in Kandy many athletic events were held. Schools have good coaches, Trinity is coached by a well known sportsman, H. Gamage Ariyaratne who polished his sports at Vidyartha College. He was also a top ruggerite. Walal A Ratnayake Central is doing well at athletics, followed by St. Anthonys, Dharmaraja, Sri Sumangala, St.Sylvesters, Kingswood, Girls High School, Mahamaya Girls School, Hillwood Girls College, Hemali BV, Swarnamali BV, Seethadevi BV, Viharamadevi BV, Kandy Convent, D.S. Senanayake, Nugawela Central, Madina Central, Berverets College, Chandananda Buddhist College, Ranabima Royal. Then the International schools Gateway, CIS, Sussex College to name a few. What they lack today is a proper ground with a good track. Kandy District Athletic Association are doing their best with limited facilities. The Sports Ministry should come forward and help.
Deva and committee give a hand for hockey
The Trinity College Hockey Foundation is going all out to give the game the best of support, the new committee which was elected in end of June at the BRC club house are packed with some top promoters.
The office bearers are: Patron - Principal Andrew Fowler Watt, Vice Patrons - Paul Jeyaraj, Amitha Nugawela, Trustee - Roshan Rajadurai, President - Deva Ellepola, Vice President - Rajiv Renganathan, Secretary -Subramanian Sanjeewan, Asst. Secretary - Roshan Krishnanalan, Treasurer - Subramanian Krishanthan, Committee Members - Wazeer Mohamed, Fazeel Fawmy, Manoj Kumar, Hanzal Ahamed. Advisory committee - Dr. Sapumal Dhanapala, Saadi Wadood, Prasad Jinadasa.
The Under 14 Team managed to secure the Gold Star at the all island schools tournament this year
Iron sport to be lifted
Weightlifting is to be given the best of support in Kandy in the future. At one time this sport was dominated in Kandy and produced several weight lifters who brought honour to their clubs and the country. Kandy was the hub for the Iron sport. All this was made possible due to the immense support backed by the NOC and Sports Ministry. Today weightlifting is catching up in a big way in schools. Even girls are interested in taking to this sport and be recognized.
Schools start fitness training
All Kandy rugby schools have started fitness program, physical and weight training for the coming season which is expected to kick off in March. This will encourage each coach and player to review it critically and to modify it to meet the needs.
Rising tide of young talent
Old Sylvestrian Football Union organized a nine-a-side football carnival for their school last Sunday at their grassless grounds at Asgiriya. The weather was nice and it was a perfect day of good football. The level of play by the youngsters were impressive the Under-12 and combined 14-16 teams, they played like grown-ups. The way they controlled the ball, passing backwards, tactics showed they have the strategy of how they want to score their goals. The players know exactly what they were doing on the pitch. Its not just pure talent but also knowledge of the game. In the under 12 event 45 players were seen in action and Ivory were champions with Blue taking second place, third place went to Maroon. In the combined under 14-16 too there were 45 players. Blue emerged champion, Maroon took second place and Ivory third place. It was a day of good run and pass football and a big hand should go to the organizing committee president Rukshan Mohamed, Secretary M. Karunakaran and coach Manju Gunasekara. The OBA president was the chief guest and gave away the awards.
How do you get into a rugby academy
The Kandy Rugby Academy is an institution run by M. Rasheed a rugby lover from the touch line, who focused on the development of the sport in Kandy. One of his main aims is to develop players to be able to participate in the game. This academy practice sessions under knowledgeable coaches are held on Saturdays at the Bogambara Stadium.
Gladwin International schools team chairman
Kandy Gateway principal Gladwyn Canagasabey is the (team chairman), for the International Schools of Sri Lanka first overseas tour to India. The Sri Lanka International Schools comprises 14 top cricketers, students players and four officials. The tournament is the 5th ISCPL 2018 which started on December 6 and will concluded on December 14 in Lucknow, India. The International schools committee under the chairmanship of Dr Kumari Grero have organized this much needed tour to encourage the talented cricketers to give off their best in the game. Today the local International schools are all out to give a big hand for cricket, which will help their students in a big way.
Japanese baseball female coaches in Kandy
In Kandy, the Baseball & Softball Association with the backing of the Japanese Embassy conducted a coaching programme at the Peradeniya University grounds on Thursday and Friday. There were four Japanese coaches to give a helping hand, Shimura Akiko onetime Japanese national coach, Kawaga Risa who played for Japan for nine years, and later was a national team coach, Rokkaku Ayako she was a national player and Yamada Jiroko. Kandy is keen to promote baseball but sad to say they could have had more students in this programme.
Why arent ruggerites taking to refereeing
In Kandy, according to statistics there are top rugby players retiring from the game but shying away from contributing towards the upliftment of it by becoming rugby referees with their knowledge and experience.
In the good old days it was top players who after retirement took to the whistle and kept the game going. Some of the top Kandy school products who after giving up the game took to refereeing, those that come to mind are Col. Bertie Dias, Miles Christofelsz, Mohamed Azain, Maurice Perera, Lesley Hadunge, C.H. Seneviratne, Mohan Sahayam, Gamini Fernando, Y.C. Chang, Col. C.S. Fernando, Lt. Gen. Denzil Kobekkaduwa, DIG Nimal Lewke, Gamini Weerasinghe, Daya Jayasundera, Kalu Perera, S.W. Chang, Anil Jayasinghe and A. Rankothge to name a few.

This is a 50m length vessel with a breadth of 18m and a depth of 6.1m. The vessel is driven by two powerful diesel engines and shall develop a speed of 14 knots. The vessel shall be fully air-conditioned and shall provide accommodation for 47 persons.
The Buoy Tender Vessel is designed to be operated to retrieve and launch marine navigation buoys, to provide repair and maintenance to marine navigation buoy, to transport marine navigation buoys and/or spare parts and to transport general cargo. This is a 60m length vessel with a breadth of 12m breadth and a depth of 4.6m. The vessel is driven by twin diesel engines and is capable of achieving a speed of 12 knots.
The vessel shall also be equipped with a Crane with a lifting capacity of 22tons. This vessel too provides fully air-conditioned living quarters for its complement of 29 persons.
The two vessels are to sail out of Colombo in August 2020.
The keel laying ceremony marked the commencement of hull construction work of the two vessels and the occasion was graced by Ambassador/ Charge d Affaires/ Head of Mission of the Iraqi Embassy Rajaa Habeeb Shallal Mandalawi, Japanese Ambassador Akira Sugiyama, Chief Engineer Talib Abdullah Baeish, Assistant Director-General/ Project Director of General Company for Ports of Iraq and TTC Senior General Manager Hideyuki Oiwa.

Cool-Head keeps Australia alive against India
Adelaide, Friday: Travis Head hit a stubborn half-century to keep Australia in the hunt Friday after their top order slumped under sustained pressure from India's bowlers, leaving the first Test in Adelaide finely poised.
Batting on his home ground, Head kept his cool in the humid conditions to be 61 not out at stumps on day two, with Mitchell Starc unbeaten on eight.
His efforts helped steer Australia to 191-7 in reply to India's 250.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin bowled beautifully to take three wickets, while Ishant Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah grabbed two each.
It was Head's second 50 in his third Test, with the Adelaide-born 24-year-old playing the sort of gutsy innings that his more experienced teammates couldn't match.
All of Australia's top four were back in the pavilion without passing 30, with Aaron Finch (0) and Shaun Marsh (2) notable failures.
It once again reinforced how much Australia are missing Steve Smith and David Warner, who remain banned over their part in the South Africa ball-tampering affair.
"It was nice to do a job for the team and it will be an exciting day tomorrow," said Head.
"We hung in there. India bowled exceptionally well. It was (a) fantastic little fightback in the end and it will be an important first hour tomorrow. Every run will valuable."
Debutant Marcus Harris, who made 26, added: "It was a tough day, it wasn't easy to score. I think we're in a decent position."
Ashwin agreed that the Test match for there for the taking.
"I see it as neck and neck as far as the game goes right now," he said. India resumed on 250-9, but they were unable to add to the total with tailender Mohammed Shami out for six on the first ball of the day, caught behind by Tim Paine off Josh Hazlewood, leaving Bumrah unbeaten on 0.
Hazlewood finished with 3-52. Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon all took two wickets each.
In reply, Australia got off to a horror start with Finch's credentials as an opener again called into question after he was spectacularly bowled without scoring on only the third ball he faced.
A lovely delivery from Sharma took out his middle and off stumps after getting an inside edge as Finch attempted a drive.
Harris looked in good nick and unruffled by the occasion, hitting three fours in his solid 26.
But he was undone by a drifting ball from Ashwin, getting an edge to Murali Vijay at silly mid-off and ending a 45-run partnership with a slimmed-down Usman Khawaja who was back after knee surgery.
Ashwin's off spin was causing problems and Marsh needlessly slashed at a wide delivery in the first over after lunch, dragging it onto his wicket.
The woeful shot extended his dire recent Test form and left Australia in trouble at 59-3. Marsh has now slumped to six consecutive single-figure scores, failing to step up in the absence of Smith and Warner. Khawaja, whose Test preparations were disrupted after the shock arrest of his brother this week for allegedly framing a love-rival with a fake terror plot, was Ashwin's next victim.
Wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant took an excellent catch after a turning ball flicked off Khawaja's glove. He was out for 28 on a review decision.
A gritty knock from Peter Handscomb, brought into the side for all-rounder Mitch Marsh, ended on 34 soon after tea with Bumrah breaking what was shaping as a handy partnership with Head. AFP

CR-Havies should be a close game
It will be an exciting tussle for supremacy when CR & FC lock horns with arch rivals Havelock Sports Club in the first leg of the Dialog A Division inter club league rugby tournament match for the Commander Eustace Matthysz trophy at Longden Place, kick off will be at 4.00 pm today.
The trophy, is named after Commander Eustace Matthysz, a rugby stalwart and former dynamic Ceylon prop forward who also represented Sri Lanka Navy and Havelocks SC with distinction before he brought fame and honour to the country as the President of the Asian Rugby Football Union in 1974. This coveted trophy is on offer since 1991 and was won by the CR & FC
outfit in the inaugural year, beating the Park Club by an aggregate of 14 points to 12.
It is the Park Club which won last year by winning both legs at Havelock Park as well as at Longden Place, hence they are the current holders of the trophy.
Going by how the two teams fared this season, Havies have a definite chance of pulling this game due to their unbeaten record so far and this makes the event a thrilling tussle.
The lads from the Longden Place lost their last match to Kandy Sports Club side last week at Nittawala grounds in Kandy while Havelocks were really fortunate and just managed to secure victory against a gallant Police Sports Club outfit by 31 points to 26 at Police Park last week after a close game.
Red shirts will have the advantage when it comes to the two hookers where experience
Dulanjana Wijesinghe will strike it very much faster and will be the man to watch in the loose play than the Havies young hooker Azmeer Fajudeen.
The Park Club boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in today's game and if the speedy three quarter line of the CR and FC spearheaded by their play maker cum vice captain Tharinda Ratwate and the present national winger and red shirts captain Kavindhu Perera delivers the goods, then it will be a daunting task for the Havelocks team to counter attack to notch up a much needed victory as they are having a very young inexperienced three quarter line this year.
CR and FC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Hafiz Adahan, Gayan Jayamanna, Charana Chamikara, Joel Perera, Shemal Weerasekara or Mithila Perera, Omalka Gunaratne, Kavindu De Costa and Tharinda Ratwatte, Reeza Rafaideen, Kavindu Perera (Captain), Rehan Silva, Chamod Fernando, Kevin Dixon, Head Coach : Nilfer Ibrahim
Havelocks (Probable XV) Dushmantha Priyadarshana , Azmeer Fajudeen, Rahal Delpachithra or Liston Flatney, Umesh Madushan, Sharo Fernando, Shenal Deelaka, Shawqat Lahir, Lasindu Ishan Karunathilake, Vimukthi Rahula and Niroshan Fernando (Captain) or Sandesh Jayawickrema, Chamara Dabare, Dinuk Amarasinghe or Lochana Girihagama, Iranga Ariyapala, Sandun Herath, Prince Chamara, Head Coach: Sanath Martis

Sri Lanka reiterated its commitment to creating a mine-free Sri Lanka by 2020 at the 17th Meeting of the State Parties to the Mine Ban Convention (Ottawa Convention) organised by the International Centre for Humanitarian Demining in the United Nations Complex in Geneva.
The Progress Report on Demining was tabled at the meeting and it was commended by the international community as originally 1,302 Sq.km of land extent was identified as a suspected and known contaminated area immediately after the war. As of now, only 26 Sq.km extent of land has to be cleared and 1,276 Sq.km of once dangerous lands have been released for human settlement, now, no longer dangerous and identified fit for normal human activities.
The lands have been converted into highly productive lands for human settlement and for agricultural, industrial and fishing purposes.
Sri Lanka developed a National Mine Action Strategy (2016-2020) and the government is using Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA) to track the progress on demining.
The victims have been provided with emergency assistance covering medical care, artificial limbs, and psychosocial support.
The livelihood assistance programme has also factored as special consideration for mine-affected victims and this will be further expanded, Sri Lankan representatives told the participants of the meeting.
The private sector will also be mobilised through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes to further support mine-affected victims and this intervention will be commenced in January 2019. The Mine Risk Education (MRE) programme has helped to create awareness among schoolchildren and the public to be proactive and alert to reduce injuries and casualties.
The currently remaining 26 Sq.km land additionally requires US $ 12 Mn to fast-track the mine clearing process. The 26 Sq.km remaining area mainly includes Kilinochchi District Muhamalai area and areas such as Maritimepattu and Oddusuddan in Mullaitivu District.
The commitment of the government to make Sri Lanka a mine-free country by 2020 and the progress achieved so far in the demining process attracted mine-hazard countries to learn from the success of Sri Lanka. Prince Mired Bin Raad Bin Zeid Al-Hussein, the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Promoting Universalisation of the Ottawa Convention who visited Sri Lanka on a mission also participated at the meeting and appreciated the progress.
He requested to share the experiences and practices with other countries, said Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development, and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry Secretary Sivagnanasothy.
Sri Lanka was represented by Sivagnanasothy, Ambassador A. L. A. Azeez, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to United Nations Organisation in Geneva and Samantha Jayasuriya, Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva. Sri Lanka has been working on demining programmes through the National Mine Action Centre (NMAC) of the Ministry and the implementing partners were Sri Lanka Army Humanitarian Demining Unit (SLA-HDU), Halo Trust, Skavita Humanitarian Assistance and Relief Project (SHARP), The Mine Action Adversary Group (MAG), and Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH).

Eighty SAITM students not qualified to register with SLMC - GMOA
The Government Medical Officers Association yesterday said that about 80 South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) students seemed to have not obtained minimum qualifications to register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council(SLMC).
About 80 SAITM students who say that they have completed their study course, have shown reluctance to register with the SLMC by submitting applications, GMOA Editor Dr. Nalinda Herath said. The SAITM degree is not recognised by any Medical Council in the world.
These students have failed to submit their applications to the SLMC, he said
We believe that they do not have the required minimum qualification, thats why they are showing reluctance to register with the SLMC, Dr.Herath said.
One student of their batch filed a petition before the Court of Appeal seeking an order enabling her to register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council. The Court directed the SLMC to register the student in question
after the respondent Health Ministry and Education and Higher Education Ministry made submissions in support of the student in question.
An appeal was later filed against the order before the Supreme Court by the Sri Lanka Medical Council too. The Supreme court also upheld the verdict of the Appeal Court.
The court has ordered an compensation of Rs.100,000 to the student and the SLMC paid the compensation to her.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, Dr.Herath said the Sri Lanka Medical Council is still not in a position to register her as she has not still submitted an application to the SLMC. He queried as to whether this student does not have minimum qualifications at the GCE Advanced Level.
We suspect that this student in question does not have minimum qualification and this may be the reason for showing reluctance to submit an application to the SLMC, he said.
He added that the Sri Lanka Medical Association is not in a position to register her unless she submits an application with all details of her qualifications.
This student has again filed contempt of court charges against the Sri Lanka Medical Council citing that SLMC has failed to execute the court order. GMOA officials recently called on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was of the view that this issue should be solved after having discussions with this group of students and their parents.
The Former President opined that this issue can be solved by offering KDU degree to them after following proper procedure.
He said this no solution has been received to this issue due to the fluctuations taking place in the political arena.
He added that many issues with regard to the SAITM have been solved.
This institute was abolished through the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence Academy Act and those who were still studying at the SAITM have been attached to the KDU to complete their degree program
There several issues which should be addressed by the KDU management and the Higher Education Ministry.

France set for women's World Cup draw as countdown begins
Paris, Friday: With just six months to go until the tournament's opening game in Paris, anticipation is growing ahead of the 2019 women's World Cup as the French capital prepares to host the draw for the finals on Saturday.
The spotlight on the women's game continues to grow, and next year's competition in France -- which runs from June 7 to July 7 -- will be the most lucrative yet.
There remains a chasm, though, compared to the men's World Cup that will take some years yet to close, in financial terms and in terms of the media spotlight.
Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg
However, there are some advantages to that -- twelve months ago, President Vladimir Putin took the stage in the Kremlin at a politicised draw for the World Cup in Russia, but this time at least the football can be the sole focus.
The hosts will be among the top seeds for the 24-team tournament, in which the United States will defend their crown while Olympic champions Germany will be strong contenders too.
Competition is likely to be intense, however -- 2011 winners Japan will fancy their chances, as will Phil Neville's England, semi-finalists at the last World Cup and at Euro 2017.
"We've got the experience now but we want to make sure we go all the way," England star Fran Kirby told The Guardian recently.
Getting beyond the group stage may not be too hard for them, even if the overall standard of women's football is improving all the time.
"I think this will be the first women's World Cup ever that will be highly competitive all the way through," Australia coach Alen Stajcic told the Sydney Morning Herald.
Beyond the leading names, this is also a big occasion for Scotland, whose women have qualified for their first World Cup in the same country where their men last went to a major tournament, back in 1998.
"I'm not one bit interested in drawing glamour countries," Scotland head coach Shelley Kerr admitted to the BBC.
"I'm hoping that we get a favourable draw that gives us the best possible chance of getting out of the group."
Hegerberg set to miss out
The ceremony at La Seine Musicale in Boulogne-Billancourt, just outside Paris, takes place on a weekend when the French capital is preoccupied with the threat of more violent "yellow vest" protests over rising living costs in the country.
France, though, successfully staged Euro 2016 despite terrorism concerns and is sure to put on a show for the women's game as Les Bleues aim to match the achievements of the men, World Cup winners in Russia.
The last tournament in Canada was the first with 24 teams and FIFA president Gianni Infantino proudly announced recently that total prize money had doubled since then, to $30 million, including a record $4 million for the winners.
That represents a step in the right direction, but a long way short of the figures in the men's game -- France pocketed $38 million for winning in Russia.
The standing of women's football was highlighted again this week when prolific Norwegian striker Ada Hegerberg was awarded the first women's Ballon d'Or.
The Lyon star called it a "historic" victory, and yet coverage of her success focused largely on host DJ Martin Solveig's bizarre request for her to "twerk" on stage. Hegerberg's achievement did not deserve to be overshadowed in such a way. However, the 23-year-old may not be paying too much attention to Saturday's draw, which begins at 6:00pm (1700 GMT).
Norway, winners in 1995, have qualified, but Hegerberg has not played for her country since their meek exit from Euro 2017. It would be a real shame for the tournament, the final of which will be played in Lyon, home to Europe's dominant club side, if she did not change her mind. AFP

FAO-China South-South Cooperation Project:
Lankas fruit value chain to be strengthened
The signing ceremony of the FAO-China South-South Cooperation Tripartite Agreement between the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), China and Sri Lanka took place at the FAO headquarters on Thursday.
The aim of the South-South Cooperation project is to help Sri Lanka boost the production and commercialization of fruit crops among the value chain actors in the country.
FAO Deputy Director-General (Programmes) Daniel Gustafson, Permanent Representative of China to FAO and Ambassador Niu Dun and Agriculture Ministry Secretary K. D. S. Ruwanchandra signed the agreement.
Sri Lanka is the second country in Asia to be funded through the FAO-China South-South Cooperation Programme. The new project valued at over USD 1.1 million, will mainly focus on the increase of fruit production and trade in and out of the country, contributing to FAOs Strategic Objectives and to the Country Programming Framework for Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka has had strong economic growth since the end of its 30-year civil war, but the challenges remain critical. Poor cultivation and high post-harvest losses lead to low yield and inadequate adherence to international food safety standards.
The project will include practical field-based capacity building through various implementation approaches.
During the two years of the project, eight experts and six technicians will be fielded to offer technical guidance to local communities, transfer practical and advanced technologies and organize training courses. Priority areas will also include raising the value chain of target fruit crops and helping develop domestic and export market to increase farmers income.
Widely regarded as a successful practice, South-South Cooperation between FAO, China and Sri Lanka will enable the effective exchange of expertise while boosting national food security and small-scale farmer livelihoods in South Asia.
Gustafson commended the notable contribution of China to the success of global South-South Cooperation since 1996.
He recognized the achievement of this collaboration now expanding to Sri Lanka under the umbrella of the FAO-China South-South Cooperation Programme.
FAOs South-South Cooperation initiatives help developing countries share and transfer agricultural knowledge and expertise among themselves, so that innovation and good practices that have been tested elsewhere in the global South can benefit other countries facing similar challenges.
China has been an active participant, strong supporter and major contributor of FAOs South-South Cooperation, granting USD 80 million to the FAO-China South-South Cooperation Programme in support of knowledge sharing and technology transfer among southern countries.

Maharani faces tough fight in Rajasthan
INDIA: The Indian state of Rajasthan voted Friday in an election that is a key test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with a local Princess representing his party facing a tough fight to stay in power.
The vote in the western state famous for its palaces, forts and deserts, home to 47 million people, is one of five state elections before Modi runs for a second term in national polls in 2019.
Results from Rajasthan, as well as for Telangana, also voting on Friday, plus from Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram -- which have already cast ballots -- will be published on December 11.
The most closely watched will be the central state of Madhya Pradesh, where 73 million people live, which polls suggest Modi's BJP might suffer a bitter defeat after 15 years in power.
The contests are seen as a dry run for 2019, with Modi and his likely rival from the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi -- scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty -- both campaigning actively.
Vasundhara Raje, Rajasthan's chief minister and a charismatic Maharani or female Maharaja representing Modi's BJP, swept to power in a landslide in 2013.
But her personal popularity has waned, with critics calling her autocratic and out of touch with the interests of ordinary people.
Her government has also been criticised for her handling of caste protests and for failing to boost investment and create jobs.
Rajasthan is one of India's few regions where local royal families going back centuries -- and outlasting British rule -- have successfully transitioned to democratic politics since India's independence in 1947.
Raje, 65, is the daughter of a former Maharaja who married an erstwhile ruler of another dynasty. Her main challenger in her constituency is Manvendra Singh, another blue blood from a family in western Rajasthan.
Ayodhya Prasad Gaur, author of a book on one of the state's leading royal families, told AFP that the nobility's popularity had to do with their permanence compared to ordinary politicians who just come and go.
The erstwhile rulers of Jodhpur still receive a wedding invite -- just like kings of earlier times -- from hundreds if not thousands of people in the region each year. And they maintain that relationship by sending a token amount as a gift for every invite they receive, Gaur told AFP.
Raj Singh, a voter in the city of Bikaner, around 210 miles (340 kilometres) from the state capital Jaipur, said he voted for Siddhi Kumari, another princess, in the last two elections. - AFP

## Title: Mike Brearley: Captaincy and the human mind

Mike Brearley: Captaincy and the human mind
In 1976, the year that Mike Brearley first played for England, he applied to train at the Institute of Psychoanalysis under Anne-Marie Sandler, a prominent analyst from Switzerland.
Initially, she turned him down, saying that he needed to have more experience with people who were in psychological trouble before he could make a full application.
Two weeks later, he received another letter from her. The British members of the admissions committee had informed her that Brearley had captained a cricket team (Middlesex) and that such a position had more relevance to training to be a psychoanalyst than she had realised. She allowed him to proceed with the application.
I like the story because of its inference that a cricket dressing room is full of damaged types  or, if not damaged, then enough of the broad spectrum of humanity to interest the most curious of observers. A team is made up of all sorts: the confident, the insecure, the exuberant, the introverted and the content, as well as the damaged. In 1971, this melting pot encouraged Brearley to return to cricket from academia after five years away and has helped him to retain a fascination with the game ever since.
We are sitting in an eyrie at Headingley, the ground that in 1981 made his reputation as a cricketing alchemist, and the conversation centres on the two aspects of captaincy  understanding how people and teams work, and tactics. Most England captains of my experience have expertise, or come to have expertise, in the second of these areas. Brearleys lifelong interest in the deepest fathoms of the mind, and his eventual expertise as a practising psychoanalyst, make him a unique member of the club, started by Len Hutton, of professional players who captained England, and one of its best practitioners.
One of the things about cricket, and this was certainly true then and is probably true now, is that you get people from every class and every walk of life, he says. There was Fred Titmus and John Murray, for example, at Middlesex who had come to the game through the boys clubs of Kings Cross and Notting Hill, rough areas in those days, and we also had the Honourable Tim Lamb. It was a fascinating mix.
His new book, the first since The Art of Captaincy, is entitled On Form and is, he tells me, a psychoanalytical look at being on form in cricket and life. It could easily have been called On Empathy, since much of it melds together his experiences as a cricketer and his expertise as a psychoanalyst to prod, probe and understand the workings of the mind, and how that affects our performance in whatever walk of life engages us.
Brearley has always believed the psychology of the game to be vital. Cricket is a psychological game  a lot goes on in the head in terms, for example, of shrewdness, resilience, bluff, individualism and team spirit, he says. Captaining calls for a down-to-earth sense of what makes players tick, both to help get the best out of ones own team and to probe the weakness of the opposition. People ask me if psychology helped me in this role. It did, but the reverse applied equally: cricket helped me to be more psychologically aware.
This curiosity in people began to take concrete shape at Cambridge University, where Brearley joined the Samaritans. He found that people didnt ring off quickly, that he could listen to them and wanted to understand why they were so despairing or suicidal. His never-to-be-finished PhD was entitled Emotion and Reason: Explanations of Action  the reason being that he wanted to try and find my way into the life of the mind.
By 1976 he had been accepted for training as a psychoanalyst and, during the latter stages of his career, was in analysis himself. My last year of playing, in 1982, was a crazy time. I would have it five mornings a week before play, 6.15 in the morning sometimes if we were playing away; later, 8.30am, if we were playing in London. It was very good of my analyst to be so accommodating.
For a long time, sport and academia battled for precedence. He played for Middlesex from 1961 to 1965, left the game to study and later went into a teaching post at Newcastle University, before eventually returning to cricket with the offer of the captaincy of Middlesex. I have always admired how easily these two aspects of his life have appeared to fit together, how he has never felt the need to wear his learning heavily around cricketers, nor felt the need to justify to his academic friends the notion that sport is a worthwhile pursuit.
It is a worthwhile pursuit, he says. Theres not much point in doing it if its not. I write a bit in the book about the snobbery of academia and the denigration from the sporting hearty. For a while I, too, thought the study of philosophy more honourable and noble but I dont really think I was an academic at heart and that was one of the reasons I came back to cricket, that and the captaincy of Middlesex, which I thought would be stimulating.
In the book, he quotes the mountaineer Heinrich Harrer: The glorious thing about mountains is that they will endure no lies. There is courage required to play elite sport, too, and truth emerges more often than not on the field of play. It is fertile ground for character study.
But it is less easy for the modern England captain to come to the job well formed in these arts. Modern England captains dont really get to captain their counties any more and it was an apprenticeship back then, he says. A county captain would run the club, essentially, but there is not that same potential to learn now. Its harder. You also have coaches, which can make it both easier and harder. They can get in the way, although a really good coach must be a fantastic asset.
I have often been struck by how warmly former colleagues of all backgrounds and temperaments have greeted Brearley. City of London School for boys, Cambridge and now living among the intellectuals of north London, maybe, but Brearley is no snob. He does not give much away autobiographically but I was struck by snippets  he liked the game British Bulldog as a boy, worked on a building site after university  that suggested a more rough-and-tumble edge than the donnish egghead of popular notion.
People thought I was an overeducated twit. Perhaps I was. But I come from a very ordinary background, he says. My dad was a schoolteacher. He was the first in our family to stay on after school or even go into sixth form. Most of the others were bringing money home by then. His father was an engine fitter from Yorkshire. Obviously a very skilled man. He played for Heckmondwike cricket club. If my father [Horace Brearley played a few first-class matches for Yorkshire and Middlesex] ever got runs, they would say to him, Tha wouldnt have got hundred if tha fatherd been bowling! Very Yorkshire.
The peculiarities of this Yorkshire ground, Headingley, are intriguing him as we chat and our conversation is peppered at my insistence about the Test in front of us: Thats good, West Indies have looked more purposeful. Gabriel looks strong.
Why is there a reluctance to post more men in the slips I suppose batsmen are more aggressive these days, pitches are flatter, but still  Shouldnt first slip be a little wider I dont think enough thought is given to the position of the slips according to how a batsman plays  you could be standing in two very different positions for the same bowler to two different batsmen 
It is clear that he believes captaincy to be a vital skill. Leadership is so crucial, helping to make individualists into teams and stodgy groups into teams that permit, encourage and enhance individual brilliance. But what if there is a mismatch, as there was in the first Test between England and West Indies at Edgbaston Does captaincy matter at all Well, the answer is a captain can make it less of a mismatch, he says. Or more.
He writes: If individualists are too powerful, too divisive and too selfish, the team suffers. If they run riot, the notion of team scarcely exists. At the other extreme, some teams can become flat, conformist and dull. Far from running riot, individuality is suppressed. These are tricky balances to find for any leader, but crucial in the formation of a happy, purposeful and successful team. There may be many different ways to handle such situations, just as there are many different ways to go about winning a cricket match. Occasionally, though, it all comes together and a captain can be on form.
Brearley gives an example in his book of one match where the combination of intuition, experience and downright luck produced a wicket. He says that he imagined his way into an opposition batsmans (Clive Rice of Nottinghamshire) body, and felt or imagined the shape of the shot to come. Moments later, he posted an unorthodox fly slip and the catch followed. It doesnt happen very often, but its nice when it does, Brearley says.
What, then, does he think of the latest England captain to take up the reins Just as I ask the question, Joe Root creams a four through the covers and that sets Brearley off: What a beautiful shot. Youd have to put that out of your mind as a fielding side. Fine player. As good as Ive seen for England. Plays according to the situation. Terrific. Likes to take the right kind of risks. People talk about his conversion rate but thats a dull way to look at the game. You have to take some risks. And then, without thinking, a checklist, as if he were preparing to captain against him next week: Likes to go at it early on. Got to have enough catchers in the slips. Thing is, thats not necessarily over-attacking, it can stop runs, too. The good players  Boycott, Cook, Root, Williamson  play the ball late, behind square, sometimes off the face of the bat. Need to have point behind square, too. Two gullies probably. Leave cover open, you dont mind him driving early on ...  Form comes and goes, but once a captain, always a captain.

From the greatest spinner ever
No Spin - A definitive, straight from the heart account
Shane Keith Warne, or 'The King' defined what leg-spin bowling is and was. He was a trendsetter, a true living legend who not only made Australia invincible when he was playing for them but has managed to pass on his charisma, knowledge, and skills to the next generation of upcoming players and for varied teams such as Hampshire, Melbourne Stars and Rajasthan Royals.
As another Test series between India and Australia commenced on December 6 at the Adelaide Oval, it's a good time to delve deep into Shane Warne's life written in his words in his autobiography 'No Spin'.
Shane Warne has inspired so many youngsters to take up leg-spin, so here are some observations and learnings got through the book which everyone in India, Australia and the world over can carry in their professional and personal lives:
NO SHORT-CUTS TO SUCCESS & NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HARD WORK
Everybody would think Warne was gifted, and he had something which other contemporary spinners didn't possess. That is true to an extent, but what went behind the scenes to make this genius is what we must learn and imbibe.
Warne slogged and would have bowled almost 2000 overs before the ball that defined him- The Ball of the century, that got Mike Gatting out. The fact was that Warne had a gift to spin the ball a long way, but post the success of the 1993 Ashes series, he needed guidance and a keen observer who could channelize that talent and ensure that it didn't get wasted.
That is where the leg-spinner, overweight and as many felt at that time(around 1996-1998) was wasting his talent, through Richie Benaud's assistance got introduced to Terry Jenner aka TJ. He ensured that Warne got on track and was able to focus on the thing he knew best- the art of leg-spin bowling.
For a cricketer who has picked up 708 Test wickets and mesmerized audiences across the world, there was no special tonic for his success. It was sheer hard work, determination and the willingness to keep learning that made Shane Warne.
THE WILLINGNESS TO LEARN EVEN AT THE PINNACLE OF SUCCESS
The cover of Shane Warne's new autobiography 'No Spin'
For a period of 3-4 years before 2000-2001, Warne was delivering results for the team but wasn't able to leave an imprint on the sport. So he fed off the learnings he got from Allan Border, Mark Taylor and his mentor Terry Jenner and implemented that in his game.
From how to approach his bowling-starting from the bowling action to his runup, to the delivery and release point. He has admitted to having taken the inputs from the people mentioned earlier and then having established a bowling action that sustained multiple injuries and countless amount of overs.
The simple point to take away from this aspect of his personality is the willingness to learn and put that learning into action to make him a better bowler. Not everyone does that when they reach the pinnacle of their success. They usually tend to rest on their laurels.
'The King' could have stayed as he was without making any changes to his bowling action in 1998-1999, but would he have been able to sustain that for long Apparently, NO. In his own words, he goes on to say that if he had continued in that pattern, he could have faced multiple issues right from shoulder dislocations to ankle problems and frankly in 5-6 years due to the workload he had, his body would have completely broken down.
Thank goodness for the advice given to him which made him an even more potent and lethal leg-spinner. And you have got to admire the fact that he has gone on to credit people he has taken advice from and also players who he admires for his success and the mark he has left on the game.
THE ABILITY TO CALL A SPADE FOR A SPADE
How many of us in our daily lives keep things within us for the fear of the repercussions of what would happen if we do say or do what we have in our mind Well, I guess every one of us.
A legend like Shane Warne has shown us time and again that calling out and expressing what's in his mind is the best way out. Even if that led to some controversy or him having to face a huge amount of backlash from his countrymen and everyone who followed and worshiped him.
Two classic examples sum this up perfectly- Shane Warne strongly opposed imposing the follow-on in the epic Test match at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata. He was of the opinion that temperatures were really tough on the bowlers and it would be a big mistake to go out and bowl again.
He made his stand very clear to his skipper 'Tugga' Steve Waugh, but the skipper didn't pay much heed to his word and I guess rest is history. And to this day, Shane Warne goes on to say that decision to impose the follow-on in Kolkata has strained his relationship with Steve Waugh forever.
A couple of incidents that left a rather bad taste on Shane Warne's image as a personality- his behavior that led to his bitter divorce with his wife Simone Callahan and the drug ban imposed on him that ruled him out of the ICC World Cricket World Cup in 2003.
On both occasions, he took complete responsibility and has openly come out in public and has stood by his stance. He has clearly mentioned in many interviews that his behavior and lifestyle led to the end of his marriage, and he is ashamed of that to this day. He cares for his three children and is still very cordial and friendly with Simone even now, but he still regrets the agony and discomfort he put them through.
And even in the infamous incident that led to him getting banned for one year for testing positive for using a diuretic that was provided by his mother- Shane Keith Warne has stood by his mother in all occasions.
He clearly goes on to say that she gave him that tablet in order to help him lose body weight, in order for him to get into proper shape ahead of the ICC Cricket World which Australia eventually ended up winning.
Shane Warne has explicitly maintained his stance that the drugs he took may have got him banned for one year, but he was completely aware of what he was getting into and it was not a coerced decision.
The point is that he was willing to own up to the mistakes he has made and the fact that he is a such a public figure watched and admired by many who play and follow the game sets the perfect example.
There is so much to learn and gain from this legend who was rated #5 in Wisden's list of greatest cricketers ever to have played the game. The man has revolutionized the art of leg-spin bowling and is admired and appreciated by every cricket lover.
With the rivalry between India and Australia set to resume shortly, it certainly is good to look back on someone who has transcended boundaries and has imparted his love and knowledge of the game to the next generation of cricketers, not just leg-spinners.
A true legend of the game, it has been a privilege to have watched, get mesmerized and get to know what went behind making the genius- Shane Keith Warne. He will continue to share his love for the game as part of the commentary team in the upcoming Test series.
We will all look forward to hearing you Warney! Thanks for everything, thanks for inspiring many of us to become better people personally and professionally. sk

N.Zealand win first away Test series over Pakistan in 49 years
Abu Dhabi, Friday: Debutant Will Somerville grabbed three key wickets to guide New Zealand to their first away series win over Pakistan in 49 years with a crushing 123-run win in the third and final Test on Friday.
The off-spinner took 3-52 and was aided by fellow spinner Ajaz Patel's 3-42 as Pakistan came up well short after being set a daunting 280-run target in 79 overs.
They crumbled to 156 in 56.1 overs on a weary pitch at Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.
Will Somerville's (3R) trio of wickets secured the Black Caps' first away series win against Pakistan since 1969, celebrating with teammates after taking the wicket of Pakistani captain Sarfraz Ahmed (R). AFP
The victory gave New Zealand a 2-1 series win after they had taken the first Test by a narrow four-run margin at the same venue. Pakistan bounced back with an innings and 16-run win in the second Test in Dubai.
New Zealand's last away series win against Pakistan was a 1-0 victory in matches played in Pakistan in 1969.
It was the Black Caps' fifth Test series win in their last six played since November 2016. They beat Pakistan, Bangladesh, the West Indies and England -- all at home -- with the single loss came against South Africa.
Somerville, who took 4-75 in the first innings to finish with seven wickets in the match, broke a stubborn 43-run sixth-wicket stand between top scorer Babar Azam (51) and skipper Sarfraz Ahmed, who made 28.
Patel ended Azam's 114-ball resistance before getting the last wicket when he dismissed Hasan Ali for four, sparking celebrations among the New Zealand players.
Pakistan were again let down by sloppy batting.
They were off to a disastrous start when Mohammad Hafeez, in his last innings before he retires from Test cricket, was bowled by fast bowler Tim Southee for eight. Medium pacer Colin de Grandhomme had first-innings centurion Azhar Ali caught behind for five before Somerville's double strike pushed Pakistan to 55-5 at lunch.
Somerville had Haris Sohail caught off a tentative push in the slip with his third ball of the first over for nine and next ball had first innings centurion Asad Shafiq caught behind off the glove.
In the last over before lunch Imam-ul-Haq, watching four wickets fell at the other end, gave an easy catch to forward short-leg off Patel for 22.
Earlier, New Zealand declared their second innings on 353-7 after some 45 minutes of batting with Henry Nicholls remaining unbeaten on 126 and Kane Williamson dismissed at his overnight score of 139.
That 212-run stand between Williamson which brought New Zealand back into the game on Thursday, was finally broken with the very first ball of the day.
Medium pacer Hasan Ali trapped Williamson leg before and even a review did not prolong the New Zealand skipper's innings.
But his 283-ball knock, containing 13 boundaries, turned the match.
Nicholls took a sharp single to complete his third Test hundred and finished with 12 hits to the ropes during his 266-ball knock.
De Grandhomme struck two boundaries and two sixes as New Zealand added 81 runs in 45 minutes, ensuring they set up a daunting target for Pakistan.
Leg-spinner Yasir Shah finished with 4-129 and debutant paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi took 2-85. AFP

Presidents Gazette notification dissolving Parliament
SC HEARINGS CONCLUDE
The Supreme Court seven-judge-Bench headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera yesterday reserved judgement in the Fundamental Rights petitions filed by several political parties and individuals challenging the Gazette notification issued by the President to dissolve Parliament.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court would make a judgement regarding these petitions in due course.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court further extended the Interim Order staying the operation of the Gazette notification issued by the President to dissolve Parliament until the date of judgement to be delivered in due course.
The Supreme Court seven-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Nalin Perera, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Murdu Fernando further extended the Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from proceeding to take any steps to conduct the Parliamentary Election by virtue of the proclamation until the judgment date.
The petitioners, respondents and intervenient petitioners concluded their submissions which were proceeded for a four-day period since last Tuesday (04).
These Fundamental Rights petitions had been filed in the Supreme Court by several political parties and individuals seeking an Interim Order to stay the operation of Presidents proclamation to dissolve parliament which published in the Gazette Extraordinary.
These petitions had been filed through Tamil National Alliance leader R.Sampanthan, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauf Hakeem, All Ceylon Makkal Congress party leader Rishad Bathiudeen,
R.A.S.D. Perera, Prof. S. Ratnajeevan H. Hoole, former MP Mano Ganeshan, Attorney-at-law Lal Wijenayake and G.C.J. Perera.
Presidents Counsel K.Kanag Iswaran appearing for Tamil National Alliance leader R.Sambanthan informed the Supreme Court that official acts of President are considered as executive acts and thereby Presidents decision can be challenged through the Fundamental Rights petitions.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General stated; The provisions of Article 38 (2) provide a specific mechanism for the Supreme Court to exercise jurisdiction over allegations of, intentional violations of the Constitution, misconduct or abuse of power by the President.
Dissolution of Parliament by the President, does not constitute executive or administrative action, falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution.
Kanag Iswaran said that the objection premised on Article 38 (2) is concerned, it is clear that the said objection is based on the supposition that Article 38 (2) operates as an ouster of Articles 17 and 126 vis--vis the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
He argued that one section of the Constitution cannot oust another section of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel M.A.Sumanthiran stated that all three languages of the constitution (Sinhala, English and Tamil) should be looked at to prevent confusion.
The Petitioners state that upon the Proclamation being published the petitioners were of the view that the proclamation dissolving Parliament was unconstitutional and illegal.
They sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1), 14(1(g) of the constitution is infringed by the petitioners.
Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-Iswaran with M.A. Sumanthiran PC, Thilak Marapana PC, C.J. Weliamuna PC, Dr. Jayampathi Wickremaratne PC, counsel H. Hizbullah, Counsel Suren Fernando and Manjula Balasuriya appeared for the petitioners.

The Budget was passed with a majority of 22 voting for (SLPP and UPFA), one SLPP member Samitha Imaduwa abstained, three opposed (JVP) and 11 members of the UNP walked out in protest prior to the vote being taken. One member of the UNP was absent during the sessions yesterday.
According to sources within the Municipal Council, the Sirikotha building located at No 400, E.W. Perera Mawatha, valued at Rs 1,472,463 owed the local government body Rs.371,060.68 as of December 31, 2018.
Municipal Council officials complained that they had sent Sirikotha several letters on the matter but they are yet to pay their rates and taxes.
Kotte MC Mayor, Attorney-at-Law Madura Vithanage making his maiden Budget speech yesterday noted that the MC has over the years faced issues of low revenue due to problems in recovering the rates and taxes that are due.
JVP member Yudheeshdeera Arosha addressing council pointed out that close to 10-15 percent of expected revenue was not met each year as a result of the MC not having a proper mechanism to collect what is due.
Further, he pointed out that the property belonging to the Kotte MC had not been assessed since 2008 and thus they were not benefitting from the rise in property values in the last 10 years.
The Budget statement made by the Mayor showed that a revenue of Rs.1,441,229,000 was expected in 2019 - with Rs. 1,232,122,000 being recurrent revenue.
In addition, a sum of Rs 109,000,000 is expected to be taken out as loans in 2019.The total expenditure for 2019 is estimated to be Rs 1,088, 293,000. Of this, capital expenditure is estimated at Rs.352,093,000 and Rs.1,424,860,00 has been allocated for loan repayments. The Mayor further stated that he expected to have a Budget surplus of Rs.843,000 next year.
Opposition members questioned as to why the estimated revenue had reduced next year compared to this. In 2018, estimated revenue stood at Rs.1,897,895,000- Rs.456 million more than next year.
SLPP Member Samantha Janaka Peiris pointed out that they would need a better tax collection system, procedures and increase the efficiency of the staff to increase revenue.
UNP Member Chandima Nayanajith in the meantime said the MC had wasted funds building shopping complexes like Jana Jaya City, the Pitakotte shopping centre and the Nugegoda Multipurpose building instead of investing in the basic necessities of the people, The loans that we have to bear as a result are exorbitant.
Former Mayor and UPFA member Janaka Ranawaka under whose tenure Jana Jaya City was built in defended it stating that it was necessary for the MC to dream big if they are to earn more revenue. He estimated that the car parking facilities and rent from the Jana Jaya City could earn the MC a revenue of Rs.50 million per year - making it possible for them to recover the total construction cost of Rs 600 million and loan of Rs 325 million.

Sri Lanka Junior Open Golf tourney from January 02 to 04
The most prestigious event in the junior golf calendar, the Sri Lanka Junior Open Golf Championship is scheduled to be held from January 2 to 4 at the RCGC.Prima Ceylon continues its sponsorship this year too and for the 11thconsecutive year. With more than a decade of magnanimous sponsorship this generous support by Prima Ceylon is ample testimony to its continued commitmentto promoting junior golf in the country in partnership with the national body for golf in the country the Sri Lanka Golf Union.
This event will be conducted according to four age group categories as follows; 15-18 years (Gold Division),12-14 years (Silver Division), 10 -11 years (Bronze Division) and 9 years and under (Copper Division). The overall winner over the 18 hole events will be declared the Sri Lanka Junior National Golf Champion (Boys/Girls) for the year2018.
Reigning Junior Champion Vinod Weerasinghe who is currently in the USA is expected to return to the island in time to defend his title. Vinod, the top ranked junior has already won this prestigious event twice before and with the ongoing professional coaching he is receiving overseas is heavily tipped to carry the title this year as well.However, a quartet of young golfing talent namely the juniors S.Dhuwarshan, Aroon Aslam, Nirekh Tejwani and Yannik Kumara are expected to provide stiff competition to Vinod this year provided these talented youngsters steady their temperament and are able to hold their nerve under pressure.
In the girls category top junior golfers Taniya Balasuriya and Kayla Perera are once again expected to fight tooth and nail for the title. In this, the girls category, it is extremely heartening to see such naturally gifted players like Balasuriya and Perera emerge onto the local golfing landscape. Still in their mid-teens, the duo have enormous potential to go the full distance and evoke memories of past SriLankan greats such as Thuhashini Selvaratnam and Tiru Fernando. Provided they stay focused, both have the ability to perform well in the international circuits as well.
In the more junior categories K.Danushan, Shanal Binuksha, Levon Niyarepola, Reshan Algama, Sherin Balasuriya,Kavindha Samarasekera M. Lidhurshan, M.S Sanjey and C. Dharaniyan from Nuwara Eliya have been identified as the emerging talent and this event should provide them a golden opportunity to showcase their skills and it is hoped the youngsters play to their fullest potential. The Sri Lanka Junior Open is thus the established benchmark for national rankings of junior golf.
The committed sponsorship of junior golf by Prima has been invaluable to the Sri Lanka Golf Union in promoting the sport islandwide and this year increased participation is expected especially from the Kandy, Anuradhapura and Nuwara Eliya regions. The popularity of the sport is seen to be growing mainly due to the focused outreach programs carried out by Sri Lanka Golf to propagate the sport at the grassroots.
This initiative was the brainchild of the Junior Sub Committee of Sri Lanka Golf as a means to identify the nations young golf talent with a view to nurturing and developing them for future national and international representation.Prima Sunrise, the title sponsor of this tournament, will as always provide nutrition for the players during the event.

Steps to save youths from drug menace
The countrys youths would be destroyed if they become addicted to drugs and narcotics, and if society does not take serious counter measures.
Otherwise, it would be too late to stop the impending disaster, said, Deputy Inspector General, Western Province North, Deshabandu Thennakoon.
He was addressing the media at Peliyagoda Police auditorium in Gampaha, recently.
He warned the people of those in their neighbourhoods who become rich overnight and could be drug peddlers. It is the duty of all to bring these people before the law, he said. Such people who suddenly enjoy a lavish life can draw suspicion.
He urged the media to educate the people to be vigilant so that the spread drug addiction among youths can be stopped.
Thennakoon said any information on suspicious people could be reported to the phone numbers; Gampaha 0713210001; Negombo 0713668001 and Kelaniya 0713580001.

Tackling Climate Change
Tackling Climate Change
We have definitely been experiencing many freak weather events for the last few years, from flash floods to unexpected droughts. Many have attributed this to the effects of Climate Change. Now a new report released at the ongoing COP24 climate summit in Poland has highlighted the urgency of addressing this issue without delay.
According to the Global Climate Risk Index 2019 Report, Sri Lanka has been ranked second among the countries most affected by extreme weather events since 1998. The Long-Term Climate Risk Index listed Sri Lanka and Puerto Rico as the top two affected countries. Sri Lanka was ranked fourth in the Climate Risk Index (CRI) in 2016. The Global Climate Risk Index 2019 analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by the impact of weather-related loss events such as storms, floods and heat waves.
The Report noted that altogether, more than 526,000 people died as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around US$ 3.47 trillion. The report was prepared to analyse damages caused by the extreme weather events that took place from 1998 to 2017. The Index said that in May 2017, heavy landslides and floods occurred in Sri Lanka after strong monsoon rains in southwestern regions and more than 200 people died after the worst rains in the island since 2003. The monsoons displaced more than 600,000 people from their homes and 12 districts were affected.
This Report should be thought of as a wake up call for climate-related action in Sri Lanka where Climate Change has clearly wreaked havoc in many areas. A decision has been taken not to permit more coal power plants, which is a step in the right direction. A recent ADB study concluded that Sri Lanka is well poised to generate all its power requirements from renewable energy including solar and wind. By this time, new technologies such as wave and geothermal power could also come into play. Moreover, the authorities have decreed that fossil fuel powered cars will no longer be registered after 2040, but more incentives should be given for electric vehicles to gain a momentum for this target. Deforestation should be stopped forthwith  in fact, new plans call for an increase in forest cover to over 32 percent. The usage of single use plastics should be drastically reduced.
Climate science should be introduced as a subject in the school curriculum, so that the future generation will have a greater understanding on the effects of Climate Change. After all, they will inherit this nation and we must ensure a healthy climate for them to live in, in more ways than one.
Empowering the Passport
The results of the Annual Passport Index are out and the top slot this year goes to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), whose passport enables visa-free entry to 167 countries. Singapore is in second place, tied with Germany, with free entry to 166.
The UAE has shot up the rankings of The Passport Index in recent times, having held 27th place just two years ago. This is an impressive achievement indeed. The fact that two Asian nations hold the top two positions is also significant. Singapores neighbour Malaysia has the eleventh most powerful passport in the world, with visa-free entry to 161 nations.
Neighbouring Maldives is ranked 51, with visa-free entry to 83 nations, while Indias passport is ranked 66th, with free entry to 65 countries. How about Sri Lanka We are languishing in the 84th spot, shared with Libya and Lebanon with visa-free entry to 45 countries, most recently to Laos.
This is no place for Sri Lanka to be in and indicates a systematic failure by successive Governments to negotiate with other countries for visa-free travel on behalf of Sri Lankans. To add insult to injury, some of the poorest countries in Africa including South Sudan are far ahead of Sri Lanka in the Passport Index, with visa free entry to many more countries. (However, the few Sri Lankans who have a US Visa on their passport can travel to 30 more countries with that visa).
Our foreign ministers and diplomats have successfully negotiated with many countries for visa-free travel using diplomatic passports, which does not serve any purpose for people-to-people contact. Sri Lanka is now a Middle Income country with a considerable percentage of the population having a good disposable income. The rise of Ultra Low Cost Carriers has made travel affordable even for the Middle Class.
It is therefore surprising that the authorities have not negotiated proactively at least with more Asian countries such as Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Cambodia, Vietnam as well as African and South American countries, without waiting for countries to give us visa-free travel unilaterally, like Indonesia did. Note that the UAE was 27th on the list just two years ago  they negotiated with at least 30 more countries in the meantime. We cannot go up the passport rankings automatically  we should do a lot more work to make our passport feel more welcome around the world.

UK and French leaders in major crises
Europe is at the core of international interest with major political crises in the United Kingdom and France. The leaders of both countries face rising opposition, Prime Minister Theresa May in Westminster and President Macron from Yellow Vest protesters.
The British House of Commons is posing a major threat to Theresa May as the debate on her Brexit Deal moves to a vote on Tuesday (11). May has faced three major defeats in the Commons this week, on her refusal to release to the Commons the legal advice given to the Government on the Brexit issue.
She is pushing ahead with Tuesdays vote, despite calls from senior ministers to delay the parliamentary clash and a near defeat, while her Northern Irish allies have increased threats to bring down the government if the Deal goes ahead.
Having failed in a bid to have the legal advice issue referred to the Privileges Committee of MPs, her government was found in contempt of parliament and forced to publish the legal advice, in a hugely humiliating defeat. This is the first time a UK government was found to be in contempt of parliament. The third defeat was over intended changes to the parliamentary process if the Commons votes down Mays Brexit Deal.
Theresa May and her Cabinet are trying hard to push the Brexit Deal, agreed with the European Union, as the only effective way of the UK leaving the EU on March 29, 2019. The rising opposition to the Deal is making it increasingly hard for May to present the Deal as the best way out of the EU.
Prime Minister Mays minority Conservative Government, is already losing the support of the 10-member Democratic Union Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland, who had an agreement to support May on major governance and financial issues. They see the Brexit Deal as wholly unfavourable to Northern Ireland. Nigel Dodds, leader of the DUP in the Commons, said the agreement falls short of delivering Brexit as one United Kingdom and would mean entering a twilight world where the EU is given unprecedented powers over the UK. The Opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn is wholly opposed to the Deal, as well as increasing numbers of Conservative MPs, as well as other smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats and Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP).
Jeremy Corbyn told the Commons it was a bad deal for the UK and that his party would seek a vote of no confidence in the government if it was thrown out by MPs. I hope and expect this House will reject that deal, he said. At that point, the government has lost the confidence of the House. Either they have to get a better deal from the EU or give way to those who will.
The leader of the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said the cold, hard truth was that the deal represented a moment of self-harm in our history.
The Conservative Whips in the Commons are reportedly making desperate efforts to prevent party members from voting against the Brexit Deal, with some pro-deal members saying its defeat in the Commons will be an attempt to steal Brexit from British people; which would be a democratic affront, and against 17.4 million people who voted for leaving the EU in the referendum held two years ago.
Those who oppose Mays Brexit Deal see it posing a major threat to the UK economy in the coming years, and one without full consideration of the impact of leaving the EU after more than 40 years, and not considering the impact of the many treaties signed with and within the EU. They see the voting for leaving the EU at the last referendum as uninformed, with voters were not given the economic and political facts of an exit.
With the increasing possibility of a defeat of Mays Brexit Deal, many see the Commons wresting control of the Brexit process from ministers, and a push for a Plan B' to prevent any chance of the UK leaving the EU without a deal in place, which is the No Deal Exit that Theresa May warns about. There is increased calls for a fresh referendum on Brexit, and the possibility of a majority in the Commons calling for a fresh General Election, in a situation where the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn have a major lead.
Macron retreats
President Emmanuel Macron made a major policy retreat this week, abandoning the fuel price increases, scheduled from January 2019, after three weeks of protests that also turned violent, over the cost of living and the hardships faced by the people. There are also moves for the protests to resume this weekend.
Although Macros had earlier said there would be no changes in economic and financial policies following the Yellow Vest protesters demonstrating in many parts of the country, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe had announced the fuel price delay in a TV address earlier this week. He said: anyone would have to be deaf or blind not to hear or see the anger of the people, seen in the protesters.
As protests increase, Macron has now abandoned the price increase.
Scores of protesting teens have also clashed with police at a high school west of Paris on Thursday, part of nationwide student action over university admissions procedures and rising administrative fees, leading to a widening of the Yellow Vest protests.
These protests, are carried out by non-politically organised activists, wearing the high-visibility yellow vests required by law to be carried in every motor vehicle for safety needs. The protests have grown into widespread anger at the government, and especially against President Macron, who was elected last year with an overwhelming mandate for sweeping economic reform. However, his popularity has fallen sharply in recent months amid accusations that he is a president for the rich', due to his economic policies.
Prime Minister Philippe earlier said there would be consultations across the country to see what accompanying measures might be introduced to ease the burden for the worst-off. He also said planned increases in gas and electricity prices this winter would be halted, and that a toughening of the rules for vehicle emissions tests would also be postponed.
Mr. Macron was elected President on a platform of economic reform, which would improve the lives of the French people via lower unemployment and a kick-started economy. But many feel that has not emerged. An analysis of the 2018-19 budget carried out by France's public policy institute, for example, found that incomes for the poorest quarter of households would largely drop or stay the same under the plans.
Middle-income earners would see a modest bump - but the greatest beneficiaries would be those who were already wealthy, in the top 1%. The pattern is worse for retired people - almost all of whom will be worse off.
Not enough
The Yellow Vests are not fully pleased with the temporary relief. They see it as a suspension of the tax rise and not an abolition, and suspect the government would reinstate the taxes later this year. They are reportedly in no mood to call off their protests.
What the government seeks is to satisfy a large enough bloc of moderates among the Yellow Vests, and wean them away from the barricades, to lose the momentum of the protests. Protesters are also demanding Macrons removal of the wealth tax concession that benefits the wealthiest 1% of people.
The climb down by President Macron, comes with his earlier insisting the measures are necessary to combat climate change and meet budget deficit reduction targets. The Yellow Vest protests come as the COP24 the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, takes place in Katowice in Poland, which is seeking to support and push further the decisions of 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) held in Paris. Macrons international image is largely associated with the decisions of the 2015 Climate Conference, and the protests and response to the Yellow Vests makes France move away from the key national decisions on Climate Change.
The Yellow Vest protests are seen by many analysts of French politics as a major shift in both national and regional politics, moving away from policy support for the rich and the business sector, to the demands of the wider public. This is seen as a rising shift in the politics in Europe, where the ruling parties of the past several decades losing ground to populist politics and the rise of non-liberal politics.
While President Macrons political party La Rpublique En Marche, a centrist, liberal and social-liberal party has a large parliamentary majority, it is fast losing popular support. Other parties of the right and left are now making efforts to capitalize and benefit from the current crisis in governance, but the trends are not in their favour, too. Populism is making strong headway.Roads leading to the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris were closed amid recent protests and riots.

UNPers call for party convention to select leader
A group of UNP Parliamentarians, Provincial Councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha members has called for a party convention to select its candidate for the premiership.
They have sent a letter to the General Secretary of the party requesting him to uphold the partys democracy by holding a special convention to select its Prime Ministerial hopeful.
United National Party former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake said UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is always talking of introducing the Lichchavi administration to the country, should run the party based on democratic principles as Lichchavis of Northern India during the Buddhas era.
Wickremesinghe cant talk of democracy at a time when there is no democracy in his own party, he said.
Attanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena has announced that he will never appoint Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and the party has to think about an alternate member.
It is up to the party to decide who is suitable to hold the post of Prime Minister rather than Wickremesinghe, Attanayake added.
Former Deputy Minister M. D. Premaratne said they have been advocating the party leader to step down to ensure that democracy reigns in the party for years.
This grand old party will fall into pieces if Wickremesinghe does not step down from party leadership, he said.
Premaratne added that Wickremesinghe destroyed democracy within the party. This party prospered as it was based on democratic principles, he said, adding that the party held the general convention every year when Dudley Senanayake was the leader. The former Prime Minister has the habit of sitting with party members until the members collectively elect him as the leader every year. That was how democracy reigned in our party. These democratic norms and practices are no longer in our party, he said.
Premaratne added that Wickremesinghe changed this practice from 1994 after Parliamentarian Ranjith Maddumabandara submitted a proposal at the UNP convention that Wickremesinghe should be in his position till his death.
A number of Parliamentarians including Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa opposed. But this proposal was adopted despite our opposition, he said.
The UNP cannot win an election until Wickremesinghe steps down from his party position, he added.
Former Parliamentarian Reginald Perera said the world knows that there is no democracy in the UNP. Parliamentarian Ranil Wickremesinghes policies do not suit the country. He will betray the country to remain in power, he said.
He said the country is unfortunate to have a leader of this nature. There should be political parties and party leaders should not hang on to the partys leadership. He should allow senior members to take over the leadership.
Perera said the present crisis can easily be solved if Parliamentarian Sajith Premadasa is appointed as the leader of the party and a convention should be held to select the next party leader for the well-being of the party, he said.
Former Minister Upali Somasiri said people in his electorate are of the view that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe does not think of the Sinhala Buddhist culture.
They want a leader who does not betray the country. They want a leader who really loves this motherland, he said.
He added that the UNP brought independence to the country. The country was brought under a massive development drive under the UNP. But the party is on the verge of ruin due to the narrow policies of Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.

We boycotted Speaker, not Parliament:Ranjith
Ratnapura District Parliamentarian Ranjith De Zoysa yesterday, said that they were not boycotting Parliament. We were only boycotting the Speaker, he said.
He said so on being questioned as to what they have to say about the criticism levelled against them by the members of the United National Party that they are the only government in the world to have avoided taking sittings in Parliament.
Zoysa said, This is the only Parliament in the world where the Speaker is acting as if he holds the powers of the President.
The Speaker and that the UNP members who take sittings in this Parliament are carrying out Parliamentary proceedings overriding the Standing Orders of Parliament and the Constitution.
During their sessions recently, UNP MP Lakshman Kiriella extended his appreciation to Speaker Jayasuriya for stabilizing the country, which is the job of the President and his Cabinet.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara went on to call President a Gamarala and other MPs put forth proposals against the media. The Speaker was to admit them.
If we did take sittings in Parliament as such, it could have been a misdemeanor inflicted by us on the proud history of Sri Lankas Parliament since 1831.
No Speaker in its history has done so much of damage to its traditions, he said.

WHAT IS LACKING IN OUR ROAD ENGINEERING
I believe that most of the people in our country experience the bitter ordeal of driving and walking on our road system almost daily. The world is fast becoming a global village paving the way for most of the people to walk on roads of other countries. A Sri Lankan who has never left the shores or has visited the countries in the undeveloped segment of the world would think that our road network could be better or even the best. But, people who have had the good fortune to visit the advanced countries could definitely have a different opinion with regard to the same. I am one of them.
I am writing this article to ignite road enthusiasm of both the public and the relevant authorities. The Daily News in which I thought to publish my findings, I proudly say, has always played the role of the watchdog of the nation. I jotted down some notes for writing this letter standing on the sidewalk of a public highway in Brisbane, Queensland in Australia.
Quality standard
As an inquisitive freelance journalist I strolled along this stretch of the road to create an accurate picture of this road and to help our engineers to take a leaf from their counterparts to uplift the road system in our country. The ironical tragedy is that it seems to me our own engineers have mastered their road engineering skills from the reputed universities of engineering and technology of this country and other countries of the same calibre.
I do not hesitate to mention here that our poor country might have not provided them with the necessary funds to cope with the related financial restraints they confront with in meeting the quality standard to pace with their counterparts in the advanced countries. The plethora of malpractices in the road sector also cannot be ignored.
One of the prominent observances I made is that in the road network here one could notice that there is a proper flow of rainwater along the roads. Garden water is directly drained to the accurately slopped highways that carries it to wide and deep man made water ways. I observed that within minutes the rapidly gathering rainwater is emptied into a properly maintained drainage system. Another predominant factor is that in most of the homesteads rainwater harvesting is done with utmost precision. They take rainwater as a blessing and thus they save their hard earned money by using rainwater for their daily use.
The local authorities rightly reward the rainwater harvesters due to its national significance. People do it driven by patriotic feelings towards the country. Even four or more laned road systems have been constructed with the accurate slope evenly for both sides from the mid elevation. In my long stay here and in Sydney I have never seen stagnant waters on the roads. We could see many an impassable portion on our only expressway after a rain for a few hours. One such spot is between Baddegama and Kurundugahahethepma on Kottawa Matara Expressway. Once I had a miraculous escape one rainy day there. God saved me. I thanked almighty God, but not our erudite road engineers. Another pivotal aspect is that transportation engineering and civil engineering disciplines seem not properly combined in our country. Where signal lights have to function, police officers are stationed.
Traffic lights
Our traffic lights also malfunction most of the time of the day. I myself have experienced that the drivers have to obey both the policeman and the signal light. When we obey the traffic light, we are given a charge sheet. When we obey the policeman, the vehicle is smashed for no fault of the driver. The left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing. People have to pay the price for the perennial defects of the system. Erroneously proportioned sleeping policemen are another death trap on our roads. Some sleeping policemen stand where their service is not needed for the smooth flow of the traffic. Faded colouring and the poorly maintained pedestrian crossings also pose a death threat to the road users.
In the Maldives one cannot see a developed road system in the widely spread islands. Yet, what I admire there is that the maintenance of the interior roads is entrusted with the householders who face the roads. We too can take a leaf from them and the light engineering aspect of the local roads could be entrusted to their counterparts here by offering them a nominal maintenance cost. Thus, we can successfully instill patriotism in people for the good of the country. In my five year teaching career there I derived much pleasure treading on their well-kept roads.
In fact, as a proud nation we also have our own road construction knowhow under our belt. Yet, we could derive much needed inspiration from the advanced countries without throwing the baby with soap water.
