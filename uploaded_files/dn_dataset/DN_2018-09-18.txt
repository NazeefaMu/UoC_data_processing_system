Two children among five dead in Angola football stampede
Luanda, Monday: Two children and three adults were killed in a stampede at a weekend football match in the Angolan capital Luanda, sparking an investigation, authorities said Monday.
The crush occurred Saturday as fans were leaving the CAF Champions League quarter-final match between Primeiro Agosto of Angola and TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the sports ministry said.
The incident caused the death by asphyxiation of five supporters and caused seven injuries at the end of the match, the ministry said in a statement.
The two children were aged 10 and 12, it said.
One survivor who gave his name only as Nemo, speaking to TV channel Zimbo from his hospital bed, said: The exit door was very small, many people fell.
The history of African football is marked by frequent deadly crowd stampedes. In Angola in February 2017, 17 people were killed and 58 injured near the northern town of Uige ahead of a season-opening match for the national championship.
Earlier this month, at least one person was killed and 37 injured in a stampede ahead of an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Madagascars capital Antananarivo.
And in July last year, eight people were killed when rival supporters clashed during Senegals League Cup final, and a stampede caused a wall to fall on escaping fans.
The scramble came after police used tear gas to clear the area surrounding the stadium.
In 2009, 19 people died in the Ivorian economic capital Abidjan after a crush in a qualifying match for the 2010 World Cup between Ivory Coast and Malawi. AFP

VAT on imported fabric reduced to 5 percent
Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera considering the requests made by the stakeholders in the fabric industry has reduced the Value Added Tax (VAT) on imported fabric to 5%.
Minister Samaraweera signed the gazette notification yesterday. Earlier the fabric was subject to Rs 100/kg CESS at the time of imports. The Budget- 2108 had proposed to impose a 15 % VAT on goods, the Value Added Tax Act No 14 of 2002 was amended accordingly, and the new VAT scheme came into effect from August 16, 2018.
As fabric was also subject to this 15% VAT, the importers, traders and industrialists engaged in using fabric as raw material for making ready-made garments had appealed to the Minister of Finance to provide them some relief as small scale traders and industrialists who are not covered under VAT Act have the adverse effect.
The Minister made this decision to amend the VAT act further to reduce the VAT on imported fabric to 5 percent considering the possibility of giving a helping hand to proposed small scale industrialists under the enterprise Sri Lanka scheme.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka, the subsidized loan scheme by the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media has introduced an interest subsidized loan scheme for medium and small-scale manufacturing industrialists and they can obtain fabric, as raw material at a low cost.

Vinotherapy
Grape..er great news! Red wine has been known to be a certified stress buster. Anyone who has quaffed down a sip or more can vouch for it. But apparently wine residue  pips and pulp  too has beauty benefits. A reason why vinotherapy is taking Europe by storm. Dating back to the ancient Romans, its a beauty therapy where wine-making residue is rubbed into the skin. It is said to have exfoliating qualities and helps reduce ageing.
The actual therapy involves a body scrub, massage or even a soak in a mixture of red wine infused with its byproducts like grape skin, seeds and vine branches. Many beauty brands too now use grapeseed oil or grape extract. But is vinotherapy good for you Dermatologist Dr Sumit Gupta is not convinced: At the most wine can help in terms of wellness but in terms of skin beautification there isnt any sort of demonstrable biological advantage of it. Whatever good things wine has, a grape juice has it too.
Maybe vinotherapy is just a touristy attraction. Gupta warns about following anything age-old at face value. While using wine byproducts get a pass, using actual wine on skin doesnt. Gupta adds, Any alcohol containing solution applied on the skin can have harmful effects. It can lead to dryness or reactivate any underlying skin disorder. For now, maybe just stick to sipping the wine!

Wallowed in paradox
This nation belongs to royalty. We have been familiar with that notion since the colonial times and then the Independence. But this same royalty seems to hinder the future of the nation, as most opinion leaders point out.
Peter Wedamuni Perera belongs to that cluster. He believes that Sri Lanka lags far behind other nations because of its royalty notion. He addresses that issue in his latest stage production, Royal Ibbek (A Royal Tortoise), along with a solution.
Our royalty doesnt seem to suit us. Our journey is much slower than a tortoise. Since Independence, we have not made much of a progress. It is disturbingly prevalent from the top class of the leadership to the lower strata of the society. That grim reality paints the metaphor of the tortoise. It is nothing but a paradox when you say royal tortoise because the two words sit in diametrically opposed poles. But that exactly explains where we are as a nation in todays highly globalised world. As a nation we still cannot overcome the social and political crises we are trapped in, Perera offered a prologue to his production.
Peters passion for drama materialized while he was still schooling. Drama and music ignited his passion. His schoolmaster D P Hettithanthri observed that passion and introduced him to Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra who in turn had him in the cast of Elova Gihin Melova Ava. That cleared the path for Peter to emerge as a professional dramatist.
He tested the waters as a professional in 1977 by scripting and producing Ambalakada Nade for the National Youth Council Drama Festival. He produced a series of dramas such as Man Mudliyar. Royal Ibbek is his latest production based on the reality that prevails in Sri Lanka at present.
The drama industry survives solely on patronage, as Perera observes. Over the counter tickets do not rake in money for the dramatists. Although that earns a considerable profit, it would not suffice to survive in the industry as a professional dramatist. One major hindrance for the drama industry is the musical concerts organized in a gala manner. That distracts the connoisseurs attention to a vivid sphere.
The stage play is an entertainment genre that demands serious attention. Its entertainment mode is much plainer than most other modes now available.
That was quite different before the open economy was introduced. In the seventies, I remember, the dramatists flourished without much patronage or sponsorship outside. Tickets available over the counter earn them bread and butter more than enough, Perera noted. Perera also observes a wide difference between the Sinhala and English audiences. The English productions usually staged at the Lionel Wendt attract a sizeable audience despite the comparatively exorbitant rates of the tickets. Incidentally, the productions are superior quality as well. The Sinhala productions do not attract a similarly sizeable audience even with lower ticket prices. It is a discouraging factor for the Sinhalese stage directors.
In a way, that blocks the path to genuine stage directors. Most talented stage directors tend not to waste their time on a futile project. It affects the Sinhalese drama industry in the long run, Perera observed.
****
Immediately following his school education, Peter Wedamuni joined the pioneering batch of Dhamma Jagoda Shilpa Shalikava to study theatre. The Shilpa Shalikava period connected him with the giants such as Ediriweera Sarachchandra, Henry Jayasena, Daya Alwis, Gamini Haththotuwagama and Sunitha Perera. Wedamuni studied with Ravindra Randeniya, Suminda Sirisena, H A Perera, Gamini Samarakone and Parakrama Niriella.
His maiden theatre effort, Ambalakada Nade, produced in 1977 was placed second as the best production. He also received several other accolades such as Ben Sirimanna Memorial Award given for the best actor along with the awards for the best make-up and the best emotional actor. Encouraged by that recognition, Wedamuni then produced Man Mudliyar in 1995. His Ahas Bandana reached the second round of State Drama Festival. His next play was Nadaya Dandukade.
In 2011, he was honoured with the Kalabhushana award in recognition of his service rendered to the Sri Lankan culture. Since then he has been engaged in composing melodies and lyrics.
Royal Ibbek is his latest theatre effort adorned by Edward Jayakodys music. The play stars Dimuthu Chinthaka, Rajasinghe Loluwagoda, Lakshman Amarasekara and Gamini Weerakone. The stage background is designed by Sirinatha Wickramasinghe.
Royal Ibbek will be premiered at the Namel-Malini Punchi Theatre on September 23 at 3.30 and 6.45 pm.

Where heaven meets hell
Wat Rong Khun, more widely known as Thailand's White Temple, is built with a very simple idea in mind. His creator, Chalermchai Kositpipat, wanted to create the most beautiful temple in the world. Undoubtedly, whoever steps inside this temple walks out with an indelible impression of it. There is simply no other place on Earth like Wat Rong Khun.
When you first find yourself standing in front of the temple, you are confronted with a cluster of desperate hands. This is hell - the endless pit of desires and human cravings, according to Buddhism. Once you cross the bridge above the "hell", you are greeted by the statues of the heaven guardians.
There's no turning back by this point, the way is only forward. In fact, the guard employed at the temple would actually shout at you if you tried to go backward. The symbolism of crossing the bridge from "hell" to "heaven" signifies the Buddhist path to enlightenment. The inside of the temple is full of modern cultural references intertwined with traditional Buddhist images. It is a piece of art on its own.
Yet, one cannot truly appreciate the story of this temple without having some light shed on the captivating life of its creator. Born in Chiang Rai, Chalermchai Kositpipat graduated from a traditional Thai school of arts. Whilst his early works include temples and murals in Thai Buddhist style, in Thailand, his art is regarded as controversial by some for it is a mix of modern culture symbols and traditional Thai art.
Throughout his life, he lived in Sri Lanka and London selling his art and making exhibitions in both Europe and Asia.
When Chalermchai acquired enough means to work on his own project, he returned to his hometown and decided to reconstruct then crumbling apart Wat Rong Khun.
To this day, he has spent over one million USD of his own money on the project. Though he doesn't shy away from donations, the artist had set an upper cap of 10 000 USD for any donations just so he could prevent the influence of donors on how the temple evolves.
In 2014, unfortunately, an earthquake in Chiang Mai damaged the temple. For a certain amount of time, Chalermchai thought of giving up on the project. Luckily, a team of engineers informed that no significant damages have been done to the temple. Not only did he decide to continue the project, he also made it the work of his lifetime.
Ironically enough, the temple seems almost like possessing a life of its own. Once new, it was crumbling apart from the old age. It was then restored, but only to be struck by an earthquake. Finally, a creative genius stepped forward and took the future of the temple upon himself.
It is the untold love story between the artist and his art that is most enchanting here.

All guns aimed at a single target
The JO and its ideological siblings in the yahapalana Government have turned all their guns on a single target  the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A).
Judging by the expressions of views by opponents of 20A, many seem to oppose its author more than the content. They allege that the JVP in league with the UNP was part of an international conspiracy to topple the previous regime. Hence, they reject 20A as not even worth considering.
The main charge is that by abolishing the executive presidency 20A is an attempt to betray the country to imperialist powers. However, they do not elaborate how that is done. Executive presidency was introduced in 1978 only. Before that it did not exist in Sri Lanka. Yet independent Sri Lanka was not betrayed by anyone to an outside power. On the other hand, nobody in his or her proper senses would say that the executive presidency was introduced to defend the country against external conspiracies. As known, it was introduced to facilitate the introduction of neo-liberal reforms and curtail is democratic rights of the people. Role of Parliament was devalued and the President assumed wide autocratic powers. Thus, the allegation of betraying the country is a figment of imagination of a deranged mind.
Executive presidency
The opponents of 20A claim that the unitary character of the State would be endangered, if the executive presidency is abolished. Actually, the unitary State was really threatened with insurrection precisely under the executive presidency and not before.
They also allege that 20A is a gateway to a federal constitution and federalism is a stepping stone towards a separate state. Federal states have successfully battled separatist movements and defeated them. Our closest neighbour India is an example.
Federalism is a form of democratic governance and not a catastrophe as opponents of 20A allege. Nor does 20A propose federalism. Federalism has become a dirty word due to its misinterpretation by communalist forces. Before independence the demand for federalism emerged not from the Tamils but from members of the Kandyan Sinhala community.
Federalism emerges not from the nature of the Constitution but from socio-economic policies of governments and their treatment of marginalized communities or minorities. It could arise equally under both federal and unitary constitutions.
Besides pure unitary or pure federal states are rare in the modern world. They are hybrid in character. Britain, for example is a unitary state with federal characteristics. In fact, it has even independent parliaments in Scotland and Ireland in addition to the central Parliament in London.
Opponents of 20A are also opposed to devolution. Devolution of power is an extension of democracy. To avoid encouraging centrifugal forces devolution is always accompanied by accommodating regional interests in the central government in various ways. Cabinet portfolios and other important positions are allocated to them so that they will also have a stake in its welfare and development. Some countries have Second Chambers in their legislatures. Such accommodation would create an interest among regional representatives to stick to the centre without agitating for separation. In India there has arisen a healthy tradition of peaceful coexistence of national and regional parties in running the central government.
The call for retention of the executive presidency defies both logic and historical experience. Executive presidency has been opposed from the day it was introduced. First, it was introduced without popular consultation. Second, it was a rush job. Third, ever since its adoption public agitation against it continues up to now with no recess. Several executive presidents elected to office had promised to abolish it. This includes the Present President. Even afterwards he had given public pledges to get it abolished. His party- the SLFP has somersaulted to oppose its abolition, albeit not officially, in a characteristically opportunist way. Ignoring history, Jonny-come  late politicos and some members of the Maha Sangha are asking why is there suddenly a demand for the abolition of the executive presidency. Perhaps they have been in deep slumber a la proverbial Kumbhakarana
Presidential candidates
The erosion of democracy and the rise of authoritarianism and family banditry could be discerned from the single example of the 18th Amendment of the Constitution which sought to perpetuate a dynastic rule. The architect and beneficiary of that Amendment has still not given up his ambition to reinstate the dynastic clan administration as evidenced from the announcement of a sibling to contest the presidency in 2020 and the lament about raising the minimum age of presidential candidates which de facto debarred his son from contesting. (Some of his cowboy lackeys even wanted to install the Baby as President even by extra-parliamentary means few days back!)
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution has taken away some powers of the executive president and vested them in Parliament. As a result the Prime Minister has become more powerful. It is strange that those who claim the president as a mere figure head want the same powerless presidency retained! This may be with an undeclared objective of bringing back the 18th Amendment.
20A should be judged from the substance of its content instead of coming to a priori conclusions from the past history of its proponent or on flimsy grounds who (in the JVP) is hobnobbing with whom (in the UNP).
Chairman Mao said that power comes from the barrel of a gun. Whether its a single barrel, double barrel or a multi-barrel gun he has been proved correct in most instances. But before taking up the gun people would take positions democratically and resort to peaceful means for taking power. It is the sovereign people who wield that power. Without people Constitutions are not worth the paper it is written on. Even Uncle Sam would be helpless against the people united.

Beckinsale done with  Underworld film series
Those who have been holding out hope for a new Underworld movie may want to prepare for disappointment. At the very least, dont expect Kate Beckinsale to suit back up as Selene in the future, as the actress has firmly ruled out a return to the franchise. Heres what Beckinsale had to say about it when asked if she would do another Underworld in a recent interview.
I wouldnt return. Ive done plenty of those.
Not a lot of wiggle room in there for interpretation. Cut, dry and quite bluntly stated. Kate Beckinsale has starred in five movies in total as Selene, starting with 2003s Underworld. She most recently returned to the role in last years Underworld: Blood Wars, which actually brought in a franchise-low $81 million at the global box office and wasnt particularly well-received, to say the least. So, not only is Beckinsale not interested in returning, but it appears as though much of the desire to see these movies has dried up as well.
To date, the Underworld movies have grossed $540 million at the global box office, peaking with 2012s Awakening, which made $160 million. Just because Kate Beckinsale is done, it doesnt mean there cant be another movie, it just wouldnt have her in it.

BOI HOLDS DISCUSSIONS WITH SINGAPORE LEGAL PROFESSIONALS, BUSINESS DELEGATION
The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) hosted a delegation of 25 members from the Singapore Business Federation and Law Society of Singapore.
The delegation consisted of entrepreneurs and senior lawyers led by Gregory Wijeyendran, President of the Law Society of Singapore.
The Law Society of Singapore is a body established under the Legal Profession Act and represents 5,400 lawyers in private practice in Singapore. The Society carries out various statutory functions including maintaining and improving the standards of conduct and learning of the legal profession of Singapore and other functions.
The BOI was represented by Duminda Ariyasinghe, Director General of the BOI, Prasanjith Wijayatilake, Executive Director (Investment Promotion), Nilupul De Silva, Director (Investment Promotion), Dilip S Samarasinghe, Director (Media & Publicity), Manilal Ranasinghe, Deputy Director (Investment Promotion).
Gregory Wijeyendran said, From the presentation that the BOI made we have got many details of investment opportunities available in Sri Lanka. Some of our clients may be interested in investing and lawyers have the capacity to bring clients to countries such as Sri Lanka.
Trade is a critical factor in the relations between Sri Lanka and Singapore we look forward to building trade between the two countries. There are considerable synergies between Sri Lanka and Singapore. Singapore is a gateway to South East Asia while Sri Lanka is a gateway to South Asia. Both countries can therefore build up on their excellent connections within their respective regions, he added. Singapore has been traditionally an important source of investment to Sri Lanka and many high profile BOI enterprises are in fact Singaporean investments. Singapore is in fact ranked 7th among investing nations with a cumulative FDI of US$ 675 million invested by Singaporean enterprises in the period2005 up to the first half of 2018.
Among the leading investing enterprises from Singapore currently in Sri Lanka are Overseas Realty (Ceylon) Ltd (high rise buildings including the World Trade Center and Havelock City complex), Prima Ceylon Ltd (grain and flour based products), Heineken Lanka Ltd (Beer and Stout), LeochLanka (Pvt) Ltd (Lead acid batteries), Inoac Polymer (Pvt) Ltd (Manufacture of foam  Polythene foam), YKK Lanka (Pvt) Ltd (manufacture of Zippers), VasanEye Hospital (specialty eye care), The Lanka Hospital Corporation (Multi  Specialty hospital) and other companies. It is expected that with the Free Trade Agreement, Singaporean investments to Sri Lanka will further increase.
BOI is now focused on attracting enterprises that are engaged in the manufacturing sector as the infrastructure sector is already well established. Sri Lanka is also interested in promoting the services and logistics sectors.
Sri Lanka is committed to building a business environment which is transparent and also seeking investments that would not damage the countrys pristine natural environment. The Singaporean delegation also said that Singapore has traditionally looked at Sri Lanka as a country which has high quality human resources and several of its members in fact have their origins in the Island.
One of Sri Lankas strengths is a transparent business culture which the BOI is fostering and Singaporean investors should deal directly with the BOI to ensure that the best services are provided to the investors.

Boost for ornamental fish breeding
An export-oriented countrywide programme to promote ornamental fish breeding will be launched soon.
This is because ornamental fish has a big international demand, Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economy State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
It has also been planned to set up exporters' and ornamental fish export zones at district level to facilitate this programme, he said.
The State Minister was addressing a workshop at the National Aquaculture Development Authority, recently, to prepare a strategic plan for the promotion of ornamental fish breeding industry.
State Minister Wedaarachchi said the workshop was a good omen for the development of the ornamental fish breeding industry since it would be a good forum to discuss problems and find solutions.
He said ornamental fish exports would also help boost the national economy. It would also be a good self-employment avenue for people in the villages. Coral reefs and aquatic plants too had a big demand internationally. As such, they could also deliberate on this subject too and arrive at decisions to promote this aspect, he added.
State Minister Wedaarachchi, who emphasised that they should team up with the private sector too to march forward in this direction, said he would call upon all to dedicate their efforts towards the development of the ornamental fish breeding industry.

Carrier celebrates new local entity in Sri Lanka
Carrier announced the opening of its new office and newly expanded product offering in Sri Lanka. Leveraging global expertise and an extensive portfolio, this newly formed entity will increase the accessibility of Carrier staff and services and the availability of their end-to-end air conditioning solutions, enabling shorter lead times and better customer service.
The key reason for opening an office in Sri Lanka was to be closer to our customers and offer them energy efficient air conditioning solutions from Carrier and Toshiba, said Arun Bhatia, Managing Director, UTC Climate, Controls & Security, India Region. Carriers philosophy over the years has been to offer the right heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) solutions.
Carrier is a world leader in high-technology heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration solutions. Leveraging Carriers global expertise and extensive portfolio, this newly formed entity will increase the accessibility of Carrier staff and services and the availability of our end to end air-conditioning solutions in Sri Lanka. Being locally present will enable us to offer shorter lead times and better customer service, he said.
Carrier has been focused on Sri Lanka for some time. We are now investing locally by launching full-fledged operations to serve our customer in Sri Lanka. Carriers philosophy over the years has been to offer the right HVAC solutions for the right applications, which ensures that our customers benefit over the complete life cycle of our products, he said.
We will be launching top-of-the-line, superior quality products from two brands, Carrier and Toshiba, which operates through a joint venture. All products will be fit for local use in Sri Lanka, while we bring our global expertise in offering high energy efficiency and advanced technological features for modern buildings, he said.
Customer care is one of the core values of Carrier and will remain a focus in Sri Lanka as well. With the opening of a new branch, we will provide local customers with best-in-class products, installation and after sales services. In particular, we will bring the latest technologies in connected services, where HVAC equipment is connected to command centre. In addition, with the use of data analytics, we will offer enhanced services, including prognostics, to deliver higher up time and energy optimization, he said.
Carrier and Toshiba operate through Toshiba-Carrier Corporation (TCC), a joint venture established in 1999 between United Technologies and Toshiba Corporation that has since developed an extensive global footprint to offer new, innovative and customized solutions and products to customers. The alliance combines Carriers and Toshibas complementary product offerings and capabilities in technology innovation, manufacturing, quality assurance, and sales and marketing, he said.
In Sri Lanka,Carrier will offer air conditioning products from two brands: Carrier and Toshiba. Carrier is known as the inventor of modern air conditioning and will bring world-class products to Sri Lanka. Toshiba, the inventor of inverter air-conditioning technology, will offer top-of-the-line, high-quality products with Japanese technology. The product and service offerings from both brands are differentiated based on the customer segments and their needs, he said.
Carrier will offer a complete range of air conditioning solutions from residential to light commercial and commercial products and services. The offerings will cater to all customer segments and applications including commercial buildings, hotels, hospitals, residential projects, small offices, banks and retail shops, he said.
Carrier is a world leader in high-technology heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration solutions and has a legacy of more than 115 years. Toshiba has a long history with air conditioning and pioneering innovative technologies. As global brands, we shall continue to invest in both the products as well as brand promotion in Sri Lanka to ensure we provide right solutions to our customers, he said.
Carrier has world-class manufacturing facilities around the world. For our Sri Lankan customers, products will be sourced from our excellent factories in India and China. Toshiba has factories in Thailand and Japan. The customer requirements shall be fulfilled through these factories, depending on the type and mix of products being ordered, he said. Sri Lanka is certainly a focus for Carrier and thats one of the reasons we have established a dedicated office here. We are very optimistic about our new entity and believe, our customers will appreciate the benefits our local presence has to offer. At this point, we have existing world-class factories which shall fulfill Sri Lanka requirements, he said.
We are proud to state that with both Carrier and Toshiba, we have an extensive range of product solutions and services to offer. From residential products including hi-walls, to light commercial products, including cassettes, ducted and variable refrigerant flow (VRF), to commercial applied products, including chillers and airside, we have all the product ranges covered. Apart from that, customer care will remain a focus for us. We will strive to provide to local customers best-in-class installation and after sales services. In particular, we will bring the latest technologies on connected services, where the HVAC equipment is connected to command centre. In addition, with the use of data analytics, we will offer enhanced services, including prognostics, to deliver higher up time and energy optimization, he said.
Yes, we already have a good network of channel partners in Sri Lanka who are helping us to build our presence in Sri Lanka by selling, installing and servicing both Carrier and Toshiba air conditioning products, he said.
The HVAC segment in Sri Lanka is growing at a fast pace primarily owing to the rise in commercial construction activity. This segment is driven by products like ducted, cassette, VRF, chillers and air handling units (AHUs). The popularity is due to product durability and a shift in the industry toward more sustainable solutions. Apart from this B2B segment, Sri Lanka is also seeing rapid residential growth. Customers are emphasizing energy efficiency to lower costs, he said.
The air conditioning industry plays a significant role in energy conservation, given that buildings consume 40% of the worlds energy and, within a building, the HVAC system contributes approximately 40% to the total energy consumed, he said. At Carrier, sustainability is one of our top strategic priorities. We focus on two aspects - developing innovative and energy-efficient HVAC solutions to reduce energy consumption for customers, and making products that utilize lower GWP refrigerants. Our range of air conditioners under the Carrier and Toshiba brands address both these, he said. Carrier has been growing consistently over the past few years in Sri Lanka while mainly focusing on the chiller segment. With our local office opening and channel network established, we hope to expand into other segments of air-conditioning, namely room air-conditioners, light commercial and VRF. We will continue to invest to further build the trust of our customers in Sri Lanka over the coming years, he said.
Carrier is a world leader in high-technology heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration solutions. The company will offer a complete range of air conditioning solutions from residential to light commercial and commercial products and services. We will introduce some of the latest products, which have recently been launched in the Asia region. These world-class products will be sourced from factories including in India, China, Thailand and Japan, and will fulfill Sri Lankan customer requirements, he added.

Comedy and twists in  A Simple Favor
Paul Feig has become a major name in comedy over the years. His last four movies have been blockbusters: Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy and yes, Ghostbusters. To some, his latest movie, A Simple Favor, may seem like something different, but its more of a Paul Feig movie than you may be expecting.
Based on the novel by Darcey Bell, the story follows single mom Stephanie (Anna Kendrick), who becomes friends with Emily (Blake Lively) when their sons have a playdate. One day, Emily asks Stephanie to pick up her son during a work emergency. Emily never returns, and this is just as surprising to Emilys husband (Henry Golding). The plot thickens and the trailer definitely teases the films twists and turns, but there are still moments for macabre humour and outright silliness.

Ruwan De Silva, the Organizing Committee Chairman of Construct 2018 delivering the welcome address lamented the problems faced by the construction industry as a result of out dated policies and regulations.
While expressing his happiness that there were many large scale development projects being implemented in the country, he pointed out that the local contractors face severe hardships due to some of the out dated rules & regulations and ad-hoc practices adopted by the Government ministries. He pointed out that this is one of the main reasons for the frequent payment delays and cash flow problems faced by the local contractors, consultants and the supply chain in the industry.
He said, The current procurement procedures and methods and the Conditions of Contract currently used in public and private sector are disadvantageous to local contractors, especially when they have to face competition from Chinese companies in Sri Lanka. According to the report issued by Finance ministry, half of the government development projects managed under the line ministries have not even achieved 50% of the quarter one targets. As it is evident from this, the Government is facing challenges in achieving its development targets. We are of the view that apart from labour shortage and low productivity in the industry, rules and regulations and procurement procedures adopted by the ministries are the main causes for this delay in implementing development projects. This problem is further aggravated by delays in decision making and inefficient policy-making.
He appealed to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Housing & Construction to look into these matters and to seriously address these strategically important concerns for the construction industry and country.
The theme of the Construct 2018 exhibition was Inno-Smart Sri Lanka. The exhibition itself lived up to its reputation as the largest construction exhibition in the country. It covered an exhibition area of more than 35,000 square feet for over 350 exhibitors and attracted more than 40,000 local and international visitors comprised of manufacturers, service providers, contractors, developers, architects, quantity surveyors, engineers, consultants, buyers and industrial professionals from the construction industry.
The exhibition provided the exhibitors with enormous opportunities to introduce their latest technologies, launch their new products & solutions, network with potential buyers and gain valuable insight in to the Sri Lankan construction market place.
Visitors at the exhibition were able to view all aspects in construction and infrastructure development, including even the smallest component to the heavy machinery & equipment and gain substantial knowledge & awareness of the latest technology.

Crazy Rich Asians
Diversity  in ethnicity  and experiences
You cannot for a second accuse Crazy Rich Asians of failing to deliver on its title. Almost every one of its characters has a fat bank account and is not afraid to show it, as gaudily and fabulously as they possibly can.
That title, larky and campy as it is, is something else, too. Its a statement. The past five years or so have seen studios finally pulling their finger out when it comes to putting money behind movies with casts that are predominantly non-white and there has been a lot of focus on the success of movies with largely black casts  Black Panther, Girls Trip, Straight Outta Compton, etc. Crazy Rich Asians is a statement that diversity means a whole range of ethnicities and experiences, and everyone should be included. It clearly knows its important, as the first major studio movie of the century with an Asian cast, but it wears that importance lightly, and festooned in sequins. It is a hoot, subtly very clever, and one of the best romantic-comedies of the decade.
At the centre of an enormous cast are Constance Wu and Henry Golding as Rachel and Nick, a young, attractive couple living in New York, where both work as professors at NYU. Things are getting serious and when Nick is due to go to Singapore, where his best friend is getting married, he asks Rachel to come along. Rachel knows most of Nicks family is in Singapore. What she does not realise, until they arrive, is that Nicks family owns most of Singapore. He is the heir to the fortune of a real estate dynasty and something of a national celebrity. As Rachel is introduced to his enormous extended family she learns that many people dont want to let the countrys most eligible bachelor go to some interloper American. Unfortunately, that group includes Nicks mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh).
Director Jon M. Chus CV is an erratic list, taking in two Step Up movies, two Justin Bieber concert films, the G.I. Joe sequel and Now You See Me 2. What all those movies have in common is a good amount of dazzle, and he brings that here. Whether its a wedding of such ludicrous grandiosity that the aisle is turned into a babbling brook before the bride makes her (confusingly damp) entrance, or a family party that resembles a royal gala, he revels in the opulence of his characters rarefied lives. And while the past works of cinematographer Vanja Cernjul dont show anything comparably glossy, he does the movie proud. You never suspect these Asians are merely moderately well off.
What Chu also shows, better than he ever has before, is control of character. Initially the film is jolly and sweet, with jokes that raise a smile if not an out-loud laugh, but it gets more charming and funnier as the characters bed in and their real insecurities beneath their expensive surface start to show through. Rachel, superbly played by Wu, comes through particularly strongly, a woman who is out of her element but quick to adapt. It manages to make her dismay about dating a secret billionaire genuinely sympathetic.
Its common in films with so many players for things to become jumbled, for characters to feel included to just add another name to the cast, but Chu knits them all together fluently. The supporting cast is full of great turns, particularly Gemma Chan as a millionaire with an insecure husband, and Michelle Yeoh. Leaving them all for dust, though, is Awkwafina, as Rachels best friend Goh Peik Lin, who looks like an illustration of the Dolly Parton quote, It takes a lot of money to look this cheap. Despite being in her twenties, she has the qualities of someone like Joan Rivers body-swapped with a trust-funded millennial.
Amid all the laughter, Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lims adaptation of Kevin Kwans 2013 novel works in some interesting conversations about the changes in Asian culture as it has travelled around the world. The film is fantastical, but it has a lot of real-world points to make and feels like a discussion thats only just getting started. A sequel is already in the works, and it cant come soon enough.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 02
Do you have, what it takes to be a smart entrepreneur
Whether you dream about owning your own small business someday or you are currently living the reality of being your own boss, you know that money is important. Just as your car will not run without fuel, you cannot sustain a roof over your head and provide food, clothing and the rest of lifes necessities if you cant pay for them.
Likewise, you cannot start your own small business or continue buying what you personally want and supply the needs for your business without money, at least for the first year or two. Thats where getting your personal finances in tip-top shape comes into play.
Let us take a look at the motivation for handling your personal finances before ever starting a business.
Revenue and profit volatility. Businesses rarely make a consistent stream of revenue, especially in their first few months and years of development. It might be years before you break a profit, which means it will be difficult - if not impossible - for you to draw a salary or live off the profits of the business early on. If youre already in a bad financial position, that volatility will make life even more difficult for you - and may require you to make even more personal sacrifices.
Business demands. Businesses are expensive; you will have to invest in several big-ticket items, as well as dozens of small items that pop up every month. If your business needs a sudden influx of cash, and your businesss resources cant accommodate the overflow, having a small personal stockpile can come in handy; that way, you wont have to open a new line of credit or seek new funding to cover the gap.
Finetuning the business. Though the worlds of personal and business finance are very distinct in some ways, they share a lot of similarities. Both require attention to detail, careful budgeting, and ongoing management and adjustment to be successful. If you spend a period of years getting your personal finances in order, you can use that experience to become a better business manager. Conversely, if you have never learnt the basics of financial management, youll have a hard time finding success in the realm of business finance.
Image and credit. Your personal credit score can also have a bearing on your success as an entrepreneur. For starters, banks are going to look at your personal credit score when deciding whether to extend credit to your or your business (at least, when your business launches and does not have a financial history of its own). In some cases, investors may also check your personal history; if they see a delinquent financial past, they may be less willing to extend funding to your business, questioning your abilities as a fiscally responsible manager.
Time management. Entrepreneurs tend to work long hours, into nights and weekends, and have packed schedules that make it difficult to find time for personal management. If you do not get your personal finances in order before you become an entrepreneur, you may not have a chance to work on them once you become an entrepreneur. Think of your pre-business time as your last chance to get your personal life organized before your professional life begins to take over.
The possibility of failure. Even if you are optimistic about your businesss future, and it seems like the business should be profitable indefinitely, the failure rate of start-ups is high. If it fails, you will be out of a job, and your primary intended source of income will immediately deplete. On top of that, you might have to deal with the lasting effects of debt. The better prepared you are going into your business, the better prepared you will be to handle this unfortunate scenario. As with most things in life, its better to hope for the best but prepare for the worst.
Strategies
Now we are aware of the importance of getting your personal finances in order before starting a business, but what strategies should you use to get there
Audit your position. Your first step should be running a full audit of your current position. How much are you currently making every month How much are you currently spending, and how are you spending it What debt do you currently hold How much do you have in FDs and savings How much do you have invested in long-term accounts, such as EPF/ETF If you cant answer these questions, you may not be aware of your current financial position. Seek to answer them confidently before moving on.
Consolidate your debts. Personal debt is one of the biggest hindrances when starting a new business; if you are strapped with debt payments, you will have less financial flexibility. High amounts of debt also increase your personal financial risk if the business does not succeed. You can mitigate the effects your debts have by taking out a debt consolidation loan, which can reduce your total interest rate and collect your debts under a single umbrella.
Eliminate your debts. While youre at it, try to reduce your debts as much as possible. While your mortgage, auto loan, and student loans arent a big deal, you should enter the world of entrepreneurship with as little credit card debt and other types of consumer debt as possible. Start making more than the minimum payments, and get yourself to a respectable position before you try collecting money for your start-up. Youll thank yourself if your business is not able to generate as much revenue as you initially thought.
Minimize your expenses. Assume that your business will not generate enough profit for you to draw a reasonable salary; in this case, youll be relying on your personal savings, secondary income, and what little income you can draw from the business to get by. Accordingly, you should set new goals for your monthly expenses; aim to keep them as low as possible without significantly interfering with your lifestyle. That will likely mean cancelling subscriptions, reducing your travel and consumption, and possibly even moving so you can downsize your living space.
Accrue an emergency fund. Before starting a business, you definitely need an emergency fund - at least six months worth of expenses. This will provide you with a cushion in case your business is not generating revenue, or in case it goes under unexpectedly. It will also provide you with a pocket you can draw upon in case the business needs an injection of funding to stay alive.
Establish secondary lines of income. If you can, build at least one secondary line of income so it is easier for you to stay afloat in case of business volatility in the near future. There are many ways to do this; for example, you could start a side hustle if youre willing to put in some extra hours of work. If not, you can also establish a secondary line of income using rental property, or by withdrawing dividend pay-outs from your stock investments.
Improve your credit score. It is a good idea to boost your credit score into the excellent range, if you can. This will make it far easier for you to get any loans you need, you will get better terms on any financial products you use, and you might even look better to prospective investors. Improving your credit score takes months, or sometimes years of effort, but is easy so long as you make your payments on time, limit your debt, and avoid opening too many lines of new credit.
Save for your initial business investments. After minimizing your expenses and setting up a second line of income, you should not have a problem setting aside some extra money, on top of your typical savings, to put into your business. This initial lump sum will help you fund your licensing fees, equipment, space, and other immediate investments.
Are you ready
Now, are you financially ready to own a business How can you tell if you are personally financially ready to start your own business
You understand business costs. If you understand how much your business needs, and what it requires to become profitable, youll be in a good position of financial knowledge.
Youre free of bad debt (or close to it). You dont have to be completely rid of your bad debts, but you should be in the process of eliminating it, and you should have it under control.
You have a good or excellent credit score. The better your credit score is, the higher your chances of success will be.
You have money to spare. Make sure you have some cash set aside for more business expenses, and some as an emergency reserve.
If all these prerequisites apply to you, and you feel confident in your business idea and ability to manage the business moving forward, you should feel ready to take the next steps. With your personal finances organized and under control, your chances of business success will be even higher.
Financial Planning
Financial planning is the process of wisely managing both your personal and business finances so that you can achieve your goals and dreams. You can do financial planning on your own or with the assistance of a financial planner.
Either way, it makes sense to follow a financial planning process that includes: (1) Setting realistic financial and personal goals, (2) Evaluating where you are now financially, (3) Developing a plan to reach your goals, (4) Putting your plan into action Monitoring your plan to stay on track with changing goals and circumstances
Advice
One important advice: Keep your business and personal finances separate. It is important because it gives more credibility and legitimacy to your business.

Double-Dutch jumping dog
A Maryland woman's rescue dogs have both made their way into the Guinness Book of World Records for their jumping skills.
Samantha Valle's greyhound, Feather, was honored by Guinness after her 75.5-inch high jump was determined to be the highest jump by a dog.
Valle's other dog, a border collie named Geronimo, earned records for most skips by a dog in one minute, 91, as well as most double dutch skips by a dog in one minute, 128.
Valle said both animals were rescue pets.
Geronimo's "name was actually Cricket when I got her," Valle said.
"Little black and white, tan-grey puppy she was so cute. On the way home on the drive from the pound, she tried to jump out the window and that's how she got her name Geronimo."
Valle said she hopes Feather and Geronimo can serve as examples of rescue dog success stories.
"I feel like people have a lot of misconceptions about rescue dogs. Like 'oh someone threw it away, there must be something wrong with it' - but I really enjoy taking people's throwaway animals and making them into something great."

Economist signals another defeat for Rajapaksa
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas breakaway faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is set for another humiliating defeat at next years presidential elections, according to the track record of the London-based Economist Group.
The subscription-based Economic Intelligence Unit, an arm of the Economist Group, in its latest report on Sri Lanka has predicted that Rajapaksas SLPP, a breakaway faction of the SLFP, will win both the next presidential and parliamentary elections.
The research and analysis arm of the London publication made an identical prediction in December 2014, just three weeks before the presidential election. Mahinda Rajapaksa is likely to win the presidential election, the EIU said on December 18, 2014.
Three weeks later, Maithripala Sirisena, a politician who had been written off by the EIU, romped home with a majority of 449,000 votes, much more than the 180,000 majority Rajapaksa gained a decade earlier.
The latest EIU report has even got some of the basic facts wrong. It talks about a presidential election in 2020. In fact, constitutionally, the poll must be held between November 8, 2019, and December 8, 2019.
The EIU applied the local council election results to arrive at its conclusion that Rajapaksas SLPP will emerge winner of the next parliamentary election too. The February council results were indeed a wake-up call to the Prime Minister and his United National Party, but those results cannot be applied to parliamentary elections conducted under a different system.
Based on the EIU track record on predicting Sri Lankan election results, several social media users asked if the London publication got their vital intelligence from Sumanadasa Abeygunawardena who predicted a thumping Rajapaksa victory in 2015.
Unlike the EIU, however, the Sri Lankan astrologer Abeygunawardena apologised to his fans saying that he had known all along that Rajapaksa was doomed, but he hadn't had the heart to tell him that he would lose.

Fast-track these cases
President Maithripala Sirisena has voiced his concern at the slow progress in instituting legal proceedings against members of the Security Forces implicated in various acts of criminality during the former regime. Speaking to Heads of print and electronic media and editors at the Presidential Secretariat on Friday, the President said the police and the CID should ensure that the legal process be taken to its conclusion, regardless of the outcome, instead of letting the matters lie in abeyance after the initial arrest is made. He made particular reference to the case involving commodore D.P.K. Dassanayake. The Naval officer who was implicated in the disappearance of eleven Tamil youth was first arrested and then released, with no follow-up legal action and none the wiser as to what has become of the case.
Like the President said, the issue would give rise to political implications adding grist to the mill of the Joint Opposition's constant refrain of a witch-hunt being carried out against war heroes by the Yahapalanaya Government. If these cases are decided, one way or the other, no one would be able to point the accusing finger at the government of witch-hunts, since it will be the courts which will be the final arbiter, if those taken in are guilty or not. Besides, leaving these cases in abeyance would also amount to denial of justice on behalf of the victims and a negation of the rule of law, if indeed those arrested in fact are implicated. Commodore Dassanayake was taken into custody and held in remand for a lengthy period and even brought before courts from time to time. The Joint Opposition made a big song and dance, with some pro-Rajapaksa Buddhist monks too voicing their protest at the treatment meted out to a war hero who was personally credited with destroying LTTE vessels at high sea.
Suddenly he was released on bail and to-date no one knows what became of the case. In fact it is an injustice on the ex-naval officer, as well, to keep the matter hanging over him like the Sword of Damocles. All such cases, particularly those where members of the security forces are implicated, should be disposed of until they are decided one way or the other and the air cleared.
Not just the ex-Security Forces personnel. Even the celebrated cases against members of the Rajapaksa family and their close associates that were opened with much fanfare by this Government have retreated into the forgotten things of limbo. What became of the famous sil redi case involving the former Secretary to the ex-President where it is alleged public funds to the tune of Rs. 650 million was used for election bribes, it is pertinent to inquire. There is also no inkling as to the progress of the cases where the progeny and siblings of the former President were allegedly involved. There was the matter of Yoshitha Rajapaksa spending Rs. 40 million to set up a private TV station and the acquisition of valuable property in Dehiwela which then became famous as the Daisy Aatchi case. The second son of the former President was shown on Television taking a ride in the prison bus, an indication that the court thought it fit to send him to remand prison due to the seriousness of the offense. However, YR is now not only a free bird but the other day was seen actively involved at the venue of the Janabalaya protest, perhaps putting the whole prison episode behind him as a bad experience.
The case where Basil Rajapaksa is alleged to have illegally acquired real estate in Malwana and built on it a luxury premises for a hotel project too appears to have lost steam and so it is with the Hi-Corp case where it is alleged that Namal Rajapaksa siphoned off Rs.30 million.
There are also the murders of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunga and Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen which, for all intents and purposes, have reached a dead end. Even the special courts set up to speed up the hearings appear to have hit a snag with suspects being granted bail. True, court procedures have to be strictly followed except that these only add to the frustration of those yearning for justice.
The Yahapalanaya Government had been in office for over three years and during this time hardly any culprit involved in cases of murder or corruption under the Rajapaksa regime had been brought to justice, to the disappointment of the overwhelming majority who voted for a regime change. This frustration was given expression to at the recent LG election. The Government can continue to ignore the public feelings on this score only at a great cost to it. No doubt, the Janabalayas and other shows staged by the Joint Opposition have huge funds pumped into them which can only come from the massive war chest amassed during the 10 year Rajapaksa rule. So far the Government had failed to discover the sources of these funds and also the avenues by which they were earned while it talks of getting more and more people to pay taxes from their hidden wealth.

Fitness after fifty
Proper exercising of the body by the middle-aged and the elderly can turn the ageing clock back by as many as 10 to 25 years. No matter at what age a person starts exercising, changes and improvements will occur. Even moderate exercises can retard the negative effects of ageing, and can also reverse them. They will improve heart and respiratory functions, increase muscle and bone strength, promote quicker reaction times and reduce susceptibility to stress and depression. Such are the findings of a survey conducted by a research team in the University of Toronto, Canada, led by Professor Roy J. Shephard, an expert on Exercise and Ageing.
Exercise is a fountain of youth. You do not have to run marathons to reap the benefits. Rapid walking for about 30 minutes at a time, three or four times a week can help you to become younger, feel younger and enjoy life as youth, once more, says Professor Shephard inviting the senior citizens of the world to try the methodology. Thus the findings of the learned Professor and his expert team have contradicted, beyond doubt, the widespread belief that the elders can never improve physiologically, but show their decline instead.
Routine exercises
In another study by Dr. Herbert A de Vries, a pioneer in the use of exercise physiology to explore the process of ageing, conducted through over 300 men and women of 56 to 87 year age group, found after six weeks of routine exercises, that their blood pressure had dropped, body fat decreased, maximum oxygen transport increased and nervous tension diminished. In his research book Fitness After Fifty de Vries noted men and women of 60 and 70 became as fit and energetic as those 20 to 30 years younger.
Besides the aforesaid, even more recent studies have indicated that exercise can help delay most of the age-associated declines. It is because exercise lowers the resting heart rate and increases the amount of blood pumped with each beat in older people. Stress on bones through exercises sends the calcium levels high, which eventually helps to improve resistance to fractures. Nevertheless, exercising by the elderly is not without risk. According to Dr. Charles Godfrey, another Canadian specialist in Rehabilitation Medicine, jumping, jogging, rigorous running or brisk walking for longer hours for those over 50 years, may expose them to the possibility of causing self-inflicted injuries, even though exercise is the only way out so long as it is done methodically and scientifically.
Scientifically, there are three major types of exercises that help to achieve highest possible quality of life. First comes the Endurance type of exercise activities. The ideal activities in this type for most older people are brisk walking, swimming, cycling on a stationary bicycle or using a rowing machine. It is best to pursue one of more of them continuously for 30 minutes, three or four times a week. Any of them will help conditioning the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, thus fighting the occurrence of physical weaknesses due to ageing.
Strengthening exercises
Body and limb Strengthening exercises are the second type. Here, lightweights, hand and leg weights are used, beginning with very light weights and progressively increasing the weight used, as the exercise is continued three to four times a week.
While weight machines could also be used, exercises like single leg lifts, finger presses and bent-leg curl-ups could also be carried out. Within 7 to 10 months, increase in muscle strength from about 40 to 75 percent could be observed with such Strengthening exercises.
Third is the Flexibility type exercise, which has to be pursued on a daily basis for best results.
Here the single most important rule is stretching the muscles, ligaments and the tendons of the body. But one should be cautious each time it is being done to be slow and be mindful of the stretching act.
It is also necessary to remain in the stretched position for at least a count of ten and then relax for a moment before repeating the exercise again.
For safe pursuance of any exercise by older persons, Dr. de Vries suggests six steps to be followed, viz., seeing the Doctor for a medical check-up prior to start, making a slow start and increasing exertion gradually, knowing the limit not to over-do, exercising regularly avoiding times of ill-health, warming up before the start and cooling down after finishing.
Today billions of people are walking, running, jogging, cycling and swimming their way to good health and fulfillment of life. Why not you join the fun asks Dr. de Vries addressing the older community of the world.

Huawei inspires smartphone industry with chipset launch
In his IFA 2018 keynote titled The Ultimate Power of Mobile AI, Huawei Consumer Business Group CEO Richard Yu introduced the Kirin 980, the system on a chip (SoC) that will bring about the next evolution of mobile AI.
As the worlds first commercial SoC manufactured with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer Companys (TSMC) 7nm process, Kirin 980 combines best-in-class performance, efficiency, connectivity features, and Dual NPU AI processing power.
Commenting on the historic occasion, Richard Yu, the CEO of HUAWEI CBG said, Last year, we showed the world the potential of On-Device AI with the Kirin 970, and this year, weve designed an all-round powerhouse that not only features outstanding AI capabilities, but also brings cutting-edge raw performance to consumers. Equipped with an all-new CPU, GPU and Dual NPU, the Kirin 980 is the ultimate engine to power next-generation productivity and entertainment applications. Therefore its evident that the 10nm Kirin 970 SoC that is powering HUAWEIs flagship devices will soon cede its cutting-edge title to 7nm.
Huawei has a stellar track record of leading chipset development. Going back in recent history, while other manufacturers were designing chips for the 20nm process, Huawei unveiled the first 16nm chip with Kirin 950.
The Kirin 980 integrates 6.9 billion transistors in an area of less than 1 square centimeter which is a 1.6x increase in density to empower better performance.
With this introduction of the Kirin 980, it is deduced that 7nm technology will improve processor speed by approximately 20 percent and consume approximately 40 percent less power compared to 10nm Chipset embedded in Mate 10.
In addition, The Kirin 980 boasts the Industrys First Dual-Brain Power. Kirin 980 can quickly adapt to AI scenes such as face recognition, object recognition, object detection, image segmentation and intelligent translation with the power of a dual-core NPU achieving 4500 images per minute which is an improved 120% recognition speed. The Kirin 980 is the first to offer LTE Cat.21 which supports the fastest downlink at 1.4 Gbps and offers a stable connection in congested areas.
Huawei confirms that a state of-the-art-smartphone, unveiling the Kirin 980 for the first time in the smartphone industry, is expected to make its debut in October in the international markets.
In Sri Lanka, Huawei has succeeded in securing the number one position in Smartphone sales according to recent GfK reports.

National Youth Model United Nations 2018
Impassioning Sri Lankas Youth
I believe we need to bring about change in society and that can only be done by having strong passion from the youth, says 20-year-old Zainab Rafeek, a Model United Nations (MUN) delegate with more than seven years experience. I believe its possible to bring about change when you have that vision in you.
Rafeek is a new member of the Secretariat of Sri Lankas National Youth Model United Nations (NYMUN), the largest youth MUN platform in the country. At this years conference, NYMUN 2018 organisers expect about 350 participants. NYMUN was founded, says the organisation, to serve two notions: to provide the young people of our country an opportunity to engage and learn the art of diplomacy and conflict-resolution.
For novices, the Model United Nations is a mock United Nations, where participants engage with the same challenging issues addressed in the real UN. Participants are typically students, and throughout the conference, they develop their critical-thinking skills by grappling with the same kinds of challenges and logistics required in real diplomatic settings. They even learn the rules of UN decorum and procedure.
Each participant is assigned a specific country, committee, and topic, and before the conference they research how that country would respond to the issue that they have been assigned. Another member of NYMUNs Secretariat, Shaila Sabri says that participants learn based on how each country could bring about a resolution. She hopes that from their MUN experience, they extrapolate beyond the conference, to how they could apply those solutions to our country.
The six committees of NYMUN 2018 function through a simulation of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly. Amongst the topics covered this year are disarmament, decolonisation, science and technology for development, human rights, and the status of women.
To a greater extent than previous conferences, NYMUN 2018 has sought to reach out to Sri Lankas nine provinces with a campaign of awareness and accessibility.
We travelled from province to province where we held workshops, explains Sabri. We distributed study guides and manuals, she elaborates, We trained young people by explaining the whole process of the MUN, the protocols and procedures that come with the conference.
During the workshops, the Secretariat holds impromptu MUN simulations, giving participants small topics to try out. Already, theyve travelled to the Central Province, the Western Province, the North Western Province, and last weekend, they travelled to the Eastern Province as well.
We had some people in Beruwela who were really interested. It was encouraging for us, says Sabri, who exchanges glances and smiles with Rafeek. They display their own passion for the messages they are spreading and the excitement they have managed to create nationwide for the process of peace-making.
Rafeek says that reaching out to all nine provinces is part of the first phase of their broader goals. The second thing, she says, is that NYMUN needs to be trilingual.
Another reason that NYMUN 2018 is different from previous conferences is that it offers two of its six committees in all three languages, English, Sinhala, and Tamil. By creating trilingual sessions, NYMUN 2018 fulfills another of its purposes: to engage with global problems through diverse perspectives.
Going forward in 2019, NYMUN envisions making the conference increasingly accessible to speakers of all three languages. With that in mind, the Secretariat is eager to implement another phase of their plan: to organise provincial conferences, where delegates from three or so provinces come together for regional debates.
Out of the provincial conference participants, the best would be chosen for Vision 2020, where the whole island would be represented, because everyone deserves a chance, says Sabri.
The year 2020 is an important one for Sri Lanka, with an upcoming Presidential Election as well as Parliamentary elections as the benchmark for sustainable development goals (SDGs), explains Sabri, and NYMUN wants to capitalise on that significance. Thats why the NYMUN Secretariat has already entered into the planning stages of Vision 2020, a national youth assembly to make sure the voice of the youth is considered by relevant authorities to ensure greater fairness of political, legal and economic systems and safeguard fundamental rights, as its mission statement says.
Vision 2020 is basically a youth assembly that we are creating, says Sabri, to be a part of the current issues in the country. Not to be someone who is looking into it, but to be someone who is actively contributing.
The NYMUN Secretariat sees Vision 2020 as an opportunity to inform and engage Sri Lankas critical youth electorate. NYMUN 2018, and, in the future, 2019 are part of the larger process of attracting the countrys brightest and most thoughtful youth in preparation for their 2020 goals. By then, the entire conference, they say, will be conducted in English, Sinhala and Tamil, because we believe language should not be a barrier in the path towards greatness, states the Vision 2020 mission statement.
Now, registration for NYMUN 2018 is available online to young people (both students and professionals) between the ages of 14 and 30, with a fee of about Rs. 2,500. Travel grants have been made available to some of the participating delegations, and by the end of this month, hundreds of young people from across the country will make their way to Colombo for the conference, which will take place on September 29 and 30 at Colombo University.
NYMUN 2018, says Rafeek, is a place where you have got youth coming from different places  irrespective of race, religion, country, or caste  bringing their innovative ideas, because each person out there may have a solution.

This isn't a stitch-up!
Wiltshire-based artist Elizabeth Bond, 31, decided to attract attention to her exhibitions by creating the world's longest knitting needles.
They measure 4.4 metres (14ft 6in) in length and have a diameter of 9.01cm (3in).
Elizabeth says she is proud to show exactly what art students can accomplish. "Everybody has potential if you just keep striving and pushing forward," she says.
"Give it a go, what's the worst that can happen"
Betsy Bond, 30, chose the end of year Creative Exhibition at Wiltshire College Chippenham on Tuesday, June 13 to unveil her giant needles, which measure a staggering 4.4metres in length and are 9cm in diameter.
She then impressed visitors to the event, including Chippenham Mayor councillor Mary Norton by demonstrating how to knit on such a large scale.
Bond, of Dauntsey Lock, said, It was a wonderful evening and I am thrilled that so many people came along and saw all the hard work that the entire creative art department has put into the event. I decided to go for the record as when I found out what it was I believed I could beat it. I wanted to achieve rather than just aspire. It has been a challenge that I have enjoyed every minute of."
The current world record for the Worlds Largest Knitting Needles is 3.98metres long with a diameter of 8.25 metres and was set by Jim Bolin from the US in May 2013.
The knitting needles were then used to knit a tension square of 10 stitches by 10 rows.
Betsy has so far knitted 85 stitches using Stockinette provided by Manchester based company Rodo Group, who kindly donated 16kg to help her achieve her challenge.
The needles, which had to be transported from her home to the Chippenham campus on a trailer, have been made from polypipe and the points and stoppers were printed in college by Nicholas Llewellyn-Jones at the Wiltshire 3D Enterprise Centre.

JHU proposes solution for dealing with war crimes
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) leader and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday urged the President, Prime Minister and Tamil political leaders to work benevolently to safeguard the rule of law in the country.
All political parties should sincerely and logically intervene in this matter, Minister Ranawaka said, speaking at a media conference at the JHU office in Battaramulla.
Everyone should realise that the rule of law in the country cannot be safeguarded by recalling past memories. Forgiveness is the best, easy and logical alternative to ensuring peace and reconciliation in the country, he said.
The JHU yesterday presented five proposals to the government for ensuring that the rule of law prevailed in the country.
The JHU proposed the appointment of an expert committee under the Attorney Generals Department to separately identify the crimes committed by military personnel in attaining war targets and crimes committed for personal reasons.
They also proposed the granting of a common pardon to the persons who are accused of committing crimes while attaining war targets.
That relief policy should also be applied to former LTTE cadres in custody, former LTTE cadres who are currently undergoing various punishments and former LTTE cadres against whom there are pending cases and who are still at large.
The JHU underlined the importance of taking immediate legal action against those who committed crimes for their personal benefit, taking advantage of the war. All the political parties should come to a common agreement not to recall past memories after implementing these proposals successfully, the Minister said.
It is useless to implement this procedure if there is no such agreement nationally as well as internationally, he said.
JHU Co-Chairman Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera, Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana and JHU Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe were also present.

Alleged misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 mn in public funds
JOHNSTONS BAIL APPLICATION REFUSED
A revision application filed by former Minister Johnston Fernando seeking an interim order to release him on bail was yesterday refused by Court of Appeal.
Johnston Fernando remanded in connection with the misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million in public funds had filed a revision application in the Court of Appeal challenging the Kurunegala High Courts order to remand him until the conclusion of the trial.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench Bench comprising Justice Janak de Silva and Justice Achala Wengappuli refused this application since it did not notice any justifiable reason to set aside the High Court order.
Senior State Counsel Naomi Wickremasekara appearing for the Attorney General had raised objections to the revision application citing that there was no illegality in the order issued by the Kurunegala High Court.
SSC Wickremasekara further submitted to court that the High Court Judge made this order for the purpose of expediting the trial after being heard on a day-to-day basis and the accused will be allowed to attend the Parliament sessions. She further argued that the Bail Act does not apply for offences committed under the Public Property Act.
However, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Johnston Fernando told court that the High Court Judge made an order to remand the accused without a legal basis. He contended that alleged misappropriation of funds at Lak Sathosa institution cannot be considered as an offence which comes under Public Property Act.
On September 3, the Kurunegala High Court issued an order to remand former Minister Johnston Fernando, former Lak Sathosa Chairman K.M.Fernando and the former Ministers Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer, until the conclusion of the trial.
The Attorney General alleged that Johnston Fernando as then Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs. 5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013.

Jumbo trouble on Kataragama - Buttala road
Wild elephants roaming on Kataragama - Buttala road looking for food pose a threat to people travelling in vehicles, pilgrims say.
The road leads to Buttala from Kataragama through Block 5 of the Yala National Park and frequently, wild elephants come to the road to get food given by people travelling in vehicles.
Now the number of elephants had increased. About five elephants roam in the area looking for food.
Some elephants become aggressive and charge at vehicles and people.
The pilgrims want the Wildlife Department to stop elephants from coming to the road.
When inquired by the Wildlife office in the area, they said the road goes through the Yala National Park. Therefore, wild animals cannot be stopped.
The wild elephants come to the road as people give them food. We have informed the people not to feed wild elephants. However, it has become useless. As long as people feed them, they come for food, an official said.

Massive clean-up in Hong Kong
HONG KONG: Hong Kong began a massive clean-up Monday after Typhoon Mangkhut raked the city, shredding trees and bringing damaging floods, in a trail of destruction that has left dozens dead in the Philippines and millions evacuated in southern China.
The death toll in the Philippines, where the main island of Luzon was mauled with fierce winds and rain, rose to 65 overnight as rescuers pulled more bodies from a huge landslide in the mountain town of Itogon.
National police spokesman Senior Superintendent Benigno Durana told AFP that 43 other people are missing, and more than 155,000 people remain in evacuation centres two days after the typhoon struck.
After tearing through Luzon and pummelling Hong Kong and Macau, the storm made landfall in mainland China late Sunday, with two reported dead in Guangdong province.
Authorities there said they had evacuated more than three million people and ordered tens of thousands of fishing boats back to port before the arrival of what Chinese media had dubbed the King of Storms.
In the high-rise city of Hong Kong, the government described the damage as severe and extensive with more than 300 people injured in Mangkhut which triggered the maximum T10 typhoon alert.
The monumental task of cleaning up the city began as residents, some in suits and ties, struggled to get back to work on roads that remained blocked by felled trees, mud and debris.
Schools were closed, along with bus services, and travel disruption saw commuters piling onto platforms trying to board infrequent trains after trees fell on overhead lines.
Landslides and severe flooding affected some areas, with over 1,500 residents seeking refuge in temporary shelters overnight.
The storm, with gusts of more than 230 kilometres per hour (142 mph), sent buildings swaying and waters surging into homes and shopping malls, with some roads waist-deep in water.
Windows in tower blocks and skyscrapers were smashed as people cowered inside.
In the neighbourhood of Heng Fa Chuen, thousands of rocks and pebbles from the sea covered parkland along the coastline which had been battered by pounding waves.
The city's main Victoria Park had become an obstacle course with hundreds of trees down and many completely uprooted.
Emergency teams were sawing apart some of the biggest trees blocking roads and pathways across the city in a clean-up operation that is likely to take days.
In the neighbouring gambling enclave of Macau, all 42 casinos shut down for the first time in its history as the storm approached.
They opened again on Monday but Macau was still in recovery mode after severe flooding hit parts of the city, forcing emergency workers to rescue people from their shops and homes using boats and jetskis.
As the storm moved past the enclave Sunday, streets became submerged under water gushing in from the harbour.
The government and casinos have taken extra measures in recent times, determined to avoid a repeat of Typhoon Hato which battered Macau last year, killing 12 people and drawing accusations it was ill prepared for a major storm. - AFP

Minister slams MR for duplicitous India policy
The whole country is now familiar with Mahinda Rajapaksas duplicitous policy of kicking up anti-Indian feelings locally and extending the hand of friendships to India when he visits that country, State Enterprise and Kandyan Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Mahinda Rajapaksa who protested against the handover of Mattala Airport to India and exhibited an anti-Indian policy here has met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modhi and said that he too agreed with the decision taken by the Sri Lanka government to hand over the operations of the Mattala Airport to India, the Minister said.
Minister Kiriella was speaking at a meeting after opening a coordinating office near the tunnel on Kandy - Katugastota road yesterday.
Mahinda Rajapaksa who subjected the country to adverse international opinion during his 10-year rule had now teamed up with his Joint Opposition group to create turmoil in the country in an effort to wrest control of the government. Despite all his antics, the present government will administer the country till 2025 by winning the next Presidential election to be held in December next year, Minister Kiriella said.
He said the killings, abductions and human rights violations caused during the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration forced the United Nations to adopt successive resolutions against Sri Lanka in 2012, 2013 and 2014. If by chance he had gained power in 2015 too, the country would have faced several UN sanctions. Since the colossal funds spent on the Port City, Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport by the Rajapaksa government did not bring any income, the country was caught in a debt trap. As a result, the government had to pay back debts amounting to Rs 1.9 trillion this year. While the government was trying to pay back these loans systematically, parties which engulfed the country in a debt trap were trying every means to come back to power.
Municipal Council member Raja Pushpakumara, Kandy Sinhala Traders Front President M.J.R. Pieris, Katugastota United Welfare Association President Sunil Shantha and Association Secretary P.H. Solomons also participated.

New technology to uplift tea industry-Eran
The growth of Sri Lankas tea industry depends on changing the system of training and education of youth involved in the tea plantation, exploring new foreign markets, producing high quality value added tea and also using modern technologies.
State Minister Finance Eran Wickramaratne addressing the 28th AGM of Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association in Colombo said. Sri Lanka Tea Board, Chairman Lucille Wijewardena was the guest of honour.
Minister Wickramaratne said that even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently at a seminar, organized by the Tea Exporters Association highlighted that Governments objective is to modernize the countrywide tea industry by increasing the productivity of workers who are involved in the industry and also extend fund facilities for both tea smallholders and large tea holder plantations.
He said in addition Government needs to encourage industrialists to start tea replanting and also grant many other facilities to modernize the industry with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank.
Highlighting on the participation of women laborers in tea plantation, Minister Wickramaratne said in 2006 Sri Lanka had 46 per cent women in labour force and currently the situation has declined to 36 per cent.
This is due to their education level which had gone up and as a result over ten percent female labour force had dropped in the estate sector,
The Minister also focused attention towards using weedicide in the tea cultivation and said the country should stop importing all kinds of illegal weedicides to the country. Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Chairman Harith Ranasinghe said their objective is to promote, foster and protect the countrys tea industry .
He said the countrys tea industry in the past has contributed immensely to the GDP and still continues to play a significant role. The Minister also highlighted that poor quality tea is made available in the local market and the import of teas from other origins and re exported as Ceylon Tea is also a matter of concern.

Not over yet: Mercedes cautious despite Hamiltons Singapore stardust
Singapore, Monday: Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said it was special to conquer "bogey track" Singapore but cautioned the F1 title race wasn't over yet after Lewis Hamilton's "stardust" propelled him to a potentially decisive 40-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
Hamilton raced to a stunning pole position which he converted into a dominant victory -- his fourth in five races -- to leave Ferrari, who seem to have the faster car, again scratching their heads with just six grands prix to go.
Team principal Wolff said there was no mystery to Mercedes' form, it was all down to sheer hard work back at the factory and the track.
"Singapore has been our bogey track for several years, so it is a special feeling to come here and win this race on pace," Wolf told reporters after Hamilton's pole-to-flag win and team-mate Valtteri Bottas's fourth place gave them a 25-point lead over Ferrari in the constructors' championship.
"The entire team has worked so hard to understand the car and take steps forward, especially since our defeat in Spa, and this result is an indication that our work is paying off."
"It was a weekend of many parts: a stardust lap from Lewis in qualifying, a chess game of tyre management this evening, and some nervous moments with traffic and backmarkers during the race," Wolff added.
Hamilton also paid tribute to "the guys back at the factory" when he spoke to reporters.
"We're hitting the nail on the head with the balance of the car and really just eking out each little bit and each weekend we've got incredible communications," said Englishman who is gunning for his fifth Formula One drivers' world championship.
"I give quite long debriefs nowadays and we work to the point that we leave no stone unturned -- there's not a single stone unturned each weekend that we arrive and so it's a real collective.
"It's just the strongest the team has ever been."
Wolff warned they had to keep up the intensity to win both drivers' and constructors' championships this season, starting with the Russian Grand Prix in two weeks.
"From our side, we can be pleased with a very solid weekend," he added. "We have leads in both championships, but they change nothing in the mindset of this team.
"We have six weekends to go and we know how quickly the situation can swing back against us. We will take it weekend by weekend, feet on the ground and determined to maximise our potential every time." AFP

Presidential Commission probing alleged malpractices at SriLankan Airlines
Over USD 100 million obtained by SriLankan were not settled - Witness
Four loans amounting to over USD 100 million obtained from the Peoples Bank by SriLankan Airlines (SLA) since 2015 have not been settled so far, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into alleged malpractices at Sri Lankan Airlines, Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd and SriLankan Catering learnt yesterday.
Three loans amounting to USD 100 million and one loan of Rs.13.35 billion had been obtained by the company in 2015, 2016, and 2017 on different purposes, including settling the fuel cost for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.
Assistant General Manager (Corporative Banking) of Peoples Bank Kumari Nayana Senaratne testified before the Commission yesterday.
SriLankan Airlines was incurring heavy losses since 2008 after the management of the company was taken over by the then government from the Emirates Management. These losses resulted in the company having to face many problems, including a financial crisis.
In such a situation,in July 2015, the company had asked for a Term Loan of Rs.13.35 billion from the Peoples Bank citing that it was in a need of money to settle the cost for fuel owed to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.
The bank, on the approval of its Board of Directors had issued this loan to the CPC as requested by SriLankan Airlines on a Letter of Comfort (LoC) which expired on March 31, 2016 issued by the Central Bank (CBSL) as a security. However, the company had been failed to repay this loan amount by the date of expiry of the LoC. Later, the CBSL on a claim lodged by the bank had extended the validity period of the LoC time by time till December 31, 2018 due the continuous failure of SriLankan Airlines on the repayment. However, the Commission came to know that although, at least one cent of the capital payment had not been settled, the company had paid Rs.3.9 Billion as the interest for this loan amount by January 31, 2018. The Peoples Bank however, told the Commission that this loan is not yet considered as a non-performing loan.
The second loan amount of USD 32.5 million had been issued by the bank to SriLankan Airlines on two letters of request issued by the General Treasury and the Prime Ministers Office as per a discussion held with the Treasury Secretary in April 2016 for the Restructuring of SriLankan Airlines, including the payment of compensation for the cancellation of the lease agreement on A350 airbuses. This loan had been issued by the Peoples Bank in the same month on the approval of its Board of Directors on a LoC valid till April 30, 2017. The validity period of this LoC had to be extended time by time till December 31, 2018 due to the non-payment of the loan. By January 31, this year SriLankan Airlines had been able to settle an amount of USD 3.10 Million as the interest.
The third loan of USD 42.5 million was issued by the bank in August 2016 on a request made by the then CEO Suren Ratwatte for Working Capital. This was also issued by the bank on a LoC valid till October 7, 2017 as security and the validity period of the LoC too had been extended time by time on the failure of the repayment by the company. However, an amount of USD 3.25 Million had been paid as the interest by the company by January 31, 2018. SriLankan Airlines again on March 7, 2017 via a letter had requested an amount of USD 25 million as a loan from the Peoples Bank to recover the loss it faced due to the closure of the BIA runway. In the same way, the LoC issued as a security for this loan too had been extended due to the failure of repayment. The amount of interest had been paid for this loan by the end of January this year is USD 1.18 million.
However, on the inquiry of the Commission, the Assistant General Manager was of the view that these loans will be settled by SriLankan Airlines as there is an involvement of the Treasury with these deals.

The petitioner further sought an order compelling the Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation against the Chairman and members of the Bribery Commission and the Attorney General for the Commission of the offence corruption.
The Petitioner states that despite a lapse of over nine months since the publishing of the Commissions final report, the respondents who are authorised to indict suspects involved in major financial crimes before the Permanent High Court at Bar, have failed to set the criminal law into motion against the suspects.
The petitioner states that the failure on the part of the respondents to act as required by law, amounts to a violation of the trust and confidence placed in them by the people of Sri Lanka, whose Executive power is being exercised by them.

President blames politicians for environmental destruction
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday held politicians responsible for most of the environmental destruction that has taken place in the country. He said that prior to his taking office, such destructive activities overwhelmed the country.
Numerous government institutions which grant permission and licences for rock, sand and other extractions for construction purposes, do not continue to monitor these activities, the President said.
It was the politicians who mostly cut down trees, mined sand, extracted soil and quarried rocks. If you take Ratnapura for example, in one of the divisional secretariats there are 86 quarries. When I took over office in 2015, I asked for the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry for two reasons. For one, I wanted to complete the Moragahakanda project. The other reason is to stop the large-scale environmental destruction that was taking place in the country, President Sirisena said.
The President was speaking at the International Ozone Day commemoration at the BMICH yesterday morning, organised by the National Ozone Unit under the instructions of the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry.
President Sirisena said that he took over the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry to strictly implement laws and regulations over those who destroy the environment. For the first time in Sri Lanka, we have the Tri-Forces deployed to secure the environment. Every two weeks, the Sri Lanka Air Force monitors the felling of trees in forests as well as illegal cannabis cultivation in the country and reports to me. We take data and information by using satellite technology as well. The racketeers who are involved in these activities use weaknesses in our legal system to evade justice, President Sirisena said.
The President also said that social media is accusing him of many things, including living expenses. There is a whole list of things that social media blames me for. They blame me for not allowing extracting sand and soil, even for housing construction, the President said, adding that the country needs a sustainable housing policy.
Deputy Environment Minister Ajith Mannapperuma and Environment Secretary Anura Dissanayake also spoke at the event.
Professor Chandana Jayaratne delivered the Special Guest Speech. A refrigerant analyser to detect refrigerants and prevent illegal import of ozone depleting substances was donated to Sri Lanka Customs. Prizes were also distributed to the winners of competitions held among schools islandwide to mark International Ozone Day, at the event.

Stressing the importance of properly fulfilling duties and responsibilities, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday gave a clarification on his decision to summon the staff of the Sri Lankan Embassy in Austria, back to the country last week.
President Sirisena observed that the Ambassador and the staff will return to Sri Lanka within the next few days.
President Sirisena said that he made the decision as his communication team was not able to contact the Sri Lankan Embassy in Austria for four and a half hours.
I wanted to get in touch with our Ambassador over an official matter, the President said.
My communication team attempted to contact the Embassy for four and a half hours. There are six telephone lines at the Embassy. None of the lines were answered. This embassy is concurrently accredited to four or five other countries. If they do not answer a single telephone call coming from six telephone lines, neither the staff in the embassy nor the representatives in the other countries will receive any message. This is the reason why I took such a decision, the President said.
President Maithripala Sirisena made these observations while addressing the International Ozone Day Celebration 2018 held at the BMICH yesterday morning.

Present day politicians have much to learn from his biography. The manner in which he steered the country overcoming problems and obstacles with patience and finesse was a fine example to present day politicians, Education Minister and UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
He was addressing the gathering at the 112th birth anniversary commemoration of late President J R Jayewardene held at the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya headquarters at Pitakotte yesterday( 17).
Minister Kariyawasam said late President Jayewardene was instrumental in introducing the free market economy to Sri Lanka after the UNP victory in 1977.
Since the beginning of his political life, President Jayewardene believed that the country should keep pace with international trends if it was to attain economic and social development.
President Jayewardene was also an internationally acclaimed world leader. Japan in particular fondly remembers and holds him in high esteem for the historic speech he made at the San Francisco Peace Conference as Finance Minister of Sri Lanka, the UNP General Secretary said.
The UNP oriented Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya was the brainchild of late President Jayewardene. He had a very soft corner in his heart for the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya and always endeavoured to safeguard the rights of its membership, he said.
Minister Kariyawasam said that UNP re-organisation work would be undertaken in a democratic manner in order to strengthen the party and help it forward march. The party had already made vast strides and moved forward after the setback it suffered at the last Local Government elections.
The party machinery will be strengthened at all levels by opening new branch offices countrywide, Minister Kariyawasam said. The partys future programme of work would be decided at the Partys Working Committee meeting. Their target was to win the election in 2020, he added.
Earlier Minister Kariyawasam paid floral tributes at the J.R. Jayewardene statue at the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya headquarters.
Floral tributes were also placed by JSS General Secretary and Parliamentarian Sirinal de Mel and JSS Vice President and Media Secretary Sunil de Silva.

President stresses improving attendance in Parliament
President Maithripala Sirisena stressed the need of improving attendance of Parliamentarians and having their active contribution in committee deliberations to enhance Parliaments efficiency.
He also strongly advocated for an increased female representation in the Legislature for improved efficiency.
There are 225 MPs in our Parliament, but we struggle to maintain the quorum of 20 MPs during the sittings.
Parliament sits only for eight days per month, the President said.
The Consultative Committee meetings and other Oversight Committee Meetings often get postponed due to poor attendance of MPs, he said.
The contributions of the committees largely impact the countrys development, the President noted.
The Presidents comments came in the wake of Parliament sittings coming to abrupt endings frequently due lack of quorum of MPs over the past few weeks.
President Sirisena was addressing the inauguration ceremony of EvalColombo2018, the first-ever global conference on evaluation, in Colombo yesterday.
The three-day forum themed Responsible Parliaments: Embracing Evaluation for Agenda 2030 is attended by 104 MPs from across the globe and about another 150 stakeholders representing various governments and civil society organisations.
There is a belief that women are more efficient than men. Fifty two percent of our population is women. To my belief, if we can increase female representation in Parliament at least to 60 percent, it will help increase the efficiency of our Parliament, the President opined.
There are 1.5 million public servants in our country, but as per the reports, public sector efficiency is only 30-35 percent. This is not a satisfactory level at all. The efficiency of politicians influence the efficiency of public servants, he added.
The President also stressed the need to focus on national data and information to attain sustainable development goals.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, delivering the welcome speech, said large sums of public money are being wasted due to lack of proper evaluation and plans. We need to make sure that the public funds are being used efficiently and effectively, he added.
The Speaker said the conference organised by the Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation and Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation was an example of having fruitful Parliament to Parliament relations.
The Speaker pointed out that the Parliament diplomacy was a concept initiated by him in 2016.

Policies without evaluation cast burdens on the people - PM
Disna Mudalige
Sri Lanka is a classic example of policy without evaluation that ultimately resulted in burdens on the people and high level of debt, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
We would not have had this high level of debt if there had been policy evaluation, the Premier said referring to the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium, Mattala International Airport and Hambantota harbour as examples of investments with no returns.
The Prime Minister was addressing the inauguration ceremony of EvalColombo2018,the first-ever global conference on evaluation, in Colombo yesterday.
The forum themed Responsible Parliaments: Embracing Evaluation for Agenda 2030 is attended by 104 MPs from across the globe and about another 150 stakeholders representing various governments and civil society organisations.
Much of the borrowings could have been avoided or put into more useful sectors if we had done the evaluation. Most of our spending had gone into non-tradable goods without doing research, the Premier said.
We have to start again to turn them around as tradable goods, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe noted.
The Premier, observing that a Private-Public Partnership has been initiated to develop the Hambantota Port and that similar arrangements are being negotiated with regard to the Mattala Airport, however said that turning around the Suriyawewa Cricket Stadium is beyond hope.
I dont think we can ever make arrangements to successfully run a cricket field in the middle of nowhere and next to a wildlife national park. Only elephants come to play in this cricket field, the Prime Minister commented.
The end result is that we somehow have to pay back the loans. We have no option but to raise our revenue by increasing the taxes, and you being public representatives, know how hard this is, he told the gathering.
We have to restart our whole economic policy. That will take a few years, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. He also expressed his confidence that EvalColombo2018 would result in the introduction of an evaluation culture in Sri Lanka.
We do policy making, implementing and monitoring, but we rarely go into the benefits and impacts of our policies. Policies are not for the politicians, but for the people. We have taken measures to strengthen Parliament after 2015, especially through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
We have set up Oversight Committees and a Public Finance Committee, and we will bring in legislation shortly to set up the Parliamentary Budget Office. These are in addition to COPE and COPA. We have to bring in evaluation as part of the functions of the Oversight Committees and such evaluation reports must be presented in Parliament, he noted.
The Chair of the Global Parliamentarians Forum for Evaluation and Minister Kabir Hashim, recalling that the first draft of National Evaluation Policy was presented by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in 2001, named him as the Sri Lankas political champion for an evaluation culture. The PM has started the ball rolling and we are determined to go all the way until we attain the results.
This is our civic responsibility. We do this voluntarily because we believe in good governance.
Evaluation as a tool serves the ordinary people who elect the politicians. Every penny counts with depleting natural and financial resources all over the world, he added.

Protest, Arab Spring and Zimbabwe
Cricket civilizes people and create good gentlemen - Robert Mugabe
On the Fifth of September the city of Colombo woke to an unusually quiet morning, an uneasy air, something big was going to happen, the sitting government may even fall, blood could be spilt. There were fewer vehicles on the roads and the buses had less than half the loads, the schoolchildren, usually early morning commuters, were conspicuously absent. Anticipating chaos, the housewives conscious of keeping the home fires burning, dipped in to their meagre savings to stock up on the essentials, rice, dhal and coconuts. Their meagre savings, the reward for months of hard scrimping, had been put aside for a real emergency.
For a number of days the main opposition, the JO (Joint Opposition) was threatening a decisive move, an overwhelming protest in the Capital city that could even topple an ill-defined government. The intended victory was to be achieved not by an election or a coup. In the calculations of the organisers the sheer pressure of the protesters on the streets would unbalance and eventually bring down the government. As to who would replace it and on what basis, were left unanswered.
Recent history provides several instances of long entrenched regimes being brought down by popular peoples movements, particularly in the troubled Middle East. Early years of this decade saw the so called Arab Spring challenging and eventually toppling governments in several countries like Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. For long ruled by entrenched families, these countries were despotic and corrupt. Many of the rulers had begun their careers as rebels; however, years of untrammeled power had turned them into unscrupulous cynics. For example, close family members, particularly the sons of Libyas Mahmoud Kaddafi, fire breathing decrier of all things Western, were shown to have been voracious investors in Western countries; large accounts in Swiss Banks, Real Estate, fancy yachts, European made cars, so on.
Better life and greater freedom
In these Arab countries the ruling families had such a stranglehold that nothing moved unless one of them blessed the venture. There is acceptance in the culture for commissions and kick-backs as legitimate rewards, in this case, for being fortuitously born in to the family. But outside of the rarefied atmosphere of this all-powerful cabal, things did not stay still; the societies evolved. Gradually, with education, travel and exposure, expectations had widened. As the masses searched for a better life and greater freedom, realization dawned that the liberators of the past had become the oppressors of the present. Although the oil flowed generously, the insularity of a tiny self-serving clique did not work towards economic efficiency. They called the shots and pocketed all the money.
Something had to give, around 2011 people took to the streets and the old order changed. The entrenched families did not go away without resistance, there was bloodshed, violence; however, the people were not to be denied. Regimes which had been in power for decades vanished like snow in the spring sun. For these long oppressed societies, there was hope for a new beginning. Unfortunately, the much awaited spring proved to be ephemeral, the Arab world, intellectually, culturally and even spiritually are perhaps not ready yet to break the mould. Soon the spring receded, new strong men emerged and these countries appear to be drifting towards another long Winter of discontent.
To equal the Arab Spring with what was planned for the Fifth of September is to defy reason, it is to compare incompatibles. The protest of September 5 was organised by a group led by none other than Mahinda Rajapakse who is a two term President of this country. Most of the organisers were Members of Parliament drawing government paid salaries, enjoying a host of other benefits with public money. They live in lavish government provided bungalows, travelling even to the site of the protest in the plushest of vehicles, again gifted by the tax payer. To protect them, the organisers had drivers and bodyguards with the compliments of the people. These minions also double as personal attendants, seeing to every need of the MP, including carrying his mobile phone and the bottle of water. It is considered unseemly for the important person to carry such personal stuff himself.
Mahinda Rajapaksa does not hail from a wealthy background and has spent his entire life in public service. However, his children reportedly lead lives far removed from the common beat, even proposing marriage to their partners at the top of the highest mountain in the African Continent. Now, we have no issue with young folk taking to high adventure. In fact conquering such physical challenges is good for both body as well as mind. Yet, these are costly exercises. Ours is a country where the Tax Department routinely queries those who purchase air-tickets for the source of funding. Paying only lip service to plain living and high thinking, some, obviously have embraced Mammon; their life styles showing high living, but not so high thinking.
It is not to say that Mahinda Rajapaksa family members are the only offenders or that such behaviour is limited to the Joint Opposition. Perhaps there are worse culprits in other governments and other political parties. In fact, the great divide today is not between the government and the opposition. They are one, united in self-interests. The real battle in this country is between these so called peoples representatives on one side and the voter on the other. This is the great moral battle of our era. As to the winner, thus far, no investigation is required.
For seventy years now our people have dutifully trudged to the polling centres with great expectations. In turn, every government so elected has proved incapable or unwilling, only leaving the country in poverty and debt. However, they miss no opportunity to leave behind ugly legacies; ethnic tensions, civil wars, unworkable laws, inefficient systems; all made worse by a stagnating economy.
To contrast, when Singapore (in 1965) broke away from its union with Malaysia it was difficult to envisage a future for the tiny island State. The country had no natural resources, unemployment was high, and now it had lost the large markets of Malaysia. But within five years, the direction was clear. Singapore will rise proudly. They had leaders who could deliver.
Global economy
In the early 1950s, South Korea was war devastated. But by the beginning of the 1970s, in little more than 10 years, the country was well on the way to gaining a rich country status. In the 1970s, China was an abjectly poor country. In just two decades, the world had begun to speak of a global economy, with China as a dominant player.
Obviously, the complex problems facing us cannot be solved by merely electing a parliament periodically. For seventy years we have been doing this. After every election, a set of white clad persons, many of them children of former MPs, take their oath as our representatives. At the end of their term, self-generated sound and fury notwithstanding, the country remains at the bottom of the index of mediocre nations.
It is a fact that people live racially and culturally; confronting different realities; thinking and acting, by and large, in a predetermined way. Countries that have succeeded need not explain their success; it is the failed nations who must explain their failure.
By any account, Zimbabwe is a country where anything that could go wrong has gone wrong. Robert Mugabe (Born 1924) ruled the country as Prime Minister from 1980 to 1987 and then as President from 1987 to 2017, 37 years in all. In these four decades the country, from reasonable prosperity has descended to a hopeless situation, GDP per Capita has dropped by more than half, industrial as well as agricultural productivity has fallen drastically, unemployment spiraled and with hyper-inflation their currency has become worthless. For the average citizen, living standards have deteriorated, life expectancy declined and his wages in terms of purchasing power has plummeted.
Most workers have left for employment in neighbouring countries, also poor, but where they are at least assured of a living wage.
Whatever his failings, obviously there are many: economic mismanagement, wide-spread corruption, human rights abuses and even crimes against humanity; Mugabe cannot be accused of having no family values. It was widely expected that the Cricket loving leader was going to appoint Grace, his young second wife, as his successor. In Zimbabwe she was commonly referred to as Gucci Grace, in reference to her greed for European luxury items.
Finally, in 2017, there was a military coup which removed the megalomaniacal clown from office. But it was done in a Zimbabwe way, or you may say in a manner consistent with Mugabeism.
As a reward for stepping down peaceably it is said that the plunderer and his family were assured of immunity from prosecution, a US $ 10 million dollar bonus, official residences/vehicles, staff and bodyguards and a host of other benefits. The present rulers, who, with the passing of time will also become former rulers one day, perhaps ensured a good deal for themselves by legitimizing this retirement package for Mugabe.
All this unbelievable nonsense seems acceptable to the Zimbabwe way of looking at things, their reality, and their values. This is high politics of Zimbabwe, to be decided in the corridors of power by black leaders in three piece Western suits, those whose ancestor were perhaps the tribal chiefs who led the great hunts. It is yet another way of looking at the world.
The protests on September 5 were led by people who also have a particular way of looking at the world. They see our unhappiness as a result of the failings of this government of four years. But it is a tragedy, 70 years long.
There is a reason to protest, no, something to rage about. But that is not this or that government. We must rage against the whole system; the utter failure of our leadership, their mindset, culture, values and above all, our own incapacity.
At independence we were considered a likely success story, a promise that has gradually withered away. It is comforting to blame somebody else. Undoubtedly, our leaders have failed. But is the failure, theirs alone

Set to  sway!
Maathra  the creative, spell-binding performing arts event produced and performed by Lyceum International Schools will be held for the 11th consecutive year at the BMICH on October 13, 3.02 pm and 5.58 pm.
One of the most popular performing art forms that has been incorporated into Lyceum's formal education is classic Sri Lankan cultural dancing, which displays the true beauty and elegance of our Sri Lankan culture. This type of dancing has not only earned unprecedented recognition both nationally and internationally, but is one that is enjoyed by all generations, regardless of their ethnic or religious background and must be preserved for future generations to come.
This resulted in the concept of 'Maathra', which was envisioned by Lyceum Founder Mohan Lal Grero and administered by Kumari Grero in 2008, with the aim of preserving and showcasing the beauty of Sri Lanka's rich, cultural heritage by instilling a love for traditional dancing in the young minds of our students. Over the past decade, Grero's vision was realized as Lyceum students have brought to life the rituals and dances of our ancestors through highly refined, stunning performances, which are now in par with Sri Lanka's National Inter-School cultural dancing standards.
The successful evolution of 'Maathra' was also purely due to the tireless efforts of Head of Cultural Dancing Rasika Kothalawala and his experienced group of teachers and students, who intricately choreograph and create a unique display of mesmerizing traditional dances in all of their shows.
The show comprises of nearly 500 performers from Lyceum International Schools' in Nugegoda, Panadura, Wattala, Ratnapura, Gampaha and Nuwara-Eliya and Kurunagala. The dances created by Kothalawala and his team incorporate a fusion of up-country, southern, Sabaragamuwa and other dance forms related to Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual national culture.

Simple tips to follow for long and beautiful nails
Its important to make sure your nails are thoroughly dirt-free. Long nails are beautiful, but regular trims are as important to your nails as they are to your hair. If your nails are brittle and break easily, its time to try some daily tips.
Ragini Mehra, founder at Beauty Source and Sapna Bedi-Khaitan, owner of Reign Studio, list down some ways to take care of nails.

Practice good nail hygiene: Without proper care, the nails become brittle and thin and so, it is essential to have a regular maintenance routine. Manicure and pedicure help in keeping healthy and shiny looking nails. Ensure that you stick to salons that have technicians who have undergone proper training. Wear gloves for better nail care when working with your hands, such as when you are gardening or housecleaning, to protect the polish and keep dirt out of your nails.

Choose correct nail lacquer and nail care collection: Wearing nail polish does not harm your healthy nails, but many of your favourite nail polishes and acrylics, are full of harsh chemicals that cause nail brittleness, dryness, and thinning. Ensure that you use products that are paraben-free, sulfate-free, formaldehyde-free, toxin-free, gluten-free, cruelty-free and vegan. Pick a nail colour remover that treats conditions that adversely affect nails and cuticles, preferable something that has the unique goodness of Vitamins A, C, and E.

Hydrate your hands: It is advised to wash the hands with lukewarm water to help keep the hands and nails soft and smooth. Also, apply a hand cream frequently which is enriched with fruit extracts. It will help in restoring and make the hands look hydrated and moisturised.

Coat it up: Bottom and top coat may seem unimportant, but they help to keep our nails from chipping, splitting, cracking and strengthen and protect the nail from being stained. The coats also do an awesome job smoothing imperfections. Try and pick up a top coat which has an external barrier harder than traditional top coats, so its more durable against wear and damage. Also look for UV protection in the formula to combat environmental damage to include fading and yellowing.

Nail extension: The nails are one of the parts of the body that can say more of a person. In fact, many people look at the hands because they say a lot about each others personality, the way of life. Presentable nails are equally important and if the nails do not grow and are short, its beneficial to get nail extension done. Take care of your nail extensions. Make sure that you fix the damaged nails as soon as possible and keep an eye out for dryness, redness and peeling of skin or cuticles.

Moisturise cuticles: Taking care of the cuticles is a critical part for a healthy growing nail. Dry, cracking cuticles not only make nails look messy, they can also cause hangnails and just plain hurt. Cuticles are part of your skin and serve the important purpose of acting as your nails protective barrier. Moisturise and massage with oils which have healing properties such as Argan Oil to restore moisture and repair damages.

SLR 300 mn Indian grant assistance for Dambulla cold storage warehouse
India and Sri Lanka signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) yesterday for the construction of a 5000-metric ton temperature controlled warehouse in Dambulla.
The event was held at the High Commission of India, Colombo in the presence of senior officials from the Sri Lankan Government.
The project envisages construction of a 5000-metric ton temperature controlled warehouse for fruits and vegetables to minimise its post-harvest losses, which are presently at around 40%.
This initiative will benefit the farming community by reducing wastage particularly during the peak season when there is surplus production.
This will help check the price fluctuation and ensure delivery of good quality agro produce to consumers.
This project is in continuation of Government of Indias efforts to partner with the Government of Sri Lanka in people oriented development projects.
Indias overall commitment of development assistance to Sri Lanka stands at a total of around US$ 3 billion, out of which US$ 550 million is pure grant assistance.

Snakes alive! With hugs and goodnight hisses!
Snakes by far are one of the most demonised and notorious creatures in the world. They are great targets of blame and are extremely misunderstood. In some cultures, they are even thought as demons and mascots of the Devil! There are few people who understand the true nature of snakes to realise they arent out to bite you for fun.
Since the days of Adam and Eve and that little misunderstanding in the Garden of Eden snakes have copped a bad rap in western culture. To some people they are the personification of evil and the merest glimpse can cause panic, fear and loathing.
Allow me to disagree with the anti-serpent lobby and state my case. Snakes are enigmatic. They are magnificent and beautiful. I think humans could learn a lot from snakes about how to survive in really adverse conditions, not unlike some of our laid-back bureaucracy. And, oh yes, I have had some painful encounters with them as well. I mean from some modern-day Civil Serpents as well as my captured snake menagerie.
I once wrote about my collection of water-snakes when I was around ten or eleven. I sold them at 10 to 12 bucks each although I kept one or two favourites among them as pets. There was the docile, non-venomous Checkered Keelback I named Oslo. Another with a more mean disposition, a dog-faced water-snake, I christened Jake, possessed a mild venom which rarely affected humans.
A year or so later I graduated to trapping Russel's Vipers, and sold them for Rs. 75 apiece, a princely sum at the time. Okay I am not ashamed to say that I was bitten by at least three varieties of serpents. Dozens of times by the more so-called low-class ones such as water snakes. Once by an equally considered lower-ranking rat-snake (garandiya). And once almost fatally by an elite thith-polonga on my right ankle.
That lesson made me more wary and extremely adept when attempting to capture them. My method of capturing a snake was to pin them down with the forked edge of a stick. In the absence of a stick you can trample its head lightly with your shoe. Then squat carefully and hold it securely behind the head with thumb and forefinger.
But you have to be careful and must hold it firmly by the sides of the neck as it squirms in desperation. If you hold it above and underneath the neck it could turn its head laterally and literally run its fangs into you. I was none the worse for my adventure except for a painful limp and the ignominy of friends and siblings calling me Nondi Pucks. But the limp lasted only two weeks until the wound healed.
Actually despite this setback I must say that the poor snake is a much reviled creature by people who have never handled or studied them. My adorable pets were often referred to as revolting slimy things. But contrary to such unfounded beliefs snakes, unlike worms, are dry skinned and indeed almost velvety to touch.
Try touching them sometime. Try moving your palm stroking the serpents skin. You will actually revel at its silken smoothness. They represent some of the most elegant creatures ever created in every way. You never find a snake with unsightly angles and corners. The movements of the snake are silent and graceful, they make no disturbing noise.
They slither silently and gracefully and move with hardly a rustle.
And they do not fight and quarrel with one another, which is more than can be said of the Human race. In fact, the malicious nature so often attributed to snakes is entirely non-existent.
A snake will often try to get away but will attack if threatened or confronted.
We loved out household maid Menika. She was a sort of surrogate mother to us. Menika adored us as well but she was initially terrified of my pets. But during the course of time she grew quite fond of my Oslo. She even fed him rice and slivers of raw fish on occasion.
During a party one night Menika and her new assistant, a comely village lass named Soma were at the kitchen sink washing the dishes. Soma had no inkling of the existence of Oslo who slithered up to her partner Menika and was inquiringly waiting for his promised treat.
Soma, the new retainer dropped a plate of a prized dinner set which smashed into smithereens and took off like a bat out of hell. Scores of guests rushed out to see what the hullabaloo was about.
My grandfather with his wry sense of humour explained that the woman was simply unused to having a snake that helped clean the dishes. He described Oslo as a Dish Viper.
I once sent my little sister and my female cousins into hysterics by promising to show them a magic trick. I slipped Oslo into a silken scarf which I tucked loosely inside my shirt.
I then confronted the giggling gaggle with an identical scarf which I kept dusting to prove there was nothing inside. I then spun around, adeptly extracting the scarf containing Oslo and replacing it with the empty one.
Then imitating the dramatic tones of a master magician I intoned the mystical incantation Abracadabra! The seven-year-olds looked on wide-eyed as I flung the scarf with the snake into their circle with a flourish. Once again I uttered the chant Abracadabra! The scarf moved as Oslo took his cue and slithered out as I slightly amended the mantra to Abracad-cobra! Needless to say I got into a heck of a lot of trouble over that escapade and the girls did not speak to me for weeks on end.
But I managed to convince cousin Suzie who was paranoid of rats that no rodent would ever approach our territory as long as Oslo was around. She petted Oslo one night as he came slithering into my room.
She said quite innocently: I like Oslo and he likes me. Hes quite cute and smooth to the touch. But he loves you the best. I asked her how she came to that conclusion.
She replied quite logically: Because he comes over every night to give you a hug and a goodnight hiss!

Song from the heart
I follow the winds that bring the cold. I light a fire in your soul, the lightest touch of feathers falling, my love may be invisible but I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby - Satellite by Above and Beyond
A memory, a story and a lesson is behind the soul in her singing. Life is journey where she has not limited herself to one genre of music. Melodies speaks to Hirushi Jayasena who sings with a heart full of gratitude towards those she has touched in life, and who in return have placed a song in her heart.
Id like to dedicate my journey to everyone who gave me a story, memory, or a lesson that is the reason behind the songs I sing, the lyrics I write, and the tunes I play. Singing has always been an experiment and I simply cannot limit myself to a type! said Jayasena
Music is a powerful force in anyones life that can uplift, hearten and transform you. It can move you emotionally in a powerful way. The effect it can have on an audience is irresistible. The effect it can have on you is instantaneous helping you relate to its lyrics.
If a musical note is a letter, then a bar is a sentence, and the melody is a story. Despite what divides us, music is a universal language that taps into whats in the heart. I always wanted to be an agent in changing hearts for the better, added Jayasena.
Jayasena does original vocals, film playback singing and instrumental covers, but she hopes to give priority to her own projects in the future. The future is certainly bright for Jayasena who is very busy these days writing the next chapter in her life.
I have a few tracks in line but right now its all about launching the Hanguman music video, audio produced by Pasan Liyanage and written by aunty Malini Liyanage. I am super excited about this! If you ask me which songs means the most to me, I think Hanguman is an important one for me. Because for the first time in my life I sang a song that I can entirely relate to in my reality. I have done live performances over the decade, but the one I got most positive feedback was for the live show Sihinayaki Re telecast on Rupavahini. That was a different kind of experience for me as well, pointed out Jayasena.
Life has been a journey where she has found herself musically and where she has found out who she is! It has been a process of self-discovery both career wise and personally.
Freddie Mercurys Bohemian Rhapsody taught me the importance of breaking free of a flawed past that wasn't you, and seeking the future to find yourself. Learning the lives of musicians gives me so much hope and I feel free to face life. But inspiration in general is unlimited. It'll keep coming. I have many favorites ranging from Beethoven to Big Sean! explained Jayasena.
Constantly comparing herself to others is not Jayasenas cup of tea. For her success is relative. What is important to herself is how happy she is in her heart. She loves what she does and lives life on her own terms.
The main tip for success is to admit that success is relative, and its mainly about what you feel within you. Do what you love, Love what you do. I adapt to any kind of situation and I am a tomboy at heart. I always aspire to live the truth, pointed out Jayasena.
From her small days music has had a strong effect on her. You could say that it was in her blood. She took part in as many competitions as possible. Since she was six it has been a continuous process of making the best out of every opportunity. She has welcomed challenges in her life. And she credits part of her success to never stepping away from a challenge.
I loved singing since I was six! Represented schools, universities and clubs for different kinds of competitions and events. Challenges were a requirement for me and it never left. And Ive come this far because of them, added Jayasena.
Jayasena attributes her success to a strong support system. She thanks her loving parents, her studio family at Redfox, friends, significant ones for believing in her, and thanks all artists and professionals who supported her in the industry. And last but not least her loving fans who have been incredible. Jayasena is in no rush to go anywhere taking life as it comes. However this does not mean she has no goals. She is looking forward to the future having set specific objectives and goals academically and artistically. She is taking it one day at a time.
Her favorite lyrics are - I follow the winds that bring the cold. I light a fire in your soul, the lightest touch of feathers falling, my love may be invisible but I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby - Satellite by Above and Beyond.
There is no number 1# performance that makes her happy because she is always looking at tomorrow and what she enjoys doing. There will be so many hits in the future. So many worlds to conquer!
I think thats something I cant measure because its all in the delivery. Maybe there is a #1 out there of mine that I never thought about. There were times when I won or achieved things, but the best moments are when you meet amazing people who eventually turn into family. They are very simple times which didnt have a spotlight or wasnt published, said Jayasena

Soul-searching as Wallabies ranking hits new low
SYDNEY Sunday: The Wallabies will slump to their lowest world ranking ever Monday, sparking soul-searching about what can be done with a troubled team that has managed just two wins in their last nine Tests.
Their alarming slide was reinforced by the 23-19 upset win by Argentina on the Gold Coast on Saturday -- the first victory for the Pumas on Australian soil in 35 years, which left the Wallabies last on the four-team Rugby Championship ladder.
It will see them fall to seventh from fifth when World Rugby's adjusted rankings are released later Monday -- their lowest since the current system began in 2003. And it won't be getting any easier with a difficult trip in a fortnight to a buoyant South Africa, who are full of confidence after upsetting the All Blacks in Wellington on Saturday.
They then face an equally upbeat Argentina in Salta before travelling to Japan to take on New Zealand in the final Bledisloe Cup clash ahead of a tour to Europe.
Coach Michael Cheika blasted his players after the Argentina defeat for their lack of enthusiasm and energy, and he knows the time for excuses are over.
You can't be talking about keeping the faith, you need to show it, he said. In this situation, it is about having the courage to stand up and turn it around.
'Woeful Wallabies'
Such is the concern at their slump that Rugby Australia is considering bringing in someone with a different perspective to work with Cheika, according to The Australian newspaper's senior sports writer Wayne Smith.
The two leading candidates to act as player mentors are former captains John Eales and George Gregan. Smith suggested the poor run of form was not so much Cheika's fault, but the players, who have been guilty of missing simple tackles and failing to capitalise on attacking opportunities.
He has stuck by his team through thick and thin, deflecting praise onto his players on those increasingly rare occasions when they have done something wonderful, but taking the blame upon himself all those other times when they failed to deliver, he wrote.
These days he is being hung out to dry and what are his players doing to help him Not much at all.
The Sydney Daily Telegraph was equally bleak in its assessment, fearing there is not much light at the end of the tunnel.
Even their most loyal supporters have lost all faith after the Wallabies' fourth home defeat this year, it said, adding that the excuses have worn thin.
And now Michael Cheika's wounded men are facing the ultimate road trip into some of the most hostile rugby grounds on the planet. Fairfax Media bemoaned the Wallabies' skillset as poor -- awful really.
It seems astonishing to say but there are few good passers in the Wallabies backline, it said under a headline Woeful Wallabies hit a new low. After four rounds of the Rugby Championship the Wallabies are bottom. Sadly, they deserve to be." AFP

Sri Lanka lose to Saudi Arabia 1-3
Sri Lanka went down to Saudi Arabia three sets to one (25-22, 22-25, 19-25, 21-25) in the final match of preliminary round of the ongoing Asia Mens Challenge Cup Volleyball tournament at the Sugathadasa stadium yesterday. Sri Lanka who were well up to yesterday heading the group with two wins failed to live up to expectations as they made many blunders on the court.
The game which began at 6.30 p.m. saw Saudis take the lead at the first technical break, 8-7 but the Lankan spikers fought well to take the lead of two points with attractive spiking. They kept on to the lead and went on to wrap up the set 25-22 to the cheers of large crowd present to witness the game.
The second set began with Lankan spikers were off to flying start and got a slender two pint lead and moved firmly up to 13 point mark. Visitors sensing the danger got their act together and fought gallantly to equalize at this point. But the Lankan lads once again went ahead to make it 19-14. At this stage Lankans made many faults and bad spiking gave Saudis the opportunity to equalize again. There onward it was the visitors who took control of the set and finished the set 25-22 making it two sets each.
With the second set victory visitors gained morale and came for the third set fully geared to fight out the set. As expected they were well prepared to challenge the locals and played well to continue the good start they got at the beginning and finished the set 25-19 to take a firm grip of the match with a 2-1 lead. This set too saw our spikers failing to live up to expectations and giving away many points.
Saudis making good use of their height to the maximum made no mistakes in the fourth set and got off to firm lead of 7-3. They continued from that point and moved smoothly to destroy Lankans hope winning the set to stretch the game to full length and won the set 52-21. Local spikers did some hard work at the last moment but were too late to make amends to the loss gained in the early sets.
As Sri Lanka failed to be on top of the group they will have to confront United Arab Emirates in the quarter final on Wednesday while Saudis take on Mongolia in the morning.
The other two quarter finals between Malaysia and Iraq and the final quarter between Bangladesh and Hong Kong are scheduled to be played on Wednesday evening at the same venue.
