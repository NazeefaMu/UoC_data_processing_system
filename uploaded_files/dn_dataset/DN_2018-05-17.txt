Sand-mining at Yan Oya to resume
It was learnt that certain parties including the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB), had been attempting to revive sand-mining activities at the Yan Oya reservoir, which had been recently suspended on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Yan Oya Reservoir Project information sources revealed that a group of officials attached to the GSMB had launched an exploratory investigation into the sand deposit site, collecting data such as the consignment of sand that could be extracted until the projects completion, prevention of environmental contamination and modes of monitoring sand excavation while adhering to permitted conditions. However, residents of the Yan Oya and Wahalkada areas along with families being resettled, were reported to have opposed the renewal of sand-mining licenses and the issuance of new mining and transportation permits.
Sources said that taking the environmental pollution caused by such activities into consideration (such as seepage into dams and adjoining water sources) along with the continued opposition for the project, the site was closed and the issuance of sand-mining permits were halted by the President.
It was revealed that by that time, around 250,000 cubic metres of sand had been excavated and that the GSMB had earned nearly Rs. 200 million.
At a Yan Oya Reservoir Progress Review Committee meeting headed by Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka, Yan Oya reservoir project officials including irrigation engineers, had said that the poorly supervised sand-mining work being carried out beyond the permitted three-metre depth, would damage the reservoirs basin which was composed of limestone and in turn, result in seepage.
An Anuradhapura district mining engineer had said that reckless and prolonged sand-mining had created large pits within the reservoir catchment region.
Later, it was decided to neither extend the existing permits nor to issue new permits in this connection. Meanwhile, the Anuradhapura District Coordinating Committees attention was brought to the sand deposit issue when Irrigation officials had pointed out that the disposal of sand available in the reservoir site would adversely affect the final stage of the reservoirs construction work.
Committee Co-Chairman and Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake and Parliamentarian Chandima Gamage, had called for more clarifications and opinions from the GSMB and the reservoir project management committee, including the Anuradhapura government agent, with regard to the re-opening of the sand deposit for further mining.
In reply, they had said that the re-issuance of mining permits would be initiated with a special investigation committee consisting of Irrigation officials and representatives of all other relevant agencies to overlook the excavation activities.
The said committee would recommend whether further sand mining would be detrimental or not by submitting a detailed report on the areas and extent of mining activities along with the quantity of sand to be mined from each area, transportation conditions and a transparent taxation system.
A Yan Oya Reservoir Project Management Committee spokesman, referring to the sand deposit issue, said that if sand mining and transportation activities which had previously jeopardised the Rs. 36-billion worth project were allowed to be carried out again, history would repeat itself.
He said rather than promoting sand-mining, the two-years-overdue resettlement programme and the compensation programme for the lands acquired to accommodate the reservoirs infrastructural facilities, should be accelerated.

SC dismisses petition challenging SFs appointment
A writ petition filed challenging the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as a Member of Parliament was yesterday dismissed by the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena refused to issue notices on the respondents citing there is no sufficient materials before court in order to support the allegation. The Supreme Court held that court cannot rely on newspaper articles to indicate that Sarath Fonseka was not a member of UNP at the time of nominations were handed over.
This petition had been filed by retired Major and former Southern Provincial Councillor Ajith Prasanna.
The petitioner had sought an order in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto declaring that the Democratic Party leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is disqualified and not entitled to be elected as a Member of Parliament of the United National Party and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The petitioner had cited MP Sarath Fonseka, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and three others as respondents.
The Petitioner stated that it is a mutation of the franchise of the people of Sri Lanka to permit Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka be declared elected as a member of the National List of the UNP wherein he was not a Candidate (in the District Lists or National List) of the UNP at the time of the Parliamentary Elections 2015.
The petitioner further stated that the nomination of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was not a Candidate of the UNP at the time of Parliamentary Elections 2015 is abhorrent and repugnant to every known principle of Democracy, Franchise and the founding principles of franchise and proportional representation, and the applicable provisions of the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act.
The petitioner specifically states that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has now usurped and unlawfully exercised powers of a Member of Parliament, despite not being qualified to hold such position and the Petitioner is entitled to seek a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto requiring Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to demonstrate as to under what authority he claims to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The petitioner states that the Petitioner is entitled to a declaration from Court declaring that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
Counsel Thishya Weragoda with Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the petitioner. Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General.

Senadhipathi files FR to prevent arrest
Avant Garde Maritime Service Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi has filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order against him being arrested.
This is on the purported violation of the Firearms Ordinance and Explosive Act as set out in the B report submitted to the Magistrates court of Galle case.
In his petition, Senadhipathi cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekara, the Attorney General and 15 others as respondents. Senadhipathi stated that the vessel MV Avant Garde was detained and taken control of by the Sri Lanka Navy in international waters.
The weapons and ammunition on board MV Avant Garde belonged to the Government of Sri Lanka and entrusted to Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited (RALL) which is also a fully state owned entity which was under the purview of the Defence Ministry.
He said there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that the operations carried out between Avant Garde and RALL were tainted with any form of illegality.
Senadhipathi believes that police officers visited his residence informing him to visit the CID to record a statement. He believes that no sooner the said statement is recorded that he will be arrested and taken into custody for the alleged violations of the provisions in the Firearms Ordinance and Explosive Act based on the ex-facie false and baseless allegations.

The EBITDA margin of the Group increased from 30.1% last year to 30.8%. Controlling of cost escalations while sustaining revenue growth have resulted in better EBITDA levels. The group revenue for the quarter under review was reported at Rs. 19.8 billion with Year on Year growth of 5.9%, while operating cost was reported at Rs 13.7 billion during the quarter with 4.7% year on year increase.
Large investments made by the group during the recent years have continued to affect the company profits adversely due to mainly the increased charges in depreciation. The Group Depreciation and amortization have increased by Rs 512 million in absolute terms showing a 12.8% Year on Year increase to Rs 4.5 billion. This increase of depreciation and amortization has resulted in a marginal drop in Group operating profit to Rs. 1.58 billion compared to Rs 1.62 billion in the corresponding period of previous year. The group has largely invested in new technology and capacity expansion of LTE, FTTH, IPTV, Global connectivity and Mobile services in catering the expanding customer base and providing more services.
The gamut of SLTs investments in the recent past also included the expansion of National Backbone Network, launching of its newly built state-of-the-art Tier 3 Data Centre the countrys first Purpose built tier 3 Data Centre, SEA-ME-WE 5 undersea cable system, and newly established cable landing station in Matara within the third quarter. SLT is also committed to further oversee South Asias first cutting-edge submarine cable depot in the Galle Port. With enhancing multiple global connectivity options with SEA-ME-We 5 international submarine cable system, company also provides global connectivity backhauling facility to international operators.

As reasoning out under group performance, the company depreciation and amortization have also increased almost to Rs.3billion during the 1st quarter 2018. Despite the increase of depreciation and amortization the company reported an Operating Profit of Rs. 502 million during the 1st quarter 2018, with an increase of 4% from same quarter of the previous year.

Sri Lanka committed to gender equality
Many national commitments have been made by the Sri Lankan Government regarding gender equality and there are also thriving civil society organisations that work to make sure that gender rights are respected, said French Ambassador to Sri Lanka Jean-Marin Schuh in an interview with the Daily News.
France is continuing its ambitious action to promote equality through its third International Strategy for gender equality (2018-2022), a strategy that was adopted on February 8, 2018.
France has supported initiatives in favour of gender equality and the rights of women in many global forums, the ambassador emphasized.
Excerpts:
Q: A recent release issued by French government states that France is enhancing the effectiveness and consistency of the gender actions in its development assistance and external action policies. What specific actions have been taken by the French Government to address gender inequality
A: France is continuing its ambitious action to promote equality through its third International Strategy for gender equality (2018-2022). This strategy was adopted on February 8, 2018.
Today, women and girls continue to face gender inequalities and discrimination across all world regions, when they must be actors of the proper functioning of societies and sustainable development, on an equal footing with men, and should be fully recognized as such.
This strategy commits all Frances external action, above and beyond the sole area of development, in all its political, economic, soft diplomacy, cultural and educational aspects, where respect for womens rights, gender equality and the refusal of all discrimination based on gender are prerequisites for any action.
The strategy applies an integrated approach to equality between women and men, known as gender mainstreaming. This means taking into account gender equality in the objectives of all French policies, fields of action and external action instruments.
Q: Are you satisfied with your governments commitment to gender equality within its borders
A: This is a long process, spanning decades. A lot has been done over the years on equality of rights  political or social rights, women have gained control over their own body, over the decisions they make. There is still work to be done on enforcing those rights: for example, equal pay is a requirement by law. But figures show that womens salaries still lag behind those of men for the same work. And that they often get part-time jobs more frequently than men. On another issue, we must strive to guarantee access to rights and justice. President Macron has made gender equality the great cause of his presidential mandate. It is our duty to put our words into action within our own borders, our own institutions, companies, schools, and daily life.
Q: The French government has said it is committed to improving the situation of women worldwide through its third International Strategy on gender equality for 2018-2022. Please elaborate.
A: In accordance with the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), this strategy stresses:
* Girls education. Enabling girls to stay at school means avoiding early marriage and pregnancy that deprive them of prospects of empowerment and right to decide over their body, their rights, and their participation in public and economic life.
* Guaranteeing sexual and reproductive rights for women and girls. On the international stage, France supports policies and measures in line with its national policies, aimed at enabling all women and girls to enjoy the right to decide on their body and access suitable sexual and reproductive health services.
* Economic empowerment of women. France promotes the effective inclusion of the needs and role of women and girls in climate-related issues during national and international negotiations, in action plans and infield actions at local and international levels.
* Free and equal access of women and girls to rights and justice, and protection against all forms of violence. The strategy takes into account the phenomenon of femicide, promotes the protection of the defenders of womens rights and gender equality and the involvement of men and boys in combating violence against women and girls.
* Strengthening the voice and effective participation of women and girls in public life and promoting the United Nations Women, Peace and Security Agenda. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, France will strive to achieve a change in perception, so that women are no longer seen solely as victims and so as to better highlight their role in conflict and post-conflict situations.
Q: Whats your understanding of Sri Lankas commitment to gender equality Are you planning to take up this matter with the Sri Lankan Government
A: Many national commitments have been made by the Sri Lankan Government regarding gender equality such as the elaboration of the National Plan of Action on Sex and Gender-based violence (2017-2021), a dedicated Chapter on Womens Rights in the Human Rights Action Plan (2017-2021), the National Framework for Women-Headed Household (2017-2019), the introduction of quotas and Gender Mainstreaming committees within the public institutions. Many efforts are still to be done, but the government pays attention and there are thriving civil society organisations that work to make sure that these rights are respected. From a cultural point of view, more and more Sri Lankan artistes take part in the struggle against gender inequalities.
We work with these organisations and the government, we listen to them, this is a constant concern in our action in Sri Lanka.
Q: Is the French government planning to discuss matters related to gender equality at a global forum
A: We always do. France has supported initiatives in favour of gender equality and the rights of women in many forums: the United Nations, with the Security Council resolutions on Women, Peace and Security; within the General Assembly, with the resolutions against female genital mutilations and forced marriage. We are extremely involved with the Commission on the Status of Women of the Economic and Social Council. And of course, we supported the creation of UN Women. Within the European Union, guidelines on violence against women and girls and combating all forms of discrimination against them were adopted in 2008. We participated in establishing the Council of Europes Convention on Preventing and Combating violence against women and domestic violence. These are only a few examples, but one of the objectives of the Third International Strategy for gender equality is intensifying Frances political advocacy in the area of gender equality. France is a leading player in international and European forums, committed at the highest level to promote womens rights and empowerment. France will continue, with its partners, to defend ambitious positions in favour of the rights of women and girls and will be a spearhead on the subject of womens rights in international forums.
Q: Gender-related issues vary from country to country. However, based on Frances findings, what are the best and worst countries for gender equality
A: Gender equality is a global issue. Unfortunately, womens rights are still violated in every part of the world, in so many different ways. The main issue in the struggle against gender inequalities is not to establish a ranking. It is to increase awareness, concrete commitments and actions worldwide, especially by developing integrated and transversal approaches in order to deeply change our societies and the way they look at women. France has made this issue a priority within its borders and abroad.

Pelwatte butter is considered natural due to many reasons; one of them being that the butter is made from the fat in fresh milk with no added preservatives. Fresh milk contains about 4-5 per cent fat and the process of butter production tends to increase the fat percentage so in order to control the fat percentage a standardization process is used which is also another reason as to why Pelwatte Butter is considered all-natural.

You gave me a 1920 shopping experience! I shouted, And the salesman called me a village bumpkin!
I guess I havent got the dates finetuned in my software! mumbled my friend. Now lets see, where would you like to go
Walmart! I said, and in a jiffy, I was in Albany, New York in the largest store in the world, Id like to meet Sam Walton, your owner! I told a salesgirl Hi Bob! I heard a voice and was bowled over by the simplicity of the billionaire owner, Mr Walton! I said, Please dont sell off your stores, I want to continue shopping the old-fashioned way! You know, touch the fabric, smell the book, try out my clothes!
I know! said Mr Walton, But youve got to move with the times. Come let me virtually take you through my store!
I dont want to virtually go anywhere! I screamed and found my young IT friend touching me reassuringly on my shoulder, I met Sam Walton, I cried.
But Walton died in 1992! said my friend.
Oh my god I met a ghost! I said and stumbled out to the local store and hugged the shopkeeper who hugged me back, Sir! he whispered, You dont have to come here anymore, we have an online portal!
No! I screamed and held onto real books and clothes and sniffed the welcome air of sweaty fitting rooms for the last time..!

Taking the Arrow out of the Heart
This Sunday, going through the news-feed on Facebook where everyone was posting pictures of their mothers and vigorously proclaiming they have the best mother in the world, I couldnt help but wonder if any of those great mothers out there were writers. What kind of mothers day card did Susan Sontags son, David, give his mother Especially when Sigrid Nunez who wrote a memoir of Sontag says in Sempre Susan, She was not a mom. Every once in a while, noticing how dirty Davids glasses were, shed pluck them from his face and wash them at the kitchen sink. I remember thinking it was the only momish thing I ever saw her do. Did Sontag need to be more momish And if she had beenor if she had more children to drop off with the in-laws or the babysitterswould she have been the same writer Would we have the legacy of her numerous work to read today Sontag aside, how do the rest of us mortals who are writers and mothers negotiate the balance between selfhood and motherhood
Ask Alice Walker. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author believes the secret behind successful writers is having only one child. They (writers) should have childrenassuming this is of interest to thembut only one. Why Because with one you can move, she says. With more than one youre a sitting duck.
Having avoided being a sitting duck, by having only one daughter, Walker went on to become an internationally celebrated writer, poet and activist whose books include seven novels, four collections of short stories, four childrens books, and volumes of essays and poetry and most recently a Tony-nominated play based on her signature novel  The Color Purple. It was Color Purple, which catapulted her into an international celebrity, making her the first African American woman to win the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 1983. The book also won the American Book award and was adapted for film by Steven Spielberg with a cast that included Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey.While the book and film brought fame and money and established Walker in the canon of American literature, it also brought criticism, the most wounding of which she dealt with in her book about the film, The Same River Twice.
Of all the accusations, it was hardest to tolerate the charge that I hated black men, she wrote. From infancy, I have relied on the fiercely sweet spirits of black men; and this is abundantly clear in my work.
Which no doubt, is true. Growing up as the last of eight children of Minnie Lou Grant Walker and Willie Lee Walker Alice was precocious, outgoing and adored by all. Her father was a sharecropper on a white-owned farm. Braving the Ku Klux Klan, he was the first black man in their county to vote. Her mother worked in the cotton fields and later as a maid. Alice remembers her as the source of her own strong sense of purpose. In a moving essay, she once wrote about how her mother gave her a suitcase, a typewriter, and a sewing machine so that she could do what she wanted; write, travel and make her own clothes. She saw to it very thoughtfully out of her meager earnings and provided those things she felt that I needed to get away from this town that was very racist, very backwards, where we had been living. So that is part of what infuses my work: this deep sense of gratitude to her and actually to my father as well. To start me out on my education in whatever way that they could.
She also laments that not one of her seven brothers and sisters became the person they should have been  because of poverty, because of racism, because of poor diet and drugs, because of the war. The boys went off to the Army.
She escaped the plight of her siblings when she won a scholarship to Sarah Lawrence where her writing skills were praised highly by acclaimed writers. After graduating with honours she worked briefly for a welfare office in New York City, but soon realized that it left her little time for writing. So she accepted a summer job in Mississippi with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, working to establish the civil rights of poor blacks in the deepest of the segregationist South. Here she met and fell in love with her co-worker, the young Jewish civil rights lawyer Melvyn Leventhal. They married in 1967 despite the sharp disapproval of his mother and the fears of her family and their friends for their safety  in Mississippi miscegenation was condemned and biracial marriage illegal. Daughter Rebecca was born in 1969. Walker often felt overwhelmed trying to combine motherhood with writing and teaching (she held positions at Jackson State, Tougalou College, and later at the University of Massachusetts Boston, Wellesley College and Brandeis University): I was afraid I could not be a successful writer and a mother at the same time, she has stated often.
A claim her daughter endorses. Yet, even though there are doubts and possible misunderstandings about Alice Walkers success as a mother, as a writer and an activist she managed to scale great heights. In 1983, the year after The Color Purple appeared, she published her most famous collection of essays, In Search of Our Mothers Gardens: Womanist Prose, in which she set forth her concept of womanism as a black feminist or feminist of color. The term helped broaden the womens movement (the word, feminism tended to focus on white women) to include women of color and appreciate their traditional cultural and creative roles.
As for not succeeding as a mother, she has her excuses. I believe you mother everybody, not in a cloying, hovering way, but taking care of what is around you. We have suffered from building a country on the bones of the children of Indians. So true motherhood is accepting that everything needs to be cared for, not just your own child. Having entered into an Earth Mother mode, she confesses that her strength comes from a belief in Nature (also under incredible stress), and that her own spirit is tuned more to the natural world than to electoral politics.
Today, she sees herself as a dedicated nomad. I sometimes think its having grown up as the daughter of sharecroppers. That pattern of having to move from one shack to another  after the family has been exploited for its labor. Its in the rhythm of my being. Now, I have places here and places there. I go from one to the other. I want to feel that the planet is my home, but I know there are parts of the planet where Im really not wanted...
She has her own theory on how to overcome this pain  the pain of being an outcast in a world bound by conventional beliefs. No one escapes a time in life when the arrow of sorrow, of anger, of despair pierces the heart. For many of us, there is the inevitable need to circle the wound. It is often such a surprise to find it there, in us, when we had assumed arrows so painful only landed in the hearts of other people. Some of us spend decades screaming at the archer. Or at least for longer periods than are good for us. How to take the arrow out of the heart How to learn to relieve our own pain That is the question. Like many such questions it is one delved into by Buddhism, but also by anyone who has lived long enough to see, by trial and error, for the most part, that the futility we begin to feel, as we attempt to bring down the archer, leaves our wounded heart untended and the medicine of life that abounds wherever we are, is left unapplied.
This kind of wisdom comes with age. At 74, Walker says she is now an elder. When you get to be my age you accept being an elder. And theres great freedom in that. So much of your life is already lived. You feel empowered to say exactly what you think. And to share what you have gleaned whatever wisdom there is. And its actually quite beautiful, a wonderful place to be in.

Test debut just  the beginning  for upbeat Ireland
DUBLIN, Wednesday: Ireland's men's Test debut ended in a loss to Pakistan but the country's top cricket administrator is confident the game can become a "major sport" on the domestic scene within a decade.
Ireland were eyeing a miracle at Malahide when, having been made to follow-on, they reduced Pakistan to 14 for three on Tuesday's fifth morning only for the tourists to eventually chase down a target of 160 for a five-wicket success.
"We've always said Test cricket wasn't the end of the journey, it's the beginning," Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom explained after the match.
"We've probably done this the wrong way around. Most teams, they get very good at what they do domestically then they make a big noise globally. We've made a big noise globally and are using that as a means of driving popularity and visibility of the sport back here in Ireland."
Gaelic games, rugby and football dominate the Irish sporting landscape but Deutrom is convinced cricket, with its international reach, can make its mark.
"We're not going to suddenly be the biggest sport overnight but if I look back where we were 10 years ago to where we are now, and trace the potential for us over the next five, 10 years, there's no reason why we shouldn't be a major sport in Ireland," he insisted.
While England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has come under fire for suggesting none of the sport's current formats appeal to youngsters, Deutrom is looking to the limited overs game to help build a fanbase. Cricket superpower India come to Ireland for two Twenty20 internationals in June and Deutrom said: "We need to keep playing (Test cricket) because why otherwise would we have sought the status But we don't want to do too much of it. It's going to be financially unsustainable.
"The Irish public has only ever really existed on a diet of ODIs (one-day internationals)," the Englishman added.
"We're really looking forward to the huge games against India coming up in June. I think we've nearly sold out the second game, which is 8,000 people, which is fantastic.
"The opportunities to grow the game will come primarily through the white-ball game but we still want to keep in contact with the Test format. It's our way of maintaining our connection with the tradition of the sport."
There are concerns over whether Ireland have the playing depth to build on an impressive run of results that have included World Cup wins over Pakistan, England and the West Indies. Several members of the team that played in the Test match at Dublin's Malahide Cricket Club are in their 30s, with opener Ed Joyce, who has scored 47 first-class hundreds, nudging 40.
But Deutrom is confident Cricket Ireland are establishing structures beneath the national side -- including the three-team inter-provincial first-class competition -- that will allow the likes of batsman James Shannon to step up when the 'golden generation' finally call it a day.
"We're now into the sixth season of our inter-provincial competition," said Deutrom. "It was a risk because we could set it up and then we weren't going to get any funding to make it sustainable. Hanley Energy have come in to make it sustainable.
"We set up an academy at the same time as well, in 2013.
"Are we doing the right things Yes, I believe we are.
"Now that we're on the FTP (Future Tours Programme) we're going to have the opportunity to have more reciprocal arrangements with the major countries to make sure we give the next tier of players opportunities, not just in our inter-provincial competition, through the academy but then also to have A team cricket to make sure when we've got guys coming into the international team there as ready as they can be." - AFP

When they say '' I do ''
Senali Perera
As the world awaits a much loved prince and his lady to say I do, there are only so many details to be curious about such a special day. UKs Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are getting ready for a remarkably unique wedding which will take place in just a few days.
In March, Kensington Palace revealed that the wedding will be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too. This wedding, like all weddings, will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the characters and values of the Bride and Groom.
The proposal 
It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet, and natural and very romantic, said the former American actress of the proposal during the couples first sit-down interview with the British Broadcast Corporation (BBC). The beautiful moment was shared by the couple as they roasted a chicken at home.
She didnt even let me finish. She said Can I say yes, the prince shared. Then there were hugs and I had the ring on my finger. I was like Can I give you the ring It was a really nice moment. Just the two of us.

A remarkable ring 
Harry designed the ring, which was then made by court jewelers Cleave and Company using one diamond sourced from Botswana and two smaller stones from Princess Dianas collection.
The ring is obviously yellow gold because thats [Markles] favorite and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mothers jewelry collection, to make sure that shes with us on this crazy journey together, Harry told the BBC. Harry often refers to Botswana as his second home; the couple also recently vacationed to the African country for Meghans birthday.
I first went to Botswana in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me we were going to Africa to get away from it all. This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world, the Prince told ABC News. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.

The big day 
The wedding is on Saturday, May 19 at St Georges Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The service will begin at 12pm.
After the ceremony, at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St Georges Hall, for the first of two receptions. The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales.

A special best man 
The chosen date falls on the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley, a match that Prince Harrys best man, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William usually attends as president of the Football Association to present the trophy. The May date may also have been selected in order to give the Duchess of Cambridge time to recover after the birth of her third child, Prince Louis, who arrived in April, this year.

The guest-list 
The guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St Georges Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.
Using American ink on English card, each invite has been printed in gold and black, then burnished to bring out the shine, and gilded around the edge. The three-feathered badge of the Prince of Wales is given pride of place in the centre, reports vogue.co.uk
According to telegraph, other guests will include members of Markles family - her mother Doria Ragland and father Thomas Markle Snr and many members of the royal family.

Tennis star Serena Williams and Markles former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.
Markle may also choose some grown-up bridesmaids from her close set of friends - most likely Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney and Indian actress and philanthropist Priyanka Chopra. She might even pick a best woman.
Markle, who was a UN womens advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings, telegraph further reports.

Music with an American slant 
Markle will bring an American slant to the Royal Weddings musical repertoire, according to orchestra conductor Christopher Warren-Green who will be leading musicians during the ceremony, announced express.co.uk
The theme, just like anybodys wedding, has to reflect something, and what that something is Im not going to say. I think its safe for me to say without a doubt we will have an American slant to this wedding  of course. said the orchestra conductor to express.co.uk

Outside of tradition 
Markle and Prince Harry have commissioned Claire Ptak, owner of London-based Violet Bakery, to make a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream frosting and decorated with fresh flowers for their big day, reports foodnetwork. The cake is a (delicious) break from the traditional fruitcake, which has been served at royal weddings for generations. Prince William and Duchess Kate only slightly skirted tradition at their wedding by having a chocolate biscuit grooms cake served alongside a traditional eight-tier fruitcake.

Princess or Duchess 
Harry is sixth in line to the throne and most insiders believe that if the Queen hands him a royal dukedom, like Prince William received upon his 2011 wedding, Prince Harry will be made the Duke of Sussex or Duke of Connaught on his own wedding day which would make Markle the Duchess of each too, mirroring Kates title of the Duchess of Cambridge. When Catherine Middleton and Prince William were pronounced man and wife in 2011, she automatically became Her Royal Highness, Princess William of Wales. The overwhelming likelihood is that Markle will in turn, officially become HRH Princess Henry of Wales. This is due to rules governing the British crown, only those born into the royal family can use the title Prince or Princess, followed by their first name.

Wedding gifts 
The couple have requested that guests skip the wedding gifts and donate to the following: CHIVA (Childrens HIV Association), Crisis (a UK-based homelessness charity), the Myna Mahila Foundation (a charity that supports women in Mumbais urban slums), Scottys Little Soldiers (which helps bereaved Armed Forces children), StreetGames (a foundation using sport to change lives), Surfers against Sewage and The Wilderness Foundation UK (which promotes the enjoyment of wild nature).
If you remember letting out a sigh of adoration on the wedding days of Prince Charles and Diana or Prince William and Kate, then, be prepared  another grand day is just around the corner. Ready those dreamy eyes and excited heart, join the joy of a royal love story, of a much anticipated I do.

At  your  fingertips
When there are beauty enhancers for every part of your body, should your nails be left out Well groomed nails are an essential part of looking good. Your nails are also a fashion statement and can complement your wardrobe. Beautifully applied nail polish adds more beauty to the nails and attracts attention.
Technique of applying nail polish 
Clean each nail with Non Acetone Polish Remover.
Always start with a basecoat before applying coloured nail polish. This will avoid the nail plate from discolouring. 
Apply one or two layers of your favourite nail polish. Remove the brush from the bottle and wipe off on one side. Place the brush in the middle of the nail, slightly away from the cuticle, gently push down towards the cuticle and sweep over the centre of the nail up to the free edge. Seal the free edge of the nail for extended wear.
Finish with your favourite topcoat for glossy nails and extended wear.
Best shape for nails 
Simple and classic, round shapes are the easiest to maintain at home or in between salon visits.
The short length and natural curved edge are a no-fuss option for anyone who puts their fingers to work.
Why nail polish thickens after a while 
As polish ages, the solvents evaporate, causing it to thicken and get stringy.
This makes applying polish quite difficult.
Old polish also doesnt adhere to the nail as well as fresh polish does. As a rule of thumb, go through your polishes every year and replace anything you didnt buy in the last 12 months.
Reason for peeling nails 
Make sure all the polishes, base and top coats are fresh and not thickened. When polish is applied very thickly its more likely to peel off. Prepare your nails for polishing. Give yourself a proper manicure making sure you clean your nail bed and push back your cuticles.
Discoloured nails 
Nail discolouration, in which the nails appear white, yellow, or green, can result from different infections and conditions of the skin. In about 50 percent of the cases, discoloured nails are a result of infections with common fungi that can be found in the air, dust, and soil.
Use a base coat to combat this issue. A base coat is typically a clear nail polish that goes onto your fingernails first, keeping the colored fingernail polish-and its potential lingering stain-off your nails.
White spots on nails 
The white spots on your nails are not caused by a calcium deficiency. These white spots in fingernails are called leukonychia and are very common. Most of the time the white spots simply are a sign of some past injury to the matrix (base) of your nails.
Remedies for nails which can break easily 
Eat plenty of protein to attain strong and healthy nails. Nails are made out of protein, so the first thing you can try is to add more protein to your diet.
Include lean poultry, fish, beef and pork, as well as spinach and other vegetables that contain protein in your diet.

Different types of manicures 
l French manicure
The ever-classic French manicure is guaranteed to give you the clean, gorgeous look you desire. For this style, a clear, pale pink, or beige polish is applied over the entire nail, with white polish along the tip.

l Gel manicure
If you want a long-lasting manicure without the commitment (or potential damage) of acrylic nails, a gel manicure is a great option. All the steps of a basic manicure are taken, except a special polish that requires curing under a UV light which is also applied.

l Shellac manicure
Another popular type of manicure is shellac. Your natural nails are cleaned, filed, and shaped at the salon. Then, a special base coat is applied, followed by two coats of shellac nail polish, and a top coat. In between each step, a dryer is used to cure. Similar to a gel manicure, shellac lasts for about two weeks and is resistant to chipping.

l Airbrushing
Airbrushing is a quick way to apply a design to the nails. The technician may use a stencil or create the style freehand.

Higher education ensured for all OL students
The right to higher education for all students who sit for their G. C. E. (O.

Students have the right to enjoy a 13 year-long school education and a properly educated student population is a necessity for the nation, with a direct approach towards vocational training skills. Thenceforth, they will be confident about their futures, the minister said.

This vocational educational stream is currently in effect at 192 schools countrywide. A sum of Rs. 3.6 billion would be invested for the purpose from this years Budget, Minister Kariyawasam said.

Police require training to tackle cyber crimes
Nearly 73 percent of women in the world had been victims of cyber sex offences, Women In Need (WIN) Batticaloa District Coordinator Sangeetha Dharmaranjan said. She was addressing an awareness programme on cyber crimes for Batticaloa Police under the theme Shatter the Silence and Win Your Life.
The programme was funded by the United Nations Development Project (UNDP) and focused on how certain individuals and websites implement sexual exploitation as a means of extortion.
Dharmaranjan said that even though Women and Children Bureaus exist at all police stations, due to social stigmata and shame, females withhold complaints related to sexual harassment or assault.
The programme also highlighted the need for police personnel to be trained in handling cyber-related offences with the aim of not just controlling, but also preventing future occurrences of such crimes as well.
WIN provides support for women and children who are victims of domestic abuse, focusing on maintenance and protection, but we require assistance to tackle cases where individuals are harassed through the sharing of explicit content on social media. Hence, it is necessary that the police are made aware of the severity of such crimes and are also provided with the proper training in order to address such issues, Dharmaranjan added.
Batticaloa ASP L. R. Kumarasiri, WIN Legal Advisor Attorney-at-Law K. Thiyagesweran, Trincomalee Police IT Department OIC Chief Inspector S. Weerasinghe, Polonnaruwa Police IT Department OIC Malinda Banda, 14 other OICs from around the country and 22 Batticaloa Crime Branch officers participated.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History :
#43 Xavi Hernandez
Six-three minutes on the clock. Spain are taking on Portugal in the round of 16 in the FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The game is deadlocked at 0-0. Portugal have managed to strangle the creative engine in the Barcelona midfield. Spain, it seemed, were running out of ideas. And then it happened.
The Catalan picks the ball up in the middle of the park, strides forward with it before laying it off to Alonso and making a dash for the penalty box. Alonso finds Iniesta who combines beautifully with Fabregas to get the ball back before flicking it to Xavi who had neither the time or space to do anything with it. Or so the world assumed. Wrongly.
Without giving it a second thought the Spaniard laid the ball off to David Villa with the most elegant and nonchalant back-heel. Villas first attempt was blocked by the keeper but the former Barcelona man put the ball away at the second time of asking. And that is all she wrote. A moment of brilliance to decide the tie and keep Spain on course to win their first ever World Cup.
Xavi was at it again in the semi-final against the Germans. Another tactical encounter resulted in the game being goalless till the 72nd minute when Spain won a corner. Xavi spotted Puyol and crossed the ball with a perfect looping trajectory directed at the penalty spot. The ball seemed to be heading to Pique who had leapt into the air to head it home. Full time: German 0-1 Spain.
Puyol had scored the all-important goal, thanks to a Xavi assist, that took them to Spains first-ever World Cup final. Spain eventually went on to win their first World Cup. He provided the most number of accurate passes, 599 with a passing success rate of 91%, and he crossed the ball inside the 18-yard box more than any other player performing in the tournament.
In the final he made 57 accurate forward half passes. Xavi also covered a lot of distance on the pitch  80.20 kilometres throughout the competitions, which average at approximately 11.5 kilometres per game. In the final, he covered a distance of almost 15 kilometres.
Xavis vision, pinpoint accurate passing and world-class ball control allowed him to dictate the flow of play while rarely relinquishing possession, most notably displayed during Spains 2010 World Cup victory where he had a 91% passing success rate for the tournament. His ability to control some matches has earned him the sobriquet, The Puppet Master.
Arguably the best aspect of Xavi is that there is a lot more to the man than what meets the eye. He may well be the most important Spanish player of all time, the man who helped change their history. In the words of Porto coach Julen Lopetegui, who ran Spains under-19s and under-21s along what could be called Xavian lines, he changed football. According to Lopetegui: Xavi helped us build, or see, a new player profile that ended up running through all levels of the national team. He killed off the myth of physicality above all else.
There are lots of players who win things, but few who lay down concepts, ideas, who change the way we think  and Xavi did that.
We concur and thats the reason why Xavi is one of our 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk

Aishwarya's butterfly dress took 3,000 hours to make!
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has returned to slay on the Cannes red carpet. After transforming into a real-life Cinderella at last years festival, the Bollywood superstar reprised her stellar black tie wardrobe with another couture gown by designer Michael Cinco.
The gown was created to reflect the impalpable dream of a butterfly metamorphosis, Cinco tells Bazaar.com of the exquisite creation.
The Dubai-based designer did not skimp on the details for this dress: its completely covered in Swarovski crystals and French palettes; it consists of ultra-violet, midnight blue, and red thread works; and it boasts a 20-foot train that mimics a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis. Plus, its body-hugging silhouette and sweetheart neckline compliment Bachchans figure perfectly.
The elaborate number took 3,000 hours to make, Cinco reveals. (That converts to 125 days if the dress-makers worked non-stop.)
Cinco initially created the crystal-covered gown for a Swarovski exhibition, but the actress helped make the look her own. We worked closely with Aishwarya and her team in creating the perfect fit and making minor alterations to best suit her, the designer adds. This is Rai Bachchans second year in a row wearing a Cinco original. She made just as stunning of an entrance last summer a frosty blue ball gown by the designer. The Disney princess comparisons were inevitable.
After teaming up two years in a row for the international red carpet event, Raich Bachchan and Cinco prove to be a designer-and-muse power duo. Aishwaryas style is truly empowering, he gushes. She uses fashion to instill confidence and reflect a sense of empowerment that is not only beautiful, but also very inspiring. Her timeless style radiates such an allure, as shes so well versed in her every curve, knowing exactly how to dress to accentuate her defining assets.
We cant wait to see what look the pair debuts on next. Harper Bazaar

He said the Agrarian Services Department expects to renovate around 1,500 reservoirs within this year at a cost of Rs. 1,000 million.
The Minister has also instructed the Agrarian Services Department authorities to purchase 10 Water-born Debris Collectors - Aquatic Weed Harvesters to remove invasive aquatic plants such as Salvinia, Water Hyacinth and Water Lettuce in the reservoirs.

All down to fitness and patience...the hottest league season by far
In all things rugby.... considerations and focus shift to survival and fitness in the Singer league.
There has been hardly any love lost between the major contenders.
Royal have weathered it all with customary patience and solid performance from the start...most pleasingly, its the manner in which they handle and absorb pressure that sets them apart.
What a grand treat for all rugby hearts both at home and across both hemispheres.
Sri Lankan islanders by nature, are colourful souls ...and serious about their cricket, rugby, and all things F&B.
So naturally, whatever part of globe, match schedules are precious occasions for sharing.
Take the schools tournament so far ...the burners ...who will challenge Royal..
Will Peters have the firepower, and match the inform boiler house 8.. Can Josephs turn this league on its head ...especially if Patana and their green machine, pressure keg Royal into mistakes Then somehow craft a big W, when they meet
What a mind boggling finish that would be in sunny Sri.....certainly a day like no other.
Peters are recovering from the long trip to that Lions den last week...and grateful for the 28 hard points that Trinity just failed to better.
If Martis was happy with that performance, is a matter for closer and more specific scrutiny by all the experts ...self appointed or not
The script for Royal v Peters is a real cracker and not for anyone with a weak constitution or lack of patience.
Both coaches know each other max....so for Lewke to outwit or outsmart Martis will take some doing.
But that is only one humble thought ....despite the pundits and rugby intellectuals striding our turf.
A thought that might well change the course and strategy of the 70mins in the middle.
To consider the possibilities of Josephs and Peters is harsh on what might be expectations...as anything is possible and no fixed assurances written in stone.
Lets bite our lips and simply...look forward to the matches.
The results certainly matter.and are huge impediments in the players mind ...affecting his thinking and sense of being.
Players need max protection from game stress, and should as part of team wellness, be shielded from the .... must win ambassadors who do more damage than good.
Sensible to prep players how to tune out, be calm and step up at the right moment, both mentally and physically.
The bodyclock theory in terms of getting ready for the match ....is an absolute.
Do the normal things, the simple daily routine that one follows...food time and habits must not change.....if you tolerate that change...you are inviting stress and more.
This little change starts adding up during your day...and will out during warm up or worse ....during game time.
Fundamentals must be jealously guarded and policed as part of team planning.
Club and international 7s emerge from their specified slumber...with the clubs lining up the best available in June...and subsequently selection options for the national squad.
Plenty in that 7s basket...with club, Mercantile, international locally...then regional with the Asian series and this year the Asian Games for a true test of skills and quality.
Our islanders will need maximum strength, fitness, skills, courage, mindset for pain and hearts that crave the impossible...
Players are expected to think and behave like true warriors...as 7s is the hardest game in the known world.
For those who have played the almighty 15mins in the middle, will understand the pressure to finish and how lung busting to cover tackle 35m across the park, pick up loose ball in your own 22m...then motor up 80m to corner flag the winning try with a minute left to play!
I can taste the endorphin adrenaline as I remember with mixed emotions...and more the heart pounding a perfect reminder.
The minds eye ...exhilarating and intimidated, all in the same breath.
What a fabulous feeling indeed.
Lets wish the selectors and their deliberations, much success.
Then hope the players like Danushka Ranjan, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Williwera, Jason D, Ritchie Dharmap, Muthuthanthri, and some inspiration impact forwards to step up this international spell till November.
Blessings for good rehabilitation and stronger minds.
May the Sri islanders force be with them Bula bula Sri api!

Battling drug trafficking: Sri Lanka punching above its weight - Minister
Project Implementation, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said, Sri Lanka had been punching above its weight, when it comes to battling drug trafficking.
The Minister made this remark while addressing a session of the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC) in Vienna on May 15. During his speech, the Minister outlined the progress achieved by the Sri Lankan Police, especially the Police Narcotic Bureau, when combating drugs and drug trafficking.
The Police Narcotics Bureau with the support of Sri Lanka Customs seized over 1,700 kg of Cocaine in major seizures in 2016 and 2017. This included a seizure of 928 kg of Cocaine from an Indian bound merchant vessel, MV Fabiola when it docked at the Colombo Port on 9 December 2016. This haul is the largest Cocaine seizure recorded in South Asia with an estimated street value of Sri Lankan Rupees 12 billion, around USD 77 million, the Minister said.
He also added that in April 2016, the Police Narcotics Bureau and Sri Lanka Navy in a Joint Maritime Operation seized 101 kg of Heroin on a dhow off the Southern coast of Sri Lanka.
A further 314 kg of Heroin were seized by Drug Law Enforcement Agencies. Cannabis Sativa L, commonly identified as Ganja, is the only illegal drug cultivated in Sri Lanka. In 2017, over 4,987 kg were detected by all Law Enforcement agencies. The prevalence of New Psychoactive Substance (NPS) is causing new challenges to all Drug Law Enforcement Agencies and in 2017, PNB detected a consignment of 542.60 kg of Kart in Sri Lanka which originated from Ethiopia, Ratnayaka added.
These impressive successes by enforcement agencies are just the tip of the iceberg. They have not deterred drug trafficking networks from using the Indian Ocean as a narcotics highway (or as CMF calls it the Smack Track), the Minister said.
It has been observed that Sri Lanka is being targeted by drug traffickers in order to develop onward routes. These would be plentiful because of the voluminous containerized trade with destinations including the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia Pacific and North America.
Commenting on difficulties faced by the Sri Lankan authorities when it comes to battling drugs and drug related crimes, the Minister said, One major challenge is the lack of a legal finish (such as prosecution) for the majority of drug seizures made within international waters in the Indian Ocean region. Some of the possible avenues towards improved outcomes are taking a more robust approach to asserting follow-on jurisdiction over un-flagged vessels; and better utilization of existing obligations, mechanisms and networks in order to achieve improved interdiction rates over flagged vessels.

Montreal-based director Ken Scott revealed that he was mindful of incorporating Indian elements because the opening portions of The Extraordinary Journey... are set in Mumbai.
Knowing Dhanushs exceptional dancing skills, I wanted a great dance number, Scott said during an interaction in the India Pavilion in the ongoing 71st Cannes Film Festival.
Berenice is a good dancer too, but she was initially somewhat nervous because these dance moves involved a different kind of choreography. But it worked out perfectly well. It is a fun number, added the director, who made the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival hit, Starbuck.
Adapted from a bestselling Romain Puertolas novel titled The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir Who Got Trapped in an IKEA Wardrobe, the film will open in France on May 30 before it goes into worldwide distribution. Co-producer Aditi Anand of Little Red Car Films revealed that a July release is being planned for the Dhanush-Berenice Bejo starrer. A Tamil version of the film, keeping Dhanushs fan following in mind, will be released. PTI

Citizens' Mail
Expedite political solution for the North and East people
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has recently said in a public meeting that President Maithripala Sirisena is dedicated for a political solution to the ethnic problem in the country. It is truly a fact because President Sirisena came to power as the president by giving a strong pledge to the people that his Government would precisely find a solution for the North East conflict which plunged the country into destructive war for more than 30 years.
Although the conflict was political, it was ended with a military solution, still depriving the legitimate rights of the minority Tamil people. The Northern and Eastern provinces were liberated from the clutches of terrorism but the problems caused for the conflict was still unresolved.
The people of the Northern and Eastern provinces kept an unsparing belief on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and voted totally for them to form a government of anticipating relief for their sufferings.
Their immediate demands were releasing the lands which are under the possession of the Sri Lanka Army, methodical withdrawal of certain Army camps and finding the whereabouts of the missing persons during the time of the war.
Even in the recent speech of the Opposition Leader R Sampanthan in parliament emphasized the Tamil people do not stand for a division of the country but they claim their legitimate rights to live in peace with other communities. He said in his adjournment debate that the political, social and the cultural rights of the Tamil people must be ensured by the Government. At this pretext we all can presume, the Opposition Leader R Sampanthans assertion was legitimate and what they want their basic rights to be given.
At this amiable scenario it is appropriate for the Government to accelerate the reconciliation process to find a political solution to the existing ethnic conflict rather than dragging on it by blabbering on unimportant matters!

Collective effort needed to develop school cricket - SLSCA Secretary
Ministry of Education, under the direction of Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, has come forward to boost school cricket in a big way with the support of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA).
SLSCA Secretary Dilshan de Silva said the massive two-year development plan should help school cricket to regain its lost prestige. He stressed the need to make a collective effort to develop school cricket and produce quality players to feed the national team in future.
Although we belong to the Ministry of Education, our hearts are with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). Hence, a collective effort is needed to take school cricket to a higher level, he said.
He said the SLSCA and the Ministry of Education has drawn a joint development plan with a year planner. It should not merely be the volume or the quantity of cricket that we play but the quality of cricket that is dished out, he said. The veteran school cricket official said the Ministry of Education has allocated a staggering sum of Rs. 100 million to develop school cricket.
The new development plan would implemented by a special committee headed by Jayantha Seneviratne. The committee includes former national players Muttiah Muralitharan, Roshan Mahanama, Mahela Jayawardene, Sidat Wettimuny and Kumar Sangakkara.
The massive development plan drawn by the expert committee includes uplifting three grounds at Colleges of Education for teachers. We could develop those infrastructure facilities to provide quality grounds. The program would also see the establishment of a high performance training centre and the supply of cricket balls needed for competition, de Silva added.
Over the years, de Silva has been a live-wire behind the SLSCAs efforts to promote school cricket. Having played competitive cricket and also served as a reputed cricket umpire, de Silva doesnt need any introduction.. He has served the SLSCA for the last two decades in different capacities and five years as an official of the umpires body.
Having served as the Secretary of the SLSCA before, de Silva returned to his previous post when he was elected at the recent annual general meeting of the SLSCA.
In fact, he has been an ardent supporter of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest for many years, serving in its selection committee, together with fellow officials of the SLSCA and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires Association.
He paid a special tribute to the Sunday Observer for inspiring schoolboy cricketers for four decades since 1979. This is the first school cricket awards show in Sri Lanka and schoolboy cricketers eagerly look forward to this recognition, he said.
Almost all past winners have done well after their school careers, finding places in the national team. I have been to this event, initially as a player and also as an official of the SLSCA and umpires association, de Silva said.
The presence of de Silva has been a blessing for the SLSCA , sharing his first hand experience as a player as well as an umpire. De Silva, who had served as a junior cricket selector for six years until 2016, is unhappy that the practice of including two SLSCA officials in the junior selection committee has now been abandoned.
He stressed the need to invest on school cricket, if the country is to strengthen its national team.
It is an investment for the future. I am not saying that the SLC is not doing anything. They are making a reasonable effort. But that is not good enough; they could play a greater role in supporting the SLSCA to implement our goals, de Silva added.
Asked whether T20 cricket would kill natural talents of young players at school level, de Silva said such version of cricket too should be there.
We need to find talented players for all three versions of the game. They have different openings. But the SLSCA should limit the period spent on T20 for less than a week and concentrate more on the established game, he said. He disagreed with the general opinion that there is too much of school cricket at present. The SLSCA has reduced the number of Under-19 league tournament matches to 13.
But most schools play five or six additional matches to honour their customary friendly games, said de Silva who had served as the SLSCA Secretary for almost eight years  in 2007/2008 and again from 2012 to 2015.
Although the SLC play major tournament matches in the provinces to promote the game across the country, we still dont have a structure that would offer employment to those cricketers in those provinces itself. They are compelled to come to Colombo to seek employment.
There is a need to have a better program for youngsters once they leave school, especially between the ages of 19 to 24, Dd Silva pointed out.
He said school cricket is not staved of talent although it has failed to produce star players who could step into the national team straightaway after their school careers.
We have not seen the emergence of star players as we had witnessed in the past. But that does not mean we lack talent. All what we need is better commitment from the players, he said.
The SLSCA Secretary said that most present day schoolboy cricketers appear to be selfish and focus on individual glory. We lack team efforts as some play for personal glory and milestones. Such players are unable to remain in the game, he said.
De Silva said natural quick bowlers in school cricket do not get the ideal wickets they need to sharpen their skills.
We see more and more dry wickets with hardly any grass on them. Those wickets are good for spinners. We need quality wickets too, if we are to make the best use of talented pace bowlers in school cricket, de Silva concluded.
Meanwhile, voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest continues under three divisions. Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests could be made through voting coupons which continue to appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.
SLT Mobitel, the national mobile service provider, provides that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest.
Its Chief Executive Officer Nalin Perera , under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel P.G. Kumarasingha, has been a tower of strength behind the successful story of the Mega Show, especially during the past decade.
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires Association under the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), headed by Thilanga Sumathipala.
All arrangements have been finalized to host the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega awards ceremony shortly. This will be the 11th consecutive year that SLT Mobitel will be sponsoring the Mega Show.

Colombo Mayoress to probe  construction of new CMC building
Colombo Mayoress Rosy Senanayake, said yesterday, that she would probe whether corruption had occurred in the construction of a new building at the CMC premises. The report in this connection would be provided to all members in the near future.
Addressing the monthly General Meeting held at Town Hall yesterday, she said that the CMC presently has a meeting hall for a capacity of only 55 members, but that number had risen to 119, together with the overhang sets, following the recent Local Government polls.
Since the new building at the CMC premises is being constructed currently, it is necessary for moving to a new location immediately, due to lack of seating for all members at the existing premises.
Meanwhile JVP member Hemantha Weerakoon had alleged that there was no 25 percent woman representation in the CMC. Mayor Senanayake responding to the allegation, said she would look into the matter and discuss with the Election Commissioner if it was necessary.
Meanwhile, members of the Opposition alleged that Rs.5.7 million had been allocated for the construction of toilets at the Mayors official residence and it was necessary to allocate enough funds to construct and renovate public toilets across the Colombo city.
The Mayor said that sufficient allocations have already been approved to develop the public toilets system in Colombo.

CPC Storage Terminal incurred Rs. 10 mn  loss on day fuel prices increased: Arjuna
Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal (CPST) has lost around Rs. 10 Million the day fuel price was hiked. He further mentioned that they are taking severe action against the wrongdoers after investigations and they are taking steps to claim the lost amount from them. He made this remarks during a programme held at the Gampaha Divisional Secretariat office, yesterday.
The Government decide to increase the prices of fuel on May 10 midnight which was declared in the morning of the same day. In such a situation, the same day orders are cancelling temporarily. However, initial investigations had revealed that 52 fuel bowsers from the Kolonnawa terminal and 22 fuel bowsers from the Muthurajawela terminal had been released following the same day order. By this smuggle, the Kolonnawa terminal had incurred a loss of Rs.6,580,200, while the Muthurajawela terminal had lost Rs.2,468,400.
Investigations disclosed that some regional fuel distribution centers also had released a stock of fuel following the same day orders.
This smuggle had taken place, following the wrong procedure. Some filling stations had received stocks of fuel within the same day, which was not received for weeks. There are customers who have paid for fuel the day before the price hike, but not received the stocks, while the customers who had paid and received stocks within hours. We are processing investigations to identify the offenders. We will hand them over for further investigations to the FCID. This smuggle had been taking place for years.
I will take severe action to stop wrongdoings. Some ministers are also trying to push us up when we are trying to catch thieves, the Minister further added.

## Title: Danger lurks at Alawwa railway crossing

Danger lurks at Alawwa railway crossing
An ambulance blaring its sirens drove towards the Yangalmodara railway crossing in Alawwa, in the North Western Province. The railway gate was already closed as two trains were supposed to pass at that very moment. In the blink of an eye, the ambulance passed through the crossing, from the right side of the road which did not have a gate; the ambulance was closely followed by the trains. It was nothing short of a stunt from a Hollywood movie. It happened on Friday, May 11.
This particular intersection is known to be one of the most unsafe crossings in the country. In 2005, over 40 people were killed when a bus collided with a train. And yet, the railway crossing remains dangerously exposed to accidents.
After the accident in 2005, the former government promised to build an overhead bridge at Yangalmodara to ensure that a similar tragedy would not happen ever again. In 2013, the driver and the conductor of the bus were sentenced to death by the Kurunegala High Court. That was the first time in Sri Lanka that the death sentence was given to a case related to a road traffic incident, as it was considered one of the most tragic motor accidents in the history of the country.
A proposal lost in time
The Daily News learnt that a proposal was indeed made a decade ago to build the bridge, but the initiative was never implemented. It has been 13 years since the accident happened and the officials have turned a deaf ear to the repeated appeals made by the police and divisional secretariat to proceed with the matter.
Former SLFP MP Shantha Bandara, who is on the Kurunegala Development Coordination Committee, confirmed that no money had been passed for the project.
He said that the proposal was presented to the Provincial Road Development Authority (PRDA) after the Yangalmodara accident, but he could not recall when that was.
The former MP noted that it was the responsibility of the PRDA to take initiatives to get it approved.
People have made several appeals to the relevant authorities to take action, but nothing has happened so far, he said.
In the meantime, the director of the North Western Province Road Development Authority P.A.S.M Marasinghe confirmed that there was a proposal to build an overhead bridge at Yangalmodara and added that it was still in the design stage.
Marasinghe refused to make any further comment on the project or the proposal.
However, North Western PRDA Design Office Chief Engineer S.L.M.D.D.A. Samaratunga said that even though the proposal was in the pipeline, it was not being considered due to various bottlenecks in the process.
He said that they have not received proper instructions on what was needed to be done with the proposal and added that there were several technical issues involved at the location.
Samaratunga explained that the intersection was a curve and not levelled. Therefore, there were several practical issues in widening the road as well.
All preventive measures have been taken by the police and the Railways to avoid accidents in that intersection, he said.
The officer noted that even he found the intersection to be a risky location and that it needed an overhead bridge to minimise the traffic and hazards that might happen.
Risk continues
Until a tragedy occurred in Yangalmodara, very few thought that this intersection was a dangerous place and that preventive measures needed to be taken. The police and railway authorities have done the best possible with the available resources to minimise the risk through the use of railway gates and speed bumps, but the question remains as to whether these measures make a difference.
The railway crossing guard at Yangalmodara, R.R. Lalith Nandasiri Ratnayake further affirmed that those railway gates and the speed bumps did not stop reckless bus drivers from violating the laws, and the crossing continued to pose a risk to the lives of more than 60 passengers (a busload) at a time.
The police recently caught a person who was trying to go over the gap in the middle.
The probability of accidents taking place here is very high, he said.
Accidents galore
Every week, at least two cases are reported of vehicles driving through closed railway gates and breaking them, said Alawwa Police OIC Tudor Abeywickrema.
It mainly happens during the night.
The drivers usually drive the bus on the other side (from the right) and try to overtake other buses. There is always competition on this road, he said.
According to Abeywickrema, the Yangalmodara intersection was very special to bus drivers as it was the midpoint between the Alawwa main bus halt and the Polgahawela main bus halt.
They pick people from the Alawwa bus halt and try their best to reach the Polgahawela bus halt before the other buses. This is the place where they try to beat the other in the race, risking the lives of people, he said.
He further said that if the police were not present, the drivers would easily take the right side of the road and try to pass through before the other buses.
We take all possible measures to ensure that an accident like the one in 2005 does not happen again, he said.
Railway gates broken
Ratnayake in the meantime explained that every day over 70 trains travel through the Yangalmodara intersection.
Even though the railway gates are closed, we still have bus drivers who try to overtake the other buses and rush through the railway tracks, which is so stupid. The train will not stop for anything, he said.
He noted that bus drivers breaking railway gates had become commonplace now.
If they break the railway gates, they will have to pay Rs. 25,000 as a penalty. We cant identify who did it and the drivers easily get off the hook and they know very well how to do it, he said.
It has been 13 years since the accident happened. Yet, the risk remains the same, despite some measures taken by the police and the Railways department.
Appeals for an overhead bridge
According to former MP Bandara and Alawwa Divisional Secretary Susantha Jayathilake, several appeals have been made over the years to build the overhead bridge to avoid any casualties happening in the future.
According to Jayathilake, even though preventive measures have been taken, that was not enough to minimise the danger. He insisted that a permanent solution was needed.
Jayathilake further said buses going to Trincomalee and Jaffna also took this route and therefore now it was not just about precautions, but also that the probability of an accident taking place was increasing.
They are long-distance buses and everyone is aware of their reckless driving even though nobody has taken any initiative to control them, he said.
Traffic congestion
The headquarters of the Mahamevnawa Buddhist Monastery is located in Polgahawela, 4 km from Yangalmdora and OIC Abeywickrema said the traffic on the intersection was uncontrollable during Poya days as people from all over the country visited the monastery.
The road will be blocked and there are no alternative roads to take on this route. All vehicles going to Jaffna, Trincomalee and Anuradhapura also take the same route. I have to deploy more than eight police officers during those days, he said.
Thus, he emphasised that an overhead bridge was vital at this juncture.
The Maha Oya runs from there and 100 metres before the intersection there is another unsafe curve on the same road. I think the overhead bridge should start from there. The wall needs to be built there for the time being, and the rest can be included in the bigger construction proposal. We have kept barrels to alert the drivers, he said.
OIC Abeywickrema said that his serious concern was the prevailing danger at Yangalmodara and questioned the reasons for authorities to take such a long period to bring a permanent solution to the issue.
He added that over 200 lorries and 600 buses take that route every day.
It is the efforts taken by the Railways and police that have prevented accidents from happening in that place, he said.
According to the police, it is the small measures taken by them and the Railways department that has prevented accidents at Yangalmodara and they sought the support of the relevant authorities to find a permanent solution.
One overhead bridge here can save thousands of lives every day. But 13 years since the proposal, neither a bridge nor the proposal has materialised.
[2005 tragedy could happen again ]This particular intersection is known to be one of the most unsafe crossings in the country. In 2005, over 40 people were killed when a bus collided with a train. And yet, the railway crossing remains dangerously exposed to accidents.

Foreign reserves to soar to US$ 11 bn
The Central Bank said it has taken measures to contain the depreciation of the Rupee.
The underlying fundamentals do not warrant the current pressure on the Sri Lanka rupee. Gross external reserves are presently at a healthy USD 9.1 bn, while the real effective exchange rate indices indicate that the currency is competitive, the Central Bank said yesterday.
The pressure on the currency is, therefore, unwarranted.
The USD 250 mn as the next tranche of the IMF EFF in early June; the USD 585 mn as the final payment on the long lease of the Hambantota Port during the second week of June 2018; and the USD 1 bn as the proceeds of a syndicated term loan due in mid-June 2018 are expected to boost the current robust level of reserves in the coming weeks.
Gross external reserves are, therefore, expected to amount to a record close to US$ 11 bn by mid-June 2018.
While being committed to flexible exchange rate management, the CBSL has the option of using a part of its unprecedentedly large external reserves to trigger a material appreciation of the rupee to prevent unwarranted depreciation of the currency, particularly as it is not justified by the underlying fundamentals, the CBSL said in a press release.

Harvard economist: GMOA strike misses the point

A senior government advisor said the state doctors strike opposing Sri Lankas free trade agreement with Singapore was misguided.
I think theyre just plain wrong about the economics, said Professor Ricardo Hausmann at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo on Wednesday.
Hausmann is the director for the Centre for International Development at Harvard University and an advisor to the Sri Lanka Board of Investment.
The Government Medical Officers' Association launched an island-wide token strike Thursday morning. They argued that the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA would allow foreign medical professionals to take Sri Lankan jobs.
But the people who should be making that argument are the doctors in Singapore, said Hausmann.
Because if the doctors in Sri Lanka are good, and theyre cheaper than the ones in Singapore, and you allow trade in these services, well, medical tourism is going to come this way, not the other way, he said.
In his opinion, the FTA would be a huge expansion in the demand for their services, he said.

The launch of the HNB Business Card stands as another important advancement in our vision to catalyse Sri Lankas entrepreneurial spirit by streamlining and digitizing cash management. By switching over from a manual system to a single digital platform for all transactions, we hope to provide our entrepreneurial customers with complete accountability for all payments, said HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles.

Financial empowerment of businesses is critical to driving economic activity and sustained growth. Hence, we are delighted to partner with HNB on the launch of the Mastercard HNB Business Card. We look forward to seeing businesses across Sri Lanka avail the convenience, security and transparency offered by such digital payments solutions and transform the way they do business, said R. B. Santosh Kumar, Country Manager  Sri Lanka and Maldives, Mastercard.
Enabling speed through convenience is at the core of HNBs strategy. In essence, we have sought to completely automate petty cash payments so that anything from a fuel payment, to expenses incurred by key personnel when travelling overseas to drum up business, can be handled with ease using the Business Card  HNB Deputy General Manager  SME & Mid-market, Jude Fernando explained.
The introduction of HNBs Business Card follows the recent launch of a special new SME Export Credit facility developed in collaboration with the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka (EDB)  the first of its kind in Sri Lanka.
The special facility aims to on-board new-to-bank export clients for pre and post shipment financing with limited tangible security, with special emphasis on tea, rubber, spices, cinnamon, coconut, textiles and garments, fisheries and related industries and is already fostering unprecedented new opportunities for export-oriented growth in the SME sector.

## Title: Improving public transport
## Supertitle:

Improving public transport
A rise in transport costs was inevitable in the aftermath of the recent fuel price hike. Diesel, which is used for both goods and passenger transport vehicles, went up by Rs. 14 per litre. Given this increase, the public braced for a fare hike, which usually happens around June every year anyway.
The private bus owners have demanded a 10 percent fare hike, but the Government has agreed to a 6.56 percent rise. The Government has to balance the interests of both bus operators and the commuters, who are already burdened by other factors at play in the overall cost of living scenario. This has led to an impasse with bus operators threatening to strike if the 10 percent fare hike is not granted.
As the private bus operators say, the fare hike is not the only factor that should be considered here. The costs of spare parts, tyres, lubricants, servicing etc. have to be considered too. But to give credit where it is due, this Government has granted many concessions and incentives for the private bus industry and the proposed fare hike has taken this into consideration. A nearly 7 percent fare hike is a reasonable compromise that will help bus owners to cover their added expenses without burdening the commuters too much.
The private bus owners act as if they provide a perfect service to the public, but they do not. The most horrendous shortcoming is the appalling lack of discipline among private bus crew. A large number of fatal accidents are caused by private buses driven recklessly by poorly trained drivers. They race each other to collect more passengers, while flouting all road rules. From running red lights to dangerous overtaking, they perform breakneck maneovoures that sometimes defy logic and even physics. And most, if not all, private bus crews are downright discourteous to passengers, treating them as mere 10 Rupee pieces (Dahaye Keli) and pushing and shoving them from one end to the other in the bus. They also issue tickets very rarely (despite a law making it compulsory) and conveniently forget to give the balance on most occasions. The music played on board is frankly, atrocious and deafening. They literally make hay while the sun shines and disappear by around 7 p.m., from most routes, leaving commuters stranded. It is the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses that come to the rescue of these passengers.
Indeed, it is by strengthening the SLTB that the authorities can challenge the private bus industry. Right now, the odds are heavily stacked against the SLTB because there are around 15,000 private buses against the SLTBs 6,000 odd fleet. But there is a large number of buses at SLTB depots islandwide which have been grounded due to the lack of minor spare parts. If this problem can be attended to, at least another 2,000 SLTB buses can be re-deployed on routes islandwide. The Government should import more buses for the SLTB, including super luxury A/C buses and low floor city buses.
In fact, the Government has announced plans to initially purchase and import around 50 such buses that will operate on electivity for urban usage. This is a commendable move as many city commuters now avoid the overcrowded private buses if they can. If the SLTB can offer a cleaner, more comfortable and less crowded bus service, then many more commuters will climb on board. As an added bonus, some of them may opt to leave their cars at home and ride the bus. This will help save fuel and also reduce air pollution in the long run. To make the bus ride even more attractive, the Government should introduce the proposed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system without delay.
The Government must also encourage private bus owners to import electric buses, which are now manufactured widely, by granting duty and tax concessions. Many cities around the world already have electric buses doing regular runs- the best example is Chinas Shenzhen, with 16,000 electric buses. Dramatic declines in battery costs and improvements in performance, including expanded driving range, have made electric buses a viable alternative to diesel-powered and other fossil fuel buses.
The savings are huge - The Chicago Transit Authority recently estimated that each electric transit bus in its fleet saves the city US$ 25,000 (Approx. Rs. 4 million) in fuel costs every year. Electric buses still command a premium, but this will decrease over the next 2-3 years. Many cities already have huge solar powered facilities for charging the buses, which makes them completely self-sufficient.
Going forward, the goods transport industry too must be encouraged to embrace electric trucks which can already cover more than 100 Km on a single charge. These are already available or will soon be available from manufacturers such as Volvo, Tesla, Fuso, Mack, Dongfeng, Arrival and Peterbilt. They have much the same advantages outlined above. Since electric trucks are virtually silent, they will not bother people even if used for night-time operations. The public and goods transport landscape is changing in line with modern trends and challenges and we should adapt soon.

Ministry to curtail unwarranted coconut tree-felling:
Individuals to require special permit from CDB
In a move to curtail the unnecessary felling of coconut trees in both the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province (NWP), the Plantation Industries Ministry had made arrangements to introduce a new procedure in which anyone wishing to cut down coconut trees would be required to acquire a special permit from the Coconut Development Board (CDB).
A Cabinet paper for the purpose would be forwarded soon and the measures would be legalised thereafter.
At present, permits have to be taken in order to cut down jak trees, from divisional secretaries countrywide. Likewise, those who wish to fell coconut trees too, have to obtain permits from the Coconut Development Board henceforth, Kurunegala Senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake told the Daily News yesterday in Kurunegala.
Private real estate companies fell coconut trees on a large scale these days in both the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts as they sell coconut lands through fragmentation and hence, this decision to issue permits to cut down coconut trees by the government, was taken to discourage such acts, he added.
Jayathilaka further said that such irresponsible felling of coconut trees had resulted in a 25-percent decline in the NWPs coconut harvests during the past five years.

In a land like no other
When I joined the Police as a Probational ASP in 1958, Brigadier Anton Mutucumaru, the Commander of the Ceylon Army who was on the Interview Board chaired by the then SD and EA Gunasena de Soyza did not have a Chief of Staff under him. As far as I am aware, this exalted position in the Army came into existence with the phenomenal growth of the Army when the war against LTTE terrorism escalated.
The loud sounding term, Chief of Staff was unheard of in the Public Service. It does not appear in the Constitution, the Establishments Code, Administrative Regulations or the Financial Regulations. When I joined the Public Service the Prime Minister was S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. When I finally severed connections with the State on retirement from the post of Director Operations and Deputy Chairman of ANCL in 1994 I had been closely associated with Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Dudley Senanayake, J.R. Jayewardena and Ranasinghe Premadasa. All these greats had honourable and efficient Secretaries. Bradman Weerakoon, M.D.D. Pieris and K.H.J. Wijedasa in particular were great Presidential Secretaries.
Public service
The office of Secretary to the President is a powerful and coveted constitutional office. The sanctity and honour of this office is such that like the President, the Secretary to the President can do no wrong.
Whoever created the superman of a Chief of Staff with the freedom and ability to turn sugar into gold has not only caused untold embarrassment to the Presidential Secretariat, but plunged the one time highly acclaimed Public Service to abysmal disrepute. The honour of Sri Lanka has been shattered.
The head of the Timber Corporation one time Secretary of the Land Ministry, who was also involved in the scandal, once arrested and remanded, was rightly suspended. The President had no alternative. An inevitable damage control move. However, Lo and Behold, before the dust could settle the office of the President rushes to make a replacement with apparently a crony leading to a public outcry. It is not understandable why a man with an adverse police record was selected with lightning speed. Scandal upon scandal!
While two Super Public Servants were receiving top media attention albeit for the wrong reasons protests, demonstrations, strikes have been keeping the nation entertained, irritated and sometimes bewildered.
Fasts unto death appear to have faded into oblivion. However if only Wimal W. who has not been in the limelight for sometime, can with his parliamentary friends ceremoniously with all the brouhaha he is capable of embark on a fast unto death, even surreptitiously eating biscuits and chocolates and sipping Coca Cola to achieve their stated objective of death, the nation will breathe a sigh of relief. Even the ranks of Tuscany will not forbear to cheer!
Protests, demonstrations and strikes continue resulting primarily in traffic jams and the police providing high pressure shower baths to students both lay and robed. The only trade union whose members make more money engaging in private practice whilst resorting to strike action caring two hoots for indigent, suffering patients in government hospitals, the GMOA now wants a role in the formulation of the governments economic and trade policies! May be worthwhile listening to them. After all doctors know best how to make money even in the most ruthless manner. And these are men and women who have received their medical education at the taxpayers expense. On the plus side, toddy tappers and conservancy workers do not strike keeping the alcohol industry alive and the garbage moving!
Unemployed graduates
Unique to Sri Lanka is the demand for jobs by graduates after free school and university education. Vociferously demanding jobs in the state are even degree holders in dancing, singing, drumming etc. What bewilders me is that at the forefront of the agitational movement for jobs for unemployed graduates is a man in yellow robes who claims to be a Buddhist monk!
The redeeming factor is that an Elections Commission is in place and elections of some sort, even delayed are held. But as Dr. Uswatta Aratchi has succinctly put it, with most of our leaders having rotting skeletons in their cupboards, This is a Dharmadvipa, the land of crime without punishment (The Sunday Island of 13/5). Even with elections what prospects hold for the paradise isle The people are compelled to vote for imbeciles nominated by party leaders who are only concerned about themselves and not one bit about the country.
The Democracy that this country enjoyed for eight decades with men of substance at the top has got eroded to a dangerous level. Corrupt politicians bent on building political dynasties for themselves have hijacked and emasculated the countrys democracy.
The patience of the people is running out. Like the stars of the universe joining up to form constellations protests that we see today at the drop of a hat can develop into uprisings, insurrections, rebellious and revolution. My advice to our parliamentarians is, read the histories of revolutions that changed the destinies of nations. Or else a catastrophy may strike us sooner than later.

LG LAUNCHES INNOVATIVE DIGITAL SIGNAGE  TECHNOLOGY AT LG GRAND TECH SEMINAR
For the first time ever in Sri Lanka, LG released the progressive new lineup of digital signage solutions on May 16, 2018.
The launch took place at the LG Grand Tech Seminar, Cinnamon Grand, which saw a gathering of more than 250 invitees from different genres of the local business community including IT, hospitality, retail, transportation, media and more. The event showcased live demos of the several categories of digital signage technology that LG has to offer.
Digital Signage, described as an electronic display platform, has gained major popularity over the past decade due to its ability to build brand awareness, serve as an effective springboard for advertising, and deliver integral information about a companys products and services through high-quality graphics and videos. With their new cutting-edge range, LG will be breathing new life into this advertising medium and bring the future of digital signage to Sri Lanka. The brand aims to revolutionize and enhance how local businesses communicate with their consumer base.
One of the many such solutions demonstrated at the LG Grand Tech Seminar was OLED Displays. Like their namesake OLED TVs, the incredibly lightweight and slim OLED Displays boast features which reproduce pure blacks with no light bleed that provide infinite contrast, and render immensely vivid visuals for more awe-inspiring picture quality.
Clients also have the opportunity to develop a large interactive video wall with LGs 55-inch LED screens. Incorporating a narrow bezel, LED screens enable the overall video wall image to resemble a single complete display that will enthrall consumers. Plus, the solution enhances the relationship between the customer and the business by allowing the customers to directly interact with the video wall. This aspect can be easily customized by clients according to their business needs.
Further, commanding a passing customers attention is the best way to increase the footfall at any store. The LG Ultra Stretch Digital Signage achieves that and does a whole lot more. Producing immersive UHD visuals in a breathtaking 3840 x 600 format, this ultra-wide widescreen signage deeply enriches the consumer in-store experience by offering dynamism in advertising, branding and interactive graphic interfaces.
Another innovative digital signage technology that wowed invitees at the event was the LED Transparent Film. Incorporating LED diodes in a transparent film which can fitted over store front windows, this solution presents a unique approach towards providing businesses a competitive edge by offering eye-catching digital content and information.
Other digital signage solutions under the LGs latest range include the System-on-Chips which can execute several tasks at the same time, guarantee smooth content playback, and produce unique advertisement layouts, while the Touch Screen Displays are equipped with no ghosting technology that host a 10-point multi-touch experience and allow audiences to write, draw and express their ideas in a seamless manner.

LSSP to celebrate Republic Day on May 22
The Republic Day of Sri Lanka will be celebrated by the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) on May 22 at 3.00 pm at N.M.Perera Centre, Borella under the patronage of LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday Prof. Vitharana said that the Leader of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Dinesh Gunawardene and several leftist political parties will attend the meeting. Several other programmes will take place islandwide to mark the day.
Prof.Vitharana said Sri Lanka is heading towards becoming a colony again and Sri Lanka won the real Independence and announced the same to the world as an independent country on May 22, 1972 with the new Constitution introduced to the country by Sri Lanka Freedom party with the support of leftist political parties.
But later, the day was forgotten and even after presenting a cabinet paper as a minister in the previous regime, the day was not celebrated as expected.
The Trincomalee harbour will be used as a US army base and relevant agreements have already been signed. Sri Lankan air force and navy have become parts of the US armed forces by patrolling along the Indian Ocean in behalf of US armed forces, he said.
Even the Survey Department is about to be sold to a foreign company. The government has signed an agreement with the IMF agreeing to conditions and accordingly the Government is pruning social welfare systems established after a struggle by the LSSP. The EPF, ETF, pensions are some of the benefits being curtailed, he added.

Mvenpick  introduces  Ramadan  buffet
Ramadan is the most sacred month of the year in Islamic culture and Muslims observe the month of Ramadan which is also a time for sacrifice, renunciation and spiritual growth. During Ramadan, observant Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset and they break fast with water and dates, followed by prayers and a meal called Ifthar. Not only does a Ramadan buffet give you and your loved ones a chance to spend time together, but it also provides a moment of togetherness that is all too fleeting in this hurried digital age.
Sharing a meal to break fast together, is a beautiful tradition. Combining this time-honoured tradition of Ifthar with the convenience of city living, Mvenpick Hotel Colombo will be introducing an Arabic Ifthar promotion from May 15 June 14 at AYU, the all-day dining restaurant.
The Ifthar buffet will serve both traditional Middle Eastern dishes and international cuisine, together with a sumptuous selection of Arabic dishes including baba ghanoush, Arabic cheeses, breads and other specialities complemented by fresh juices.
Desserts will include a selection of Baklava, Muhallebi, rice kheer and assorted Arabic delights.

Membership of AML/CFT increased
Membership of the National Coordinating Committee Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) had been increased in order to better coordinate mechanisms to combat the above.
Accordingly, Cabinet approval was granted on Tuesday (15) to a proposal made by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, to widen the composition with the inclusion of the Commissioner General of the Department of Inland Revenue, Commissioner General of the Department of Exercise, Director General of the Bribery Commission and representatives of the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs.
In 2006, the Financial Intelligence Unit under the Finance Ministry, introduced the policy on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). It was later established as the national coordinating committee on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT).
Minister Samaraweera had pointed out the need for various government institutions to work together to combat financial crime and thus, the proposal to widen the scope of the committee with the inclusion of the people above was made.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) - the global policy setter on Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMACFT) - has publicly identified Sri Lanka as a country with strategic AMACFT deficiencies, placing Sri Lanka in its Grey list of countries.
An Action Plan for Sri Lanka has been introduced to be implemented within a given time frame to rectify the deficiencies highlighted by FATF.
Further, the European Union in its Parliamentary Sessions in February 2018, had already black-listed Sri Lanka when it comes to money laundering.

Milky breakfast
Serving healthy meals for children, especially picky eaters, is a main concern for parents. Most of the children love milk, so you already have one delicious food on the table.
Creating healthy meals for little ones can be simple and stress-free when you have a plan. Start by incorporating options from a variety of food groups. When planning meals and your childs snacks, focus on offering a variety of fruits and vegetables, adding whole grains, different lean protein choices as well as milk and milk products to deliver vitamins and minerals growing bodies need.
Importance of protein
Protein is an integral part of every nutritious meal, including breakfast. A protein-rich breakfast, including milk, helps to start your childs day right. In fact, studies show eating breakfast helps your child concentrate and focus at school. From muscles to hair, bones to teeth, the body needs protein to be healthy and strong.
Protein impacts many different functions, including: Building lean muscle  Protein supplies your body with the amino acids it needs to build strong muscles. Getting enough protein in your diet, along with exercise, helps build and repair muscle.
Keeping you fuller, longer  Getting enough protein, more than carbohydrates or fats, can help you feel full, and satisfied with your meal which means you may not feel hungry again mid-morning.
Maintaining bone health  Along with key bone-building nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, protein also helps build healthy bones.
Milk is a great protein food for kids
With nine essential nutrients, including protein, in each eight-ounce glass, milk is a delicious, simple and wholesome option. Consuming milk and milk products is especially important during childhood and adolescence, when bone mass is being built.
All dairy milk  whether it is fat free, flavoured or organic milk provides essential nutrients. In addition to naturally occurring, high-quality protein, milk contains other nutrients including B vitamins for energy, vitamin A to help maintain a healthy immune system as well as calcium and vitamin D, both that work in concert for bone health. It is the daily recommendation that toddlers ages 2-3 get two glasses of milk, children age 4-8 get 2.5 cups and 3 cups for adolescents, teens and adults.
So just remember, beginning proper milk drinking habits as a child can have lifelong benefits. Milk in the morning is a healthy habit that helps provide kids with nutrients they need for the day and benefits that extend well beyond the morning.

Model musings

He swam against the tide and had not only survived it but had come out in top form. Treading into an industry which is mainly considered as a female dominant zone 23 year old Isanka Pramuditha Amarasinghe managed to clinch the Face of Asia male award at the Asia Model Festival held in South Korea recently. He competed against around 62 contestants from 24 countries across the world to bag the win.
Put together with the goal of exhibiting Asian models and businesses related to the fashion scene, the Asia Model Festival has been developed as the core icon of Asias culture industry and a global culture platform. The winners of the competition get opportunities to brush up their modeling talents and grow up as globally renowned models.
Pramuditha and a female model named Deshani Liyanaarachchi were selected to take part in the Asia Model Festival from a mini pageant held at the Dutch Hospital in March. The models who competed at the event were trained by Gihan Dasanayaka. Face of Sri Lanka in association with Korea Model Association (KMA) organized the event as a means of promoting cultural relations between Sri Lanka and Korea.
Winning the StylishMarketer Grand Finale 2016
Walking the ramp for the AACS Graduation Fashion Show Gradution Model Show 2016/17
The finale comprised of three rounds: the traditional costume, face of Asia introduction and evening wear. We had a dancing competition in one of the earlier rounds and another mini pageant which selected the most photogenic contestant. There were 20 sponsor awards and I got the Panasonic Korea award and Lui and Lei best photo award, he said.
He notes that the whole competition which ran from April 25 to May 6 was no walk in the park.
Everyone was striving to present the best versions of themselves. Deciding on how to outshine them was a challenge. I believe that my appearance and catwalk was the key to success, Pramuditha opined.
Apart from bagging the title of Face of Asia male model, winning the Lui and Lei best photo award at the event has been the most memorable moment at the competition for Pramuditha mainly because it was the first mini pageant which kicked off the competition.
That was held on the first day. We also had commercial shootings and photo shoots from various sponsors. They were all renowned international companies. We were given the opportunity to be the face of their products. How to pose with various types of products and how to present oneself in the best manner for commercials were some of the new things I learnt at the event, he recalled.
He says that the Korean, Indian, and Chinese models were the toughest to beat as they not only possessed good looks but also had oodles of talent.
Pramudithas personal style is simple but elegant. He says that eveningwear suits him best because of his height and body shape. He has played cricket during his school days and has obtained colours for rugby at Kelaniya University.
At the ChokolaatePonds MDFD 2017
Pramuditha is an old boy of Sri Jayawardanapura Maha Vidyalaya and Isipathana College, Colombo. His father, Prasad Amarasinghe, is employed as a security officer at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo. His mother, Priyanthi Amarasinghe, is a housewife. He has one brother, Sasanka Dulanjana, who is an undergraduate at Sri Jayewardenepura University. Pramuditha is currently in the final year at Kelaniya University.
I started my modeling career once I turned 21. That was in 2016. I took part in the inter university modeling competition called Stylish Marketer which is conducted by the future marketers association of Kelaniya University and won first place. Brian Kerkoven choreographed the event and he trained me, Pramuditha explained on how he got into the runway.
Pramuditha opines that height really matters for a male model. He is 6 feet 3.2 inches.
That is one of the biggest advantages I possess and that got me the break I needed to get into modeling. My height and looks come from my genes. My parents have also been very supportive of me ever since I chose this path. My brother too has been my pillar of strength, he said.
Winning the Hiru Avurudu Kumara 2017 title
Unlike in the past years the industry has opened up more for male models to make their way to the ramp and photo shoots. Sri Lanka too has seen more male fashion enthusiasts making it to the limelight.
It is true that there are many more opportunities for male models in various sectors now. However female models are still more in demand than males. I believe that holding male beauty pageants and male modeling competitions will change this aspect in the future, he mused.
His advice to budding young models is to identify their strengths and weaknesses and work towards reducing their minus points.
Concentrate on whatever you take up and give it your best shot, he said.
With the Face Of Asia male award
Winning the Face of Asia male award and the Stylish Marketer title are not the only feathers on Pramudithas cap. He was the Hiru TV Aurudu Kumara in a competition organized by Hiru TV last year.
Winning the Face of Asia male award is the biggest achievement in Pramudithas life.
I feel so motivated by the feedback. I want to continue in the field as a professional model after my studies and get another international prize for Sri Lanka. My sights are set on winning the Mr World title in 2020. So fingers crossed! he added with a smiled.

Pelwatte Dairy strengthens operations with new management appointments
Sri Lankas 100% local dairy manufacturer Pelwatte Dairy Industries Limited (PDIL) recently further strengthened its operations with the appointment of a new Managing Director and Operations Director at its state-of-the-art Buttala manufacturing plant.
Akmal Wickramanayake was appointed as Managing Director of Pelwatte Dairy Industries in early 2017, taking over management responsibilities of the company that was founded by his father Ariyaseela Wickramanayake Under his guidance, Pelwatte Diary has undergone corporate restructuring to better streamline operations and reposition the brand in a highly competitive market.
We compete in a highly volatile market and it has always been my fathers vision to make Sri Lanka self-sufficient in milk. As an organization we strongly believe that this is an achievable dream and we constantly strive to better the lives of dairy farmers and their families, while also supplying a 100% Sri Lankan product to consumers, Akmal Wickramanayake said.
Together with several other senior management appointees, PDIL is also putting much emphasis on expanding its procurement network in order to control supply and acquire raw milk for the increased production capacity.
Particular attention during this expansion has been on dairy development of the dairy farming community in an effort to improve the quality of the milk supply in Sri Lanka.
To this end, PDIL through their own Animal Feed Production Mills, produce their own cattle feed which along with high nutrition grass grown on PDILs own extensive grasslands, have positively impacted milk yields in the last year.
Furthermore, the farm has been directed to be used as a dairy farming centre, where PDIL staff teach and train dairy farmers development concepts such as the latest methods and best practices of cattle husbandry, how to improve cattle nutrition to grow milk yield and quality, how to carry out barn maintenance and various other concepts.

Pope sells his Lamborghini
VATICAN CITY: A Lamborghini supercar owned by Pope Francis has been sold for nearly four times its original asking price. The 198 mph two-seater Hurrican, which would typically be worth around 155,000, was donated to the Pope in November last year.
But with a speed limit of just 9 mph in the Vatican City there would be little use for the Pope to have such a powerful supercar. So he decided to sell it and donated the proceeds to charitable causes  but only after he signed and blessed the bonnet.
The car was entered into RM Sothebys Monte Carlo sale over the weekend, where it ended-up selling for an eye-watering 615,000.
The Iraqi city of Nineveh, which was besieged by ISIS, will get 430,000 from the sale, with the remaining 185,000 split equally among three other charities.
RM Sothebys described the Lamborghini as being in as-new condition having remained in static storage since it was built late last year. The car is finished in Bianco Monocerus white paint with contrasting gold Giallo Tiberino stripes in homage to the colours of the flag of the Vatican City.
It has been fitted with 20-inch alloy wheels and has leather seats and features as 5.2-litre V10 engine which generates a staggering 570 bhp. This gives the Italian supercar a 0-62 mph time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 198mph. Augustin Sabati-Garat, auction manager, RM Sothebys Europe, said: We are honoured to have hosted such a hotly contested bidding war for this unique Lamborghini Huracan.
We give thanks to His Holiness Pope Francis for donating the sale fee to charity, and for Automobili Lamborghini for gifting the car, as we are pleased to have played a part in sourcing money for good causes.
The fact that this car sold for nearly three times worth its estimate, and much higher than the models standard retail price, is telling of how much interest it attracted.

Porterfield confident of  Irelands place at Test table

DUBLIN, Wednesday: Ireland captain William Porterfield was in no doubt his side deserved their elevation to Test cricket after a thrilling debut ended in a five-wicket loss to Pakistan.
Hopes of a miracle at Malahide weren't just the stuff of fantasy when Pakistan, set a modest 160 to win on Tuesday's final day, collapsed to 14 for three before lunch at the Dublin ground.
Imam-ul-Haq (74 not out) and Babar Azam (59) then combined to dash dreams that Ireland, the 11th nation to play men's Test cricket, would record a remarkable win. But it was a testament to Ireland's skill and resolve that after they had been made to follow-on by visiting captain Sarfraz Ahmed, the game remained in the balance on the final day.
For a while, it seemed Ireland might rewrite the record books on two fronts in becoming only the fourth side to win a Test after following-on and just the second in the 141-year history of the format, following Australia's defeat of England in the inaugural 1877 Test at Melbourne, to win their debut match. That they were in a position to do that owed much to Kevin O'Brien's impressive 118 -- just the fourth instance of a man scoring a century in his country's first Test match -- that was the cornerstone of Ireland's second innings 339.
Ireland made their reputation on the global stage with World Cup wins over Pakistan, England and West Indies, Porterfield was proud of his side's entry into the Test arena.
"The biggest thing was how we fought back in the second innings with the bat -- that showed the character we have," he said.
"It's something that's been talked about during big occasions, World Cups. That's always been known to be there but Test cricket is Test cricket for a reason, it's there in the name, you did get tested and we were after the first innings.
"To get up to close to 350 showed what we've got in the changing room and the passion that we have for playing our cricket."
The crowd briefly included 74-year-old Rolling Stones front man and cricket fan, Mick Jagger, but Porterfield hoped that the next generation of potential Irish cricketers would be more inspired by O'Brien's hundred.
"Hopefully in the next week or two there's going to be hundreds of little kids aspiring to be Kevin O'Brien in backstreet cricket," the Irish captain said.
"This Test match will have gone a long way to providing the next generation of cricketers, I'm sure."
This was O'Brien's first international century since he scored the fastest-ever World Cup hundred, off just 50 balls, in Ireland's stunning win over England at Bangalore seven years ago.
Yet the controversial decision to shrink the 2019 World Cup in England to a 10-team tournament and Ireland's failure to come through an increasingly competitive qualifying tournament where only two spots were available means Porterfield's men will be on the outside looking in next year.
"We wouldn't have got to where we were if we didn't get those opportunities to put down a marker on the world stage," Porterfield insisted.
"That gives you an opportunity to create enough noise. To miss out by it just being a 10-team World Cup is bitterly disappointing.
"We wouldn't have had the opportunity to play a Test match today, I don't think if we hadn't been playing the last 10, 12 years at World Cups." - AFP

Puzzle of the Presidential Hopeful
The declaration by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) May Day rally that he would not retire from politics in 2020 has ignited discussion in political circles about prospective presidential candidates for the election which is due that year.
Previously, the President had pledged that he would not run again for President. He did so while campaigning for the Presidency, shortly after taking his oath of office, when he visited the Dalada Maligawa a few days later and several months later at the funeral of Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera.
Since then, until his May Day announcement, President Sirisena had been maintaining a studious silence on the issue. That is despite some stalwarts of the SLFP publicly proclaiming that he would be his partys presidential candidate at the next presidential election.
To be fair, even on May Day President Sirisena did not announce he would be running for President again. He merely said that he would not be retiring from politics. However, being the incumbent President, it is difficult to imagine any other role for him- because a Mahinda Rajapaksa style foray into Parliament as a backbench MP would not serve any purpose for President Sirisena.
Presidential election in 2020
In this developing scenario, one issue seems clear: There will be a presidential election in 2020. This is despite a pledge by President Sirisena- and indeed by those who campaigned for a government of National Unity- that the Executive presidential system of government as it exists now would be abolished.
That appears to be a remote possibility now. In the aftermath of the motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, sixteen SLFP parliamentarians crossed over from the government and sat on the opposition benches. While they state that they remain loyal to the President, it is an open secret that most of them are marking time before switching allegiance to Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In effect this means that the government has now lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament which it enjoyed previously. Even if the SLFP MPs remaining loyal to the President, the entire United National Party (UNP), the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) put their numbers together, it would still not be possible to muster the 150 MPs required for a two-thirds majority.
Therefore, although the JVP does have a proposal before Parliament to abolish the Executive Presidency, its chances of success are virtually non-existent and at this juncture both the mainstream SLFP and the UNP have lost its appetite to launch campaigns to abolish the Presidency.
Hence the discussion about potential presidential candidates. Barring an eleventh-hour rapprochement with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), President Sirisena will certainly be the candidate of the mainstream SLFP.
Given the dismal performance of the mainstream SLFP at the recent local government elections vis--vis the SLPP and the UNP, there are questions about the viability of such a campaign but President Sirisena obviously feels differently.
Local government elections
It is also true that presidential elections and local government elections are different elections altogether. In a presidential election, there is a significant component of the personality factor and President Sirisena has the benefit of being the incumbent in office.
The SLPP camp is gearing for the campaign on the assumption that it would be fielding its own candidate. If it had any doubts about that, they disappeared when it won the local government elections with overwhelming majorities in most councils. The question now is who that candidate will be as Mahinda Rajapaksa is barred from running for President again because of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution imposed a two-term limit on individuals.
Previously, it seemed a foregone conclusion that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa will be the SLPP candidate. While nothing has happened to change that perception, there has however been discussion about possible alternatives too with the only certainty being that the candidate would be a Rajapaksa sibling.
Last week, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa delivered the keynote address at a meeting of Viyath Maga, an organisation which describes itself as a network of professionals, academics and entrepreneurs to effectively influence the moral and material development of Sri Lanka- and left no doubt whatsoever that he was projecting himself as a presidential candidate.
As a candidate, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has his pros and cons. As the Defence Secretary who spearheaded the war against terrorism, he will command good support in the South of the country but by the same token he is unlikely to attract many votes in the North and East- and, apart from Mahinda Rajapaksas post-war election victory in 2010, no candidate has won a presidential election without the support of the North and East.
The SLPP also has to make contingency plans as Gotabhaya Rajapaksas name has been mentioned in several ongoing investigations. Should he be formally implicated in any of them, that would jeopardise the SLPPs campaign. Therefore alternative candidates need to be groomed.
The names of Basil Rajapaksa and Chamal Rajapaksa have also been bandied about as potential candidates for the SLPP. While no one doubts Basil Rajapaksas ability as a political tactician, his acumen as a charismatic presidential candidate is yet to be put to the test. Besides, if he were to be the candidate, his opponents are likely to capitalise on the several allegations of corruption against him and turn them into campaign issues.
Corruption allegations
It is in such a context that the name of the eldest of the Rajapaksa siblings, Chamal Rajapaksa has come into the fray. There is an argument within the SLPP that because Chamal Rajapaksa is not tainted with corruption allegations he would be the best option. However, the former Speaker will be 80 years of age in 2020 and whether this, together with his mild-mannered disposition is suited for the rigours of a presidential election campaign is a question that is being asked.
Meanwhile in the UNP too there has been some discussion about the presidential election. The newly appointed General Secretary of the party, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has publicly stated that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the partys presidential candidate. Following this statement, there have been inquiries as to how Kariyawasam could make such a statement when the party has taken no such decision.
Nevertheless, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera also stated publicly that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was the most suited to be the UNP candidate. To date, no one from the UNP has publicly disputed this but given that there is still one and a half years to go before nominations for the election are called, there has been no formal confirmation of the Prime Ministers candidacy as yet.
There is a school of thought that, for the UNP to have any chance of winning the next presidential election, there needs to be a new image and a new approach. There are two ways in which this can be achieved. One is a change of leadership. The other is a radical transformation of the party while retaining the Prime Minister as its leader. The first option is not likely to eventuate. It remains to be seen whether the UNP will pursue the second option. Even if it does, it has very little time to do so.
Slowly but surely, the contours of the next presidential contest are taking shape- and the chances are that for the first time in Sri Lankas presidential election history, it will be a three-way tussle, rather than the traditional two-party contest.

Ray Wilson, member  of Englands 1966  WC winning side, dies
LONDON, Wednesday: Ray Wilson, a member of the England team that beat West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final, has died aged 83, former club Everton announced. An outstanding left-back, Wilson won 63 caps with 1966 a memorable year for him as he won the FA Cup with Everton at Wembley and a few weeks later the World Cup as hosts England beat West Germany 4-2 at the same stadium.
"Everton Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Ray Wilson," read a statement on the club website.
"Unquestionably one of the finest footballers to wear the royal blue jersey, Ray passed away on Tuesday evening, aged 83."
Wilson, married for 61 years to Pat who survives him and father of two boys Russell and Neil, never lost his love for Everton whom he joined in 1964.
"He loved it at Goodison, absolutely loved it," Pat said last year.
"He still does. If they are on television, that is it. He sits there and watches it, transfixed."
Wilson was revered by both Everton and his first club Huddersfield and he was honoured in April this year when their Premier League clash was officially designated Ray Wilson Day.
Wilson played almost 300 matches for Huddersfield having been signed by former Liverpool managerial legend Bill Shankly in 1955. He moved to Merseyside in 1964. Even before he had a trial with the Yorkshire club, Everton had their eyes on him.
"I got a letter from Everton offering me a deal but I felt loyal to Huddersfield," he said years later.
"But I remember looking around Goodison properly for the first time after I had joined and thought to myself, 'My word, what have I been missing out on all these years, I should have been here years ago." -

Reviving hockey in Kandy
Kandy District Hockey Association is all out to bring back hockey to the position it enjoyed at club level previously. Hockey in Kandy dates back to 1907, when the Indian Rajput Regiments occupied the Kandy Military Barracks, currently known as Police Barracks, were wanting to play hockey, almost every evening, and they did so.
During that time St. Anthonys College was housed at the present St. Sylvesters College premises and they used the barracks square for all their sports.
The boys of that era felt drawn to the game themselves; and tried their hand at knocking the ball about with a borrowed stick or two. The fearless youngsters found some places vacant whenever the military men did not turn up. At that time, there was no clubs or tournaments, the Indians who were on military duty played hockey by themselves. After their departure there was no hockey.
Then in the mid 1930s P.T. Rajan who was a school teacher, with the backing of another two teachers V.D. Paul Raj, J.O Mendis and Municipal Charity Commissioner at one time re-started the game of hockey.
It was mainly due to P.T. Rajans keenness that hockey in Kandy prospered in the schools and clubs.
The teams during that period were St. Anthonys College under the name of Hotspurs, Trinity College under the name of Rabits, Kingswood College, Kandy Rovers SC , Imperial Motor Garage Sports Club and Indian Students Hostel, (now known as Asoka Vidyalaya).
As years went on, hockey flourished in Kandy with several schools in and around the area taking to the game. During the World War, large number of clubs and schools including foreign teams played in Kandy.
Again in 1950s the game was heading to the wilderness and to keep it alive P. T. Rajan presented a challenge cup in his name to the Kandy District Hockey Association to be given to the winners of the Inter Club League Tournament.
One time Municipal charity commissioner M.S. Jainudeen, as Secretary of Kandy District Hockey Association went all out to popularize the game.
It is said that in 1944, Kandy DHA, had one of the finest league tournaments, in which 14 teams had taken part. They were St. Anthonys (Hotspurs), Trinity (Rabits), Kingswood, Police, the CLI, Kandy Rovers, The Sampans (Army), The Blue Jays (Army), All Anglo Indian XI, Parklands (Army) Indian Legionaries (Army), South East Asia Command team (Lord Mountbattans staff). The cup went missing for years before it was found and handed over to the Rajan family.
Mention must be made of great players like the late Philip Buultjens, Bobby H.W. Jayaweera and Sam Elhart of Trinity fame, Robert Wright, P. Thangavelu, A.L. Perumal, George Mackay, A.H. Sherifdeen all of St. Anthonys, Lionidas James of Kingswood, M.I. Bin Ismail, and Freddie White who was considered as the best goal-keeper not only in Sri Lanka but also in Asia.
Today at school level, Kandy schools are doing well especially girls schools, but club wise the game has gone down. An effort is being made to bring back the game to the position where it was earlier.

Rupee depreciation will enable export  enterprises to earn more, increase reserves
The falling value of the Sri Lanka Rupee against the US Dollar, would bring much benefits to the exporter in terms of a greater inflow of currency to the export enterprise, said President National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Ramal Jasinghe.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said the drop in the Rupee against the Dollar, which is currently being observed brings about a great opportunity for export enterprises to earn more and in turn build Rupee reserves and look at capacity building and to make improvements in their businesses.
This financial strength in Rupee terms would enable exporters to make more investments to his enterprise and look at more automation and other technical advancements. We see the depreciating Rupee as a window of opportunity for the exporters and they should exploit this situation to their advantage.
The agriculture sector including tea rubber exporters are making gains with the drop in the rupee against the dollar.
Export earning in January and February increased by 8.6% to US$ 1, 881 million as against the corresponding period in 2017 which was US$ 1,733 million. Total exports in February 2018 was US$ 916 million which also showed a 5.5% increase over 2017 February.
Meanwhile Agriculture exporters increased to US$ 410.2 million in January and February 2018 showing a 2.9% increase as against the corresponding period in 2017. Minor agricultural products also saw an export revenue increase from US$ 15.9 million in JAN/FEB 2017 to US$ 18.7 million JAN/Feb 2018.
He however said that some of the value added exporters may find the depreciating Rupee and issue since cost of raw materials would move up and their margins becoming thinner. He also said that high fuel costs too could have a major impact on cost of production and hence may lose the competitiveness in terms of pricing in the global market.
The way out of this is to look at more local value addition and to reduce the dependency of imported raw materials. Use of imported input as components and raw materials, should be researched and implemented , with a view to substituting such inputs with local products to meet demanding international standards.
This commands the involvement of the scientific research and development community to join hands with the local industrialist and the export community and to intensify their R & D efforts to support the export drive.
He also said that they are also looking at the positive steps taken by the Central Bank to correct this situation. He said that at the NCE they are also happy with regard to recent economic development efforts taken by the government to simplify export procedure and reduce red tape. (SS)
