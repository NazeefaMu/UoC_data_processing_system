'IS affiliates multiplying faster than Al Qaeda's ever did' - Ex-CIA director
US: Groups allying themselves with Islamic State are breeding faster than Al Qaeda affiliates ever did, a former CIA boss told Congress following the latest attack in Turkey, which officials say was carried out by a bomber connected with the terrorist group.
Allegiance to Islamic State (IS, previously ISIS/ISIL) has grown from "nothing" only a year ago to nearly 20 countries, President Barack Obama's former CIA Director Michael Morell testified at the House Armed Services Committee.
"IS has gained affiliates faster than Al Qaeda ever did," Morell was cited by Breitbart as saying, as the dust continues to settle on the deadly blast that claimed 10 lives and wounded 15 people in the heart of Istanbul.
"They have conducted attacks that have already killed Americans and they carry the potential to themselves to grab large amounts of territory." IS is now "a significant strategic and lethal threat" to the United States and beyond, Morell said, as he reiterated calls to destroy the group, which no longer operates by its own former rules of keeping to its conquered territories of Syria and Iraq.
The ex-CIA director reiterated calls to degrade the group, or "they would succeed."
Morell said that Libya could become the next IS hub. "Libya is a place where this could happen in the near term. ISIS controls territory in Libya," he said.
"They are currently expanding that territory and foreign fighters are beginning to go to Libya to fight with the ISIS group there. I would not be surprise if we woke up one morning and ISIS in Libya had grabbed a large part of Libyan territory. The same kind of blitzkrieg on a smaller scale that we saw in Iraq," he said, Defense News reported.
The issue of returnee jihadists has been plaguing Europe for some time, as hundreds more continue to join fighters in Syria, or are simply radicalized on home soil. The Paris attacks recently are testament to the horrifying prospect of a Europe in flames.
Evidence of such a spread are witnessed around Russia as well, most notably the North Caucasus region of Dagestan, where IS claimed responsibility for attacking a group of tourists in the run-up to New Year celebrations.
Earlier in December, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), Aleksandr Bortnikov, urged for tougher criminal punishment for anyone joining terrorist groups, including IS. "I deem it necessary that together with lawmakers we once again analyze the existing legislative base in order to make corrections... to tighten criminal responsibility for participation in terrorist activities," Bortnikov said at a joint session of the Russian National Anti-Terror HQ and the Federal Operative HQ of the FSB.
Despite these warnings, and despite the Obama administration's creation of a "narrative working group" to up the military strategy against IS abroad, the US president did not seem too disturbed by the specter of terrorism on US soil in November. Back then he had said there was "no specific and crediblethreat" to the US, upon receiving special national security briefings two days in a row about potential holiday terrorism threats by Islamic State.
A few days after Obama's comments, a US Muslim couple opened fire at the Inland Resource Center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring a further 21.
Their commitment to the idea of jihad was all over the internet and was expressed on the husband's Facebook page.

Govt regrets inconvenience faced by media personnel - Gayantha
The government regrets over the inconveniences faced by the media personnel who went to court to report the Embilipitiya incident, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
He said that he contacted Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake over the phone and inquired about the incident.

Minister Karunathilake said that media personnel have been issued a separate media identity card by the Information Department to create an environment for them to render their service to the society without any trouble. The minister said he learnt that there was no such a notice preventing the media personnel covering the proceedings.
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that action will also be taken against several police officers of the Embilipitiya Police who were involved in the incident that resulted in the death to a youth on January 4.
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the Attorney General would request the Chief Justice to hold a Trial-at-Bar into the Vidya's murder in Kytes and added that it was what President Maithripala Sirisena promised to the parents of Vidya.

Migrant fears as bulldozers head for French 'Jungle' camp
FRANCE: Authorities in the northern French port of Calais were struggling to move hundreds of migrants into refitted shipping containers on Wednesday ahead of plans to bulldoze part of the notorious "Jungle" camp.
The government had planned to move 500-700 migrants and refugees out of the grim makeshift camp into refitted containers with heaters, electricity plugs and cribs for newborns.
But many are reluctant to leave their tents, cafes and shops in the Jungle, and are suspicious about the new camp, which is surrounded by barbed wire and requires a fingerprint scan to come and go.
There is concern that the 125 containers -- each holding 12 people -- are not nearly enough for the 4,000 people currently estimated to be in the Jungle, who are trying to smuggle their way to Britain by ferry or on cross-Channel trains.
Local official Fabienne Buccio said she understood the "apprehension" about the move.
"Given everything these people have been through before they got here, they don't have any immediate confidence in what's happening," said Buccio.
Only around 70 people had moved to the containers by Tuesday night.
"It's warm, we're protected from the cold and the wet," said one, a 44-year-old Afghan accompanied by his wife and six children.
"But how can we live with 12 people in a container, with no shower and no kitchen"
"It's just a dormitory, where there's nothing to do but sleep," added aid worker Christian Salome, from NGO L'Auberge des Migrants.
"But at least the families have shelter."
The authorities have made no secret of their desire to reduce the number of migrants and refugees in Calais.
Buccio said it was "not reasonable" to expect the container camp to be enlarged after it reaches its full capacity of 1,500 people by the end of January.
She also said the major effort to tighten security around the port and Channel Tunnel -- making it almost impossible for migrants to smuggle aboard trains and ships heading to England -- helped explain the heightened tensions of recent days.
France and Britain have spent millions boosting security since last summer, when there were hundreds of daily attempts to breach the barriers.
There have been concerted efforts to convince migrants in the Jungle to give up their attempts to reach Britain and apply for asylum at centres around France, but only about 2,000 have agreed since October.
Many are drawn by family connections and language to Britain, while the migrants often view France as unwelcoming and with limited economic opportunities.
