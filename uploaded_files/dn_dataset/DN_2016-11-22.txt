With a new superhero, Marvel conjures magic
If a man has cheekbones like that, it is enough of a superpower. But Benedict Cumberbatchs Stephen Strange, sorry Dr Stephen Strange with emphasis on the doctor, is not the one to be satisfied with what he has. In comes mystic superpowers, turning him into sort of a Tony Stark with spells but with a wit and intensity that only the actor can muster. So he has the gift of witty repartee, is a genius, has a giant ego and can save the world. He also has a crimson cape which is in love with his cheekbones. Sigh!
But Cumberbatch is not the only reason why you are here, are you You are here because you want to know in the Marvel universe, where does the new superhero stack up So here it goes: Take Batman Begins, put it on steroids, mix Iron Mans smarts and you are ready to enter the psychedelic stun-fest that is Dr Strange. It is funny, it is smart, it has enough of multiverses and astral bodies to give it depth but, most important, it is knock-your-socks-off impressive.
Flaming circles
Marvel believes in giving us five special effects where one will suffice but with Dr Strange, the studio seems to have embraced the subjects outre source and given it a brilliant Kaleidoscopic treatment. As cities fold upon themselves, reality shatters like mirror only to come together again and characters vanish into a space-time vortex through flaming circles. In fact, you forget you are watching a Marvel movie and there are moments when you feel as if Christopher Nolan is trying to out-Inception himself. If you are watching this in IMAX, it may just be the best experience you will have in a long, long time.
And then there is the cast, how can you take Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdamas and Mads Mikkelsen and not make a film that absolutely sings Short answer: You cant. There has been a lot of talk about how Stranges teacher, the Ancient One, should have been an Asian man and not a Celtic woman. It seems what the film lost in white-washing, it gained in gender parity. And then, Swinton is so other-worldly that it is a shame to put her in any brackets.
Doctor Strange movie review, Doctor Strange review, Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange movie, Benedict Cumberbatch Marvel seems to have embraced the outre source material of Doctor Strange.
One-dimensional villain
The only grouse I have with the film is how it wastes Mads and Rachel. Marvel has always had an issue with its one-note villains (think of anybody other than Loki) and the problem persists. In fact, we hear Mads had passed the chance to play a one-dimensional villain in Thor: The Dark World to do precisely that in Doctor Strange. Rachel, meanwhile, is a general hey you for Strange every time he or anyone else needs medical attention. The female leads is another one that Marvel simply cant wrap their heads around.
In the meanwhile, you fat suits at Marvel, stand up and take a bow. After giving us film after film with the same formula, you have stepped into a new realm and conjured magic.

Where Im today is my biggest achievement
Actor Nargis Fakhri enjoys her work, but says she wont let it consume her life. That explains the recent speculation about her quitting Bollywood for good to be with her family in New York, US. As she turns a year older today, the 37-year-old clarifies shed come by when she has a good film offer in hand, and that life is about experiencing different things.
For me, life isnt about what it is for everyone else... like oh career... I have to do this, I have to be married by a certain age. It is about doing anything new that adds to my knowledge. Work is only a piece in my life. It doesnt consume my whole life. I want to take vacations, meet friends, and spend time with family and my mother, says Nargis.
This realisation dawned on her when recently; someone told her that she wasnt ambitious enough. Talking about her priorities in life being different, Nargis says, I am ambitious about life, about doing different things, meeting new people and being a positive person. My ambition is geared in a different direction so many people dont understand it. It is not just limited to a professional sphere. Also because I grew up very poor. For me, where I am today, compared to where I came from, is my biggest achievement. Im so proud of myself. Hindustan Times

Return of a franchise after 15 years
When a film becomes a hit, its quite common for the makers to develop it into a franchise. After all, they want to capitalise on the formers success. However, its not often that a sequel is made a decade and a half after the success of the first movie. Thats what sets writer-filmmaker Anubhav Sinhas Tum Bin 2, featuring Aditya Seal, Neha Sharma and Aashim Gulati, apart.
Five reasons that make it an interesting watch...
1. Love franchise after 15 years
The first outing, Tum Bin, was a surprise hit when it released in 2001. Backed by an excellent soundtrack, the romantic drama was loved by all and fared well at the box office despite being pitted against biggies. It remains to be seen how the audience reacts to Tum Bin 2, especially since it is releasing 15 years after its prequel.
2. The music has struck a chord with listeners
Young singer-composer Ankit Tiwari has created a soundtrack that not only boasts of melodious songs like Ishq Mubarak, Dekh Lena and Dil Nawaziyaan but also caters to the young audience. Moreover, the producers have recreated late Jagjit Singhs song Koi Fariyad from Tum Bin as Teri Fariyaad for the sequel with supporting vocals by Rekha Bhardwaj.
3. Director Anubhav Sinha lends his technical expertise
The writer-filmmaker has ensured that he has captured the picturesque locations of Scotland beautifully on celluloid. His attention to detail also inspired his actors to give their best shot, making the storytelling more impactful.
4. An interesting mix of supporting cast
Seasoned actors like Kanwaljit Singh and Meher Vij (of Bajrangi Bhaijaan fame) play pivotal roles in the movie. Moreover, West Indian cricketer Dwayne Bravo also has a special appearance. Television actress Mouni Roy will also be seen sizzling in Nachna Aaonda Nahin, a recreated version of the famous Punjabi folk number by the same name.
5. A complete family entertainer
The makers promise clean refreshing content with all the ingredients that are bound to wow the young and old alike. Times of India

OTSC 60 Years Family Night with Gypsies
I was very fortunate to join the Old Thomians Swimming Club (OTSC), family show so meticulously put together by a team of experts led by Tusita de Alwis and Rasika, who displayed their consistency of reaching excellence in their field of organizing family entertainment events.
We had the Gypsies in attendance led by the genius Sunil Perera and his brother
Piyal, who need no introduction, when it comes music with an international flavour.
The show started at 7.45 pm, on Sunday the 13th of November at the BMICH Banquet Hall in a tastefully decorated setting with Blue Black and Blue written all over it.
Distinguished guests graced the show, Old Trinitians and Royalists who form the TRT with the Thomians were just one family enjoying a unique night, termed the entertainment as one of its kind. 450 guests were in attendance with Ronnie Lietch a premier entertainer hosting the show, adding so much class and glamour.
Gypsies played all their hit songs of yester year; they emulated western artists to near perfection whilst guests were invited for a scrumptious meal during the first break at 9.30 pm.
What a show, the song, laughter, and most importantly the comrade between the Thomians and their guests recorded volumes of a fantastic evening.
It was great to see two of our Past Presidents namely Sarath Colonne and Sunil Peiris better known as "GDS" at the family night, whilst our present President Dulip Soysa kept the Thomian flag, on a very high pedestal.
OTSC hosts good entertainment all year round. The Club house is a home away from home. 10 years back we celebrated our 50th anniversary, at the same venue in the main hall, but this year it was very special.
The price of a ticket was well worth the entertainment and the comrade. For me personally it was a special night. I was asked to lead in the singing of the College Song.
I had the pleasure of meeting school mates, old friends and my favourite Commander Captain Gaf Fernando, a senior Captain of Air Lanka, and Singapore Airlines, a distinguished Old Thomian, a man of few words and also Old Royalist Snr DIG STF Chief M.R Latiff who were there till 1.30am until the show was over, who stated Tusita and his team did us proud.

After all its opera
Menaka Singers Opera Ensemble (MSOE), the premier opera ensemble in Sri Lanka held it third recital for the year, at the Russian Cultural Centre at 7.30 pm on November 21. Following a sold-out performance in January this year and a triumphant dinner-theatre at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle in September 2016, the MSOE is proud to present another evening of spectacular opera arias by Mozart, Donizetti, Gounod, Bizet, Puccini, and Verdi.
The concert was narrated by British opera star Barbara Segal and was collaborated on piano by Menaka de Fonseka Sahabandu, the founder of MSOE. The unique feature of the ensembles performances was that each aria is introduced by Barbara with a short synopsis of the opera from which it is taken, and the context in which it is sung. This allows even those new to genre to appreciate the beauty of opera, even though it is sung in Italian, French, or German.
Born in Manchester, Barbara studied with the late Dame Isobel Baillie, and then at the Teatro La Scaly, Milan, Italy with maestro Cesare Alfieri. She made her operatic debut in the role of Musetta in La Boheme at the Santa Magherita Ligure Opera Festival, and her repertoire includes roles as Queen of the Night in Die Zauberflote, Violetta in La Traviata, Lucia in Lucia di Lammermoor and Marguerite in Faust. She has taken on principal roles in concerts in over 23 countries. Menaka is well-known in Sri Lanka's classical music scene, having taught music for 32 years. Multitalented Menaka is a pianist, singer and is also a violinist in the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL). She is a Fellow of the Trinity College London in Piano and Singing and a Licenciate of the Royal Schools of Music London, also in Piano and Singing. Menaka has received the award of excellence in vocal western music by the SAARC Women's Association of Sri Lanka, and the Savasangeetha Award. She has performed as a pianist and sung as a soloist with the SOSL, and has also sung the role of Frasquita in Bizet's Carmen, staged in New Delhi.
Barbara has been working with MSOE for the past one and a half years, holding a series of intensive Masterclasses, helping to identify suitable arias for each individual voice. While the initial classes focused on the basics of voice production, breathing technique etc, as the singers technique stabilized, the classes focused more intently on stage presence and interpretation of music. Barbara was able to more easily identify the roles that would suit their vocal fachs, allocating arias for spinto/lyric/coloratura soprano, coloratura mezzo-soprano, lyric tenor, etc. Some legendary arias including Ah, Je Veux Vivre (from Romeo et Juliette), The Doll Song (from Les Contes dHoffmann), The Coat Aria (from La Boheme), and La Mamma Morta (from Andre Chenier), was performed at the recital.
Barbara stated I was so pleased with the progress shown by all the singers at the Anantara concert. The audience commented that it was great to see Sri Lankan singers who really understood and felt what they were singing, and who were able to convey that to the audience. In fact the Anantara concert was such a resounding success that they have been invited back for a repeat performance in Tangalle on November 27. Menaka and I are incredibly proud of all of them.
Soloists for the evening will include sopranos Joanne Aloysius Rajiyah, Nipuni Siyambalapitiya, and Samali Liyanage, mezzo soprano Rachel Halliday, tenor Niran de Mel, and baritones Nishantha Warnakulasuriya and Laknath Seneviratne. The seven soloists are members of the Menaka Singers Opera Ensemble, and have many years experience onstage, with some having been soloists with SOSL, and some, prize-winners at competitions and examinations.

Murray beats Djokovic to win ATP World Tour
Britain's Andy Murray beat five-time champion Novak Djokovic to win his first ATP World Tour Finals title and end 2016 as the world number one.
With the year-end top ranking on the line, Murray won the much-anticipated final 6-3 6-4 at London's O2 Arena.
I'm very happy to win and to be world number one is very special, said the Scot. It's very special playing against Novak in a match like this.
Murray, 29, extended his career-best winning run to 24 matches.
The victory also ends Djokovic's four-year run of success at the tournament and the Serb's bid to equal Roger Federer's record of six titles.
Murray, who had won 10 of the pair's previous 34 encounters, added: We've played Grand Slam finals and in the Olympics before, but I am very happy to win.
It is something I never expected, he said, his win capping off a weekend that also saw brother Jamie Murray and partner Bruno Soares crowned world number one doubles pair.
A capacity crowd of 17,000 packed into the O2 Arena to witness a match that felt more like a heavyweight championship boxing bout than a tennis match, and it was Murray who rose to the occasion.
Andy is definitely number one in the world, said Djokovic. He deserved to win. He is the best player.
In the decisive moments, I wasn't able to come back. I played better late in the match but it wasn't enough.
Murray went into the match having played over three hours more than Djokovic during the course of the week, but in the end it was his big-match sharpness that prevailed.
He played with far greater purpose than Djokovic, who made 30 unforced errors in an unusually erratic performance.
Murray's experience of winning matches day in, day out through the second half of the year shone through, in contrast to the more tentative Djokovic we have seen since he won the French Open.
The Briton did open the match with a double fault, and another three points later, but he pressed for the break at 3-3 after Djokovic sent an easy smash wildly long and wide. The breakthrough game two games later when Murray fired a forehand into the corner for a 5-3 lead, and the set followed after 46 minutes.
Murray simply grew stronger and Djokovic more error-prone as the second set unfolded, two breaks giving him a seemingly impregnable 4-1 lead, before the champion fought back.
Djokovic recovered one break and raced through a service game to cut the deficit to 4-3, but Murray steadied the ship with a solid service hold to move within a game of victory.
When he beat Djokovic to win Wimbledon in 2013, Murray had to come through a tortuous 14-minute final game, and there was more tension this time.
The crowd were gripped as two match points passed before Djokovic finally succumbed on the third to give up his title - and the mantle of best player in the world.
This achievement, to put in perspective, is bigger than any grand slam. It takes an awful lot of work. -AFP

English glee as Aussies turn to Pom Renshaw
SYDNEY: Australia are banking on English-born opener Matt Renshaw as part of their rescue package for the crisis-hit Test team, much to the glee of their arch cricketing rivals.
In one of the seismic selection purges in the last 30 years, opener Renshaw, 20, will be the youngest Test batsman to debut for Australia since the late Phillip Hughes in 2009.
This is a lifelong dream. I thought some day down the track I would be playing for Australia, but not at age 20, said Renshaw.
The tall Queensland left-hander was born in Yorkshire but came to Australia via New Zealand aged 10, and was a childhood friend of Englands Joe Root.
He will open the batting with David Warner -- who infamously punched Root in a Birmingham bar before the start of the 2013 Ashes. Renshaw is one of three likely Test batting debuts along with Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddinson for the demoralised Australian team in this weeks Adelaide day-night Test against South Africa.
Victorian batsman Handscomb, 25, is also the holder of a British passport, but was born in Australia to English parents.
Selectors wielded the axe after Australia lost by an innings and 80 runs to hand the Proteas an unassailable 2-0 series lead in Hobart.
Australias fifth Test defeat in a row, after losing 3-0 in Sri Lanka in July and August, has left them on the brink of their first ever home Test series whitewash.
Pure Aussie
Cant believe a country would pick a player not born and bred in their own back yard, teased former England captain Michael Vaughan in a tweet. London Daily Telegraph cricket writer Nick Hoult joined the fun, tweeting: 20 years on from the Aussie press dubbing (Martin) McCague the rat who joined a sinking ship they pick a Pom in their losing Test team #fairdinkum. Renshaw got the nod after just 12 first-class games where he amassed 1,021 runs at 44.39 with three centuries, the latest, 108, coming in the Sheffield Shield last week.
His father Ian told the Brisbane Courier-Mail his son was pure Aussie. It is important for people to know that Matt loves Australia and he is as Australian as they come, he said.
For a long time it felt as though he couldnt say that, because we, his parents, are English but he is pure Aussie. Renshaw will be a contrast to fellow left-hander Warner. Unlike his adventurous partner, he prizes occupation of the crease above all else. That will be welcome for Australia, who were bundled out for 85 in the first innings in Hobart and lost 10-86 in a stunning collapse during the Perth series opener against the Proteas. South Africa are chasing a first-ever series whitewash in Australia when they go into Thursdays pink ball Test.

India skittle England to grab series lead
Visakhapatnam: Ravichandran Ashwin finished with a match haul of eight wickets as England collapsed on the last day of the second Test to hand India a thumping 246-run win and a series lead on Monday.
Chasing an unlikely 405 for victory, England were bowled out 20 minutes after lunch for 158 as India grabbed a 1-0 lead in the five-match series, after the first Test was drawn.
Skipper Virat Kohli led from the front to bring up the teams second biggest win against England by runs, after they won by 279 runs at Leeds 30 years ago.
Kohlis sparkling 167 and his 226-run third-wicket stand with Cheteshwar Pujara (119) in the first innings was instrumental in the hosts posting 455 after batting first.
The star batsman also hit a gritty 81 in the second innings to underline Indias dominance over the visitors.
Weve been playing some really good cricket, we dont want to be complacent but dont want to be desperate, either. We respect England, said Kohli, who was named man of the match.
Ashwin, the leading Test wicket-taker this year, once again turned on the heat against the English batsmen who resumed their chase at 87 for two but lost their last eight wickets for just 71 runs.
The off-spinner, who picked up his 22nd five-wicket haul in the first innings, captured the first scalp of the day by having Ben Duckett caught behind for nought, ending the batsmans brief, 16-ball stay at the crease.
Ashwin and debutant Jayant Yadav finished with three wickets each in Englands second innings, while fast bowler Mohammed Shami chipped in with two.
The biggest positives are how the fast bowlers bowled and Jayants debut. It was lovely to have five bowlers who can pick up wickets, said Kohli.
The morning session saw England lose Moeen Ali who looped up a simple catch to fine leg off leg-spinner Ravindra Jadeja for just two runs.
Off-spinner Yadav got the important wicket of Ben Stokes, top-scorer with 70 in Englands first innings, for six.
Joe Root, who was dropped on nine by Kohli at leg slip off Ashwin, provided some resistance until fast bowler Mohammed Shami had him lbw for 25.
Root reviewed the decision but TV replays suggested the ball would have hit the leg stump, upholding the on-field call.
The hosts had reclaimed the advantage on the fourth day after Jadeja trapped England skipper Alastair Cook lbw for 54 on what turned out to be the last ball of the day.
It was a good toss to win (for India), no doubt. From losing those five wickets on day two - you have to score first-innings runs, said Cook.
After conceding a 200-run deficit in the first innings, England will take heart from their spirited bowling second time around.
Fast bowler Stuart Broad, who played with a strained tendon on his right foot from day two, and leg-spinner Adil Rashid fought valiantly by claiming four wickets each to dismiss India for 204.
We made India work very hard. We played some good cricket at stages in these first two games. We need to win a couple of games to get ourselves back in the series, said Cook.
The action now shifts to Mohali for the third Test starting November 26. AFP

Zimbabwe v Sri Lanka ODI washed out
Bulawayo: Zimbabwes one-day international clash with Sri Lanka was abandoned on Monday after heavy rain at Bulawayos Queens Sports Club left the outfield too sodden to continue.
The hosts had won the toss and elected to bat first, before progressing to 55 for two in 13.3 overs when the threat of lightning forced the players to leave the field.
A heavy thunder shower followed, and although the afternoon saw the sun return, one section of the ground was deemed unsafe for play to continue.
With the two sides splitting the points, Zimbabwe remained bottom of the triangular series table with four points, while Sri Lanka and West Indies each have seven.
The West Indies and Sri Lanka face off at the same venue on Wednesday with the victor now assured of reaching Sundays final.
The last game of the league phase will see Zimbabwe play the West Indies on Friday. AFP

Paris: Andy Murrays spectacular rise to the top of the mens rankings was made official Monday with the Scot topping the end of season ATP charts on 12,685 points.

Renowed Pakistani mountaineer dies
Rawalpindi: One of Pakistans best-known mountaineers, Hassan Sadpara, died of cancer Monday aged 54, his family said, as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif paid tribute and Pakistanis mourned on social media.
Sadpara was the first Pakistani to scale all five of the countrys eight-thousanders which tower above 8,000 metres (26,247 feet) -- among the 14 highest mountains on the planet. That included K2, the worlds second highest mountain but considered a more challenging climb than the highest, Mount Everest, in Nepal -- which Sadpara had also climbed.
Sharif spoke of the countrys pride in Sadpara, who leaves three sons and a daughter, as social media was flooded with tributes.
Late Hasan Sadparas dedication and self-confidence enabled him to climb highest peaks of the world. The entire nation is proud of his outstanding performance; his endeavours for winning laurels for the country will always be remembered in golden words, said Sharif in a statement. Sadpara, who was born Hassan Asad, came from a small village near the town of Skardu in the mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region in Pakistans north.
His fame did not bring him fortune, with his family urging the government to help finance his cancer treatment as they began to run out of money. AFP

This club was doing well and in the 1970s the club failed to play a match on the due date and they were suspended from cricket. Then some keen cricket promoters who were with the club like Mervyn Berenger and Bertie Gomes changed the name to Kandy Cricket Club and continued the game.

2016 American Music Awards: Top moments and winners

The 2016 American Music Awards brought out the biggest names in music Sunday night at Los Angeles' Microsoft Theater.
The awards, which were co-hosted by Gigi Hadid and Jay Pharoah, were full of show stopping performances-- including John Legend's emotional performance of "Love Me Now," and Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj's racy "Side To Side" duet.
But besides the performances, it was a competitive night. Drake led the way with a record 13 nominationsand brought his dad as his plus one. At the top of the show the rapper won the award for "Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album" and gave a shout out to actress Nina Dobrev who presented him with his award.
"Thank you very much. Me and Nina were on 'Degrassi' together by the way," he said. "I really want to thank everybody who helped me make this album ... I want to thank the city of Toronto, and of course I want to thank the fans and my parents. My dad's here tonight."
Drake also debuted a new Apple commercial during the show, which featured him working out and lip syncing to Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood."
Green Day got political during the award show while singing their new song "Bang Bang." During the performance, the punk rockers chanted "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA" six times. The lines have been used in anti-Trump protests. The performance sent Green Day trending on Twitter with some wondering if the band would be the next target of Trump's Twitter tirade afterhis Hamilton rant.
A sentimental moment came when Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, took the stage to accept the award for "Best Soundtrack" for "Purple Rain" on behalf of her brother. There wasn't a dry eye in the audience as she gave an emotional speech.
"Prince defied the odds, a Black teen from Minneapolis with a goal to electrify the world. Hehad the courage to be different," Nelson said. "With his vision and god-given talent, he is still one of the world's most respected and loved artists."
Another major moment of the night was when actor Robert Downey Jr. presented Sting with the American Music Awards' "Award of Merit." The singer had the audience on their feet as he sang a medley of his greatest hits.
