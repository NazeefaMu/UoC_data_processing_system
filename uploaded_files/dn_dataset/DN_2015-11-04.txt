Weerawansa queries government
Actress Sunny Leone to promote casinos
NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa yesterday asked the government whether it is going to promote casino industry by bringing well-known actress Sunny Leone to the country.
"Sri Lanka has degenerated to a level that infamous actresses such as Sunny Leone is used to promote casinos in the country," he said.
Weerawansa said that those who were clamouring for good governance are silent about this and added that the leaders of good governance including Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera are not even to be seen.
"Ven. Rathana Thera is rarely seen in parliament too," he said
Leone is said to be planning to visit Sri Lanka in December and during her visit, she is expected to present a musical concert at a casino in Colombo.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo, Weerawansa said that the government's dreams to bring economic development to the country have shattered and the country's growth rate which was at 7 percent last year has dropped to 5 per cent within a very short span.
The people who are employed in the state and private sectors are facing the threat of losing their employment due to the country's present economic plight. He said that the Public Service Commission Secretary is appointed through a transparent mechanism. Weerawansa said that the appointment of the commission secretary was carried out without following a transparent procedure.
"Weerawansa questioned the independence and credibility of the commission, if appointments to key positions of the commission such as secretary are not carried out through a proper process.
He said if the government has a real intention of meting out justice to the HNDA students who were subject to police attack, the services of police officials who attacked the female student indiscriminately should be suspended.
"Nothing of that sort has taken place and the police attacked the students on the orders of government leaders," he said.
Weerawansa said that country has never witnessed a press conference held by Sri Lankan sex workers. The governemnt receiving requests to accepts the rights of LGBT community, he said
Weerawansa added that country did not witness such a situation during the previous regime.

Agonies and ecstasies in a journalist's life
Triggering off from the standpoint of a lobby correspondent, it looks as if the former journalist attached to two Tamil newspapers Thinakaran and Weerakesari has thousand and one things to express. All this is about our good friend S Thiilainathan who had been working in the newsroom of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.
He is visualized as a multi faceted media person with a vast area of experience at home and abroad with a working ability in three languages English Sinhala and his mother tongue Tamil. Having commenced his media life as a lobby correspondent cum journalist at the age of eighteen he has managed to write some of his experiences in Sinhala in the latest book titled as Panasvasaraka Parlimentu Vartakaranaya (Fifty Years of Life as a Lobby Correspondent) but strangely enough the 45 short chapters in the work are not confined to a narrow field as a reporter. It transcends the barriers of a mere reporter and reaches the allied areas of communication and meeting various types people and visits to places and in addition to the facing of events which could be deemed sometimes as disastrous as well as challenging.
The work is packed with various types of incidents narrated in the form of fascinating mini narratives evoking the interest in the unwritten and so far written social history in 1962. He started his reporter career attached to the newspaper Virekesari. This starting point has been a blessed moment which had paved the way into many more avenues namely the career in the Davasa newspaper, Broadcasting corporation, the very first FM channel, advertising firms and culminating in Lake House.
Apart from these media units he had served as a member of the performance board and Presently as a member of the Director Board of Sri Lanka Press Council. He seems to feel that fifty two years have gone by leaving quite a lot of memories sweet and bitter. For the average reader these memoirs may look fantastic jottings and for the budding communicator and the student of mass communication they could well be wonderful series of lessons so far unheard of from a veteran in the field.
The communicator Thillainathan had had the chance of meeting some of the most popular politicians of the calibre of J R Jayewardene Dr N. M Perera R. Premadasa, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Dr W Dahanayaka, K M P Rajaratne I M RA Eriyagolla, Tiruchelvam, Maithripala Senanayaka, Amirthalingam, Thondaman, M H Mohamed, Razik Fareed, William Gopallawa as well as Vijaya Kumaratunga to name a few.
He also states as a passing comment how he had the chance of getting to know some of the local and foreign films stars like MG Ramachandran and Saroja Devi to name two out of a galaxy of such personalities. Besides his work as a media communicator he had had the ability to comment on some of the latent social incidents of his career spanning to over fifty years. One such example is his encounter with Anton Balasingham as a writer and recalling of the dreadful Duraiappa case in Jaffna Then comes the citing of the bomb blasts that took place in various places of the country where he recounts and records the narrow escape he personally had from the bomb blast in the central bank building. It is more of a sensitive eye witness account of a devastating human tragedy.
This work of Thillainathan enables the reader to discern the need to know some of the forgotten significant events of the past that would help consider the worth of living in peace and harmony. He recalls the incident of the much discussed army parade held in Colombo where the Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi is said to have had a narrow escape from the rifle blow on the part of a local soldier destined to have severed all the possible political and other links that existed in the two countries at the time.
He too tries his best to recall some of the controversies that came to be known as historic legends such as the arrival of some of the members of the parliament by bullock carts dressed in loin cloths as a protest for the price hike of fuel and other commodities. He too tries to recall some of the events that mistook free flow of information which from the point of view of the ownership of private media companies and radio channels happened to be misunderstood grossly.
The writer seems to feel that the misunderstandings had caused as a result of the lack of a healthy dialogue on the part of the owners and the professional users of media. This accounts for drastic misgivings that had brought negative practices in the field of mass communication. In several short chapters the writer underlines his observations that had been misunderstood. As a communicator of truth and frankness he brings to fore some of the factors leading to professional jealousies which had caused at times bitter feelings.
I felt that the work is written in a simple readable style giving vent to more factual events than mere commentaries of a high flown nature. Though the work as a whole looks more like a series of random jottings, it nevertheless possesses a unity in diversity.

But looks like, after the success of Arya and Arya 2, Allu Arjun is not interested in Arya 3. Rumours of Allu Arjun teaming up with director Sukumar has been doing rounds and the dancing superstars confirmation of the same has got the fans excited. When the media asked if Arya 3 is on the cards, Allu Arjun said," Arya 3 is unlikely. But both of us will definitely team up for something bigger than Arya! You'll forget that franchise for sure."
Meanwhile a source close to the director revealed, Sukumar had narrated a storyline to Arjun, who was immensely kicked. But the project was put on hold. They were in talks in 2014 but things didn't work out because Bunny had other projects lined up. They will work on something soon. It could either be the same story they had discussed earlier too or a complete new concept".

From Best Friends to Soul mates
After Harbhajan Singh there is another legendary star from the Indian cricket world to make headlines and for the same reason in fact. The 'man in blue' we are talking about is Rohit Sharma, who is going to wield his bat elsewhere (we mean on the wedding fields!).
Indian Premier League's (IPL) team, Mumbai Indian's captain Rohit Sharma got engaged to Ritika Sajdeh, who is also his best friend and was his sports manager in the past on June 3, 2015. And now, it is time to cheer for the couple who will soon be marrying on December 13, 2015.
The star cricketer who is currently busy with the Test series against South Africa, will culminate his current relationship into marriage at a five star hotel in Bandra, Mumbai. The ceremony is expected to be a half-day affair. No doubt, he is too seasoned a player to be distracted with the dates, but the wedding is still fixed as per the schedule of the Test series.
A source close to Rohit told Mid-Day:"It is a good date and most importantly, there won't be any cricketing commitments for Rohit as the Test series against South Africa ends on December 7". As per various reports, the high-profile wedding would be attended by the legendary batsman, Sachin Tendulkar along with some other former and current cricketers. Preparations are on in full swing for these best friends to become life partners. Yahoo

Call to include pragmatic proposals in budget
A group of intellectuals on Tuesday urged the government to come up with progressive and pragmatic proposals in the the upcoming budget which addresses the countrys basic economic issues.
Addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Kelaniya University Vice Chancellor Senior Professor Sunanda Madduma Bandara said the government should pay its attention especially on basic economic issues of the country, when preparing the budget.
He said the budget has to balance the revenue and expenditure of the government. The budget is based on taxes such as income tax, customs duty and excise duty.
There should be a proper procedure to identify the rich who are not paying income tax. It is necessary to implement a proper tax collection procedure, he said.
A slump in main exports such as tea and rubber has affected the countrys economy. Creating an investor friendly environment to attract more investors is another important factor the government should pay its attention to, when preparing the budget, he said.
Prof H.D.Karunaratne said the income gap between the rich and the poor has increased in the world today. Jobless growth is another challenge.
The economy is affected by the heavy debt burden which has resulted in an unbalanced economy, he said.
He proposed to increase government expenditure on education. Attention should be paid towards entrepreneurship development and human resource development, Karunaratne said.
He stressed the need of implementing advanced data and information management procedure to collect island wide data and information. Data and information should be computerized for easy handling, he said.
Former Higher Education Ministry Secretary Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawaratne said that the private sector is the engine of the countrys economic growth. The public sector is the gear box of growth. The people are the wheels and politicians are the drivers of the economic growth, he said.

Casualties pile on for Windies
Casualties within the West Indies team continued to increase with wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin becoming the latest victim in the short-list.
"Ramdin is suffering from diarrhea and he returned to the team hotel," said West Indies media manager Phil Spooner yesterday.
"He didn't feel alright this morning and although he came to the ground he was feeling uneasy."
Ramdin was replaced by batsman Jermaine Blackwood with Andre Fletcher taking over the wicket-keeping gloves for the second ODI against Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium.
West Indies are without their captain Jason Holder for this game serving a one-match suspension for slow over rate in the first ODI.
West Indies have already lost the services of hard hitting fast-bowling all-rounder Andre Russell who is recovering from a strained stomach muscle which he suffered while bowling during the first ODI played at this venue on Sunday.
"Russell is getting better and we are trying to get him to play as a batsman in the next ODI," said Spooner.
In the light of these injuries and suspension West Indies made three changes to their side that lost the first ODI by one wicket.
Holder, Ramdin and Russell were replaced by Jermaine Blackwood, Jason Mohammad and Ravi Rampaul.
The third and final ODI is scheduled to be played at Pallekele on November 7.

Feel the life
Dear Children,
Ask your grandparents about their early days. Ask them how they spent their leisure time. So how is your life different from that of your grandparents The answer is not as complicated as today's busy lifestyles I suppose!
Unlike the days of your grand parents, today the society has changed a lot. Due to the advancement of science and technology many new technological devices have come up. Out of all these, the most significant devices are those that link people with each other irrespective of where they live.
Through electronic mail, Facebook, Twitter, Skype or through any other similar communication mode you can be in touch with anyone of your choice. Isn't it strange that sometimes we communicate often with those who live far away from us, with these new devices, but fail even to talk to those who live close to us Social media has changed the lives of billions of people across the globe. You too are among them. Sometimes we spend hours on facebook or other social media. When the entire day or your study hours are spent on social media, you will end up as a failure. You won't be able to live up to the expectations of your parents.
Similarly when you are trapped in a digital world you will hardly get time to appreciate the things that are around you. You may not get time to admire nature, the greatest source of inspiration for great writers, poets and philosophers. Have you ever walked on a lush green meadow listening to the songs of birds and enjoying the sight of trees laden with flowers. Have you ever been close enough to a water fall to hear the music of the water as it glides down a rock. These are the best ways to feel the pulse of nature. So if your parents accuse you of spending too much time on Facebook or Twitter, remember that it's for your own good.
Bye for now,Aunty Sanju
Elephant
The elephant is perhaps the strongest and the largest wild animal in the world. The elephants can, however, be tamed and trained to serve their masters.
The elephant has four legs which are fat and long like pillars. It has two large ears like big fans, a long trunk, but a short tail with a tuft of thin hair at the end. Its eyes are small. The male elephant has two long teeth known as tusks. It lives on leaves, stems of banana trees or small soft plants, grains etc.
There are two categories of elephants: Indian and African. African elephants are bigger than their counterparts. The elephant is an intelligent animal. In ancient days, it was used in war or hunting. Now-a-days, the elephant can be seen in a circus show or zoo. There are tamed elephants who obey their masters. An elephant is also used in the woods for pulling big logs of timber from one place to another. The elephant generally lives for more than one hundred years. It is a good friend to mankind, if it can be properly trained for a particular purpose.

My father is my superhero
Ben Ten, Superman, Spiderman... there are tons of them. But for me, my father is my superhero. I chose this topic to thank my father for his love, for playing a major role and influencing my life.
Amma says the first word I said was 'thatha'. The happiest moment everyday in my life is when he knocks at the door in the evening after returning from office. As he enters there is so much excitement. He hugs me, kisses me and carries me on his shoulder as if we are meetings after ages. Several times in a day he says 'I love you Arjun'. He is my inspiration. He guides me like a lighthouse guides ships. He has always been a good listener, understands me, trusts me and advices me.
Every evening we play games together. Thatha teaches me to be powerful, self-reliant and courageous. We have dinner together. Sometimes I demand to have dinner out, and though he is tired and hates hotel food, he would take me out cheerfully, cracking all jokes on the way. He teaches me the importance of family bonds and sacrifice.
When I am sick, he will be with me throughout my illness. When amma scolds me, he will always say - my son - he is the best, he is the winner. He has never scolded me till date.
He has taught me many valuable lessons on positive thinking. He never says 'no' for anything. He has made me set my goals and every night before I sleep. He says, love everything in this universe and the universe will give you back everything you desire. Those who don't believe in superheroes have never met my father. Even when I am all grown up, I know, that I will be glad that I have my own, unique, superhero and best friend. He is the one and only one who can make me smile in any circumstance. He is my father.

My ambition
Man should have some ambition in life. When I will grow up, I want to became a soldier to serve my motherland. That is my ambition in life.
Among my friends, some want to become doctors, engineers, lawyers, or professors. But I want to become an army personnel. Why Because I consider myself brave, disciplined, healthy, and perfectly fit to become an army man. I am already doing cadetting to achieve my goal.
I enjoy the parade or the long march, and love to hear the war drums and the bugle during my training. The uniform encourages me. As I stand in front of a mirror, I see in my mind's eye my future adult self as an army officer reflected in the mirror.
A soldier has to be a patriot. He has to be an honest fighter who should not care for his own life to save the freedom of his motherland. A good soldier is adored by all. He is a dedicated soul for the great cause of protecting the integrity and sovereignty of his country. He must be a complete man with sound health, strong body, and a clear and broad mind. He is the pride of his countrymen.If a soldier wins in a war, he becomes a hero. If he dies in the war, he becomes a martyr. Thus he is worshiped either as a hero or as a martyr. I wanted to be remembered like that even after I die.

Memories
Memories are of many types, some harsh and some soft like feathers. We love to be reminded about good memories because they sooth our minds.
One such memory is of childhood. It affects our matured life so our childhood has to be nurtured properly. Some peoples take advantage of poor children by giving them harsh work to do which are beyond their capability and strength. Children are innocent. They do not know good or bad. They do not believe in divisions. They find their happiness in things like toys, rain, marbles etc.
When our childhood is tarnished, it affects our personality when we grow up. The childhood has to be nurtured of both the rich and poor children. So let us take action and make sure everyone has happy childhood memories.

Children with dogs at less Asthma risk
UK: Children who grow up with dogs have about 15 per cent less asthma risk than those without the pets, a new study has claimed.
A team of Swedish scientists used national register information in more than one million Swedish children to study the association of early life contact with dogs and subsequent development of asthma.
This question has been studied extensively previously, but conclusive findings have been lacking. The new study showed that children who grew up with dogs had about 15 per cent less asthma than children without dogs.
A total of more than one million children were included in the researchers' study linking together nine different national data sources, including two dog ownership registers not previously used for medical research.
The goal was to determine whether children exposed to animals early in life are at different risk of asthma.
"Earlier studies have shown that growing up on a farm reduces a child's risk of asthma to about half. We wanted to see if this relationship also was true for children growing up with dogs in their homes," said Tove Fall, Assistant Professor at Uppsala University.
"Our results confirmed the farming effect, and we also saw that children who grew up with dogs had about 15 per cent less asthma than children without dogs," said Mr Fall.
"Because we had access to such a large and detailed data set, we could account for confounding factors such as asthma in parents, area of residence and socioeconomic status," said Mr Fall, who coordinated the study together with researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.
In Sweden, every person carries a unique personal number.

The compassion formula!
If there ever was a cameo interview that encapsulated the very essence of a man it would be today's tale from Diyawanna - Parliamentarian Dilum Suraj Bandara Amunugama who fervently believes in world peace and the power of doing good. Dilum is a man who puts everyone at ease with his easy charm.
Early days
Amunugama's father was in the Military and his mother worked at an NGO. His uncle Sarath Amunugama needs no introduction. Amunugama had a relatively normal childhood with a sister, and every day he spent at Trinity College was a matter of pride to him and everyday was important. Every calendar day at school was important.
His pride
Hard work is nothing new to Amunugama. That is what got him to where he is today. A politician is only as good as his electorate. Amunugama has always kept the power of the people in mind and his responsibility towards them having voted him in.
"It is absolutely no secret. It's all in a hard day's work. We just have to understand that the people voted us into parliament and they can as easily vote you out. Having said that, I feel that almost every day is a challenge for me. The happiest and most important day in my life when I was elected as a member of parliament. Because this way I can help and be the voice of the people I represent."
His message to the youth
Amunugama's message to the youth sums up what every religion from the dawn of history has impressed upon the people. His message is the central teaching of ethics and the many philosophies of the world. In four words he has summed up human civilization and society for the youth - Do good and be good.
Life out of Parliament
"I don't read books per say. But I read articles and newspapers. I travel most of the time so mostly listen to what's playing on the radio. And I have an affinity towards golden oldies.
Due to time constraints I hardly have time to watch anything unless I watch it on the go. So movies are a no! I like to play cricket and I watch the occasional rugger match whenever time permits.
I am in a relationship and that happened through a mutual friend. When it comes to dating girls during my time I don't think we did anything out of the box. It was always out and about in a group."
If you were able to live your life all over again and be anyone you want, who would that be and what would you do differently
"I would want to be me"
Wish for the world
Amunugama is a complete man. No doubt it was the trait of compassion that has given him the courage to believe and the strength to enter parliament.
"World peace is most important, but to achieve that we have to first establish peace in the country we live in. My greatest strength is, as I see in me is compassion. This is what I first notice in a person as well and I am very religious. Anything to do with compassion moves me. Without compassion you are just half a man."
Formula
Amunugama's signature mark is that he is an extremely uncomplicated young man. A man who keeps things perfectly simple, his attitude in life must be admired.
"I don't think anyone needs a reason to be happy. Basically if you are content with your life you can be happy. Life is not complicated. If you understand that, then you are a happy man! Like I said before do good and be good."
Role model
The fact that Amunugama didn't have to elaborate on this, will come as no surprise to anyone. This leader left a lasting legacy and still looms large in the imagination of the masses.
"Just one person. It is Mahinda Rajapaksa and I don't think I have to elaborate."
Did you also undergo military discipline
"Well yes, when my father came home which was not a thing that happened frequently because there was a war going on."

Foreign markets to be explored to address tea industry crisis
Foreign markets will be explored for Sri Lankan tea to address the crisis in the tea industry, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma on the fall of prices of tea buds.
The Prime Minister said new markets for tea will be explored in countries such as India, Pakistan, Turkey and Iran. He said the Tea Export Board was granted Rs. 1 billion by the Treasury to provide relief for affected tea smallholders due to the prevailing crisis.
We met stakeholders in the tea industry recently. Money was disbursed to provide for relief, he said.
The Prime Minister said tea exports had not reached new markets over the past years. Tea had been exported mainly to Russia. There is no way that we can inquire into this matter, as the former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia and Ukraine is missing, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government perseveres to protect tea smallholders and labourers attached to the tea industry.
Replying to a supplementary question by MP Alahapperuma, the Prime Minister said the crisis in the international tea market is worse than the situation in 2008.
The economy of Russia and Ukraine had been affected. There are conflicts in the Middle East, he said.

Prime Minister praises Opposition Leader
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament complimented Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan for raising a matter of national importance.
The Prime Minister made this observation after the Opposition Leader raised the matter of HNDA students by asking a question under Standing Order 23(2). I thank the Opposition Leader for raising this matter. He proved that he would take up the issues pertaining to the North and the South alike.
This indicated that he is a true national leader of the Opposition.
I hope that he would continue this practice even in the future, the Prime Minister said.

Speaker to inquire into military deployment close to Parliament
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday in Parliament said that he did not call for the deployment of military personnel close to Parliament. He would present a report to the House after looking into the matter, he said.
The Speaker made these observations in reply to a charge by MP Dinesh Gunawardena that the Speaker had deployed Police and military personnel near the Parliament road to obstruct the students who were protesting, from entering Parliament.
The Speaker rejecting the claim of MP Gunawardena asked him not to make false allegations against him. The Speaker warned MP Gunawardena to be mindful of his conduct in Parliament. You are a senior MP, but you resorted to disturb the business of the House. I observed this for several days. I regret your conduct, he said.
Even though the Speaker assured that he would inquire as to who gave orders to deploy Army personnel near Parliament, MP Gunawardena continued to protest without allowing the Speaker to proceed on the business of the House. The Speaker refused to provide a microphone to MP Gunawardena stating that he had been repeating the same for nearly 20 minutes.
I allowed ample time for you to speak. I told you that I will inquire into the matter. Do not disturb the proceedings of the House, he said.
MP Gunawardena took his seat and the protesting MPs in the Opposition also followed him ending their protest.

High defence authorities provide security for Parliament - Deputy Speaker
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said yesterday that the security arrangements of Parliament were designed and put in place by high defence authorities of the country.
The Deputy Speaker addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex, said that the Army was not called to provide security to Parliament yesterday. It was wrong that MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena has said the Speaker had summoned the Army to stop the university students' protest march towards Parliament.
Police and STF commandos provided security on roads leading to Parliament as intelligence agencies have reported that some student protestors marching from the Sri Jayewardenepura University may come towards Parliament.
"The deployment of security personnel to prevent such intrusions is not our task," Deputy Speaker Sumathipala said.
The security authorities were bound by the duty to ensure the protection of Parliament. The security of Parliament is not a party matter, he said.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Speaker said the human rights sessions of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva held recently were progressive for the country.
The delegation had explained that investigations and hearing procedures with regard to murders of two MPs, T Maheshwaran and DM Dassanayake were nearing completion.
"We requested them to drop the item from the IPU human rights agenda. But the decision would be taken by the eight-member committee which we don't have access. The IPU accepted our proposal," he said.

Heidi Klum Dressed as Jessica Rabbit
If there is one thing Heidi Klum has become known for since retiring from the runways, it's her extravagant Halloween parties, and more importantly, her equally extravagant costumes. She used to involve ex-husband Seal in the festivities, but divorce doesn't exactly encourage people to have fun and dress up together.
Single life notwithstanding, the German former supermodel amped up her costume game to a very scary degree. Having chosen some offensive outfits in the past, such as dressing up as the Hindu Goddess, Kali, in 2009, but she has since learned from her mistakes.
This year saw Klum, at her high profile annual party, take on the task of dressing like Jessica Rabbit.
On the surface, it seems like a pretty simple concept: wear a red wig, a red dress, red shoes, and purple gloves. But Heidi managed to make it weird, with latex on her face to make her look like the cartoon vixen, fake breasts, and a fake butt to top it all off. She certainly beat anyone else's attempts to get plastic surgery to look like Jessica Rabbit. Racked

Kusal, Lahiru steer Sri Lanka to series-clinching win
Flamboyant opener Kusal Perera missed out on a well-deserved century by one run but coupled with a cultured unbeaten half-century from vice-captain Lahiru Thirimanne it was enough to propel Sri Lanka to a series clinching eight-wicket win over West Indies in the second one-day international played under lights at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka chasing a revised target of 225 under the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule completed the win with nine balls to spare to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
If Sunday's run chase proved to be nerve-wracking - Sri Lanka winning by one wicket, yesterday's victory was convincing with the top order ensuring they finished the match off without allowing it to drag on.
Thirimanne who made the winning hit - a push to mid-on for a single was unbeaten on 81 scored off 95 balls with five fours and a six and Dinesh Chandimal was on 16 not out.
Man of the Match Perera dominated a 156-run stand with Thirimanne that really took the wind out of the West Indies sails, Despite Perera's dismissal for 99 scored off 92 balls (4 sixes, 6 fours) the final result was a foregone conclusion.
West Indies who chose to bat first after winning the toss apparently overlooked the dew factor for they were greatly handicapped by a wet ball due to the dew on the field making it slippery in the bowlers' hands. It was also not easy on the fielders to field the ball cleanly.
Sunil Narine who caused havoc in the first ODI with three wickets in one over struck immediately as he was brought on in the fifth over surprisingly Dilshan (17) with his first delivery that swung more than spun to take his off bail. Dilshan together with Perera had set the tone for the innings posting 40 off 25 balls for the first wicket.
The usually flashy Perera played a refined knock but it didn't stop him from reaching his half-century with a six over midwicket off Brathwaite and following it up with another six off a free-hit courtesy of the bowler sending down a high full toss.
Lasith Malinga gave Sri Lanka the early breakthrough with the wicket of Andre Fletcher for a duck and when Sachitra Senanayake picked up a wicket with his first ball getting rid of Jermaine Blackwood who tried to take him on but only succeeded in holing out to Siriwardana at long-on, West Indies had lost two wickets for 29 in the fifth over.
The innings was revived by Johnson Charles and Darren Bravo who associated themselves in a partnership that produced 70 runs in as many balls.
Siriwardana who has the knack of breaking partnerships did just that when everything was going well for West Indies. He had Bravo caught on the pull shot by Dilshan at midwicket for 21 and then removed the ominous looking Charles for 83 trapping him lbw.
During his 70-ball stay at the wicket Charles slammed four sixes and seven fours and his presence in the middle saw the West Indies maintain a healthy run rate of six an over.
With the match being played on the same strip as the first ODI on Sunday, spinners came into play in a big way. Before rain caused an interruption to the West Indies at 149-4 in the 27th over, Sri Lanka already had five spinners in action bowling a total of 19 overs.
The game when it resumed after a three and a quarter hour break for rain took a bizarre turn with West Indies perched nicely at 211-6 losing their last four wickets for three runs - all to run outs.
The dismissal of acting skipper Marlon Samuels for a well struck 63 off 61 balls (2 sixes, 4 fours) - his best innings on the tour sparked off the run out mania from which the West Indies failed to extract themselves out of and eventually fell short of utilizing their full quota of overs. Taylor, Brathwaite and Narine all followed the same pattern as their captain needlessly throwing away their wickets to poor judgements.
The third match of the series which is now a dead rubber will take place at Pallekele on November 7.

Libyan Islamists threaten to send more migrants to Europe
LIBYA: Libya's self-declared Islamist government has issued a veiled threat to send "hundreds of thousands" of extra migrants to Europe if Brussels does not recognise it.
Officials say they could hire boats to send large numbers of Africans across the Mediterranean, massively adding to the numbers already reaching Europe's borders.
The warning was made by a spokesman for Libya's General National Congress in an interview with The Daily Telegraph.
The Congress took control of Tripoli last year after fighting against forces loyal to the internationally-recognised House of Representatives government. A fortnight ago, both factions rejected the terms of a UN-brokered peace deal.
Jamal Zubia, the Congress's foreign media spokesman, said Libya was spending tens of millions of pounds a year stopping migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, through the use of detention centres and repatriation programmes. He said that if Europe continued to refuse to recognise the Congress's authority, the government could reverse the policy.
"To be honest, I have advised my government many times already that we should hire boats and send them to Europe," he said. "We are protecting the gates of Europe, yet Europe does not recognise us and does not want to recognise us. So why should we stop the migrants"
Libya has long been a major transit country for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, but the numbers have grown thanks to the security vacuum that followed Col Gaddafi's fall in 2011. Last year, an estimated 170,000 arrived by boat from Libya in Italy. Between January and September this year the figure was 130,000.
Contrary to popular impression, the Libyan government does not turn a complete blind eye to people-smuggling. Its Department for Combating Illegal Immigration employs 8,000 staff and detains large numbers of migrants for entering the country illegally, as well as working with the International Organisation for Migration on voluntary repatriation programmes. In coastal ports, local officials run coastguard patrols and assist with the collecting of bodies when migrant ships sink.
However, the sheer number of migrants vastly outweighs the capacity of the authorities to deal with them, even though Libya spends pounds 80million a year on the issue. Many officials resent deploying resources at what they see as a European problem. Mr Zubia stressed that his government had no immediate plans to stop its efforts to halt the flow of migrants, or to start hiring ships to speed their passage to Europe.

Maldives declares state of Emergency
Gayoom has declared a state of Emergency, giving sweeping powers to security forces to arrest suspects ahead of a major anti-government
protest rally, his spokesman said. "(The) Maldives declares state of emergency for a period of 30 days starting 12 pm (07:00 GMT) Wednesday," the presidential spokesman Muaz Ali tweeted on Wednesday.
Gayoom said on Tuesday he would take all steps to ensure the safety of his people, a day after an explosive device was found near his official residence.
In his speech to the nation he said an explosion last month on his speedboat was "an act of greed to attain power," an apparent reference to his vice president, who is being held for questioning over the alleged assassination attempt.
The FBI, which investigated at the Maldives' request, said on Saturday it found no evidence a bomb had caused the boat explosion.
The government said Gayoom was not sitting in his usual seat on the boat and thus was not hurt by the blast, which injured his wife, an aide and a bodyguard.
Vice President Ahmed Adeeb was among nine people arrested on suspicion of involvement in the boat explosion. The Maldives Constitution provides for the vice president to assume power if the president dies or incapacitated Maldives is an Indian Ocean archipelago with 350,000 people, mostly Sunni
Muslim, and is known for its beaches and luxury resorts.
It has had a difficult transition to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008, with the first democratically elected leader being jailed for 13 years under the country's terrorism law.
The trial was criticised both locally and internationally for an apparent lack of due process.

Meet the Hong Kong: Treat That's Taking: New York by Storm
This year has been a banner year for Asian-style ice cream in NYC. This Summer, 10 Below Rolled Ice Cream, a Thai-style street food, had Manhattanites lining up in droves for a taste. If its reception at the Grub Street Food Festival is any indication, Eggettes NY, will be the next trendsetting ice cream spot. While a brick-and-mortar shop is currently under construction, Eggettes NY is due to open in Chinatown soon and will sell gai daan jai (otherwise known as eggettes), a traditional Hong Kong street treat similar to a Belgian waffle in texture, with a unique bubbled shape.
Patrons of the shop will be able to order the eggettes on their own in four flavors  original, chocolate, green tea, and pumpkin spice  as well as part of an ice cream cone. Here's how to make the eggettes at home. PopSugar
INGREDIENTS:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tbsp tapioca starch
1 tbsp custard powder
2 large eggs
2/3 cup granulated white sugar
2 tbsp evaporated milk
150 ml water
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp vanilla extract
DIRECTIONS:
Matcha Eggette Cone With GreenTea Ice Cream, Oreos, Blueberries,and Chocolate Syrup
*In a large bowl, add all ingredients and mix with a whisk until only very small lumps remain. Set batter in fridge for one hour.
*Read instructions on whether your pan can be placed directly onto stove or if it needs a wire rack and do accordingly. Pre-heat each half of the waffle pans on medium-high heat until hot (about 1-2 minutes).
*Lightly brush each pan with vegetable oil (don't use spray). Turn heat to medium (I set mine at dial at
*Pour 3/4 cup of the batter into the middle of the egg waffle pan and then immediately flip pan, making sure to hold pan together tightly so it doesn't leak. Cook for 2 minutes, then flip to other side and cook for 2 minutes. The egg waffle will now require one more cook on each side. Timing may vary depending on stove, but mine needed 2 more minutes on each side. (You first waffle will like still be pale yellow and may have cooked unevenly. Like the first pancake, this is your throwaway one. The ones after should look light brown when they are finished.)
*Remove the side of the pan the finished egg waffle is clinging to, and hold it above a plate with the waffle upside down,. Using a chopstick or spoon, gently loosen it from the pan, starting on the top edge, using gravity to help it release. It will start to curl as it falls off and you should be able to get it out in one piece (except for the first waffle).
*Repeat with the remaining batter (re-greasing pans first) and then serve immediately.

National reconciliation: Towards a comprehensive national framework
A serious, well coordinated action plan for national reconciliation is long overdue. The war and its aftermath made such a plan imperative, in order to build bridges across long standing ethno-linguistic divisions and heal the wounds caused by the violent conflict. LLRC report highlighted the urgent need for ethnic reconciliation. Now the Geneva process has also brought the reconciliation issue to the forefront. Moreover, there is broad agreement at a societal level regarding the need for reconciliation, yet, there are no clear signs of any effective measures being taken to move in the direction of a concerted national effort.
Given the obvious significance of reconciliation in the context of post-war reconstruction, the establishment of a high profile, well resourced Ministry would have indicated the level of commitment of the government to national reconciliation. Instead, what we observe today is the absence of a national level focal point around which diverse yet related Ministries, relevant state institutions, civil society organizations and international agencies could be mobilized to develop and implement a national action plan.
National reconciliation is urgent against the backdrop of the ethnic war that reinforced long standing ethno-linguistics divisions. These divisions are the result of a whole range of historical, social, cultural and political factors.
Transcending these divisions is necessary to reduce the social distance between communities and forge national unity. But this is easier said than done because the divisions are continually reproduced by certain structures and processes. These are related to education, regional disparities, language, media, arts, employment, etc.
Joint national action plan
Given the pervasive nature of the issues connected with national disunity, reconciliation efforts need to be multi-sectoral in scope. In other words, a whole range of sectors and institutions need to contribute to a national programme of reconciliation. No single Ministry or an agency, no matter how powerful these may be, can formulate and implement such a programme.
The main reason is that there are several ministries that deal with matters pertaining to national reconciliation. So, unless these Ministries function as a well coordinated cluster, it would be difficult to secure their optimal contribution to the national effort. Some of the Ministries that are relevant in the above regard are Education, National Integration, Law and Order, Justice, Cultural Affairs, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Youth Affairs, Sports, and National Planning.
Some of the interventions that are necessary to promote national integration necessitate policy and institutional reforms that take time and money. For instance, most of our educational institutions are segregated on ethno-linguistics lines and continue to reproduce exclusive identities among children and youth. Moreover, despite change of state policy in favour of bilingualism and trilingualism, second language teaching in schools is an almost total failure. There are also issues with school curriculum pertaining to social cohesion.
The other Ministries mentioned above no doubt have a great potential to contribute to national reconciliation but we have not been able to tap their potential. On the other hand, if we develop and implement a joint national action plan that includes envisaged policy changes and well focused interventions in areas that come under the purview of different Ministries, their cumulative effect will no doubt be far reaching. Yet, in spite of the urgency of such a collective effort, it appears that the authorities have so far failed to put together a well-thought out inter-sectoral action plan that spells out a clear vision, a set of national objectives and strategies that can help the country to achieve national reconciliation within a reasonable period of time. Even if it is going to take many years to achieve national reconciliation, the launching of a well coordinated, national reconciliation programme backed by political will at the highest level of government itself can create a sense of hope in the minds of the hitherto marginalized and alienated sections of society.
Megapolis project
As indicated above, national reconciliation is a multidimensional phenomenon. It is as much socio-cultural as economic. It is necessary to provide equal opportunities to minorities living in the provinces. This can be done only by promoting regional development in order to reduce regional disparities. The present national effort to develop the western region through the Megapolis project should set an example for the other provinces to follow, in order to develop the outlying provinces.
While the lack of investment capital will no doubt be the key constraint to regional development, it is still possible to adopt regional development strategies that are less capital intensive. I.e. Eco-tourism, agricultural diversification, rural agro-based industries, organic agriculture, etc.
We cannot afford to have a repetition of anti-state rebellions that we witnessed in the country since the early 1970's, in particular, the devastating ethnic violence that ravaged the country for more than two decades.
We now have a good understanding of the causes of such violence and rebellions. Unless we make a concerted effort to neutralize such causes, divisions and tensions are not going to disappear. If nothing is done, the situation can get worse over time. It is the collective responsibility of the political leaders, intellectuals and civil society groups to take steps to avoid such a situation.

Patients want test results via password-protected websites
US: Most patients prefer receiving the results of sensitive medical tests - such as genetic tests - through password-protected websites or portals rather than by email or letters, a new survey has found.
The survey by Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) found that the largest portion of participants was comfortable receiving test results through password-protected websites or portals. The survey of 409 participants did not include in-person communications, researchers said.
The research found that while password-protected web portals are highly preferred, participants don't mind a variety of non in-person communication methods including email, texts or voicemail for receiving results of common tests such as blood cholesterol levels. However, that is not the case for two very sensitive tests - non-HIV sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and genetic test results.
In those cases, receiving the results via a password-protected patient portal/website was highly preferred. Communication with patients may need to be on a case-by-case basis - every individual may have a personal preference, and there may be a way to indicate those preferences in the patient's record, said the study's lead researcher, Jeannine LaRocque, assistant professor of human science in the School of Nursing & Health Studies at GUMC.
The goal of this study was to try to better understand these preferences, so we can improve doctor-patient communication, said LaRocque.
The survey tested the desirability of seven different methods of non-in-person communication in receiving three different kinds of tests: common tests such as blood cholesterol and colonoscopy results; non-HIV STIs; and genetic testing (predisposition to a disorder, carrier of an inherited gene linked to a disease and a carrier of a genetic disorder).

Political motive behind arrest - FSP
The Frontline socialist Party (FSP) yesterday said that the sudden arrest of Kumar Gunaratnam of the FSP was illegal and it was only a political reason behind the sudden arrest
and not a legal reason. Addressing the media yesterday at the CSR, Maradana, FSP Politburo Member Duminda Nagamuwa claimed that Kumar Gunaratnam was taken into the Police custody without a warrant while he was at his mother's place in Anguruwatota, Kegalle.
"The present government is also following the footsteps of the previous Rajapaksa regime without doing what they promised prior to the 2015 Presidential Election. The Rajapaksa regime kidnapped Kumar Gunaratnam on several occasions they alleged and the present government has arrested him. But finally both parties wanted to expel him from the country," he said.
Nagamuwa also said that Gunaratnam, is an Australian Citizen and he applied for dual citizenship. But the Immigration and Emigration Department didn't granted dual citizenship for him. Therefore, he entered the country on a tourist visa and requested the Immigration authorities to extend it. But, they didn't responded to the request.
The FSP urged all parties who raised their voices against the anti-democratic rule of the Rajapaksa regime to be united and raise their voices against this attempt to expel him from the country.
FSP Secretary Senadheera Gunathilake was also present.

Recorders show crashed Russian jet not struck from outside: Investigator
EGYPT/RUSSIA: The Russian plane that crashed in Egypt was not struck from the outside and the pilot did not make a distress call before it disappeared from radar, a source in the committee analysing the flight recorders said.
The source declined to give more details but based his comments on the preliminary examination of the black boxes recovered from the Airbus A321 which crashed in the Sinai Peninsula on Saturday killing all 224 people on board.
The Egyptian government said the black boxes were being examined by Egyptian and Russian experts along with German and French specialists from Airbus and from Ireland where the aircraft was registered.
It said the search was continuing across the 9-sq-km crash site. Security sources said intelligence agencies had obtained a copy of the passenger list.
Russian officials have said the plane, carrying holidaymakers from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St Petersburg, likely broke up in mid-air but said it was too early to say what caused it to crash.
The first bodies recovered from the wreckage arrived on board a Russian government plane at St Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport, where grieving Russians left piles of flowers. A photographer saw a white lorry leaving the airport, escorted by police cars, heading for a St Petersburg morgue, where the bodies were to be identified. Egypt said the plane was carrying 196 bodies. A second plane was due to leave Cairo today evening.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had declared Sunday a day of mourning, said today the crash was a great tragedy.
"Without any doubt everything should be done so that an objective picture of what happened is created," Putin said in comments cited by ITAR-TASS. "So that we know what happened."
When asked if a terrorist attack could be to blame, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said no theory could yet be ruled out.
An Egyptian militant group affiliated with Islamic State said on Saturday it brought down the plane "in response to Russian air strikes that killed hundreds of Muslims on Syrian land".
Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov dismissed the claim, saying it "can't be considered accurate".
Alexander Smirnov, deputy general director of airline Kogalymavia, which operated the plane under the brand name Metrojet, said only a "technical or physical action" could have caused the aircraft to break up in the air.
"The plane was in excellent condition," Smirnov told a news conference in Moscow. "We rule out a technical fault and any mistake by the crew."
Kogalymavia's deputy general director for engineering, Andrei Averyanov, said a 2001 incident when the plane's tail section struck the tarmac on landing was fully repaired and could not have been a factor in the crash.

SLTA marks 100th anniversary
The Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) will celebrating its momentous 100th anniversary with the hosting of the prestigious Asian Tennis Federation's Annual General Meeting later this month.
A truly landmark event for the SLTA - which is the second-oldest tennis association in Asia - the AGM marks the first time the Asian Tennis Federation has held such a distinguished event in Sri Lanka and is anticipated to signal a reinvigorated engagement between the Sri Lankan tennis community and its Asian neighbours.
With the rising prominence of tennis, the sport is generating renewed interest among a young international audience and SLTA President Iqbal Bin Issak believes that the time is ripe to provide opportunities for more Sri Lankan youth to enter the sport.
Noting that the rise in popularity of tennis is already well underway, Issak stated that the renewed interest in tennis would also generate valuable opportunities for Sri Lanka's private sector to partner with the SLTA to gain international exposure and prestige while helping to develop tennis in Sri Lanka.
Development of Sri Lanka as an international destination for tennis is also anticipated to attract a more affluent tourist demographic to the country, a move that could prove to be highly beneficial for wider national goals.
In the build up to its centenary celebrations, the SLTA has been deeply engaged in promoting the development of tennis in the island having successfully conducted multiple back-to-back tournaments commencing from February this year.
The first three professional-level events are expected to provide an invaluable stepping stone for local talent and were followed promptly with a further three junior level tournaments in July, finishing up with three International Tennis Federation under 18 tournaments for boys and girls that concluded in October.
The tournaments succeeded in drawing significant international participation with 120 players, parents and coaches arriving in the country this year. The tournaments also generated unprecedented opportunities to showcase young Sri Lankan tennis talent, providing local players with vital international exposure thereby honing their skills and forging lasting bonds of camaraderie and friendship through tennis.

A retiring headmistress claims that young girls need to choose between a career and a family in early life
Sorry girls, you can't have it all
Vivienne, who was awarded Tatler's Best Headteacher of a Public School last year, said she supports women who choose not to combine motherhood and a career.
Vivienne Durham head of Francis Holland Regent's Park has revealed that she believes girls should choose between a family and a career

In the interview with Absolutely Education magazine she also said: I'm sorry, I'm not a feminist. I believe there is a glass ceiling  if we tell them there isnt one, we are telling them a lie.
She said: Young girls have massive options these days and some of them will make a decision that they don't want to combine everything and that is as valid as making the decision that you do want to combine everything.
The headteacher of the 13,000-a-year school, which counts Cara Delevingne, Jackie Collins and Jemima Khan among its star-studded alumni, added that she believes that such a decision should be made as soon as possible for young women.
She continued: We all have a biological calendar and you have to make decisions about your entire working life, which probably goes up to about 77 now, but you have to make decisions about 40 per cent of your life early on.
Vivienne added that the right career can be, for some women, as satisfying as starting a family.She revealed that she believes that a job can be as fulfilling as starting a family
Sacrifice
If you're lucky enough to find yourself in a job that you love, it could be very emotionally fulfilling. I am not saying it is as emotionally fulfilling as having children but [that love for a career] sometimes that means that the decision ends up being right.
Her comments, which are bound to upset women who believe that they can be mothers and career women at the same time, come after one of Britains top NHS fertility specialists wrote to education secretary Nicky Morgan demanding that girls of school age are taught about the dangers of delaying motherhood.
In the letter, seen by The Mail on Sunday, consultant gynaecologist Professor Geeta Nargund wrote: I have witnessed all too often the shock and agony on the faces of women who realise they have left it too late to start a family.
For so many, this news comes as a genuine surprise and the sense of devastation and regret can be overwhelming.
Fertility issue
And so often the cry will be Why did no one warn me about this
Vivienne Durham head of Francis Holland Regents Park has revealed that she believes girls should choosebetween a family and a career
Fertility issues placed a costly and largely unnecessary burden on the NHS, she said, warning that the IVF bill looks set only to increase.
Hundreds of millions is already spent on IVF, with each treatment cycle costing around 5,000.
Arguing passionately for fertility lessons, she urged Mrs Morgan: Information is power and the best way to empower people to take control of their fertility is through education.
Prof Nargund said: Ideally, if a woman is ready for a child, she should start trying by the time she is 30. She should consider having a child early because as a woman gets older, her fertility declines sharply.
At the time a Department for Education spokesman said: Sex and relationship education is compulsory in all maintained secondary schools.
We also expect academies and free schools to deliver relationship education.
We trust schools to ensure the education they provide meets the needs of particular students. As such, they are free to talk about fertility or any other relevant issues.

[PARLIAMENT - (05-11-2015)]
There was no extra security at Parliamentary premises on Nov. 03 - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jaysuriya yesterday, announced that no extra security was deployed within the Parliamentary premises on Tuesday November 03,
He stated that neither a member nor the public who came to meet the members were subjected to any extra check-ups other than going through the normal procedures.
The Speaker made this announcement in relation to a question raised by opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena on November 03 in Parliament on the extra security deployed.
"I inquired from the acting Inspector General of Police and other relevant authorities on this matter," the Speaker said. "I was told that as they had information that a large section of the university students were preparing to stage protests in Colombo and near the Parliament, extra security was deployed outside the Parliament premises."
The Speaker further stated that he came to know that it was not compulsory to obtain the Speaker's permission to deploy security personnel outside Parliamentary premises. He added that there had been similar situations earlier too. At this stage, the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella stated that the country had a new political culture unlike during the Rajapaksa regime.
"The Police is independent now.
There is an Independent Police Commission now," Minister Kiriella said. "Nobody can order the Police. If that is so, it constitutes an offence."
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that the Police Commission is responsible for the recruitment, promotions and disciplinary actions, etc of the Police. "It does not control Police action, Dissnayake said. "The government is responsible for them."
At this stage, the Speaker stated that he had already made an announcement and should resume the business of the day. Opposition Member Dullas Alahapperuma requested the Speaker to inform the
authorities to make the Speaker aware if extra security is deployed. The Prime Minister stated that he would not speak about the powers of the Police or the Security forces. "But one should consider that two of our parliamentarians had been brutally killed during the last parliament," Premier said. "Our leaders too have been killed by the LTTE."
He also said those assassinations should be considered when statements are made when security is deployed around Parliament.
Chief Opp. Whip demands Black Book be tabled
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, demanded Minister Mangala Samaraweera to table the 'Black Book' prepared before the Presidential Poll in January, enlisting corrupt government officials.
The MP was presenting an adjournment motion on the controversies surrounding the Avant Garde investigations. He observed the 'black book' would expose the names of corrupt government officials on whom there are allegations of misusing colossal amounts of public money.
He charged that some of these officials are still bearing office in high positions under the present Government. Elucidating on a series of large scale corruption charges against the previous Government, Dissanayake accused the present Government of covering up those who were involved in those acts of corruption, fraud and other wrong doings.
"Many of the officials who were involved in corruption and fraud in the past years are holding ministerial and deputy ministerial posts.
Those who are accused of ethanol and drug business are also among them. With them in the government, how could we hope that thieves would be brought to book This Government continues with the deals of the previous regime.
This is against the people's wish. The people gave a mandate to bring these culprits to book and take over their illegally gotten wealth," he accused.
He went on to state that several ministers intervened to shield the retired Major Nissanka Senathipathi of the Avant Garde Company and that he met the President soon after the January elections. Referring to the Prime Minister's statement on Avant Garde, Dissanayake observed it had contradictory facts and charged that it was false.
Dissanayake said that Minister Vajira Abeywardena facilitated a meeting between Nissanka Senadhipathi and President Maithripala Sirisena on January 10, following the election results.
He further charged that the Prime Minister accompanied a businessman named "Thirukumar Nadeshan" when he went to Temple Trees to meet defeated President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the wee hours of January 9.
He also demanded to know to which court case ex-MP Sajin Vass Gunawardena had agreed to appear as a state witness and in which Magistrate's court he had made that statement.
"The public have a right to know the deal the Government has with the ex-MP. Why is he given MSD security" he asked.
Following the speech of Dissanayake, Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera, proposed to summon the IGP and Attorney General to Parliament to query on the matters raised.
Don't deport Kumar Gunaratnam - Dinesh
UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, asked the government not to deport Frontline Party Leader Kumar Gunaratnam from Sri Lanka.
Rising to a point of order, MP Gunawardena said that Gunaratnam had been arrested by the Kegalle Police and detained at the Kegalle Police station without an arrest warrant. "I direct the attention of the House to this urgent matter as relevant ministers are also present here.
We got to know that there are attempts to deport him.
He was born in Sri Lanka and is a Sri Lankan citizen.
He has abandoned his Australian citizenship for this purpose.
If he has done anything wrong, he can be dealt with under the laws of our county," he said.
Motion on Avant Garde investigations:
Speaker gives Chief Opp. Whip the nod
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, allowed Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake to move the adjournment motion on the Avant Garde investigations, observing that it did not obstruct the judicial process.
The Speaker made this observation following a point of order raised by the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, that matters raised in the motion could be under subjudice, stating that the Avant Garde matter is presently before the Galle Magistrate's Court.
"The next date of the hearing of this case has been fixed for February 25. Therefore this motion could affect the judicial process," he said. However, MPs Dissanayake and M A Sumanthiran observed that only a 'B' report had been sent to the Magistrate's court, adding that the motion is not a matter of subjudice. They requested the move to allow the motion be granted, it was of great public importance. The Speaker allowed the MP to move the motion, while asking him to be cautious to avoid things that could affect the judicial process.
CC decides implementation of Independent Councils soon
The Constitutional Council which met in Parliament yesterday, had decided to establish the other independent commissions proposed under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution without further delay.
The Council discussed the nominations of members for the independent commissions for which members have not yet been appointed. The council is to finalize them on its next meeting on November 6.
The members for the national police commission, human rights commission, public service commission and commission to investigate allegations of bribery and corruption, were appointed recently. The members are yet to be appointed to the elections commission, audit commission, finance commission, delimitation commission and the national procurement commission, etc. The council meeting was chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

Avant Garde Armoury case:
I stopped former Defence Secy. from being arrested
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stated that he stopped former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa from being arrested in connection with the Avant Garde floating armoury case.
He said in Parliament yesterday that he was in the position that Gotabhaya Rjapaksa should not be arrested in this connection. He added that he brought this matter to the notice of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He also added that they instructed him to act according to the law. He made these observations joining the adjournment debate on the Avant Garde floating armoury moved by Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
"Although some groups and the media had mistakenly published that the Attorney General said there was no evidence to prosecute anyone connected to Avant Garde for committing a crime, it is incorrect." Wijeyadasa Rajapaksh said.
"He said that there was no evidence to file cases under the Firearms Ordinance, the Prevention of Terrorism Act or the Explosives Act."
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the AG has said that there should be more investigations to ascertain whether money laundering charges could be brought against the Company. Hence, that matter had been referred to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The Minister further stated that the members who state that they have no faith in the Attorney General's Department and the Judiciary system again protests against foreign judges who come to inquire into allegations in Sri Lanka.
"It seems that those who speak against the judiciary and the Attorney General's Department, are involving themselves in an attempt to make a situation of anarchy in the country.
