Speakers talks on democracy, ludicrous
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya talking about democracy is ludicrous, former MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Addressing a press conference at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo yesterday, Alahapperuma said that only November 21 was listed on the Parliament calendar as a regular sitting day. Parliament was not scheduled to sit on any other day.
According to Alahapperuma, the peoples sovereignty has been dangerously challenged. There is no Order Paper for Parliament now and the contents of all court cases are severely distorted due to the activities of the Speaker and Parliament.
In 2004, a similar situation arose but UNP Speaker W.J.M. Lokubandara appointed the Parliament Business Committee without being biased. In 2015, UPFA Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa appointed the Parliament Business Committee without being biased. The people should be reminded about this past history, he said.
Alahapperuma pointed out that although the Executive President, Parliament and the countrys judiciary have 561 heads, the people are still supreme and their head count is 16 million. The people do not know about their power. The mass media should educate them about it.
MP Arundika Fernando said that the Government will ask the people of Sri Lanka for a mandate and the people will definitely give it to the Government. The people were eagerly waited to get rid of the UNP regime which made their lives very difficult.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa began providing relief to the people shortly after his appointment, he said.
MP Indika Anuruddha said that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa did not come from the back door and the UPFA did not snatch anybodys Government. Everything started to unfold with the publication of the COPE Report and President Maithripala Sirisena had forgiven the former Prime Minister on a number of occasions.
President Sirisena dissolved Parliament to provide an opportunity to the people to elect Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now the UNP is planning to hold rallies on democracy at every junction spending Rs.200 million. The Government did not send any MP to Singapore to obtain money. The UNP Government robbed the Central Bank in February 2015, a month after its election to office and brought in the 19th Amendment in April in order to boost the Sirikotha Account and prevent the Rajapaksa family from contesting elections.

APAC delegates in Colombo for largest gathering of Depositories
The 22nd Annual General Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Central Securities Depository Group (ACG) hosted by Central Depository Systems (Pvt) Ltd (CDS), a fully owned subsidiary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), commenced today in Colombo with delegates from 25 depositories and clearing organizations in participation.
The event breaks new ground for the Sri Lankan capital market as it marks the largest gathering of depositories and clearing organizations Sri Lanka has ever hosted. This annual gathering has been held for 21 consecutive years since 1997 and is the main event in the ACG calendar.
The event this year, is held on the theme FinTech  shifting or shaping the future of CSDs and will discuss areas such as the future direction of CSDs, embracing technological change and the outlook of the CSD Industry with a specific focus on considerations for Asia-Pacific (APAC). China, Japan, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Bhutan, Nepal, Iran, Taiwan, Cambodia, Thailand, Bangladesh and Hong Kong are represented at the event.
Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, speaking on FinTech and its implications on the financial services industry stated Whether an industry is shifting or shaping because of FinTech largely depends on where the industry is. If it is not digitized, FinTech will shift it. You will see that some jobs will be replaced along with trading patterns. If not, FinTech can concurrently both shift and reshape the industry depending on where it envisions itself. The most important factor is for the sector and the region to have a clear view of what outcome it wants through FinTech. It must not be done because it is fashionable. FinTech must be used to solve issues and open new vistas, expand business and benefit from the new types of interconnectivity it offers.
SEC Chairman Mr. Ranel T. Wijesinha speaking at the event congratulated CDS Sri Lanka for hosting the 22nd ACG AGM and stated that the SEC is deeply committed to providing the assistance and support that is necessary for CDS Sri Lanka to play a larger role in the ACG and in the international stage. Sharing his remarks on FinTech, Mr. Wijesinha stated that embracing technology remains to be a key priority for capital markets around the world, and also went on to outline the importance of strongly considering all risk management aspects when implementing innovative technologies.

Bond scam suspect list out soon - Minister Lakshman Yapa
Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said the government was in the process of releasing a list of names of individuals of officials and politicians who have been implicated in the Bond scam.
Once this list comes out next week, many of these politicians who are crying foul over the Constitution will have to eat humble pie because of their connection to the Bond Scam, he said. Its only a matter of time before this list is out in public, he told a news conference at the SLPP party headquarters that SLPP members may continue to boycott parliamentary sittings due to legality of the proceedings, as there is a case before courts.
Since there is a case before Supreme Courts and Parliament was dissolved through a directive issued by the President, a question arises regarding the legality of the sittings, he said. One also wonders if the decisions taken by Parliament are legally binding.
He added that the party stance was to forge ahead for the elections rather than to drag the process by way of these parliamentary proceedings.
MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said the public was aware of the fissures within the UNP because it was obvious that the party was having an internal crisis.
Harin Fernando told the media that a young person should be given the opportunity to lead the party or hold a leadership position, to which Ranil Wickremasinghe replied stating that it would only happen in 2020. On the other hand there are members like Navin Dissanayake, Thalatha Athukorale and Sujeewa Senasinghe cheering on for Sajith Premadasa to be appointed to lead the UNP, he said. How can members of the UNP speak of the countrys democracy when there isnt a semblance of democracy within their own party
MP Abeywardena said that there had been an issue pertaining to the pension rights of Samurdhi officers. It was at this point that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa proposed the setting up of the Divi Neguma Fund, however the government changed and the Yahapalana regime took no notice of the concerns of these Samurdhi workers, he said.
Within the first few weeks of this new government assuming office, we are thankful to Wimal Weerawansa for paving way for these workers to receive their rightful welfare benefits and monies, he said.
He added that an event is to be held at the Sugathadasa Stadium where nearly 4,000 such workers will receive confirmation of their contracts, while the others who have vacated their positions will receive their gratuity and other benefits which they were denied off for the last three years.
The MPs also denied that police informant Namal Kumara and Amith Weerasinghe would be given nominations from the SLPP. The SLPP will not give nominations to individuals with such tainted reputations. It is clear that both individuals do not have the integrity or repute to be members of the SLPP. The SLPP will not give out memberships like handouts to individuals who have been embroiled in court cases, conspiracies and crimes.

Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne appeares before the Colombo Fort Magistrates
Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne appeared before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court a short while ago.
He appeared before courts over the hearing of the abduction of 11 youths.
The former Navy Commander is accused of shielding a navy officer allegedly responsible for abductions and killings.
Police recently told the court the admiral had protected Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, a navy intelligence officer who is the main suspect in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths between 2008 and 2009.

Chief of Defence Staff fails to report to CID
Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne failed to report to the CID yesterday, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekera told Daily News.
The CDS was informed to report to the CID to record a statement for allegedly harbouring Lieutenant Commander Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath, who is implicated in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youth in 2008-9.
Admiral Wijegunaratne was summoned before courts in September but he had left the country to participate in the Mexicos 28th Independence Day Celebrations.
He was summoned to give a statement on the abduction of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009. The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had ordered the CID to take arrest the former Navy Commander and CDS on August 29 if there is sufficient evidence to prove that he had aided and abetted Navy Officer Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath to abscond the magisterial inquiry into the disappearance of 11 youths.
The CID arrested Navy Sampath on Lotus Road in Colombo on August 13. He had been in hiding employed as a security guard at an estate using fake identity card.
Sufficient evidence was there to arrest the CDS for aiding the main suspect to evade arrest but he had to first report to the CID for a statement.
This was the second time he was summoned to the CID, but did not report to record his statement.
The media reported that Admiral Wijegunaratne was willing to reveal the truth before court as a responsible senior military officer, as he claims that he has never committed any wrong intentionally.

IGP UNDER probe
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) conducting the probe into the alleged assassination plot of President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, will begin investigations on the allegations made against the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujitha Jayasundara.
He is said to have taken back the cheque of Rs. 500,000 given to police informant Namal Kumara with a reprimand to stop forthwith all that said and done in respect of the alleged assassination plot. According to the complaint Namal Kumara had made to the CID about the assassination plan, on a day in September this year, he (Namal Kumara) had gone to the Police headquarters with the former DIG Nalaka de Silva to receive money, a gift given by the Police in the presence of several police officers and photographers. The IGP handed over the cheque to Namal Kumara, and had taken back the cheque with a dire warning to stop forthwith, all that was said and done in respect of the alleged assassination plot.
In his complaint to the CID, he had referred to incident and had said that he had thought the IGP, assuming that he (Namal) was ready to disclose all relevant information of the alleged assassination plot, he was given a strong warning against disclosing anything about the assassination plot. He never expected a warning of this sort and felt rather disturbed and uneasy, Namal Kumara in his complaint to the CID had said.
In his complaint Namal Kumara had said that the alleged cheque was written to ex-DIG Nalaka de Silvas name and not to his (Namals) name.
The information Namal Kumara had given to the CID, with regard to the alleged assassination plot, includes names of two politicians and names of two State officials. He has also said that although not connected to the plot, one other politician had the knowledge of the assassination. Although I did not get the envelop containing the plan and advice to go about the assassination plan, all that contain in his phone, which has gone erased. the said phone has by now sent to overseas.
There is also a plan to disclose name of another person at a meeting scheduled to be held on December 5 at Maha Oya Ampara, which Namal Kumara has not so far referred to in the CID statement. It is claimed that the person whose name is to be disclosed is still working as a state official.
The organiser of the said meeting has sought police protection.

Speaker creating  renewed conflict - Minister
The Speaker is going to great extremes to create a fresh conflict between Parliament and the Judiciary while the Government is demonstrating its complete respect for the Judiciary, following all court orders, Public Administration, Home Affairs and Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
Addressing a press conference at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo yesterday he said that from November 14th onwards, the Speaker had been violating court orders, the constitution, the standing orders and traditions.
He is acting without an Order Paper. Anything connected to court cases cannot be discussed in Parliament.
Therefore, the Opposition cannot debate the validity of the Prime Minister, the Cabinet in Parliament after filing court cases.
Minister Premajayantha said nobody knows which Standing Orders were suspended on November 14th and 16th. The President rejected the so called no confidence motion that was claimed to be passed in Parliament. If the first preamble in it is removed there is no existence of the second one because they are connected to each other, he said.
The Minister said that according to the present Sri Lankan Constitution, the President can call a Presidential Election after January 9,2019 only if he wishes to contest. A new President will not be able to solve the issue of the current Parliament because no political party has the majority in it. A new President cannot dissolve Parliament until March 2020 if the arguments in the 19th Amendment is to be accepted.
If UPFA MPs cross over, the President can refrain from offering them Cabinet Ministerial positions and they can be removed from Parliament after holding a disciplinary inquiry. The people are sovereign and they have the right to select their representatives. If my representative does not act according to my wishes, I can remover him or her and appoint another.There is no argument about that, he added.

UNP Chairman threatening media - Minister
Port and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday strongly condemned the letter sent to all media institutions by UNP Chairman Kabir Hashim.
The Minister said that UNPers who are crying for democracy are now threatening media institutions.
Quoting from the letter, Minister Samarasinghe said; Incorrect reporting of the current political situation in the country must be corrected immediately.
This is particularly important to safeguard your organization from law suits and other civil actions in light of the Hansards of November 15 and 16 confirming the absence of a legitimate government in Sri Lanka.
In his letter Hashim further stated; The positions of Prime Minister, Minister, Deputy Minister, State Minister, Leader of the House, Chief Government Whip no longer exists. It is therefore inaccurate to refer to any Member of Parliament as Minister or Prime Minister. I trust we can count on your organisation to refrain from carrying content referring to MPs using positional terms that do not exist.
Responding to the letter, Minister Samarasinghe said the position of Prime Minister has been duly gazetted by the President and the Cabinet of Ministers and the institutions coming under the ministries have also been gazetted.
He further said that if anyone feels that their fundamental rights have been violated as a result of this gazette they can seek redress at the Supreme Court. But none of them had challenged these gazette notifications in the Supreme Court.
The Cabinet of Ministers are currently engaged in their ministerial work and we are also taking all the decisions that need to be taken. It is questionable why the UNP is trying to influence these media institutions highlighting on some decisions included in the Hansard after conducting a voice vote, he added.
He said the UNP Chairman should think twice before signing a letter like this.

UPFA calls Speakers bluff
The UPFA has submitted a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya requesting him not to publicise Hansard reports of the propeedings in Parliament on November 14, 15, 16, 19, 21 and 23 since they are not legally acceptable.
In the letter, the UPFA has stated that the sessions on the above mentioned dates were not held according to the Constitution and Standing Orders; hence those sessions are not legal.
The UPFA held a press brief at Parliament premises yesterday to elaborate on the matter, where Ministers Dinesh Gunawardena, Nimal Siripala de Silva, S.B. Dissanayake and Wimal Weerawansa spoke.
The Government group met and discussed Parliament affairs yesterday with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa heading the meeting.We informed him of our decision to boycott Parliament sessions until the Speaker operates under the Constitution and Standing Orders. Today also there was no Order paper. The Speaker is acting on his own accord. This has now become a Sirikotha meeting. Parliament now sits violating the Standing Orders.We are a group of MPs who refuse to heed the Speakers erroneous decisions.We demand that he comes back to the right track, Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Whatever the party we are in, we have to act according to the Constitution.We shall not accept anything done violating the Constitution. The President has also informed the Speaker to act according to the Constitution and correct the resolutions passed against the lawful procedure. Parliament sits without Standing Orders or an Order paper. There was no Party Leaders Meeting as well. We cannot bow down to these actions. All these actions violate the Constitution and Standing Orders. Until the Speaker starts acting according to the Constitution, we shall not participate in Parliament sessions, Gunawardena said.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said Parliament is not a place to act according to personal whims and fancies.
There should be a ruling party and an Opposition in the House. But the Speaker is only acting with the Opposition.There is no ruling party, Prime Minister or a Cabinet present. So how come Parliament sits Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has utterly destroyed Parliament traditions, De Silva said.
Considering these stubborn decisions taken by the Speaker we wonder if he is acting sanely or not. He should either seek medical treatment or should come back to his senses and start respecting Parliamentary traditions and customs. There is nothing in the Order papers. There is no mention about adjourning Parliament at least.This way, one can even hold sessions until the next morning. The Speaker is acting naively. We cannot support these actions. We are boycotting Parliament against Speakers hidden agenda. If the Speaker appointed the Selection Committee, it should meet and carry out its operations. Before Parliament sits, the Selection Committee should meet and discuss about agendas, De Silva furthered.
We are telling the Speaker to come back to the correct track and accept the government. He should stop playing favourites . This Speaker has committed errors that no other Speaker in the world has ever committed. He has even distorted the Hanzard. We have requested him not to make the Hanzard reports on 14, 15, 16, 19 and 21 public. We will also handover affidavits rejecting these reports, De Silva also said.
S. B. Dissanayake speaking to media pointed out that neither the UNP nor Ranil Wickremesinghe has sought legal action against the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. Just because they got a no confidence motion passed in the House, the Speaker is claiming that there is no governing party or a Prime Minister. These Parliament sittings, Hanzard reports are illegal. Our Parliament has become a joke to the world. Speaker has no right to act like this in Parliament. Dissanayake furthered.
Wimal Weerawansa pointed out that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is carrying out a propaganda to promote the illegal course of actions taken by Wickremesinghe and Sumanthiran.
Former CJ Shirani Bandaranayake husband was penalised for acting illegally like this, when he had no power to act as a Chairman in a State Bank. He was acting without any vested power and used public property. Speaker Jayasuriya will be treated in the same way. The Speaker is preparing the Hanzard according to his personal preference. He is violating Parliament traditions and bringing a motion to deprive Prime Minister Rajapaksa of his expenses. If such a motion is brought in, the Cabinet should approve it beforehand. When we were in the Opposition, we asked for our rightful place to lead the Opposition. But he gave it to Sampanthan who only had 16 heads in Parliament. What kind of democracy was practiced when he took that decision Now that Ranil Wickremesinghe has lost his position, all these people have come together, Weerawansa pointed out. If Wickremesinghe bows down to democracy, there will be no rebellion within the party itself for the leadership, Weerawansa said.
Whichever the foreign forces who may try to pressurise us we shall not back down. We changed a government that was journeying towards destroying this country. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike took a similar decision, but the JVP did not question this on that occasion. The foreign forces are using the Speaker as a puppet to realise their own agendas, Weerawansa further said.
