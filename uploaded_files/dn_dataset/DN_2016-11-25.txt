Need to create competition for special players
Greetings islanders and traditional fans who have stayed loyal to their original clubs and colours... its a stretch to expect a new generation of loyalty...as much has changed from those intense, emotional partisan days.
Longden Place the CR cauldron, Havelock Park the Havies walled fortress, Police Park, the blue shirts and the best running surface in town, Army have moved home a few times along Galle Face, and now have their own stadium in Diyagama...Air Force settling for their new manicured pitch at Ratmalana - 80 mins between choppers and aircraft traffic is tougher than you think ...check with Kandy if you harbour doubts. The Navy extends another gladiator arena in Welisera ...inside the naval base and pressure for all visitors.
Finally the CH, my old club and perhaps the most challenging prospect with the cricket square slap bang in the middle ...and need to adapt fairly sharpies...and then of course, Kandy's Nittawela arena of pain, that test mind body, skill and courage, every time we travel up through the rock passage at Kadugannawa.
The season is still young and much has happened to re-examine form, match fitness and strategy for the biggest stables in Sri.....Navy getting past CR, closing them down and strong in the loose plus solid in the set scrums too. A result that has opened the eyes of all the other teams...and given Navy a reputation as a powerful unit. Their big boiler house forwards, really stamping their mark on the day. Good to see a pack dominate play and 15s rugby is all about the pack ...vital for us all in the backs ...is good clean ball to run. Starve the opposition of possession and you cut their oxygen supply.
Games can be decided only on ball protection and running metres....tackle power power, the critical inbuilt terminator effect, the difference between very solid teams and those aspiring to be contenders.
Strong teams will generally be able to weather the worst and still bounce back, the team might need some prep; to adjust...essentially play badly, but still pocket the W...plus coaching of course .Kandys loss to Air Force was a great reminder of not being presumptuous and expecting players to put their hands up and do the job anyway. The Kandy management are demanding consistency ...lets see how it translates.
Last week for the Dialog league, pretty much all games, ran to form ...Air Force beat Police, Havelocks outlasted CR, under lights and just limped home 10/6 ...to keep their tournament hopes open.
Navy......ran 50 points past the CH at Welisera and may well get better and stronger as the season turns for the 2nd round.
Player management and professional services seem to be a crying need for the business of playing rugby ...particularly with the national rep players on recovery from surgery etc... the Union need to contract the top flyers and create a system of performance contracts for those elite players, perhaps a two tier contract based on tours and national games
We need to create competition for those special players who earn their national caps - there must be value to being chosen for your flag and subsequently a system with legal contracts to protect players welfare through their time at the top.
Young talent just showing their wings and colours at school level, can safely aspire and push for those tough tour slots ...selections will attract the absolute best for the jersey...and give the national selectors, plenty of choice for those slots, that traditionally cause volumes of discussion prior to the final squad list.
All my playing days ...which extend a few weeks short of 13 seasons for the national jersey, were never in total agreement with those national selectors ...who seemed more like gremlins with big sickles and grim hoods ..
Selections were always bloody affairs ...knowing your contender and fighting for your slot. Longden Place was that designated venue of pain ...and only years later, did I manage to change that as the chairman of selectors, insisting that my team went down to the grounds and actually interacted with the national squads, shared ideas and generally put all players at ease and encouraged pride and belief for our flag.
The Dialog league is the real tester for endurance, strength, courage and team spirit ...it does tax the mind and body to its max and has a wonderful ability to create weekends of total performance and joy ....!
Defending champions Kandy and coach Sean will be hoping to wipe the Air Force blimp off the Kandy radar ...a step up beating a fit Army side by 34 points, and plenty to do in the weeks ahead.
Air Force on the other side have shocked their fans and handed Police another shock last Friday ...exceptional for the team morale and fabulous for that group of young contenders.
Expectations are enormously high for the remaining first round matches, and I am delighted that many experts and pundits have been shocked and confused with the results so far ...the game needs spice and surprises, it needs a few jolts and impact tackles to wake the media and disbelievers up ....and the Dialog league 1st round has certainly done just that.
Enjoy the weekend clashes as the warriors confront each other in the middle......
Will Kandys loss be the only one or will Havelocks craft another famous victory when they clash.
Mouth watering prospects for islanders to absorb and savour.
Cheers fans and followers of this wonderful code from 1 to 93.

Spain take early lead in World Cup
Melbourne Thursday: A miraculous putt from Rafa Cabrera Bello on the 18th green gave Spain the leadafter a challenging opening round of the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne Thursday.
Cabrera Bello and his youthful team-mate Jon Rahm executed a flawless game plan in the blustery conditions, which made foursomes -- alternate shot -- play difficult for the two-man teams at Kingston Heath. With only six countries returning scores under par, the Spanish combination took a one-shot lead over the USA, France and China -- courtesy of the late birdie that resulted from Cabrera Bello's snaking 15-foot putt.
Rahm drove the ball magnificently and Cabrera Bello did the rest around the greens as the pair gelled well to notch a three-under par 69 ahead of Friday's fourballs.
Cabrera Bello said he could not believe his last putt had dropped.
I thought I had holed it, then it looked like it was going to miss right and then, I don't know how, maybe someone upstairs put some backspin on it to go in the hole, the two-time European Tour winner said.
Spain will be grouped on the second day with France whose Victor Dubuisson and Romain Langasque returned a two-under par round of 70. AFP

Messi bags double as Barca see off Celtic
GLASGOW: Lionel Messi hit a brace as he returned to the Barcelona line-up to help book their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a comfortable 2-0 win at Celtic on Wednesday.
Messi, who missed Saturdays goalless draw with Malaga due to illness, provided a fine finish to Neymars lofted pass to hand the Spanish champions a 24th-minute lead in Glasgow.
The Barcelona captain, who grabbed a hat-trick in the 7-0 mauling in the reverse fixture in the Camp Nou, then converted a 56th-minute penalty won by Luis Suarez to see his side top Group C with 12 points from five games.
Manchester Citys draw with Borussia Monchengladbach in the groups other match also sees the English side through and means Celtic cant pip the Germans to third spot due to their inferior head-to-head record.
It was quite a hard game and we expected Celtic to come out and make it difficult, said Barcelona manager Luis Enrique.
We were good at the back and we got better as the game went on. It was a very difficult group and its great to finish first with a game to spare. Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers felt his side had improved significantly from their hammering in the Camp Nou, although their European adventures are over for another year.
I was proud of the team tonight. We looked like we played without any fear and we pressed the game well, Rodgers said.
If we take some of our chances then it might have been a different game but we showed a vast improvement, which is important. Apart from the injured Andres Iniesta, Barcelona named their strongest 11 as Suarez and Messi returned from suspension and illness respectively to form their formidable partnership with Neymar in the Barca attack.
Sublime Messi
Celtic didnt allow the visitors time on the ball as they pressed high up the pitch early on.
However, Barcelona began to probe at the Celtic defence with Mikel Lustig looking particularly vulnerable to the runs of Jordi Alba and Neymar.
The Brazilian was first to burst into the Celtic box and teed up Messi with a back-heel and the Argentines deflected shot had Craig Gordon scrambling across his line before it was cleared.
Alba was then the provider as his cross from the left found Ivan Rakitic lurking in the box but the Croatian international sent his header bouncing into the turf and over the bar.
Celtic failed to heed the warning signs and Barca soon had a deserved lead.
Neymar, who learned earlier in the day that Spanish prosecutors were seeking a two-year jail sentence and 10-million-euro fine for his part in his allegedly fraudulent transfer to Barca, was given space to play a wonderful lofted pass to Messi, who crashed a sublime shot on the half-volley in off the near post.
The hosts tried to respond and had their first shot on target in the 37th minute when Moussa Dembele stung the palms of Marc Andre ter Stegen with a fierce strike.
Only a superb save from Gordon stopped Suarez from adding a second before the break as he blocked a point-blank header from the Uruguayan international with his body.
Celtic lost Scott Sinclair to injury at the break but his replacement James Forrest created Celtics best opportunity when he picked out Dembele with a cross but the in-form French forward sent a tame header straight to ter Stegen.
It was to prove costly as Barcelona doubled their advantage moments later. Suarez got on the wrong side of Emilio Izaguirre and the Celtic defender hauled him to the ground to earn a penalty that Messi sent straight down the middle to score his 502nd goal for the Catalan giants. Neymar was fortunate to escape with just a booking, which will see him miss the final group game, as he pushed Lustig to the turf after the players clashed, with the Brazilian international subbed moments later.
