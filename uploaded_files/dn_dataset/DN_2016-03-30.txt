Constitution making a collective effort: PM
Making of the Constitution is a collective effort and there will be no separate drafts from the UNP or the UPFA, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of 'Seminar on Constitutionalism' organised by
the Parliament of Sri Lanka with USAID support, at Waters Edge Hotel, Battaramulla.
The Prime Minister said unlike in the making of the first and second Republican Constitutions when the ruling party enjoyed a two thirds majority, no party has a two thirds majority in the current Parliament.
He added that a national government was formed with the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena to fulfill the people's aspirations to introduce a Constitution that strengthens democracy, unity and rights of the people.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out the powers of Executive and Legislature should be clearly defined in the new Constitution, adding that President Sirisena had expressed his willingness to give more powers to Parliament.
He said the entire Parliament has now been integrated to the Constitution making process by forming a Constitutional Assembly, adding that the Steering Committee for the purpose would be appointed on April 5. The Premier expressed his confidence that a new Constitution would be finalised by 2017 when the Sri Lanka Parliament celebrates it's 70th anniversary.
"Upholding the people's sovereignty and rule of law are key factors that should be kept in mind when making the new Constitution. The Constitution making will go ahead as of the public opinions gathered by the Public Representations Committee. Discussions are on among Party leaders on an electoral reform based on mixed member proportional system. This is the central focus of constitutional amendments," he said.
He said power sharing and decentralisation should also be considered in a manner that suits the country avoiding any harm to the unitary character.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said his endeavour is to empower the Committee system in Parliament and thereby integrate all groups in Parliament for the governance of the country.
He added that Parliament should take the initiative in deciding what the people need in the Constitution, while studying the models in other countries.
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap commended the steps taken by the government to protect and promote civil rights of the people including freedom of expression and rule of law.
He said the government is faced with more challenges in the spheres on reconciliation and accountability.
Keshap assured US support to build a stronger democracy and future prosperity, and said it is ready to partner with the government to carry out oversight responsibilities on public service to make them more effective.

The Court of Appeal yesterday permitted Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Central Committee member Premakumar Gunaratnam to file written submissions in connection with the writ petition filed by him, seeking an order that he be given Sri Lankan citizenship in accordance with the Citizenship Act.
The petition was re-fixed for support on May 24 by Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena.
The petitioner stated that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is yet to consider his application submitted to obtain the citizenship of Sri Lanka, without any reasonable ground.

Through his writ petition, Gunaratnam had cited Internal Affairs Minister S.B.Navinna, the Controller of Immigration and Emigration and Attorney General as respondents.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Counsel Sudath Caldera appearing for the petitioner moved Court that a Writ of Mandamus order be issued on the Minister of Internal Affairs to consider his clients application for resumption of citizenship.
Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the petition cannot be maintained since there is no reasonable ground to issue such an order.
The DGS further submitted to Court that the petitioner has violated the provision of the Immigration and Emigration Act after over staying in the country through a fake passport.
Kumar Gunaratnam is presently under remand at the Kegalle remand prison. He is an Australian citizen and arrived in Sri Lanka on January 1, 2015.

No foreign influence in constitution making process: Speaker
Parliament will never allow foreign influence in the constitution making exercise, although it welcomes the technical assistance extended by those countries, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
He was addressing the inauguration of the 'Seminar on Constitutionalism' organised by Parliament with the USAID support at the Waters' Edge Hotel in Battaramulla yesterday.
The Speaker who said the government was ready to expand their knowledge on constitution making by learning from the experiences of other democratic countries, assured those present that the final output would be a homegrown one that best fits the country.
He said the USA, Germany, UK, Canada and many other countries have expressed willingness to extend support to Sri Lanka in making the new constitution, and that the UNDP would coordinate the process. "We will not hesitate to take all of their friendly assistance while being careful at the same time," he noted. He also said the constitution making exercise is not limited to one political party. "It is a historic duty and responsibility vested on each and every MP in Parliament. If one is not participating in this task, he is neglecting this duty," he said.
Commenting on the progress achieved over the past 7 months under the present government, the Speaker said many steps have been taken to strengthen democracy in the country. "We were able to appoint independent commissions through the Constitutional Council. The appointments were basically done by the civil society members in the Council without any political interference.
The bodies such as the COPE and Public Accounts Committee are performing their roles with new vigour and enthusiasm unlike before. A new system was facilitated to directly ask questions from the Prime Minister. Oversight Committees have begun work and will complet it soon. The Right to Information Bill was presented in Parliament," the Speaker said.

Sri Lanka stuns South Africa in women's match

Sri Lanka ended the league phase in the ICC Women's World Twenty20 2016 with a 10-run win over South Africa in Bengaluru on Monday that enabled the Islanders to finish third in Group A.
Sri Lanka, which managed just 114 for seven after electing to bat, fought back to restrict the favoured South Africans for 104 at the Chinnaswamy stadium.
Sri Lanka's captain Chamari Atapattu led from the front with 52, but none of the other team-mates managed to cross 20 as Marizanne Kapp and Sune Luus picked up two wickets each.
South Africa's openers Dane van Niekerk and Trisha Chetty replied with 50 for no loss by the ninth over before the rest of the batting collapsed against the steady Sri Lankan bowling.
Atapattu had a hand in two of the first three dismissals which reduced South Africa to 52 for three, running out Van Niekerk for 24 before claiming rival skipper Mignon du Pleez leg-before for no score.
At the other end, Eshani Lokusuriyage trapped Chetty leg-before for 26 to open up the middle order.
Sugandika Kumari claimed two for 24 and Udeshika Prabodhani took two for 13 as the rest of the batting floundered to hand the Sri Lankan women their second win in four league matches. Atapattu, who was named player of the match, said she was delighted her team was able to finish the tournament on a high.
"I am proud of my girls," she said, dedicating the award to her father who encouraged her to play cricket.
"We were not able to put up a good total, but the bowlers and fielders did well. I knew our bowlers had the potential to restrict South Africa.
"We may not be in the semi-finals but this tournament has taught us a lot of positive things which will help us in future."
Sri Lanka Women 114-7 in 20 overs (Chamari Atapattu 52, Prasadani Weerakkody 15, Eshani Kaushalya 12 n.o., Marizanne Kapp 2/17, Sune Luus 2/20)
South Africa Women 104-7 in 20 overs (Dane van Niekerk 24, Trisha Chetty 26, Sugandika Kumari 2/24, Udeshika Prabodhani 2/13)

Two finely honed teams meet for a place in the final
DELHI: New Zealand who has never reached the final of a World Twenty20 tournament will be looking forward to doing so when they meet 2010 champions England in the first semi-final of the 2016 World T20 at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Wednesday.
In the group matches New Zealand have performed like a well oiled machine reading the sub continent conditions and the pitches so well that they have got the better of all their opponents to be the only team to come through the qualifying stages unscathed.
On that record alone New Zealand could consider themselves as favourites to beat England. However captain Kane Williamson was pretty optimistic about his team's chances. "In terms of my perspective and the coach's we will pick horses for courses against the opposition. That philosophy won't change. In terms of favourites I think it's impossible to give someone a favourite tag in T-20 cricket," said Williamson at the pre-match press conference.
"The nature of this game is such that any given team that plays best wins. Anyone can beat anyone. Going into the tournament both pools were very strong and everyone had the desire to go and believed they could. Here we are for the knockout game and the guys are looking forward to it."
Williamson said that he was aware of the threat that England possess to his team.
"I am not surprised at all. Having played bit of county cricket, I have seen all these guys quite a lot. How good players they are. They are a big threat," said Williamson.

"We saw that in the ODI series that we played in England. When I saw the team on paper I knew it will be a tough challenge, you need to play tough cricket. I am not surprised that they are in the semi-finals. There are so many good cricketers in that country you try to improve as a side England have done that and they are very much contenders."
England have a slight advantage on the pitch and conditions having played their last two group games against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka at Delhi, whereas for New Zealand they have played all over India.
"I suppose England have been fortunate to play in these conditions a couple of times, but in T-20 anything can happen," said Williamson. "Coming into this tournament in both pools each team was confident that they will go all the way. I am sure England is no different. We have seen more of India than most opposition's. It's one of those things just happened by coincidence. Guys have just embraced the flights and enjoyed the variety of hotels."
Williamson said that he was going with an open-minded approach to the semi-finals.
"My perspective I am trying to do the best job I can with many other leaders who assist us. It's important to come up with sound game plans and ultimately it's up to the players to execute those plans. We have done that so well in this tournament. Going into this tournament, it's a big exciting game," Williamson said.
England captain Eoin Morgan rated New Zealand as the team that has played the best cricket in the group stages and is looking ahead for a tough game.
"We've got a tough game tomorrow against a really strong New Zealand side, which have played probably the best cricket of the group stages. So we're going to have to come up with a very strong game of cricket tomorrow to beat them," said Morgan.
"We've come into this tournament with an open-mindedness about the conditions we're coming up against, and that'll be no different tomorrow. We're playing on a fresh wicket which has a really good covering of grass. It's changed over the last few games a little bit."
"We've become quite settled in Delhi, and it's been good to us. We've had fantastic support and following. Ultimately we've grown used to the pitch a lot more than the first game we were here, which was probably a little bit drier," he said.
Having been in two semi-finals before Morgan said what England had learnt is that in getting to the knockout stage in any tournament means that you have done the hard work.
"It is almost now that you have earned a licence to go out and express yourself as much as you can. To me that attitude means getting the best out of yourself. If you have guys coming out who are very relaxed about performing and performing on the big stage that takes a lot of weight off your shoulders," Morgan said.
"The guys that we've selected have done outstandingly well and shown a great amount of attitude in learning. It's not always easy to come up against very strong sides who knock you back on a day-to-day basis, but every question that's been asked of us we've come back with either a counter-answer or a more aggressive option," he said.
The two sides have played each other in 13 T20Is with England winning eight, New Zealand four and one no-result.
