Are they human
Strike during dengue crisis:
unprecedented action to be taken:
GMOA acting as a political party:
Minister Rajitha Senarathne yesterday said that the Government would take stern and unprecedented action against the striking Doctors. Addressing a media briefing held at the Government information Department, the Minister of Health said that he intends taking action, which had no precedent.
As a trade union leader I havent take action against any trade unions during the past. But this time it would be different he said.
He said that the masses are currently suffering a dengue epidemic and that they cannot condone with the actions of the Doctors given the dire situation faced by patients.
He questioned as to if the striking Doctors were actually human, given the fact that the Trade Union action was taken during a health crisis.
Students against the establishing of the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) stormed the premises of the Health Ministry last evening damaging property and holding officials hostage.
Senarathne said that it was ironic that students who damaged the property of the Health Minsitry had gone to the National Hospital managed by the same ministry for treatment.
The Minister further said that 16 vehicles were damaged during the ruckus and that the damages are estimated to be in the millions.
He further said that the renovation of the damaged property would be undertaken by the the Health Ministry through its budget, and that the funds should have instead been utilised for the benefit of the poverty ridden patients.
He further said that the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) was playing the role of a political party and not a Trade Union.
Senarathne speaking further said that lectures for medical students were to commence on the 26th of June and that it was unfortunate that the studentsn resorted to such heinous conduct.

Health Ministry rioters should be punished
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said legal action should be taken against undergraduates who destroyed public resources of the Health Ministry after entering it forcefully and illegally.
The State Minister was addressing media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters.
He added that anyone has a right to protest but no one has the right to destroy public resources. Legal action should be taken against the undergraduates responsible for causing damages, after analysing the CCTV footage,he said.
The State Minister said that he is against SAITM but the behaviour of the undergraduates and Government Medical Officers Association in connection with SAITM cannot be accepted.
SAITM came from the back door. It should have come from the front door Therefore, I oppose it. However, the way the GMOA behaves cannot be accepted.The respect for the profession is destroyed by the way the GMOA behaves, he added.
I am for private universities including private medical faculties. But they should be created the proper way he added.

WTOs Trade Facilitation Agreement game changer for intl trade
The World Trade Organizations (WTO), Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) which came into force on February 22 will be a game changer for international trade and local businesses engaging in imports and exports will be the main beneficiary of improved efficiency of border administrative procedures, Sri Lanka Shippers Council said.
TFA came into force with the ratification of two- thirds of WTO members and some estimates suggest that implementing trade facilitation reforms can bring bigger benefits for global businesses than tariff liberalization. TFA contains provisions for expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods, including goods in transit.
It also sets out measures for effective cooperation between customs and other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues. It further contains provisions for technical assistance and capacity building.
Developing countries like Sri Lanka can divide implementation of the agreement into three categories.
Accordingly under the category A , the member will implement provisions by the time the agreement enters into force or in the case of a least developed country within one year after entry into force.
Under the category B, the member will implement provisions after a transitional period following the entry into force of the agreement, while under the category C, member will implement provisions on a date after a transitional period following the entry into force of the agreement and requiring the acquisition of assistance and support for capacity building.
Sri Lanka has already submitted its category A commitments.
The Sri Lankan government has to implement these immediately without waiting for the full two year period allowed under the TFA, as it will boost the economys competitiveness.
The country is expected to provide Category Band C commitments soon.
When submitting what the country will do under category B, the government first has to give indicative dates of implementation and within one year has to provide definitive dates of implementation.
Sri Lanka being country , where implementation of policies, promises by government remains weak , the council says the TFA provides a trading community with a good opportunity to lock in implementation dates.

4revers refreshing endeavour!
Beauty care brand 4rever came forward this season with a CSR programme that benefited thousands of pilgrims who ascend Sri Padaya. The objective of this project is to allow pilgrims to refresh themselves on their way to the summit of the sacred shrine. In that regard, 30 shower cubicles have been installed; 15 for men and 15 for women with the patronage of 4rever.
This bathing facility at Seethagangula served to add to the Sri Pada experience as, since time immemorial, people have stopped to refresh themselves at the said location during their ascent. The cubicles offer pilgrims safe and clean water for the purpose of bathing and changing facilities that are built to provide and protect privacy.
The water is drawn from an unpolluted source, upstream of Seethagangula. The bathing booth was installed accordingly to spare pilgrims of the hassle of having to go in search of clean water outlets that is not polluted with plastic or broken glass scattered everywhere. The booths facilitate a safe shower in every conceivable sense for the old and young pilgrims alike. It also minimized the impact on the natural beauty of the immediate vicinity by regularly cleaning the area under the constant monitoring of local authorities. The programme was conducted during the total duration of the pilgrimage season, which spreaded for six months, Uduvap Poya to Vesak poya.
The bathing facility provides free 4rever Hibiscus -Conditioning & Lunuwila-Anti-dandruff- shampoo samples to all pilgrims. The environs closer to the bathing booth were also fully illuminated at night for the benefit & safety of the pilgrims.
Commenting on the project, 4rever Skin Naturals founder & chairperson, Chandani Bandara said,As a company that is close to nature and is benefitting from it, I think of conserving the same as a part of our duty and responsibility. We consider it a blessing and a privilege to be able to be of service in some way, the little way we can, to the thousands of pilgrims ascending Sri Padaya.

Akila denies Dambulla Viharaya takeover talk
Education Miniaster Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday denied allegations that the government was going to takeover the Rangiri Dambulla Rajamaha Viyaraya and instead revealed that they were taking action to curb corruption within the famed Buddhist temple.
The Chief Incumbent of the Rangiri Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya, Ven. Dr. Godagama Sri Mangala Thera addressing the media on Wednesday (21) had alleged that the Minister was trying to take over the temple and merely turn it into a tourist attraction. The Ven Thera of the temple, which is attached to the Asgiriya Chapter, accused the Minister of attacking the Sangha.
Ven. Mangala Thera last year asked me to investigate into the malpractices and corruption which has been going on for sometime within the temple and we have found that there are serious problems in the figures . So I do not understand why he has changed his stance now said the Minister addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha.
He added that on an inspection of the world heritage site, they found that the antiquities were in a precarious situation and no maintenance had been done to protect and preserve it despite the large income earned by the temple.
Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova on a recent visit to the temple said Dambulla was at risk of being removed from the World Heritage list, said the minister.
Sri Lanka has six archaeological sites recognized as World Heritage sites and according to the minister, the listing not only brought honour to the country but also income in terms of tourism earnings.
We cannot approve of the acts of certain Buddhist monks who have been running the temple. Since the early 80s and up to 1996, it was the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) which issued tickets to foreigners but in 1996, the monks pressured the government to stop that practice. But after 2009, the monks started to issue tickets priced at Rs 1500 each to foreigners, explained Minister Kariyawasam.
He pointed out that according to the Antiquities Ordinance, the right to issue a ticket lay in the hands of the Archaeology Department.
The Dambulla Temple which comes under the Vihara Devalagam Ordinance is required to submit their yearly accounts for auditing purposes to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs and according to that report in 2015, the temple only showed earnings amounting to Rs 38 million. The Minister thus said this number was suspicious given the fact that Sigiriya alone earned over Rs 10 million a day and at least 80 percent of foreign tourists who visit Sigiriya also visited the temple.
Our investigations show that they would at least earn between Rs 3.5-8 million a day on average, said the minister.
He stressed that though the temple had been collecting the money they had not spent any on its preservation and instead had built illegal structures, leading to the damage to the archaeological value of the site.
If we get this money we can use it for the preservation of all sites. There are many sites and temples which need renovation but the Archaeology Department does not have the funds to undertake such activities, said Minister Kariyawasam.
The Minister has also taken steps to release funds for temple renovation projects through the Divisional Secretariat instead of sending cheques directly to the chief incumbent.
No one wants to tackle this issue as any politician who touches this sensitive issue is going to have a hard time. But I am doing this with genuine intentions. Do not use this to say that we are insulting the Sangha, said the minister.
He further explained that there was nothing wrong with preserving archaeological sites so that the country can earn revenue through tourism.
The Archaeological Department has also identified 10 other archaeological sites which can be improved and opened up for tourism and the minister explained that the chief incumbents of those temples had no issue with their proposal.
We believe that from 2009-2017 the temple would have earned an income running into billions, larger than the capital expenditure allocated to a Ministry for a year, Kariyawasam said.
He said : No matter the condition, as a government we will do what needs to be done and for that we need your support.

Are cereals really all that healthy
We all get confused when we are shopping for a nutritious but tasty breakfast. Between all of the gluten-free, natural and no added sugar labels it is a daunting task to figure out what is it actually that one should eat.
While most of us are aware that things like chocolate laden corn flakes or Froot lops are not exactly filled with nutrients, the muesli that you eat could be equally unhealthy, being packed with sugar.
Speaking to a popular website, Australian nutritionist, Fiona Tuck, recently shared her views on the breakfast cereals to eat and avoid.
According to Tuck, there are more processed cereals out there that contain less natural nutrients and more additives.
She adds that while rice puffs may look innocent, they are in fact something one should avoid.
Puffed white rice, for instance, contains little nutrient and is highly refined, Tuck explained.
Muesli, on the other hand, is something that can be healthy, but needs to be approached with caution.
Countless supermarket packaged mueslis can contain high amounts of sugar. Alternatively, try making your own at home by mixing oats, nuts, seeds and fruit. Most nutrionists agree that when it comes to breakfast, nothing is as nutritious as oats.
Here is looking at what to have and what to avoid when it comes to breakfast cereals.
l Rice puffs: Bad -
They contain little nutrient and are highly refined.
l Muesli: Mixed -
Analyse whether sugar is one of the first three or four listed ingredients.
l Oats: Good -
They are low in sugar, filling and nutritious.
l Chocolate laden corn flakes: Bad - They contain few nutrients and often lots of sugar.
l Froot Loops:
Nutritionists agree if its coloured, stay away.
l Rice Crispies:
These can contain lots of sugar, salt and processing. Mirror

Are you a harry potter potter
I have always fancied a bit of pottery making but the last time I made some kind of such a creation, I was about 7 years old and I really cant remember whether I was any good at it but how hard can it be for the girl that zip wires across valleys, swim across crocodile infested waters and beats the drum in a sort of semi-convincing way that has everyone dancing by the pool
A belly dancing pot
We made our way from Negombo old town where I did some sketches of the wonderful old balconies with Ranjan to the very rural village of Kirimatiyana, where I meet with Sakunphala, our lovely 33 year old pottery teacher  The boys and I are shown some examples made earlier that morning drying in the tropical sun  immediately afterwards she seats herself on a low stool next to a foot-operated pottery wheel and slaps on an enormous piece of wet clay like an artist with a no-nonsense air of supreme confidence after she had done this a million times before. I wonder at this point if she plans to make a witches cauldron theres so much clay but realise she is simply saving time by putting about ten pots worth on the table so she can do several at a time. Talking to my two sons Amzar and Samad I wondered if perhaps she knew that getting it in that central spot was crucial to throwing a good pot.
In about twenty seconds flat she fashioned a pot so perfect it could have been made by a Deep Blue operated machine. Wow! That is just so easy, I thought, as I took over the driving seat like James Bond girl getting into his Aston Martin. After some fumbling about getting the clay to even move with my dry hands, I dipped them her advice into water and caressed it into something resembling a belly dancing pot dancing to Arabian music until finally, fed up with the amateur at the wheel, the quasi pot escaped, taking flight across the floor into a wet lifeless heap into the corner of the shed, looking not unlike a giant slug. I looked up sheepishly, in total disbelief, at the assembled company from the surrounding village looked at first shocked and then started to laugh and so did I seeing the funny side of things. Not surprisingly they did not offer me a job to join their family business, although my youngest one made several very unusual pieces of pottery and my oldest created a fantastic looking vase.
I learn as I have another go that pot-making had been in the family for 75 years, three generations, and that she had been pumping out some 200 pots a day for 27 years since she was six years old. I was so impressed learning step by step how she fashioned those pots as if they were a part of her, coming out of her fingers like magic each one was so beautifully performed it almost looked machine made except for the occasional thumb print on the rim.
A couple of days course
We all tried to copy her with varying degrees of success and it started to get competitive and ugly as I again failed to cut the mustard but as it was descending into a mud fight the action was moved on to the area where they fired the pots  the hand built oven was a master piece. This was no ordinary oven at about 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, with two channels running down its length, covering the two sides of assembled pots.
Sakunphalas dad showed us how the pots would be stacked up to five feet high and then covered first with broken pots then a layer of straw. The final layer was made of wet mud before the fuel, made of coconut fronds and husks, was inserted into the channels along with sawdust to slow the burn down for a day before putting in bigger husks for the second bigger fire on day two.
Although, this was the least successful of my experiences, it was nonetheless one of my favourite and very humbling  I would recommend it to anyone, not just for the hands on experience but also to see people and their cottage businesses outside the towns in their rural element and surrounded by Sri Lankas rich wildlife. For the boys it was a great day to indulge in their primal earthy instincts and momentarily experience rural lives in the raw, with this most hands on and challenging of art forms, pottery making. If you can do a couple of days course you will with practice create your own masterpiece in clay and for my sons it was the perfect excuse to get muddy and have a mud fight with the other village kids before having a game of cricket with a tree branch and a ball made from a Balsa seed.

Australia strengthens relationship with SL to combat people smuggling
The Australian Border Forces largest patrol vessel, Ocean Shield, has conducted official visits to ports in Sri Lanka and India for the first time.
Australian Border Force crew has shared knowledge and conducted operational activities with the Sri Lankan Navy and the Indian Coast Guard as well.
The Commander of Australias Operation Sovereign Borders, Air Vice-Marshal Stephen Osborne explained why these visits are important. People smuggling is a global problem. By working together with our international partners, we will defeat these criminals and help save peoples lives, he said.
Air Vice-Marshal Osborne said effective international cooperation and information sharing has enhanced Australias ability to stop people smuggling boats. Earlier this year Australia intercepted a people smuggling boat carrying 25 Sri Lankan nationals. In cooperation with Sri Lankan authorities, all 25 people on that vessel were returned to Sri Lanka.
It has now been more than 1,000 days since the last people smuggling boat reached Australian shores, and more than three years since the last known death at sea because of people smuggling. Despite the progress that Australia and our international partners have made in the fight against people smuggling, smugglers across our region continue trying to convince vulnerable people to hand over their money and attempt to travel to Australia illegally by boat.
Air Vice-Marshal Osborne is encouraging Sri Lankan-Australian community members to tell their relatives overseas not to risk their lives and waste their money by attempting to come illegally to Australia. Trying to reach Australia illegally by boat is dangerous and pointless. Any people smuggling boat that tries to reach Australia will be stopped and turned back. The illegal pathway to Australia is closed, and it will remain closed.

IS blows up 800-year-old Mosul mosque
IRAQ: Islamic State (IS) Jihadists on Wednesday blew up Mosuls 800-year-old iconic leaning minaret and adjacent mosque where their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014 declared himself caliph in his only public appearance, Iraqi officials said.
The Islamic State group swiftly issued a statement via its Amaq propaganda agency blaming a US strike, but the US-led coalition condemned the destruction as a crime against the people of Mosul and all of Iraq.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the destruction of the sites was an official declaration of defeat from the jihadists in the eight-month-old battle for Mosul.
Our forces were advancing toward their targets deep in the Old City and when they got to within 50 metres (yards) of the Nuri mosque, Daesh (IS) committed another historical crime by blowing up the Nuri mosque and the Hadba mosque, Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir Yarallah, the overall commander of the Mosul offensive, said in a statement.
The destruction of two of Mosuls best-known landmarks comes on the fourth day of an Iraqi offensive backed by the US-led coalition to take the Old City, where holdout jihadists are making a bloody last stand.
It adds to a long list of Iraqi heritage sites and monuments the jihadist organisation has destroyed in Iraq and Syria since Baghdadi created his caliphate straddling both countries, almost exactly three years ago.
IS proclaimed its self-styled caliphate in June 2014, after sweeping across Iraqs Sunni Arab heartland, an unprecedented experiment in jihadist statehood.
The Iraq-born Baghdadi appeared at the Nuri mosque in Mosul, Iraqs second city, days later to declare himself caliph and urge the worlds Muslims to move in.
It remains the last public appearance to date for the jihadist supremo, whose fate and whereabouts are currently unclear and whose state has been shrinking for two years.
Iraqi forces on Sunday launched an assault on the Old City of Mosul, eight months into a huge offensive to wrest back the northern city from the jihadists, who had made it their de facto Iraqi capital.
The ancient minaret known as Al-Hadba (Hunchback) lies next to the Nuri mosque and was the most loved and recognisable landmark in Mosul, sometimes referred to as Iraqs Tower of Pisa. The Hadba was completed in 1172 and had distinctive ornamental bands of brickwork wrapping around its cylindrical shaft. It started listing centuries ago and has long been considered an endangered monument. - AFP

Bocuse dOr Sri Lanka contest for world live culinary competition
In January 1987, Paul Bocuse, an icon in the culinary world, created the Bocuse dOr, a revolutionary gastronomy contest, giving young chefs a unique opportunity to demonstrate their skills, offering them a tremendous springboard for their careers.
From one competition to the next, its international influence has grown constantly.
The competition brings together 24 young chefs from all over the world, among the most promising talents of their generation, and sees them prepare amazing dishes within an allotted time period, live in front of an enthusiastic audience.
The jury comprises some of the world's best chefs. Beyond a mere cooking contest, Bocuse d'Or is a show that draws extraordinary media coverage.
Many talented chefs have made a name for themselves thanks to the contest. Along with the successive creation of contests in Latin America, Asia and Europe, Bocuse dOr has become a showcase revealing outstanding talents and gastronomic trends from all over the world. Beyond the competition itself, the Bocuse dOr has created its own family: a global network of chefs, future celebrities and famous cooks, and partner companies.
They all share the same values of creativity, rigour and innovation, are committed to passing on their skills and have a passion for fine food. The competition to select the Asian finalists will take place in the Asia Pacific Region where 12 countries will participate and the top five countries will be invited to the global final in Lyon, France, in January 2018.
This is the fourth time in the history of the event that Sri Lanka has been invited to participate. Spearheading the Bocuse d Or Sri Lankan chapter is culinary guru Rohan Fernandopulle together with an executive committee comprising some of the most renowned chefs in Sri Lanka
Commitee members, chefs from 23 hotels and guest speakers
Team Sri Lanka was short of a few marks, to be selected to participate in Lyon 2017. At the competition held in 2013, Team Sri Lanka was selected to participate at the World Finals in Lyon, France, after being placed among the top four at the Asia Pacific competition. This years competition will be conducted by Bocuse d Or Sri Lanka together with Sri Lanka Tourism and CHSGA.
In order to provide our chefs with appropriate training triple Bocuse d Or Winner Chef Eng Tong was flown in from Singapore for the pre-training programme held in May at the SLITHM premises. Along with him, a Bocuse d Or approved international and local jury will be selected to ensure the high standards of the competition.
"Currently the hospitality industry is facing a vacuum of experienced talent with international exposure and competitions create the perfect platform for our young chefs to garner exposure of this nature," said Rohan Fernandopulle. "With the high culinary standards it is important for Sri Lankans to benchmark the best of the best and step up to extraordinary culinary standards.
Our local chefs have an innate ability create spectacular dishes and I believe with the correct training and guidance we have been able to provide them, Sri Lanka will soon be rubbing shoulders with the culinary giants of the world. Fernandopulle followed."
Rallying behind us we have some great sponsors and partners who believe in our vision of culinary excellence and this wouldnt have been possible without them, Fernandopulle said. The main sponsor is Dilmah and the partners are CHGSA and SLITHM and Sri Lanka Tourism. Other sponsors are USMEF, Edinborough, Round Island, Pragmatic, Euro-Kitchen, Eoas, Nestle, Fonterra, CDC Events, Unilever Food Solutions, East West, SriLankan Airlines, Connaissance, Queens Workwear, Galle Face Hotel, Movenpick Hotel, Waters Edge, Captcha Eye, MAS, TNl, Litro and Beko.
The national selection for Bocuse d Or Sri Lanka will be held on June 30 at the BMICH premises followed by a gala dinner and awards ceremony at Waters Edge where Team Sri Lanka will be awarded the opportunity to represent Sri Lanka in Bocuse d Or Asia 2018.

The book Sri Lanka - Soviet Russia relations an introduction
February 19, 1957 was a memorable day in the annals of state relations between the island of Sri Lanka or Ceylon as it was known then and the vast land of Russia, known as the Soviet Union or the USSR. It was on this very day 60 years ago, that diplomatic relations between these two states were officially established.
Sixty years is not a long period in the history of a country, but a long span in the life of a human being. It is our delight that there happens to be a person amongst us who relates the saga of the aforesaid relationship between these two countries in a gigantic literary work in Sinhala, titled Sri Lanka-Soviet-Russia relations. He is none other than Sirimanna Karunatillake, now in his late seventies who had lived through these years and substantially contributed to building and strengthening Sri Lanka - Soviet-Russia relations over the years. He is the most experienced, knowledgeable and suited to relate this story.
It is a voluminous book comprising of four chapters running into 624 pages, elaborating the development of relations between the two countries in socio-political, economic and cultural spheres as well as people to people relations during the last 60 years. It was presented to President Maithripala Sirisena on the March 21, 2017 on the eve of his official visit to Russia as a useful hand book on Sri Lanka-Soviet-Russia relations.
The story begins with a brief description of the two countries, with their background and present standing and a narration of the Soviet tour of Ceylons team of emissaries, comprising senior diplomat Sir Claude Corea, T. B. Subasinghe, then Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and two others in September, 1956, at the direction of Premier S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, as elaborated in Part I of the first chapter.
It is said that after successful completion of negotiations and signing of necessary protocols the team embarked on a long tour of the Soviet Union, stretching from Moscow and Leningrad in the western end to lrkursk - Siberia, in the far eastern end of the Russian Republic, passing through Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakstan Republic, Dushanbe, the capital of Tajiksitan Republic and Novosibirsk in Siberia. Not only the history and the geography of these cities and republics, but also the mysterious Siberia, Lake Baikal and the Trans-Siberian Railway line as well as the historical events and personalities connected with these environs are vividly described herein.
Part II of the said chapter deals with the roles played by the Ambassadors of the two sides with special mention of the pioneers such as Prof. Gunapala Malalasekera, Ceylons first Ambassador to the Soviet Union,Vladimir Yakovlev, the first Soviet Ambassador to Ceylon and T.B. Subasinghe, nick-named Troika of Sri Lanka-Soviet relations, meaning three substantive roles played by him, including the role of being Ceylons Ambassador in the Soviet Union on one occasion. It is emphasised herein that the pioneering roles played by these three stalwarts, greatly helped in laying the foundation in building and fostering a genuine and long lasting friendly relationship between the two countries which prevail up to this day.
Part III thereof narrates the most memorable events in the annals of the past 60 years, more so the bilateral visits of VVIPs to each others countries.
It begins with the visit of Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin to Ceylon in December 1961, Ceylons Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaikes visit to the Soviet Union in October, 1963, Soviet woman Cosmonaut Valentina Thereskovas visit to Ceylon in November, 1963 and others later on. Some of them are opposition leader J.R. Jayewardenes visit to the Soviet Union in mid-1972, Minister Gamini Dissanayakes visit in October 1978, Minister Lalith Athulathmudalis visit in September 1980, Foreign Minister A.C.S. Hameeds visit in April, 1982, Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgarmers visits in January 2001 and June 2004, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovs visit to Sri Lanka in October 2009, President Mahinda Rajapaksas visits to Russia in February 2010 and June, 2011, culminated with the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to Russia in March 2017, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations.
Chapter two deals with socio-economic and trade relations between the two countries wherein the enormous aid and assistance rendered to our country, particularly during Soviet times, is elaborated in detail. The aid so rendered were of two types, viz. social aid in furtherance of the development of human resources and material aid in furtherance of industrial and agricultural development of our country. It is stated here that the more valuable and long lasting one among the two, was the social aid by way of education and training provided to our student community to become engineers, doctors, scientists, etc. This process started in the year 1960 and over 5,000 Sri Lankans have graduated from Soviet Russian higher educational institutions so far. Sensational experiences of some of them have also been vividly narrated therein.
Meanwhile, material aid and assistance rendered were specifically in the spheres of housing and construction, refining and exploration of oil, irrigation and power and industrial development. The most prominent aid projects among them were the setting up of a Prefab concrete structure manufacturing complex in Narahenpita, Samanalawewa Hydro- Electric scheme, Steel factory in Oruwala, Tyre factory in Kelaniya and the Flour milling plant in Modera, as described therein. Chapter 3 deals with cultural relations in varied sectors such as Buddhist philosophy, literature, art & sculpture, music & dancing, theatre & drama etc. Far-sighted initiatives taken by Prof. Gunapala Malalasekara, Ceylons first Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Vladimir Yakovlev, first Soviet Ambassador to Ceylon, truly laid a solid foundation in building and consolidating a true and long lasting relationship in the cultural arena. Prof. Malalasekaras interest in the teachings of Buddhist philosophy as well as Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit languages at the Moscow State University and Yakovlevs interest in associating with Buddhism, the main religion of the island and his acquaintance with Buddhist priests, right from the beginning are examples of such initiatives. Another example related with Yakovlev was the setting up of a cultural division under the Embassy, no sooner the first cultural agreement between the two countries was signed in January, 1958 in Colombo.This division eventually culminated with the setting up of the Soviet Cultural Centre in Colombo in December 1973 and later succeeded as the Russian Centre in Colombo which stands to this day as an open window on Russia.
It is highlighted herein that Martin Wickramasinghes passion for Russian literature from his adolescence and his close association with Vladimir Yakovlev, the first Soviet Ambassador during his tenure in Ceylon, made a significant influence in building mutual understanding and co-operation in bilateral relations in this sphere. His first visit to the Soviet Union in 1959 and the eventual publication of his book titled Rise of the Soviet Union, eventually made a great impact in the furtherance of friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries in the course of time. It was aptly recollected at the commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the said visit held in Colombo in October 2014 with the participation of Prof. Nina Krasnadembskaya, (a post-graduate aspirant mastering the Sinhalese language in the Leningrad State University at that time), who arrived as a special guest from Russia for the occasion. Martin Wickramasinghe has visited the Soviet Union on three more occasions thereafter, in 1965, 1967 and 1973.
Another aspect vividly described herein is the steadfast flow of Sinhala & Tamil versions of Russian & Soviet literature into the island since the establishment of diplomatic relations. Hundreds of such literary works translated and printed in Moscow thus filled the book shelves of the country, making Russian literature the most popular foreign literature among the reading public of Sri Lanka.

CAB to shine at Edinburgh Fringe Festival
The Colombo Art Biennale (CAB)which was co-founded in 2009 by Annoushka Hempel, will have its most prominent showcasing yet this August at the renowned Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and also very much in the planning stages for an ever strengthening and larger showing at its fifth edition set for 2018.
This showing at Fringe will be CABs most prominent international showing to date, preceded by Serendipity Revealed at the Brunei Gallery SOAS in London in 2014, and a Pala special exhibit at the Saatchi Gallery in 2015. With In search of stillness being hosted at the invitation of the founders of the coveted Summerhall, a Fringe Firsts award-winning and top press-attended venue with a knack for spotting must-see and accolade deserving shows, there are high hopes for all participating and Sri Lankas diverse art talent pool at large to get its moment to step from the fringes to the global spotlight.
Pala Pothupitiya is one 15 artists whose work will be part of the CAB helmed contemporary Sri Lankan art showcase to be exhibited at the worlds largest arts festival - Scotlands Fringe. This is the first comprehensive locally curated showing in the Fringes 70 year history and comes at a time when given both the festivals banner year, and the global state of political and social upheaval, the Fringe looks to revisit its founding principle to heal the wounds of war through the language of the arts - a conversation Sri Lanka is well-suited to contribute to.
Curating under the title RETURN: in search of stillness, Hempel has selected artists from the CAB catalogue, starting from the biennales inception in 2009 up to present, who were up to both the challenge of creating under a theme that seeks to encapsulate feelings of catharsis, displacement, exit and stillness - emotions identified as focal points in Sri Lankas ongoing journey to move away from the continuing cycles of violence that have too long plagued it and move towards seizing the opportunities of stabilizing its yet tenuous peace in order to achieve both healing and progress. Its a big task, and on the curatorial front it requires courage in envisioning how works and perspectives that both complement and contrast can get an equal hearing within a shared space.
As part of In search of stillness, established artists such as internationally acclaimed live performance artist Venuri Perera, and pioneering feminist and colonial discourse artist Anoli Perera will present alongside emerging artists KaneshThabendran and Vijithiran M., both from Jaffna, who from their respective mixed-media and painting standpoints speak about what has gone missing, and the trauma of the end of the war.
To this artistic dialogue also enters photojournalist Abdul HalikAzeez whose work straddles both documentarian and artistic inclinations to speak of manifestations of community targeted that violence that persist in the post-war period. Next to him Al Jazeera and BBC featured filmmaker Kannan Arunasalam will present shorts, including those of vinyl collecting priest and, that speak to different shades and tones of Sri Lankan identities. Researcher Radhika Hettiarchchi will amplify the voices of Sri Lankan women from across the island through Herstories, while Anup Vega will harness energies for healing through his life arts installation informed through multi-religious rituals from Sri Lanka. Sujeewa Kumari will create her own space in which audiences can access nature and stillness within themselves.
Rounding off the visual arts programme will be diaspora artists Rajni Pereras take on the politics of cultural identity, and Maya Bastians new-media collage dealing with dissonance and reconciliation within shared family memories of the 80s. Acclaimed playwright and director Ruwanthie de Chickera will collaborate with British visual artist and academic David Cotterrell to look at contexts of objectification and distance. Finally, there is Alex Stewart, the British artist who has been visiting Sri Lanka since 1993, crafting storytelling exhibits that celebrate both the whimsical and hard-truths of Sri Lankan life and folklore to much local acclaim.

## Title: Can Rice be made out of Plastic

Can Rice be made out of Plastic
Currently there is a fear psychosis spreading among people of Sri Lanka that rice made out of plastic has been imported to the country and is in circulation in the open market among other natural verities of rice. Many news reports have been appearing in the printed and electronic media about this danger and on how such harmful synthetic rice could be identified, and distinguished from natural edible rice varieties available in the market.
These rumours first appeared soon after the floods in many parts of Sri Lanka in the month of May, after the arrival of humanitarian aid to flood victims from overseas. Even though the reason behind these rumours is not known, people all over the country are shaken by these false rumours and inquire from grocery shop owners and from officials in the health sector whether the rice they buy for their staple food is genuine natural rice or so called harmful plastic rice. This fear, created for some unknown reason, is quite similar to the fear created among Buddhist devotees planning to visit Kataragama and Sithulpahuwa during the Poson week and restricted them to their houses during the Poson Full Moon Poya week. This was because, a few weeks prior to that, it was reported in a newspaper that there will be a big tsunami on June 8 or 9 that will kill millions of people in coastal areas in the south of Sri Lanka.
A few days after the Poson Full Moon Poya day, the chief incumbent of one of the main Buddhist religious place in the south reported in newspapers that the past Poson Full Moon Poya day this year recorded the lowest turnover of devotees who visited famous temple in the south for several decades due to this rumour spread by an errant astrologer.
Industrial materials
From the beginning of the 19th century, after the discovery of macromolecular structure of polymers, plastic industry grew rapidly replacing materials such as natural fibers like cotton and silk and even material like metal and wood owing to the versatile nature of these plastics which are polymers. Today, plastics are important industrial materials used in all fields of industry, such as polyethylene and poly propylene for wrapping purposes and for making all kinds of cans and even large water tanks, paints and varnishes. Melamine formaldehyde commonly known as Melaware is used to make electrical appliances and crockery items. Extra hard polymer material such as ABS is used to make automobile components and toys.
Apart from elastomers like rubber and fibers like nylon and polyester, polymers are divided into two main groups, namely thermo plastics and thermosets. Thermoplastics are heat-sensitive and they become softer at high temperatures. They are molded at high temperature into various items used in day-to-day life such as tumblers, cups, foot rulers, combs, soap containers, cans and water tanks etc. In thin film form, they are most useful for wrapping and packing purposes particularly for food items.
A major issue with these materials is the time taken to perish and mix with the soil when they are thrown into dumping yards after use, in comparison to perishable wastes like paper and dried leaves of coconut or Palmira. However, they can be recycled and converted into other products thereby mitigating this problem. This process of recycling is not only beneficial in solving the environmental problem, but countries like Sri Lanka can minimize the foreign exchange used to import fresh virgin polymer materials to feed the industry. Thermosets such as Melaware and Bakelite on the other hand are network polymers, which are infusible and insoluble in solvents and hence cannot be recycled. Disposal of old thermoset plastics is therefore a problem all over the world.
Thermoplastic polymers
During the conversion of thermoplastic polymers into items like food containers or household appliances, a large portion of the plastic sheet used to click out the item remains as off cuts. These off cuts are reused to make more items or different other items by converting them into fine powders, grains, pellets or to thin short pieces that resemble long grain rice. The reason for doing this is to feed them into moulds by pumping through thin tubes. Though these plastic pieces look a little like rice, the two ends are sharp cut to give the grain a cylindrical shape and are not pointed like in rice grains. Therefore, it is very easy to identify them even if mixed with white rice. There are instances where these granulated polymers are incorporated with coloured dyes to make colour master batches to be used to make coloured end products.
All these thermoplastic polymers are lighter than water and therefore, float on the surface when mixed with water. None of these thermoplastic polymers can be converted into material that resemble boiled rice. It has been reported in the internet that boiled plastic rice can be molded into a ball by pressing with fingers on the palm. This is another canard. In order to make a sphericalball, the polymer must be softened to the level of rice and also, it must be sticky like rice. None of the thermoplastic polymers mentioned above assumes that characteristic when boiled in water.
Polystyrene, commonly known as cellulite, softens on boiling and change shape, but reverts to the original rigid nature, though the shape is distorted, soon after cooling to room temperature.
They remain in the same particle form without changing their shape or the rigid nature below their melting temperatures which are much higher than the water boiling temperature. Therefore, there is no reason for anyone to harbour even a slight fear that the rice you buy from any grocery shop will have plastic rice mixed with it. Moreover, all these thermoplastics mentioned above are more expensive than rice and hence no sensible person will mix rice with grains of plastics for making higher profits.
From these technical facts, it is clear that there is no plastic rice made anywhere in the world to adulterate edible natural rice with. The fear created among the public about artificial rice is somewhat similar to the rumors spread about a tsunami reaching the southern coast of the country killing thousands of people last week. In this context, it must be mentioned that currently there is no technology available anywhere in the world to detect a tsunami a few days before the tremor. It is possible to measure the magnitude of an earthquake only after it has occurred, and then from the speed of the tidal wave created, it is possible to estimate after how many hours a tsunami can arrive in a coastal area directly facing the earthquake site, but never before that. Therefore, the public should not panic and react to this type of false rumors spread by rumor mongers for unknown reasons.

Sugar prices
The government has increased the import duty on sugar by Rs 10 due to the reduction of world market prices. Immediately sugar price was increased by Rs 10 by retailers and fares of all sugar items has been increased. Now it has been learned that world price has come down to the extent of Rs 13 per kilogramme and Sugar Importers Association has agreed for a pro-reduction of Rs 3 on original sugar price.
I regret to state that this will have no effect on prices of sugar items (Buns, cakes, tea etc) which has already been increased by Rs 10. Nobody will ever give effect to a price deduction of Rs 13 on those items.
Strictly speaking, the government should have increased the export duty by Rs 13 per kilo. So that excess fund could be transferred to a development fund. It would have kept the sugar prices stable. Now, this price deduction will encourage consumption of sugar and NCP decreases will increase. Our media should point out this to the government and advice a wise countervailing action always when world prices are reduced.

CMC will no longer dump garbage at Meethotamulla

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) informed the Supreme Court that they have taken a decision to refrain from dumping garbage at Meetotamulla area in Kolonnawa.
The CMC revealed these facts when a fundamental right petition filed against Meetotamulla garbage dump was taken up for inquiry.
Meanwhile, counsel who appeared for the petitioners tendered in court 40 death certificates pertaining to the individuals who died by the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse.
This petition was filed by seven residents of Meetotamulla area citing Colombo Municipal Council, Urban development authority, Western Province Waste Management Authority, Central Environment Authority, Kolonnawa Municipal Council and the Attorney General as Respondents.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with this fundamental rights petition.
The petitioners are seeking a declaration from Court stating that the proposed expansion of the dumping site is an imminent infringement of their fundamental rights.
The Petitioner stated that the Kolonnawa city is a highly residential area, with high population density and laments in the middle of this highly residential area is a huge and growing garbage dumping site, with a huge mountain of garbage, which has now grown to over 18 acres in extent.
They stated that the garbage from the Colombo Municipal limit is brought and dumped into this mountain of garbage and that approximately 750 to 1200 tons of garbage come into the site on a daily basis.
They allege the stench is now becoming unbearable for the families and children and that there are tremendous and serious health hazard, with around 30 people of the area having died due to germs and dengue, rat flu, skin deceases, kidney diseases. Hundreds of other families are affected and their numbers are growing daily.
They say that there are other sustainable solutions (other than the dumping of garbage in the aforesaid manner), which could bring an end to this problem, but that these measures are not being taken by the respondents.
They alleged that the respondents are taking immediate measures to demolish another 100 houses to expand the site for a further 3 acres.
They stated that if the proposed expansion takes place there will be serious, immeasurable, irreparable and disastrous ramifications.
They added that there are people and companies who are interested in purchasing the garbage (for money) and who are willing to recycle the garbage at their own expense in an environment friendly manner.
Deputy Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva Appeared for the AG. President's CounselSaliya Peiris with counsel Nuwan Bopage appeared for the petitioners.

Commercial Bank launches  version of Millionaire Account
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has re-launched its popular Millionaire Account to enable a larger group of aspiring savers to open accounts and benefit from its unique structure.
The Bank said it will now allow customers to build up a minimum balance of Rs 500,000 instead of Rs 1 million as originally envisaged, or multiples of Rs 500,000 with no upper limit on the targeted investment.
Holders of Commercial Bank Millionaire Accounts will also be eligible to borrow an equivalent of up to 75% of their account balances, a new feature introduced with the re-launch of the product.
Originally launched in 2015 as an aspiration-linked investment plan that enables account holders to build up a target amount within a specific period without a high initial investment, the Commercial Bank MillionaireAccount is designed principally to cater to a segment that needs to fast track savings for specific purposes such as the purchase of assets, childrens or own education or weddings. The product is a flexible, easy to manage investment plan that generates expected returns within a targeted period of time.
It guarantees the depositor a balance of Rs 500,000 or multiples of Rs 500,000 in two, three, four, five, or six years, depending on how much he or she is willing to deposit each month.
Available to any Sri Lankan over 18 years of age, the Commercial Bank Millionaire Account that generates a balance of Rs 500,000 in two years requires a monthly deposit of Rs 19,155 per month. A deposit of double that  Rs 38,310 per month  over two years guarantees the depositor a balance of Rs 1 million.
Depositors can nominate beneficiaries to receive the total amount invested without any penalty charge, in the event of their demise before maturity.
Sri Lankas largest and most profitable private bank and the countrys most-awarded financial institution, Commercial Bank plays a significant role in the national economy. The Bank accounted for 4.31% of the total market capitalisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in 2016 with a market capitalisation of US$ 790 million at the end of the year. The Bank is the largest lender in Sri Lanka to SMEs, having disbursed Rs 952 billion to the sector over the past five years, and channels 17.82% of the countrys export volumes and 8.36% of its import volumes.
For FY 2016, Commercial Bank reported Assets of Rs 1.012 trillion, Gross Income of Rs 93.143 billion, Net Profit of Rs 14.513 billion, a Deposits base of Rs 739.563 billion and a Loan Book of Rs 633.391 billion.
Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets, Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon, the Maldives, where the Bank opened a fully-fledged Tier I Bank in September 2016 and Italy, where the Bank launched its own money transfer service in November 2016.

CTSU condemn politically motivated transfers
Ceylon Teacher Services Union (CTSU) yesterday, condemned the several politically motivated transfers given on the direct involvement of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to teachers and Principals in schools in the Kurunegala area.
We condemn the moves of the Education Minister of using the teacher service for political purposes, said General Secretary of Ceylon Teacher Services Union Mahinda Jayasinghe adding that a number of teachers of schools in Kurunegala have been subjected to political revenge with the knowledge of the Education Minister.
He said no teacher should be subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment when he or she is transferred under the provisions of the national teacher transfer policy.
But, many teachers in the Kuliyapitiya Central Colleges have already been politically victimized. It was the school where Education Minister studied.
Ceylon Teacher Services Unions Kuliyapitiya Zones President has also been transferred without showing any reason and proper investigation.
If there are politically victimized persons, proper investigation should be held and solutions found without resorting to actions like this. Although, he submitted an appeal, the Principal of the Kuliyapitiya Central College had refused to accept it.
The Principal had also allegedly tried to assault one of the teachers of the school. He is said to have admitted children to school unlawfully, he said.
Education suffers a setback when such violent people are recruited to the education service. Teachers have been subjected to intimidation and harassments by him and we have made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission in this regard, added Jayasinghe.

Has coach Ford gone on vacation or quit
Following the Sri Lanka cricket teams return to the country on June 14 from the ICC Champions Trophy there has been a lot of speculation going around that head coach Graham Ford has quit his job and gone home to South Africa.
With the Sri Lanka Cricket hierarchy in London attending the ICC meetings there is no way of confirming whether Ford has actually left or gone on vacation.
However SLC vice president K Mathivanan who is looking after the affairs of SLC at the moment said that Ford has not indicated anything about quitting his post in writing nor has he made any official commitment towards that end.
Ford as we are aware has gone on vacation for a week to South Africa and we expect him to be back by next week for the start of the Zimbabwe series, said Mathivanan.
It is common practice that Ford goes on a vacation after a tour and this is nothing new.
The speculation comes from a news report that Ford did not leave with his minimum travel gear but with all his bags and that too after having a long talk with the SLC hierarchy following the Champions Trophy.
Sri Lanka won only of their three Group B matches (against India) losing to South Africa and Pakistan and failed to qualify for the knockout stage.
Mathivanan pointed out that Ford cannot just leave without informing his employer SLC giving sufficient time as per his contract because he is contracted till the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

HelpAge assists 2,400 flood-affected families
HelpAge Sri Lanka launched an Emergency Response Project for the benefit of over 2,400 flood and landslide affected families in Ratnapura, Kalutara, Matara and Galle districts last week.
HelpAge distributed a large stock of food and other items worth over Rs. three million to nearly 10,000 flood and landslide victims at Kapugampitiya in Ratnapura, Ihala Naragala, Pahala Naragala, Vilapahala, Kirimatiwalakada, Bulathsinhala, Ratiyala and a temporary camp located at Koboke Tamil School in Bulathsinhala in the Kalutara District.
Flood and landslide victims in Aluttanayangoda Ihala, Mapalagama in Galle and Akurassa, Maramba, Athuraliya and Malimbada in Matara District also received essential items. The project was funded by HelpAge Sri Lanka and HelpAge International, United Kingdom.
The items distributed were rice, dhal, sugar, milk powder, tea, canned fish, water bottles, sarongs, clothes, t-shirts, bed sheets, mats, towels, sanitary towels, candles, toothpaste, soap etc. The programme was conducted under the guidance of HelpAge Sri Lanka Chairman Tilak de Zoysa.
HelpAge Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge highlighted the importance of helping flood victims at this crucial juncture. He said HelpAge estimates nearly 100,000 elderly people were affected due to this sudden disaster.
Quoting the Disaster Management Centre, Liyanawaduge said over 700,000 people including a large number of elders were homeless due to floods and landslides. Nearly 360 safe locations were set up for the displaced.
He said the HelpAge distribution was carried out for three days with the participation of HelpAge staff and members of the Senior Citizens Committees in the areas.
The situation prompted us to carry out continuous programmes to distribute food, drinking water, sanitary and other food items to families of elderly people during their stay in temporary camps, Liyanawaduge said.
HelpAge Sri Lanka Programme Manager Chaminda de Silva said HelpAge has also planned to implement another programme to provide household and hardware items to construct damaged houses in these districts to support, especially the elders and their families, affected by the disaster.

Her life was changed forever!
India Hicks was a bridesmaid at Charles and Diana's wedding. Twenty years after the princess's death, she shares her very personal memories.
It was an iconic moment: Diana stepping out of the carriage, the world watching  and me, bent double, trying to de-wrinkle her dress. India Hicks shares her unique behind-the-scenes perspective of the 1981 royal wedding.
Looking back through all the photographs, all I can think of is what on earth had I done My worst hair day ever  seen by 750 million people. Just before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981, I thought chopping off my waist-length hair was an excellent idea. It was not.
When my godfather Prince Charles called to ask if I would like to be a bridesmaid, I was initially horrified. I was a 13-year-old tomboy, never out of jodhpurs, and I would have to wear a dress. Charles was a remarkable godfather, though  caring, considerate and involved  and I adored him; still do. So, despite my reservations about the dress, I glowed with pride to have been asked, especially as my mother, Lady Pamela Mountbatten, had been a bridesmaid at the wedding of the then Princess Elizabeth to Philip Mountbatten in 1947.
I met Diana for the first time at a dress fitting at the lily-strewn studio of the designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel. When we arrived, Diana was upstairs, where her dress was kept under lock and key. The windows of the building had been blocked out so that the press camped on rooftops across the street could not snap a shot of it, one of the most closely guarded fashion secrets in history.
After her fitting, Diana came downstairs to join the bridesmaids as we were measured. Frill after frill, pin after pin, hour after hour, we stood silently as the Emanuels creations were brought to life. Diana was warm and kind to me but focused mainly on the younger bridesmaids (Sarah-Jane Gaselee, 11, Catherine Cameron, six, and Clementine Hambro, five). Of course, she was really a child herself, innocent and slightly awkward.
Rehearsals
I met Diana again during the rehearsals at St Pauls Cathedral. She would practise walking down the aisle with a 25-foot-long sheet  the same length her train would be  tied around her waist with string, which we helped to manoeuvre. Never before had a royal bride walked that aisle with a train on such a scale.
As the weeks wore on, the frenzy over the wedding grew. The Government declared the day a public holiday and people prepared to celebrate with massive street parties. I was photographed for the cover of Tatler by the legendary fashion photographer Norman Parkinson, who came to my parents home in Oxfordshire with his entourage.
On the eve of the wedding, we joined members of the royal family, visiting dignitaries and film stars, including Princess Grace of Monaco, for the firework display in Hyde Park. The sky lit up across London as fireworks exploded in time to Handels Music for the Royal Fireworks, ending with a spectacular revolving sun 170 feet above ground, which shot out sparkling flares.
The following morning Sarah (Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, 17 daughter of Princess Margaret) and I rode in a sleek Daimler to Clarence House, the home of the Queen Mother, where Diana had spent the night. Scarlet-tail-coated footmen showed us upstairs to where Diana was having her hair done. Beside her on a tiny dressing table was a small television set, with rather grainy reception, so she could watch the wedding preparations going on across London, interspersed with images and stories of her past. If anyone stood in front of the screen  God forbid  she shooed them away so her view was unobstructed. It was a strange scene, this young, beautiful bride about to become the worlds most famous princess, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt with a dazzling tiara on her head, singing along to the TV commercial Just One Cornetto, which everyone, not just in the room but on the whole floor, joined in.
Just after 10am, Diana stepped out of her jeans and into her ivory silk taffeta wedding gown, to which the dramatic 25-foot train was attached. As she descended the grand staircase, she hesitated for a moment and turned to a footman to ask for a glass of water. Everyone waited in silence as she sipped from the glass, before her veil came down over her face and she stepped out into the waiting golden carriage. Her life was about to change for ever. History was in the making.
While Diana, accompanied by her father Earl Spencer, slowly made her way to St Pauls, Sarah Armstrong-Jones and I were standing by in the chapel of St Michael and St George, one of the many smaller chapels inside the cathedral; the other younger bridesmaids, meanwhile, were being contained by fierce nannies, and the two not entirely reliable pageboys, Lord Nicholas Windsor, 11, and Edward van Cutsem, eight, dressed in immaculate naval uniforms, were idly standing by. (I saw Edward again recently, under very different circumstances, no longer a small boy with a threatening sword strapped to his belt.)
Terrible mistake
As the carriage drew closer we walked down the steps to help Diana out. It was at this point that we all recognised the terrible mistake of having Diana, her father, who was by no means a small man, and a voluminous train pushed into a small carriage. Her dress, train and father were completely crumpled. There are many significant images of that moment: Diana stepping out from the carriage, the world watching, the crowds cheering, the guards lining the steps  and me, bent double with my bottom in the air, trying as best as I could to de-wrinkle the situation.
It took Diana  on the shaky arm of her father, with five bridesmaids and two pages in attendance  three and a half minutes to walk up the aisle in front of the biggest ever gathering of European and foreign royals, an invited congregation of 3,500, plus that vast television audience.
I sat, munchkin-like, on a small red velvet stool, close to the King of Tonga, who relaxed in his specially commissioned oversized chair, which to me looked like a splendid throne, made to accommodate his impressive 35 stone. His wife, Queen Mataaho, passed snacks down the pew to me. In Tonga, rank is demonstrated by your size. We needed to keep eating.
The Archbishop of Canterbury led the traditional Church of England service, assisted by clergymen from many denominations. The brides nerves showed briefly when she mixed up Charless names, calling him Philip Charles, rather than Charles Philip. Inside that calm, consecrated cathedral one could hear a pin drop, but outside on the steps and in the streets the nation roared in jubilation. I only really remember my buttercup-yellow satin shoes pinching, as they were a size too small.
After the private signing of the register, the Prince and Princess of Wales walked back down the aisle to Elgars Pomp and Circumstance. I rode back to Buckingham Palace in a glass coach drawn by horses  an enchanting experience only slightly ruined by the tiny tears of my fellow bridesmaid Catherine Cameron, who turned out to be desperately allergic to horses and spent most of the journey miserably blowing her little nose on her petticoats.
The newlyweds took an open-top carriage to Buckingham Palace, where they emerged on the balcony to give the crowds the kiss they had been longing to see. I had been privileged enough to have been on that famous balcony several times before. My grandfather rode in the Trooping the Colour, the Queens birthday parade, every year, and afterwards we would join the royal family and enjoy homemade lemon refresher and bowls of Smarties. But nothing could have prepared me for the sight of the crowds that day. We watched in awe as the micro navy-blue line of mounted police was forced to break rank as the swarming masses flooded through from the Mall to the gates of the palace, screaming joyously.
Photo shoot
Patrick Lichfield took the wedding photographs. A first cousin once removed of the Queens, he was well practised at being around the royals and came armed with a whistle so he could keep the wedding party in line. Photo after photo was taken. Prince Andrew insisted on making jokes (I wish I could remember how rude they were). But finally, utterly exhausted from so many pictures, everyone collapsed on top of one other in laughter. All I could think of was that dress and veil wrinkling even more. Finally, the wedding breakfast. Brill in lobster sauce, and chicken stuffed with lamb mousse was served. I ate the bread rolls. Strawberries and cream followed. At one point Diana picked up Clementine Hambro and sat her on her lap (more wrinkles). Clemmie had fallen in the long gallery before lunch and the Queen had bent down to help her up and rub her little flowered-wreathed head, and now Diana was making sure all was well.
Being royal, Charles had not one but two best men. Princes Andrew and Edward made speeches, light and witty, just as you imagine brothers would at a wedding. As soon as the cake had been cut, Diana, her sisters and the bridesmaids disappeared to help her change into her going-away outfit.
The mood was giggly and Diana gave us a kiss and a thank-you present: a pretty Halcyon Days pot commemorating the day. Inside were the cocoons of two silkworms that had spun the silk for her wedding dress. (A few weeks later, a rose from her bouquet arrived, set in glass to act as a paperweight, with a note of thanks in her schoolgirl writing.)
And then she was gone, to begin her honeymoon at my grandfathers home, Broadlands, in Hampshire. She was whisked away across the Buckingham Palace courtyard with a just married sign and empty Coke cans attached to the carriage by Andrew and Edward  raising smiles from the Queen, Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, who hotfooted it after them. Its not often you see our sovereign, her mother and sister running across the palace courtyard  or running at all
My mothers royal bridesmaid dress and mine now hang in acrylic cases on the wall of my daughters bedroom. They have both been on display in museums and on tours around the world, but now rest side by side, happy to have been part of history, but just as happy to be quietly home.

HFHSL celebrates National Housing Day providing homes for landslide victims in Kegalle
In celebration of National Housing Day, Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka (HFHSL) ceremoniously handed over 80 houses constructed for families affected by landslides in the Kegalle District in Aranayake, Sri Lanka.
This project was launched by Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka in partnership with Alwaleed Philanthropies in January 2017, as part of a Disaster Response initiative to assist families affected by Cyclone Roanu which struck Sri Lanka in May 2016.
In response to this disaster HFHSL launched the Kegalle Housing Project, estimated at nearly Eighty Million Sri Lankan Rupees to construct homes for 80 families in the Divisional Secretariats of Aranayake, Deraniyagala and Yatiyantota.
Providing safe housing solutions to more than 350 affected people, each completed house constructed through this project contained disaster resilient features recommended by the National Building and Research Organization (NBRO).
Commenting on the project, HFHSL President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Lakshan Madurasinghe said, At Habitat for Humanity, we believe that every Sri Lankan deserves a decent place to live. I am very proud of the impact Habitat Sri Lanka has been able to create through the Kegalle Housing Project. In merely six months HFHSL has been able to help rebuild the lives of 80 families who lost their homes and livelihoods, which is indeed a great achievement. We are sincerely grateful to Alwaleed Philanthropies for their generosity and their support.
Operating in Sri Lanka since 1995, Habitat for Humanity has supported more than 23,000 families by building and improving places they can call home.
HFHSLis currently engaged in implementing a project funded by the European Union which aims to construct and repair nearly 2,400 houses in Batticaloa, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu by 2019.
Apart from housing construction, Habitat Sri Lanka also helps families to build or repair water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and provides WASH training in communities, and is currently supporting rural communities in the Matale District to gain access to safe drinking water and to construct adequate sanitation facilities.

Inflation  decelerated to 7.1% in May
Inflation, as measured by the change in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) (2013=100), which is compiled by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), decelerated to 7.1 per cent in May 2017 from 8.4 per cent in April 2017, on year-on-year basis.
This deceleration is mainly due to the base effect amid a monthly increase in NCPI. Both Food and Non-food categories contributed towards the year-on-year inflation in May 2017.
The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis increased to 6.1 per cent in May 2017 from 6.0 per cent in April 2017.When the monthly change is considered, the NCPI increased from 121.0 index points in April 2017 to 121.8 index points in May 2017.
This monthly increase was mainly due to the increase in prices of the items in the Food category. Within the Food category, prices of vegetables, red onions, fresh fish, rice and coconuts increased during the month.
In the Non-food category, prices of items in clothing and footwear; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (materials for maintenance); furnishing, household equipment and routine household maintenance; transport (tyres, tubes, spare parts and lubricating oil); and miscellaneous goods and services sub-categories increased.
Prices in health; education and restaurants and hotels sub-categories also recorded marginal increases. Prices of certain items within the alcoholic beverages and tobacco sub-category decreased during May 2017.
Meanwhile, prices in communication; and recreation and culture sub-categories remained unchanged during the month.
The NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy decreased significantly to 4.7 per cent in May 2017 from 5.9 per cent in April 2017 on a year-on-year basis. This decline is due to relatively low monthly increase and the base effect. Annual average NCPI
Core inflation also declined from 6.6 per cent in April 2017 to 6.4 per cent in May 2017.

Ireland and Afghanistan granted Test status
Become 11th and 12th full ICC members:
LONDON, Thursday: Ireland and Afghanistan have attained Test status after they were granted full membership by the International Cricket Council.
The ICC met for its annual conference in London on Thursday and confirmed Ireland and Afghanistan as full members after a unanimous vote.
Ireland have been playing as affiliate members since 1993 and have recorded famous victories over Pakistan, England and the West Indies in that time.
Now they will be able to play Test cricket against the worlds best, with Afghanistan also making the step up having only achieved affiliate membership in 2013.
The ICC confirmed the news on Thursday afternoon, posting on Twitter: @ACBofficials and @Irelandcricket confirmed as Full Members after a unanimous vote at ICC Full Council meeting.
Both will now be eligible to play Test cricket following a recommendation that their applications met newly approved member criteria.
The move sees Ireland and Afghanistan take the total number of member countries to 12 and they are the first to be given Test status since Bangladesh in 2000.
Ireland international Gary Wilson welcomed the news by posting a statement on his own Twitter account.
An historic day for Irish cricket, he wrote.
Years worth of work feels like it has been recognised. There are many people in the background that have made this happen. Current officials, players and management have been major cogs but lets not forget the tireless volunteers who worked so many years to get us where we are.
Men who played for free and managed for free. Good men no longer with us like John Wright and John Caldwell, no doubt there are others.
As well as for us, this is for them. No doubt they would be as delighted as we are. Heres to the beginning.
Irelands newly appointed Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, offered his congratulations as the country now prepares to host Test cricket for the first time.
I am delighted that Ireland will take its place among the Test playing nations, he said.
Its great news for the game here and a fitting result for many years of hard work and campaigning by Cricket Ireland.
Ireland has enjoyed some notable successes at International level in the shorter versions of the game. We can now look forward to some great days ahead as Ireland takes on the top Test cricket playing nations in the world.
The Afghan Cricket Board posted its own message of gratitude.
Massive thank you to everyone who has played their part in making the dream of Full Membership of ICC a reality, it wrote on Twitter.  Telegraph

John Keells Group provides relief, resettlement to flood victims
In response to the recent severe flooding in southwestern Sri Lanka, John Keells Foundation (JKF), the CSR entity of the John Keells Group, provided funding and coordination support together with Group businesses who also mobilized their staff and other resources towards the provision of immediate relief to affected communities.
Group company Tea Smallholder Factories PLC (TSF) assisted affected communities in proximity to their factories through the distribution of dry rations and cooked food among affected persons in Neluwa, Hingalgoda, Karawita, Kurupanawa and Halwitigala while displaced staff in Kurupanawa were provided temporary shelter at the factory premises.
TSF has also assisted community members in resettlement by cleaning 15 houses and 175 wells in Kurupanawa, Hingalgoda, and Karawita. In total, TSF supported over 1,500 persons.
JayKay Marketing Services which operates the Groups supermarket chain, supplied dry rations, medicines, bedsheets, pillows and sleeping mats worth over Rs. 1 million to an estimated 1,000 persons affected in Ratnapura, whilst collection points were set up at each Keells Super outlet for the public to donate dry rations and sanitary items with contributions being matched on a 1 to 1 basis.
Through these collections, Keells Super has collected over 300 dry ration packs from customers, valued at approximately Rs 1 million and has matched these contributions with an additional Rs. 1 million worth of dry rations.
An estimated 600 families from Atthudawa West and Atthudawa East in Matara District were provided dry ration packs.
Ceylon Cold Stores responded to immediate needs of persons in Hambantota and Matara by distributing over 9,000 water bottles to affected persons, whilst lunch packets were given to persons affected in Ranala, Batewala. Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts donated linen including bedsheets, pillows and towels, totaling over 4,400 items to affected persons in Kalutara, Kurupanawa, Hingalgoda and Nagoda. Cinnamon Lodge also supported affected persons in Ehaliyagoda through a monetary contribution for each household and 2,000 bottles of drinking water and linen to 100 families who were displaced during the floods.
Union Assurance encouraged its branch staff islandwide to volunteer for relief efforts, by providing them two days paid leave while the staff too donated dry rations to affected persons in Matara.
Towards supporting the resettlement of displaced persons, John Keells Foundation has undertaken a well cleaning initiative in Galle and Kalutara Districts in collaboration with Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) and Group businesses in the affected areas.
Since the initiation of the well cleaning programme on June 2, 780 wells have been cleaned in Galle and Kalutara Districts, benefitting 7,479 persons. The initiative is ongoing.
JKF is also working with SLRCS towards facilitating the provision of school requirements including books, stationery items and school bags for flood-affected school children.
John Keells Foundation will continue to assess the needs of affected persons and provide necessary relief, especially targeting the resettlement of persons.
Disaster Relief, one of the Foundations six CSR pillars, aims at supporting persons and communities affected by disasters towards enabling them rebuild their lives and livelihoods.

Kias class champion  the 2017 Picanto revealed in Colombo
Bigger, bolder and feature-packed third generation model set to revitalise city car segment
Korean car maker Kia unveiled its third generation 2017 Picanto in Colombo on June 15, emphatically shattering the ennui in Sri Lankas urban city car segment.
With its 2016 predecessor already enjoying the best-in-class tag in the market, the all-new, youthful and energetic Kia Picanto will also dispel preconceived notions about A segment cars with exciting new hi-tech features, more space and enhanced handling and safety, authorised distributor Kia Motors (Lanka) Limited said.
A bold new exterior design and a modern, more spacious and quieter cabin with floating touchscreen; new in-car technologies and connectivity features including Android and Apple smartphone integration; a stronger body, increased fuel efficiency and the largest cargo capacity in its class are just a few of the improvementsin the new Picanto revealed to media at an exclusive preview.
The Picanto has in the past been described as a small car all grown up, and this new model takes the concept even further, literally, as well as in terms of design, performance and sophistication, said Mahen Thambiah, Managing Director of Kia Motors (Lanka) Limited. It redefines the value for money paradigm and provides a drive that will please the young at heart and the motoring aficionado alike.
Revealed for the first time at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, the new Picanto is designed as an innovative, bold and fun-looking urban city car.Ithas a more assertive stance with bolder body lines, a longer wheelbase that contributes to a natural improvement in ride quality and stability on all roads;longer rear overhang;new projection headlamps with LED indicators and LED daytime running lights;and Kias distinctive wide C-pillar as a design motif, which stands more upright than that of the previous model.
A choice of nine vibrant paint finishes makes the car stand out. The six new colours available to buyers of the new model are Lime Light, Shiny Red, Aurora Black, Pop Orange, Sparkling Silver and Celestial Blue in pearlescent metallic paint finishes. The Picanto is fitted with 14-inch steel wheels in its basic form, but customers can select one of four aluminium alloy wheel designs, ranging from 14-inch to 16-inch in diameter.
The new Picanto is powered by a highly efficient 1.0litre MPI engine at entry point. Upgrades to the engine include a new exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, and a new cooling system with shut-off valve, reducing the time it takes the engine to warm up from a cold start. A new two-stage oil pump also reduces mechanical friction and delivers greater fuel efficiency.
A new steering rack quickens the steering ratio by 13 per cent over the outgoing Picanto,enabling more immediate responses to driver inputs while reducing the turns of the wheel lock-to-lock, making the new modelmore agile and even easier to drive at low speed and in the city.
Inside, the 2017 Picanto provides occupants with more leg and head room than best-selling rivals in the A-segment.
Kias designers have created a more modern, refined cabin with new materials and layout adding a greater sense of quality. Apredominantly horizontal design adds greater visual width to the interior, highlighting the increased cabin dimensions.
The dashboard layout is more centrally aligned, with a large 7.0-inch floating touchscreen human-machine interface (HMI) sitting at the heart of the centre console and moving many of the cars controls further up into the drivers line of sight. The boot of the new model grows from 200 litres to a maximum 255 litres  the most of any car in the class. When the 60:40 split-folding rear seats are folded down completely flat with a one-touch lever, cargo capacity is boosted to 1,010 litres.
In the sphere of safety, the new Picantos body shell is cast in Advanced High-Strength Steel (AHSS) improving tensile strength by 12 per cent.
The new, stronger steel has been used to reinforce the floor pan, roof rails and engine bay, as well as the A and B pillars, strengthening the core structure of the car. The new bodyshell also uses more than eight times the quantity of structural adhesive found in the previous model.The car is also equipped twin airbags and anti-lock brake system (ABS).
As with all Kia Picantosfrom the 2016 model onwards, the new Picanto is backed by a warranty of five years/150,000 km, whichever occurs first .
Kia Motors (Lanka) Limited, has represented the Kia brand in Sri Lanka since 1996.

Lanka Women suffer 109-run loss to India
Half-centuries from Punam Raut and Mithali Raj, followed by a four-wicket haul from Rajeshwari Gayakwad, led India women to a 109-run win against Sri Lanka in their Womens Cricket World Cup warm-up match played at Chesterfield.
Raut added 92 for the first wicket with Smriti Mandhana and 49 with the second with Raj as the top three set up a daunting total of 275 for 8.
Four of Sri Lankas top five got past 20, but none of them managed a half-century, with Dilani Manodaras 49 the top score of the lot.
At 135 for 3, the chase still held some hope, only for Sri Lanka to collapse to Gayakwads left-arm spin, the last seven wickets falling for 31 runs.
Scores:
India Women 275 for 8 (Raj 85, Raut 69, Kanchana 2-49)
Sri Lanka Women 166 (Manodara 49, Gayakwad 4-12)

One of the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, Robert Payas, a Sri Lankan national, on Wednesday petitioned the Tamil Nadu government seeking mercy killing.
In an emotionally charged letter to Chief Minister K Palaniswami, he said he should be killed on grounds of mercy and his body should be handed over to his family.
"Payas has petitioned the government through the Puzhal prison authorities," a top prison official said.
Blaming the Centre -- both the previous United Progressive Alliance government and the incumbent National Democratic Alliance -- for opposing the release of seven Rajiv Gandhi case convicts, including him, when former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa took the initiative, he said, "We do not know why our release has been put on hold." - Agencies

Lankan cricketers undergo intense physical training program
Ahead of tours here by Zimbabwe and India:
Sri Lanka Cricket announced on Thursday that it had established a high-profile evaluation and monitoring committee headed by Asanka Gurusinha to oversee the physical fitness and conditioning of the national performance squad ahead of their upcoming campaigns against Zimbabwe and India in Colombo.
The move comes in the wake of Sri Lankas unfortunate exit in the group stage of the Champions Trophy 2017, where they lost to eventual champions Pakistan in a nail-biting game on June 12.
Elaborating on the plans set in motion, team manager Asanka Gurusinha stated: We know how much resource and effort was invested in the team ahead of the CT17, and we know how much effort each and every player made both on and off the field. But we have the face the reality that we were just not good enough on the day, and look to the reasons behind this. We have had several internal discussions with the coaches, trainers, the selectors, and the players themselves, and we all agree that there is a disparity in our fitness levels.
We have incredibly talented cricketers, with the passion and the commitment to fly the flag on high  but they are not quite cricketing athletes, which is where we need to be. The national selectors met last Friday and have selected a provisional squad of 30 players. These players will undergo rigorous testing and evaluation this week, and will only make it into the squads for the Zimbabwe and India tours provided they meet the required grading, said Gurusinha.
The initial testing of the 30 member provisional squad was conducted under the supervision of SLC HP Training & Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham who commented: Sri Lanka Cricket High Performance Sports Medicine and Sports Science Department are running a battery of fitness tests encompassing body composition, speed, power and endurance. We will provide this information to the selectors to help guide their decision making but more importantly give players a plan to improve areas of concern in a realistic time frame.
The Committee which has formulated a strict evaluation criteria comprises chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya, team manager Asanka Gurusinha, chairman SLC Medical Panel Professor Arjuna de Silva, High Performance Manager Simon Willis, Rehabilitation Manager Nirmalan Thanabalasingham and National Trainer Nicholas Lee.

Living in limbo with nowhere to go
Plight of landslide victims of Morawaka:
With the heavy rainfall reported in the South of the country recently, many areas experienced severe flooding and landslides. Many of the areas including Deniyaya, Morawaka, Werella, Akuressa, Kamburupitiya, Deiyandara, Pallegama and Makandura were the most severely affected.
The Daily News visited the Morawaka area recently to inquire into the post disaster measures that have been taken to resettle those displaced and assistance given to recommence their lives.
Several of the affected residents of Morawaka recollected their dreaded ordeal in which they had lost many of their loved ones and lamented about their uncertain future.
A tree fell on my house around 11 PM, so I rushed to my friends house nearby. I thought the tree fell because of the strong winds. I came back the next morning to check the damage, but my house was gone. There was no trace of it. Around 50-60 acres of land were covered in mud and debris. My son and his family lived next door, and the landslide had also swept away their house. I returned to my friends place, but my wife was so sick and anxious that I did not want to tell her that our son and grandchildren were dead. But, I had to tell her, said an elderly displaced man from Morawaka town.
After days of non-stop rain and intermittent floods in the Matara district, a hillside just north-east of Morawaka collapsed around midnight on May 25th. The landslide devastated an area of over a kilometre, swallowing everything in its path, destroying 27 homes, killing 24 people and displacing over 400 others.
Only nine bodies have been recovered thus far, while the rest remain lost beneath tons of mud and wreckage. The government has suspended its efforts to find the other bodies. Flooding also ruined four other homes, bringing the full tally to 31 ruined dwellings.
Still displaced
Almost a month has passed since the disaster, but about 50 displaced people from seventeen families are being housed in a building at the Morawaka Primary School, a structure in which many have been living since late May. Many of them have lost several family members, their houses, most or all of their personal property and any hope for a prosperous future.
There were more people living at the school in the days after the landslide, but many have since moved back into their damaged houses after receiving clearance from the National Building Research Organization (NBRO).
The lions share of the displaced are still dealing with the affects of the twin traumas of losing several family members and their homes at once. There are many people here who have lost five, six or more relatives. Luckily, I escaped into the jungle before the landslide buried my house, but it killed my son, his wife and their two children. We have nothing now, said a elderly woman. Needless to say, those who witnessed the flooding and landslide remain traumatized, as most of their family support structures have ceased to function. Neighbours and other community members have, however, taken in friends and relatives who lost their homes, lessening the strain on the governments relief efforts.
But those who remain in the school building must contend with the pain of losing loved ones while living in cramped, unpleasant conditions. They remain in limbo, with no past to return to nor future to look towards.
Dire living conditions
The structure itself is made up four rooms, one of which serves as the kitchen. But, the people prepare the communal meals in a corner, as ceiling-high stacks of broken desks, chairs, and school furniture take up most of the floor space.
The other three rooms are cramped and uncomfortable, as they serve as living, dining, and bedrooms; mattresses litter the floors, and the metal lattices that function as both walls and windows admit a constant stream of mosquitoes. Only a lucky few have nets.
Residents patience is wearing thin, as the buildings conditions are not conducive to long term occupancy.
We need a permanent place to stay. We cannot stay in this school for a longer period. It is not easy living here; the whole place gets wet even after a small rain and we get bombarded by mosquitoes at night, said the woman.
The lack of living space is especially apparent, as rooms overflow with stuff. Clothes hang on makeshift lines and occupy much of the limited shelf space. Many have brought the salvaged contents of their ruined homes, but these soggy keepsakes, dreary reminder of past lives, are difficult to hide amid the clutter.
Though the scene is somewhat dismal, children do their best to entertain each other, gaily entangling themselves in the nets while their parents look vacantly on. The elderly generally spend their time inside their rooms, only occasionally going outside to eat and mingle.
It is perhaps the children who find the experience of living in the camp the least onerous, as the younger kids flit around with each other playing and joking.
Aid drying up
The displaced, though thankful for being housed, related that the level of support they enjoyed at the beginning of their ordeal was far greater than the aid they now receive.
We have stayed in this school for almost four weeks. For the first two weeks, the Army helped us a lot, and for the first three weeks we got enough food and all necessary items. Now we sometimes dont have enough food to eat, the man said. The drop off in aid could possibly be attributed to the fact that many private entities and NGOs raised money and donated goods and food, especially dry rations, for the affected in the period immediately after the landslide. At the moment the District Secretariat is responsible for providing food and other necessities.
Adding to the strain is that many of those living at the school really dont have anything to do. A good number still have not returned to work, preferring to try to sort out their affairs from the school instead. Some adults spend the days cooking, but most simply mill about talking with one another and wondering what comes next.
Many cannot leave the school to live with friends or relatives, and they are further dissuaded from going elsewhere due to the fact that they will stop receiving aid if they do so.
Government officials, however, have offered to provide each family with Rs. 7,500 per month to rent homes for three months. Many of the displaced claimed that such a move is impossible, citing that they would not be able to pay the rent after the initial period of government subsidization.
Uncertain future
The people understandably want new homes, but it is unclear how exactly these new homes would be financed. Nobody at the school reported having home insurance, and most claimed that they did not have enough savings to build new homes on the plots they own.
We request the government to help us and provide houses for us. We have not been informed of any alternate place to live as of yet, said the man.
Complicating their plight is that the land on which their old houses stood is, for the foreseeable future, uninhabitable.
The District Secretary is in the process of identifying land for the people, according to Morawaka Grama Niladhari (GN) K.G. Kumuduni.
The secretariat has identified a stretch of land near a factory in Bathalawaththa, Morawaka and are in the process of acquiring these lands, she said.
But even if the government obtains that land, it is unclear who would pay for the construction of seventeen new homes for the displaced families. The GN, for her part, said that the prospects for new homes were dim.
The main issue the people in this camp suffer with is the fact that they have no other place to go to. There seems to be little hope of them finding permanent abodes, she said.
Well aware of the difficulties they will likely face in acquiring new homes, most people said that they would stay in the school as long as they could despite the poor conditions.
What else can we do We have nowhere else to go, said the woman.

Mahaweli lands will be given to suitable, eligible people: Amaraweera
Mahaweli lands will be given to suitable people. Earlier there was a saying that if anyone requests Mahaweli lands, he was considered a loser and if anyone grabbed Mahaweli lands, he becomes a winner, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that a lot of people killed each other and had several fatal conflicts because of the ownership of Mahaweli lands. This issue will be solved and the ownership of Mahaweli lands will be given to the suitable and eligible people, he said.
According to Minister Amarawera, over 77 percent work of the Uma Oya project has been completed and assistance of the experts from Switzerland has been obtained to stop the water leakage. The water leakage will be completely stopped by June next year and the project will be opened by the end of next year. All victims will be given the highest compensation ever offered in Sri Lanka, for a similar project.
The electricity generated by the Moragahakanda Project will be added to the National Grid next month. "I do not know what will happen to the newly built Angunakolapelessa prison. But, other development projects worth over Rs. 7,000 will be handed over to the public soon.
International level swimming pool, outdoor and indoor stadiums, shopping malls etc are included in the project", the Minister added.

Mangala for relaxing laws on liquor sale
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera proposed relaxing the laws pertaining to the sale of Wine and Beer in the country.
The minister said relaxing the issue of licenses for wine and beer sales would help deter consumption of illegal liquor (kassippu).
However, he stressed that it was his personal opinion, adding that the Finance Ministry would soon take a policy decision in that regard.
He also said the practice of closure of bars and taverns on Poya Days and Christmas Day should be reconsidered. Even though we ban the sale of liquor on Poya Days, the consumption of illegal liquor is high on those days. The owners of Super Markets and bars told me that liquor sales go up on the day prior to Poya, he said.
The Minister pointed out some bar owners sell liquor at their homes at higher prices on Poya Days. We have banned the sale of liquor even on Christmas Day. December is the peak tourist season in the country. It is timely that we reconsider these out-dated laws. For example, Thailand is a Buddhist country, but, they only close bars and taverns on the General Elections Day which comes once in about 5-6 years, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister made these comments moving a Notification under the Excise Ordinance for debate in Parliament yesterday. The Notification was to reduce the distillery license fee from Rs.100 million to Rs 1 million.
As per a budgetary proposal in 2016, the distillery license fee (except for palmyrah arrack) was increased from Rs 100,000 to Rs.100 million and the license fee for manufacturing of liquor was increased from Rs.50,000 to Rs.50 million.
However,small and medium scale manufacturers complained that they could not afford the sharp increase. Several fundamental rights petitions were filed in the Supreme Court against the move. The Supreme Court suspended enforcing the revised license fees till the hearing ends. Therefore, the reduction of license fees with effect from January 1, 2017 will not result in any loss of revenue to the Government, the Minister said.
The minister said there are 15 distilleries and 24 liqour manufacturing companies in the country. He pointed out the consumption of illegal liquor is a problem in the country, adding that this percentage is as high as 61 percent.
It has been found that the consumption of kassippu goes up when we increase the duty on liquor. We cannot forcibly reduce liquor consumption, instead what we can do is to give more relief to types that have less impact on health, he said.
He said the Finance Ministry is discussing and collecting information to revise the laws pertaining to the sale of wine and beer.

Mervyn gives undertaking to SC on compensation payment
Former Deputy Minister Mervyn Silva yesterday gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court to pay compensation of Rs.400,000 as damages to a resident of Kiribathgoda by June 27 this year.
President's Counsel Anil de Silva appearing on behalf of the former minister gave this undertaking to the Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep.
On November 28, last year, the Supreme Court ordered former Deputy Minister Mervyn Silva to pay Rs.400,000 as compensation, personally, as damages, to a resident of Kiribathgoda and ruled that former Deputy Minister and former OIC of the Kiribathgoda Police infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioner after demolishing a part of his residential house in 2010.
The Supreme Court further ordered the former OIC of Kiribathgoda police to pay compensation of Rs.50,000 to the petitioner for demolition the parapet wall of the petitioner with the blessing of former Deputy Minister .
In his Fundamental Rights petition, petitioner Asitha Nanayakkara Liyanage, a resident of Kiribathgoda had cited former Chairman of Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha Prasanna Ranaweera, Secretary to the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha Hemapala Hettiarachchi, Commissioner of Local Government Kachcheri Complex, Gampaha, Chief Inspector of Police, Kiribathgoda Police Station, former Deputy Minister Mervyn Silva and three others as respondents.
The Supreme Court had declared that the former Minister and former OIC have infringed the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms and Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Both the above Respondents have wittingly breached the fundamental rights of the Petitioner.
At all times relevant to this application a Minister of the State was involved and thus makes the State also liable. As such court directs the State to pay a sum of Rs. 100,000-as compensation to the Petitioner, the Supreme Court ruled.
The Supreme Court further directed the Inspector General of Police to conduct investigations according to law and ascertain whether any other person is responsible for the destruction of Petitioners property and in doing so whether instruments and machinery belonging to the State had been used and utilised, and take suitable action having consulted the Attorney General. .
The Petitioner, a resident of Iriyawetiya Junction, Kandy Road, Kiribathgoda, complains against all Respondents in his Fundamental Rights Application to the Supreme Court filed on 01.10.2010, of certain harassments and abuses caused to him and his family, which ultimately resulted in demolition and destruction caused to part of his residential house.
It is averred inter alia in the petition filed in the court that on 18.09.2010 seven Respondents had come with equipment and vehicles belonging to the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha and destroyed the parapet wall bordering the Petitioners property bordering the KandyIriyawetiya Road and also destroyed two toilets and a wash room within the premises owned by him.
The petitioner alleged that the demolition of the petitioners parapet wall was done with the vehicle and instruments of the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha with the blessing of the 1st and 2nd Respondents and 4th Respondent former Kiribathgoda OIC deployed police personnel to provide security on the instructions of 7th Respondent Mervyn Silva.

Mini graduates
At CaroMont Regional Medical Center in North Carolina, some very special mini-ceremonies are taking place - honoring and celebrating the lives of premature babies. Once the newborns are about to leave the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), they get a personalized graduation cap and a portrait.
Its just for babies born at 34 weeks of gestation or earlier when they leave its a huge accomplishment not only for the baby but parents as well, Melissa Jordan, a nurse at CaroMont Regional Medical Center told Buzzfeed.
The program was started as a way to celebrate this milestone in the babies lives.
Jordan was inspired to do this after spending time with a vulnerable baby who was born just at 29 weeks.
The day he got discharged, we gathered staff and we went in singing and dancing and gave him his cap - and his parents just smiled ear to ear - thats when we knew it was something we wanted to keep doing for other families, Jordan said.
Leaving the NICU can be joyful but also scary and nerve-wracking, so this was our way of bringing a little normalcy to taking the baby home, Jordan said.

More than just acting
The impetus to succeed and to work for the honor and common good of their school is instilled in the D.S. Senanayake boys through their education. Dramatic Moves features the actors of D.S. Senanayake College where talent and the system come together to produce the perfect actor.
What I have experienced in working with these boys in E. L A (English Literary Association) is that they are dedicated to their work. They work energetically, enthusiastically and have a great respect to the school they serve.
They work in unity, as one family, together with old members, parents and teachers in charge. So far, from the time I have taken over as teacher in charge, they have succeeded in continuing their projects according to schedule.
It is the team spirit that is behind their success. The great spirit of these DS boys is their stability They work decisively.
The most unforgettable moment was the Inter school Shakespeare drama competition held last year. With the previous years experience of being the runners up of the competition, they worked with commitment and performed well. But unfortunately they were edged out at the preliminary stage by being the 5th.
Only 4 teams were selected to the finals. But I am glad to say it was a great performance which was brought on to the stage resulting from their great commitment, said Teacher in charge Janaki Ranasinghe.
*********
A tight bond
President Dhanindu Liyanage, felt that drama teaches you soft skills.
It was for the 33rd consecutive year (1984-2016) that D.S. Senanayake College participated in the Shakespeare Drama Competition this year making it the longest running tradition in our school.
Winning in Shakespeare in 2012, when we became champions, it was an amazing performance because everyone was amazed. It was a massive team effort.
We have a tight bond in our club that makes us brothers. This is what really makes us different from other clubs. Everyone knows that when it comes to Shakespeare at DS we do it with a sincere heart and we give it our best.

When you do drama you acquire interpersonal skills. When you get up there on stage you know exactly what to do and what is required of you. This automatically creates a bond. I feel, for anyone drama is very important, because in real life you need to interact with each other. In Drama you learn to overcome your fear of talking to people. You learn to interact with each other, said Liyanage.
*********
Biggest strength
Secretary Viduravi Athulathmudali pointed out that with the right motivation and attitude a really great production can be brought to life on stage.
Although we may not have got into the finals all the time, in Shakespeare that does not detract from us because we put in a really great production. When we start practices for Shakespeare, for the first few weeks we make sure, each individual in the club, who participates in Shakespeare gets the necessary motivation. In a drama there are speaking roles and non -speaking roles. When people get non-speaking roles they tend to think that they are unimportant. But during those few weeks, before giving them the roles we make sure that all of them are equally important. To choose them for Shakespeare we hold an inter-house drama competition within the school and through that we choose the students for Shakespeare Drama Competitions.
Every year we choose three great actors from our school through the inter-house drama competition and in the Shakespeare Drama Competition we make sure that at least five of the cast members are in the position to achieve the Best Actor Award. Usually at a Shakespeare Drama Competition we have 20  30 members of the cast and out of that we make sure that at least five cast members in the speaking roles are in a position to achieve Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor, said Athulathmudali.
All for one and one for all is their motto says Athulathmudali.
Our biggest strength is the brotherhood which exists in us. When we start Shakespeare or any competition we make sure that this important element exists within us. When we take part in a competition we dont perform for the competition, we make sure that everyone performs for everyone else. Our Motto is All for one and One for all. Everyone understand that he is needed by everyone else and that is the major strength. Then also when we have quality productions, we start around 4.00pm in the evening and go on till 1.00am  2.00am next morning. During that time we make sure the bond is created between the cast members, explained Athulathmudali
At D.S. they make sure that the students abilities are brought out whatever the form of expression.
I have received a lot from the English Literary Association which focuses on Drama and Debating. We know how to adapt to the society, finding sponsors and interacting with other schools, and we make sure that every coming generation has that experience. The ELA is a free platform for anyone to express whatever is within them, added Athulathmudali
Every time D.S. performs it is memorable performance.
2015 was an awesome performance, and that year we had the least amount of cast members and we came runners-up. 2014, Macbeth we ended up fourth place. We started out with the witch scene and it had so much energy, the audience felt that they were there. In 2012 when we became the champions, that was an awesome performance where we performed Midsummer Nights Dream.
Stepping into a characters skin and playing a female role is certainly a challenge to Athulathmudali
One of the major challenges a speaking role should have, is being able to step into someones skin. The techniques the directors use are many. They show dramas performed - for example the Macbeth dramas and how the roles are enacted. Gradually they make sure the person gets into character. For one month before Shakespeare we have practices every single day. If that particular person gets out of character, during those practices, we make sure that they get into character and the motivation we put in helps the person get into character. When he observes the other roles being performed, then he gets into character. Again it happens through that bond we create.
Last year we did Henry VI and I played a female role, and it was a bit hard. I also performed in the Tempest. Going into a female role we have to be aware of all the movements  not just walking, but the way you walk and the way your muscles move. Everything matters.

The voice and the way you sit and the way you keep standing and your actions and reactions, everything matters. So we research the personality of the particular character. So if we take a young woman or a middle aged woman, even though both of them are female, they are different. So what I think is, you need an intense amount of research of the character you are playing, and then it is about practice. You are on stage for a limited period of time, so during that limited period of time, you should make all those movements perfect. You should make sure your audience thinks of you as a woman  during that duration. It is hard but it is doable, elucidated Athulathmudali.
*********
Somethingspecial
Treasurer Abdul Malik believes that drama gives you a set of values and principles.
I would like to think that we have a certain unity that is unique and something that sets us apart from other schools. Our parents help us a lot and without them this would not be possible. We have a strong unity amongst the club members.
Doing drama is really important because it teaches you how to achieve something without putting someone else down.
We never put anyone down. Also when it comes to drama at D.S. there are no age barriers. The juniors can talk to us very freely and share anything. Drama gives you something special. You know how to talk to a person. You learn to cultivate the right attitude.
We make sure our younger batches are prepared and ready. The cast is a sort of inner-circle at school, said Malik.
*********

Emerging young talent
Senior Member Vinura Gamage, says the future is secure
At D.S. the talents of the students are identified and this does not apply only to drama but the entire spectrum of activities at D.S. honestly I feel that D.S. has a great future, because we definitely have emerging young talent. Their level of acting is really of a very high standard. We always ensure there is a younger generation who can keep it up when we leave school.
In my experience the competition in the drama circuit is pretty competitive. I am pretty sure considering the amount of training we put ourselves through, that we have been able to reach a high standard, said Gamage.

'Most of worlds tropical forests  will disappear by end of century'
Every year, more than 15 million hectares of tropical forests are cut down, releasing millions of tons of carbon emission into the atmosphere, says a US environmental organization The Nature Conservancy.
According to them, a study commission by the UK Treasury has reported that reducing or eliminating deforestation is a highly cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to save the planet. Without action now, they say, the worlds tropical forests will be lost by the end of this century.
Taking a cue from this revelation, Sadaharitha Plantations in Sri Lanka are offering investors the opportunity to contribute to afforestation and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions while reaping sustainable high returns in the long term through commercial forestry.
Chairman of Sadaharitha, Sathish Navarathna said We have over 2,000 acres of forestry and a portfolio of over 26,000 satisfied customers all over Sri Lanka who realize the enormous potential the investment offers in economic terms in addition to contributing in a big way to preserving the environment, not only by reducing greenhouse carbon emission, but also by protecting the land during inclement weather conditions.
It is a noteworthy fact that although tropical forests cover only 12% of the planet, it is the habitat of more than half of the worlds plants and animal species. At the current rate of deforestation this precious ecosystem will disappearwithin the next 100 years.
Sadaharitha Plantations, the winner of the Gold Green Award in 2012, is engaged in forest plantations management with sandalwood, teak, mahogony, rambutan and agarwood to earn foreign exchange for the country.
Dr. Upul Subasinghe, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura who is conducting research on forest management of non-timber forest products such as agarwood and sandalwood, commended Sadaharitha Plantations on their efforts to promote commercial forestry which helps protect Sri Lankas environment while enriching the economy.
He said Planting forests offer a significant cooling benefit with the suns heat absorbed by the dark forest canopy, contributing to reduced global warming.
According to a paper presented by Dr. Subasinghe in 2015 with regard to the carbon fixation values of plantations managed by Sadaharitha, after 20 years of planting, a teak tree will store 0.55MT of carbon equivalent to 2.017MT of CO2.
In 20 years a sandalwood tree will store 0.12MT of carbon equivalent to 0.44MT of CO2. In 8 years after planting an aquilaria (agarwood) tree it will store 1.14MT of carbon and 4.18MT atmospheric CO2.
More than 2,000 acres of Sadaharitha forestry consist of above species, including mahogany and rambutan that will be directly involved in the fixation of carbon and atmospheric CO2 for many years. This emphasizes a greater value of commercial forestry, while delivering remarkable monetary benefits.
Green Economy Concept that Sadaharitha has adopted mitigates global warming and is defined by United Nations as one that improves human well-being while reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.
The company has provided over 900 direct green employment opportunities and introduced innovative forest-based income generation to the villagers living in areas adjacent to the Sadaharitha forests. Sadaharitha Plantations will soon be celebrating 15 years in the business of commercial forestry in Sri Lanka.

NFF condemns police attack on university students
The National Freedom Front (NFF) yesterday condemned the police attack on the university students who were protesting against the SAITM private medical college on Wednesday.
Addressing the media at the NFF office yesterday, National Freedom Front Organiser MP Jayantha Samaraweera said the Wednesdays attack on university students was the worst attack in history.
Around 96 students, including females injured in the police attack on the protest campaign held at the Health Ministry, demanding the government to abolish SAITM, Malabe, are receiving treatment at the National Hospital, Colombo, he said.
Samaraweera said the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister who failed to solve the matter through discussions put the students lives in danger.
He alleged the ministers who have accepted the bribes of the owner of SAITM are attempting to legalise it. President Mithripala Sirisena should take the responsibility of solving the issue accepting the recommendations of the Medical Council, Samaraweera said.

North Korea tests new missile engine, US officials say

North Korea has tested a new rocket engine as part of its efforts to build a missile capable of reaching the American mainland, US officials said.
The news comes amidrising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang overthe North's nuclear ambitions.
The Trump administration has made the issue one of its top priorities.
Despiteinternational condemnation, North Korea has increased its missile tests, with the aim of developing an intercontinental nuclear-armed rocket.
The US Defense Intelligence Agency warned last month that North Korea was on an "inevitable" path to achieving this.
US officials speaking anonymously to several news agencies said the latest engine test, on Thursday, could be one stage of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) engine that would be able to reach the US.
Due to the secretive nature of all of North Korea's military activity, it is hard for experts to assess how close the country is to building a reliable ICBM.
North Korea's missiles - what do we know
North Korean missilescan already reach South Korea or Japan, both countries have a US military presence.
A missile to reach the US mainland is in development but it's not clear what stage the project is at.
North Korea has conducted severalsuccessful nuclear tests.
But it's thought they have not yet managed to build a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a missile.
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday urged China to use more diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang "if they want to prevent further escalation in the region".
China is seen as North Korea's main ally and the US hopes Beijing can have greater influence on the totalitarian state to stop both its missile tests and nuclear programme.
US President Donald Trump has said he would like to solve the North Korea crisis diplomatically, but has previously warned thata "major, major conflict" is possible.
Tensions spiked once again last week when US student Otto Warmbier who was serving a hard labour sentence in North Korea for stealing a propaganda sign,died shortly after returning home in a coma.
The US has also ramped up its military presence in the region, conducting drills with Japan as well as South Korea, and is installing a controversial missile defence system in South Korea, known as Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad).
But South Korea recently said it was suspending the further deployment of the system until an environmental assessment was completed.

One death too many
Recent media reports said that over 60,000 persons were afflicted with Dengue Fever (DF) since the beginning of this year. Half of this number is from the Western province. The number of deaths has also reached a record high which exceeds 160 since the beginning of this year.
However statistics alone does not point to the human tragedy behind them. They are like dead wood which can be broken down at will to suit anyones interest. That is why politicians often use the same statistics to prove even opposing trends. Like the devil quoting scriptures to suit his purpose, they would quote statistics to prove that they were or are better managers of the disease than their opponents. That is why celebrated American writer and humorist Mark Twain said there are three types of lies  lies, damn lies and statistics.
One may quote statistics to prove that the death rate is declining but the question is that from the human point of view, from the point of view of members of the family or the next of kin even one death is too many. It is they that suffer most from such unfortunate developments. The fact that fewer deaths are taking place in society is no consolation to the members of the bereaved family. That is why the target should be zero avoidable deaths and nothing else.
Epidemic level
One may classify death from Dengue fever as a natural death. Yet it is not so strictly speaking since the causes giving rise to the disease are mostly man made or results of human action.
It was in the early 1960s that dengue fever was discovered in Sri Lanka. But then it was an isolated and sporadic phenomenon. It began to spread substantially during 2004-07 period. Now it has reached an epidemic level, a fact not so highlighted by the authorities.
It must be said that authorities, especially governments in power since then did not pursue in earnest the cause of prevention and eradication of the disease. Though much has been said and fanciful programmes were laid bare for the same nothing materialized. Cuba, one of the few countries that have successfully fought against DF offered us generous assistance. Cuban specialists visited the country thrice at their own expense and conducted surveys and handed over reports recommending measures to be taken to combat the disease. They promised to give BTI, a bio-agent destroying the breeding grounds of the Aides mosquito. But the government was not interested.
The message conveyed by a former Health Minister to the Cuban Ambassador was that Sri Lanka could manage on its own. However, due to public agitation and appeals to the President of the country a small amount of BTI was brought down but was left unused in the stores almost till the expiry date. Vested interests as well as a section of misguided professionals too objected to the use of BTI. Even a local manufacturer was not given permission to proceed with the production of BTI locally. However, BTI was imported from the United States and used in the Colombo Municipal region with no protests. It is sad to note that a proposal from Cuba to build a factory for the production of BTI still remains without being pursued by the Sri Lankan authorities despite the current severe epidemic of DF. So much for the commitment of politicians!
The gravity of the problem is still not understood. Official statistics show only the tip of the iceberg. There are many more unreported DF cases. Those that seek treatment from the native physicians or others as well as un-hospitalized patients are not taken into account. There may also be DF patients who were not recognized as such by physicians.
Often there is a misconception that DF is a mere health hazard. It is much more. It is an environmental issue and a social issue by now. It affects several spheres of the material life of society including health, education, labour, productivity etc.
Non-comprehension of the problem in toto has resulted in our inability to develop a holistic approach for combatting it. Only partial solution and primitive methods have been used so far. Nor is there any agreement on what is to be done. Combatting DF requires several methods. It is not enough to rely on only one or two methods of reducing the Aedes mosquito population. Recently a Chief Minister has declared that fumigation is not a successful method and decried its use. It is true that fumigation alone is not sufficient. But it in association with other methods could successfully limit the spread of the disease. Now the government is contemplating importing BTI from Australia. Good. But what about producing it locally and assisting the local private entrepreneur who wanted to do so
State and private hospitals
This column has repeatedly emphasized the futility of militaristic and bureaucratic methods in combatting the spread of DF and called for public mobilization in cleaning the environment. It is heartening to hear that the SLFP youth have decided to join that effort en masse. Let us hope that other political parties would also follow the lead given by the SLFP youth.
At this moment when the masses are faced with a double disaster  foods and DF, it is high time that the Government divert funds for eradicating DF by cutting down wasteful expenditure and postponing cosmetic projects such as city beautification and concentrate on ensuring sound health for the masses.
Though statistics do not portray the present situation correctly, it is graphically portrayed by the overcrowding at both State and private hospitals. The Hospital for Fever patients at Angoda, the Colombo North and South Teaching Hospitals, the Jayawardhanapura Hospital are all full to the brim that patients are turned away without being admitted. In these hospitals several DF patients share a single bed and some are under the bed or on the floor elsewhere. Few fortunate get a chair to sit. It is said that in pediatric wards five sick children are in two beds joined together. In all these instances it is the poor and the poorest of the poor that suffer most.
It is very unfortunate that no one- neither the public nor the leaders of the government, who never ceases to praise the dedication of the Armed Services personnel in a past war ever open their mouths in praise of healthcare workers from the consultant to the minor employee who are performing Herculean task of looking after thrice the usual number of patients they handle with no respite. Perhaps they are being blinded by the political hatred with which they view the GMOA over differences in their perception of the SAITM crisis. The media too seems to follow the same policy.

Debate on SAITM issue postponed
Parliament adjourned yesterday at 4 pm and sittings fixed for today as Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena was not in the House to move the adjournment motion on the Issue of SAITM and the clash took place on Wednesday.
The government had agreed to allow the Joint Opposition to move an adjournment motion on the matter since MP Dinesh Gunawardena requested the government since the matter has become a matter of national importance as the GMOA has launched a strike. He said the Joint Opposition members discussed the matter on Wednesday evening and needed to debate the matter in Parliament.
"The students who went to the Health Ministry on the public day were assaulted and many of them were hospitalised," MP Gunawardena said. "The GMOA has launched a strike and those except for the Dengue patients are not being treated in hospitals," he said.
He said the matter affect around 8,000 medical students in the country and it was a national issue. "So we need a debate on the matter," MP Gunawardena said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he had been informed earlier of the motion.
Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the government was ready give an adjournment motion at 5.30 pm yesterday itself.
When MP Gunawardena said the House could be adjourned at 4.30 pm to give more time for the matter which is of great importance to the country, Parliament agreed to adjourn the sittings at 4.30 pm to give more time for the adjournment motion.
The debate on the Notification under the Excise Ordinance came to an end at 4 pm and presiding member Ananda Kumarasiri called to move the adjournment motion. As the member to move the adjournment motion was not present in the House, sittings postponed for today.
Anura Kumara points out conflict of interest:
Aligayawanna called on to step down from one of his portfolios
There is a conflict of interest in Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna holding the Chairmanship of Committee on Public Accounts, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
Speaking at the debate in Parliament yesterday he requested Alagiyawanna to step down from either of his portfolios. He said there were clear discrepancies in the Finance Ministry records and he called on the COPA to look into the Ministry records, particularly the 2016 annual report.
MP Dissanayake demanded Alagiyawanna to decide between the two portfolios as it was a conflict of interest to hold both. The MP said the National Lotteries Board Act clearly indicates that it should be under the Finance Ministry, and therefore handing it over to the Foreign Ministry without amending the Act is a clear violation of the law.
He requested the attention of the President and the Prime Minister to the matter.
COPA report No. 2 to be presented today
The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) will present its second report to Parliament today.
It comprises findings on 31 public institutions including three special investigations carried out between May and October, 2016.
On behalf of the Committee, its Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanna will table the report at the commencement of sittings today. The COPA presented its first report to the 8th Parliament in September last year.

A Perfect Match
It came as a great surprise. No one imagined the 39-year-old Prince would ever marry. He was seen as an awkward and introverted guy, kind of boring, and certainly not a suave Prince Charming with a love life ripe for press articles. So they left him alone.
Prince Philippe, the then heir to the Belgian throne put this freedom to good use. He managed to date a 26-year-old speech therapist from the Belgian nobility for three years in secret. The announcement of their engagement in September 1999, left the country clamoring for the couples photocall - the press didnt even have a good recent photograph of the new future Queen.
Of course, there were rumors right away that this was an arranged marriage. Philippe denied it when he met the press, saying that no one had introduced Mathilde to him and that it was indeed love at first sight (those rumors about a proposal are still hanging around today, after four children and more than a decade of marriage). It was a fairly perfect match: Mathilde dUdekem was young and pretty, came from a good background (she was a jonkvrouw, a lower grade of nobility), she had an honorable career, and she possessed enough warmth and charisma to spill some over to her stiff husband. Plus, she was actually born in Belgium (She will be the first-ever Belgian-born queen consort).
As Duke of Brabant, Philippe was carefully groomed to be king, with training as a fighter pilot followed by studies in constitutional history at Oxford and political science at Stanford. But he appeared stiff and forced in public appearances. Good natured laughter over the crown prince, as the Flemish newspaper De Standaard said, became almost a national sport.
The daughter of a judge and a countess, Mathilde was his opposite. As a young adult, Mathilde volunteered with organizations for the disabled, spent time as an au pair, and went backpacking with friends in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. After the announcement of their engagement, Mathilde won over hearts and minds and was looked on as the ideal bride for the reticent Philippe.
The wedding was held in December and included plenty of movement - to the Brussels Town Hall for the civil wedding, and then to the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula for the religious wedding, and then on to the reception - so a winter coat dress was called for. Obviously, a Belgian designer was needed to add to this national celebration, and Edouard Vermeulen of Natan was the choice. The coat he created was a silk crepe design with a tall collar and long sleeves. At the front, it closed with buttons and had a trim line around the waist. The coat covered a simple sheath dress beneath. At the back, the coat swept out to a long and dramatic train, 4 or 5 meters in length, which took some effort to manage in the course of an active wedding day. On top of the train rested the veil, a family heirloom from Queen Paolas family dating back to 1877. Mathildes tiara was on loan from Queen Paola as well. It is said, Queen Paola never loans her tiaras to anyone. So this was a special occasion indeed.
The big, informal party at the Laeken Palace held after the wedding ceremony saw the participation of 1,000 ordinary Belgians invited from every corner of the nation.
Every single citizen in Belgium was happy. Everyone knew Mathilde with her youth, charisma, and beauty, will bring a breath of fresh air into the stuffy royal household. As the mayor of Brussels during the civil wedding ceremony said, the whole of Belgium had fallen for her charms!

## Title: A retirement age for politicos

A retirement age for politicos
Executive Director of PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi has called for a retirement age for all Sri Lankan politicians saying that most of our politicos have stuck in their toes and refusing to budge even when they are long in the tooth. He said that there were some politicians who should be consigned to wheel chairs but are still staying put due to the greed for power. Such politicians, he opines, hinder the opportunity for youth to come to the fore to serve the country. He wants a ceiling placed on the age for political office though this should not necessarily mean that all politicians should retire at 55 or 60 as in the case of the public and private sector.
Hettiarachchis recommendation, no doubt, would be received with mixed sentiments. He certainly would not be a favourite with some of our members in the August Assembly, who have long passed their expiry date. There will also be those who will contend that long experience in the field is a sine quo non, in order to mature as a fully fledged politician who could serve the public better. Those who are of this school of thought would refer to the case of JRJ who became Head of State when he just passed the biblical life span of three score and ten years. This was after remaining nearly half a century in politics holding ministerial office under three UNP governments prior to that. Sirima Bandaranaike too played a long innings and was indeed wheel chair bound when she died in harness. Others such as Maithripala Senanayake, T.B. Illangaratne. Dr. N.M. Perera served long years as politicians, and it must be said, made noteworthy contributions towards the country. What is more, these politicians were repeatedly elected by the people despite their age, some of them even defeating youthful candidates fielded by the other side.
True, as the PAFFREL head contends, a majority of our politicians are on the threshold of senility, if not already there, and should be put to pasture. Some of their conduct in recent times definitely suggest that old age has taken a toll on their faculties. Equally, it is true that we cannot write-off all politicians in general merely because age has caught up with them. With age comes wisdom and Sri Lanka could do with political leaders who have accumulated loads of wisdom. With age also comes cunning and, regrettably, it is this trait that one sees more often in our politicians, going by past experience. We are aware of at least one political leader in the recent past who went out of his way to extend his tenure in office, indefinitely, so it was said, to pave the way for his progeny to pick the baton, possibly when he had reached a ripe old age. The PAFFREL chief perhaps may have had such individuals in mind when he made his suggestion for a retirement age for politicians.
Be that as it may, many would agree with Hettiarachchis claim that aging politicians were blocking the entry of youth into politics, read parliament, but not all. Youth have to be guided by experienced hands and it is only mature politicians, who have acquired the skills with long years in the field are capable of doing this. Hence, one should guard against throwing the baby with the bath water. If all politicians of retirement age are to make way for youth there is certainly going to be disorder and mayhem, given the scenario now being witnessed on the streets.
On the contrary, it is the new entrants who are responsible for the riotous scenes presently witnessed in parliament and not the veterans. True, this conduct may be attributed to youthful exuberance and cannot be exactly faulted. But if Hettiarachchi feels that parliament will be a better place if youth representation is increased at the expense of aging politicians he indeed is mistaken. We had youth representation in its entirety in the JVP when the party won nearly 40 seats at the 2004 General Election with most members even appointed Cabinet Ministers under CBK. It is difficult to gauge if the country gained in anyway by such a large infusion of youth into parliamentary politics. Which goes to show that bringing youth into politics is not the panacea of all ills. The countrys problems need speedy solutions which require experienced handling and it is only those politicians who have matured with age could cope with the challenge.
On the other hand, one has to admit that there is certainly deadwood in the present parliament who needed to weeded out and replaced with fresh faces. These MPs, as mentioned before, are merely marking time till the time is ripe to make way for their kith and kin to join in the gravy train. They, no doubt, are a burden on the country and a drain on its finances. More than a retirement age, it would be ideal if a MP is debarred to contest election after a specific term in parliament. This, while giving them a honourable exit, would also ensure no family tree thrives.

Sai Nathane Varuga Varuga at New Kathiresan Hall
For the first time the life of Shirdi Sai Baba will be presented in a dance drama in Tamil. This dance drama titled "Sai Nathane Varuga Varuga" will be staged at New Kathiresan Hall, Colombo on June 24 at 6 pm. as a fundraiser for building a Shirdi Sai Baba temple in Avissawella. This drama is produced by Sri Shirdi Baba Trust which has taken up the task of building the Baba temple.
Sai Nathane Varuga Varuga has been scripted, conceptualised and choreographed by Kala Suri Thivya Sujen.

Close to 40 dancers from Sri Lanka, Trichy and Vellore are being passionately trained by Sujen. She feels that at every step in this project she is being guided by Baba, and thus this is a project very close to her heart.
The music for this event has been composed by the eminent Violin Maestro Lalgudi GJR Krishnan. Krishnan feels the divine presence of the Guru in every note, and feels that it is a blessing to have been able to be a part of this project.
The common adage is that it is always the Guru who chooses the disciple -- thus, all the musicians who are featured in the recording are Sai devotees. This project was recorded in Chennai at Re sound India with leading artists and professionals. The head of the studio, Sai Sravanam, is an accomplished audio engineer and a sensitive musician rolled into one. The brilliant musicians who gave their best under the direction of Lalgudi GJR Krishnan are Mayavaram Viswanathan (mridangam), Ganapathy (mridangam & percussion), Srikanth Gopalakrishnan (vocal), Keerthana (vocal), Karthika (vocal), Padma Shankar (violin), Bavaniprasad (veena), Sruthisagar (flute), Enjikkudi Subramaniam (nadaswaram) and Kishore (sitar).
Sujen said that she is grateful to Sri Shirdi Baba Trust for this magical journey.
Every one of us feel that we are fortunate to be a part of this production. I am extremely thankful to Lalgudi Krishnan, Sai Shravanam and all the musicians for their valuable contribution. We the dancers are really working hard to make the production a wholesome one.
The rasikas who are fortunate to witness this dance drama are bound to be transported to another world. The experience will be enriching, leaving `their eyes moist and their hearts full.
The task of building a temple for Shirdi Sai Baba is as formidable as it is noble. We hope to see you in large numbers and seek the support of each one of you to contribute your mite so that the dream of a temple becomes a reality soon," she added. -TS

SL doctor loses appeal over manslaughter of abusive husband
A Sri Lankan-born doctor who was jailed after being found guilty of killing her abusive husband has failed in her bid to have her conviction and sentence overturned.
Chamari Liyanage was sentenced to a four-year prison term after being convicted by a jury in February last year of unlawfully killing Dinendra Athukorla in Geraldton in 2014.
She was released on parole in March this year after a protracted fight to reinstate her visa to stay in Australia.
Liyanage appealed against her conviction and sentence, but today in a unanimous decision, three Appeal Court judges dismissed her arguments.
She was not in court for the judgement.
During her trial, she maintained that she remembered nothing of what happened to her husband, with the court hearing the couples five-year marriage was defined by the worst kind of escalating sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
She testified she had tried to leave her husband six times, but was trapped in a cycle of abuse with someone who was a monster.
She was eligible for parole in July last year, but did not seek release because her visa at that time had been revoked and she would have been deported to Sri Lanka.
It is understood Liyanage has voluntarily agreed to suspend her medical licence.
In its decision to dismiss Liyanages appeal against her sentence, the court said the term she received was appropriate.
The sentence imposed was a significantly lesser term than the sentences usually imposed for the offence of manslaughter, even in the presence of significant mitigating factors, the judgement read.
The sentence is not arguably manifestly excessive, either as to the type of sentence or the length of the term of immediate imprisonment which was imposed. ABC News

SLIM holds CSR project on blood and organ donation
Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the national body for marketing held a community driven CSR project, blood and human organs donation campaign for the second occasion recently at the SLIM Business School in Colombo.
The campaign was organised with the objective of inculcating qualities of empathy and social responsibility within SLIM students. Through this campaign SLIM encouraged its students and stake-holders to donate blood and sign up to donate human organs to the sick, less fortunate and needy people in the society.
Thus, eyes and tissue donations were amalgamated with the blood donation programme. It was significant that SLIM students showed much eagerness to sign-up for the donation of eyes, tissues and limbs to the needy.
In accordance to its vision, SLIM is poised to elevate the status of marketing in the country in a socially responsible manner. The business model of SLIM thus looks beyond mere financial management and measurements, and to be in harmony with factors which nurture this blue planet that our people inherit.
In line with this objective, SLIM embarks on society driven CSR programmes from time to time adhering to the triple bottom line; society, economy and environment.
SLIM and Colombo SLIM Students Association organized the Blood Donation campaign together with the National Blood Transfusion Service, Human Tissue Bank and Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society.
The drive was carried out with the theme, Be a Hero, implying the opportunity for everyone to make a difference by saving lives.
SLIM CEO and Executive Director Sanath Senanayake said that all SLIM activities adhere to the core objective of adding value to the marketing sphere and elevating the status of marketing in the country.
SLIM conducted this blood and organs donation campaign to shed light on social responsibility. True marketers always make emphasis on social responsibility. CSR projects such as these add value to the effort made by SLIM in elevating the status of marketing in Sri Lanka. We groom students to become fully fledged marketers who could marvel in the global context.
Thus we inculcate qualities such as empathy and social responsibility in them, in addition to professional training, said Senanayake.
Credible and value adding training programmes, tutoring and multiple support sessions of SLIM have been endorsed by the marketing fraternity and the corporate sector in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has opened immediate talks with three countries to procure a rice tranche to stabilise its domestic markets.
We are looking for par-boiled (Nadu) and Samba categories now Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said yesterday.
The Minister met Thailands Ambassador designate Chulamanee Chartsuwan, Indonesias Ambassador Gusti Ngurah Ardiyasa and Pakistans acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Ahmad Khan Sipra at the Ministry..
We are keen to procure rice for Sri Lanka from you through a Government to Government process, but are open for your private sectors support as well if necessary. The Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) will be the focal point for this effort and will be in contact with you continuously. After one of you are picked as the supplier of this volume, based on a transparent international procurement process, our expert team consisting of my officials, food technologists, and rice experts will arrive in your country to inspect and certify the entire stock before it would be shipped to Colombo.
We are looking for par-boiled (Nadu) and Samba categories at this moment. We can start with 300,000 metric tonnes. Even if Sri Lanka would choose one of you as the supplier in this case and leave the others, we are still eagerly looking forward to enhance bilateral trade with all of you-in many other ways,Bathiudeen told the ambassadors.
All the Ambassadors pledged immediate support to the Presidents efforts to procure the rice tranche.
They also clarified the processes of Government to Government procurement at a time like this in their respective nations to Minister Bathiudeen and Ministry Secretary Lokuhetti.

Sri Lankan baby elephant gets international attention [Video]

The elephant donated to South Korea by the Sri Lankan government in 2010 got quite a fright when her baby fell into a pool at the Grand Park Zoo in Seoul, South Korea.
The footage recorded by the zoo shows the curious one-year-old elephant  christened Korilanka to mark the ties between Sri Lanka and Korea  getting close to the waters edge and accidentally tumbling in.
Fortunately, the baby elephant was not actually drowning, says Joyce Poole, a National Geographic explorer and co-founder of Elephant Voices: When elephants swim, they put their trunk out of the water and continue to breathe.
In the video, the National Geographic reports, the baby can be seen doing this snorkelling behaviourmeaning it was in no imminent danger.
Even though the family knows the baby can swim, they are still clearly alarmed it has fallen in without meaning to, as evidenced by their quickly flapping ears, says Poole.
Even the elephant in the background of the video, separated by a fence, starts rapidly pacing back and forth. Elephants are drama queens, especially the females. If anything kind of dramatic happens in the family, it is cause for great excitement, Poole explains.
It is part of the bonding process. The uniquely close family bonds and capacity for empathy of elephants is evident in this display.
Only one of the female elephants that helps the baby is its parent, the mother.
The other larger, older elephant that springs into action to help, a 36-year-old, is a bonded family member that gets just as worried about the infant as its own mother.
National Geographic points out that in the wild, the older female elephant would likely be a grandmother or aunt of the baby, but in captivity, unrelated elephants are housed together and still form close bonds.
In the video, the two bonded females are clearly close as they coordinate to help the baby out of the water and back to the safety of dry land, the National Geographic reports.
When watching these videos it is always good to remember elephants are complex social creatures with large families in the wild and captivity can be rough on them, Poole says.
When a video like this goes viral, people say how cute it is, but these animals are living very tough lives.

Sri Lanka's food gap widens in wake of floods and drought: UN

An extreme drought followed by floods has affected large swathes of cropland in Sri Lanka, United Nations agencies reported today, warning that the disaster threatens the food security of 900,000 people.
Having lost their crops to drought and floods, Sri Lanka's most vulnerable groups are struggle to earn an income, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP).
Following the bad harvests, many, the agencies add, are forced to buy food from local markets.
As access for families to nutritious food has been reduced  forcing many to eat less  prices at local markets have risen sharply, with rice prices reaching an all-time high in January.
Now, nearly 225,000 households (or about 900,000 people) face food insecurity, the UN agencies say.
A previous joint assessment showed that in 10 districts about one third of the drought-affected population had its regular income reduced by more than half.
To cover immediate needs, FAO and WFP are calling in the current Crop and Food Security Assessment for the urgent provision of seeds, as well as planting and irrigation equipment for the next planting season, from September to December, as well as to support irrigation systems.
Additionally, both agencies recommend quick and targeted cash assistance for the poorest and most vulnerable families to ensure adequate food intake and to prevent them from incurring unsustainably high debt or adopting other coping mechanisms that could have long-term negative effects.
Rice production to drop by nearly 40 per cent in 2017
Based on findings in the report, which assesses the seriousness of a crisis situation by looking at the food produced nationally and the extent to which poor people can meet their basic food needs, both agencies argue that drought conditions in 2016 and early 2017 led to widespread crop failures, in particular for rice paddy  the country's staple food.
Total paddy production in 2017 is forecast at 2.7 million metric tonnes, almost 40 per cent less than the last year's output and 35 per cent lower than the average of the previous five years.
Following last month's severe flooding and landslides, the agencies note that the heavy rains did not ease the water supply constraints in the drought-impacted north-central and eastern parts of the South Asian country.
Looking ahead, the situation may further deteriorate if the next cropping season fails. Current predictions show the second 2017 paddy harvest  known as Yala, due to be harvested in August and September is forecast at 1.2 million metric tonnes, 24 per cent below last year's level.

Systemic failures and growing public disenchantment
Not everything has collapsed. Most people have running water on their taps. Shops carry enough daily provisions. Electricity and telecommunication systems are functioning. Public hospitals provide basic healthcare and so on. These are specialized systems providing critical services. Yet, most slow moving systems in the country have continued to stagnate and at times, even become dysfunctional. Examples for the latter are education, disaster preparedness, urban planning, criminal justice, local and national governance, environmental protection and social welfare.
But, the present quality of life and future prospects of a population depends more on the efficacy of the slow moving systems. Faced with a myriad of fast changing social, economic and environmental problems, politicians and ordinary people remain preoccupied with urgent, day-to-day problems rather than exploring possibilities for reforming slow moving systems. They often do not see the connection between slow moving systems on one hand and the day-to-day problems they face on the other. Since ordinary people cannot wait for long term solutions to their problems, or till we remove underlying causes of their problems, it is necessary to find short term remedies to pressing issues like homelessness, poverty and displacement. Yet, we know that systemic problems also need to be addressed through long term plans and interventions. But what is obvious today is that there are serious problems with both.
Most of the social, economic, political and environmental problems we face today are the result of the failure of slow moving systems. While climate change is an underlying factor in the deteriorating environmental conditions in the country, our failure to manage environmental resources in a sustainable manner in the recent past has also contributed a great deal. Cutting down forests, irresponsible use of land for agricultural and settlement purposes, particularly in catchment areas, mismanagement of water resources, etc. are cases in point. The growing population in the country has been spread out across the land mass through sub-optimal resettlement schemes, making it virtually impossible to provide social infrastructure in an effective manner, be it protection from wild elephants or provision of transport.
Modern society
Similarly, our failure to reform the education system in line with the imperatives of a modern society has wide ranging ramifications but there are no short term remedies to problems that it has given rise to. When we face problems, we blame individuals who hold important positions, often without realizing that individuals are the products of systems.
As is well known, corruption has become endemic in this country. But there are countries that have stamped out corruption even in the Asian region. They have done so by adopting a policy of zero tolerance and establishing effective legal and administrative systems to curb it. In this country, we have failed miserably in this regard.
Taking another example, our education system has become a serious problem rather than a solution to many of the problems we face, be it preparing younger generations for enlightened social citizenship or equipping them with skills, aptitudes and world-views that are necessary to function and flourish in a changing society. While many people continue to use or even abuse the education system to achieve their personal goals, be it upward mobility or employment, the larger societal goals like innovation, creativity and national identity have fallen by the wayside. Despite the general recognition of the need for promoting multilingualism among youth through education, we have failed miserably to do so. Meanwhile, many international schools have been established across the country to promote English language education and these naturally benefit the well to do at the expense of lower income groups, contributing to widening social disparities.
National planning system
National planning system in the country has virtually collapsed by now. Those who believe in the magical powers of the market do not appreciate the critical role that the State has to play in the social regulation of the market. There is enough evidence from around the world that, left entirely to the market forces, many economic and social problems get worse, be it income distribution, wasteful and harmful private consumption, environmental damage or the lack of access to social protection. In such a scenario, people run around looking for private solutions, as is evident from hundreds of thousands of youth migrating overseas or moving into the informal sector, both of which do not pave the way for a stable or contented future.
And finally, on paper, we have a three tier governance structure but, in actual fact, the centralized, top heavy nature of the political system continues, making the lower tiers often irrelevant. Despite all the efforts in the past to revamp it, local government system is in a sorry state today. In many countries around the world, local government institutions make the living environment of citizens clean, orderly, healthy and safe. Yet, in this country, we have not empowered local councils to be effective, efficient and responsive in addressing local issues, be it environmental sanitation, building regulation or maintenance of infrastructure.
This gap became all too evident during recent environmental disasters in the country. Here, not only long term planning failed but also disaster response was ill-coordinated. Those who are affected by the floods and landslides know that long term recovery is going to be difficult, at times agonizing, at least partly due to inadequate state response. Many people come out to provide immediate relief but there is often little by way of sustained support for long term recovery. This is the experience of many people who were affected by the 2004 Tsunami.
So far, in this article, an attempt had been made to demonstrate, with a few illustrative examples, how governments often have failed to offer sustainable solutions to societal issues through long term planning. Many more examples can be looked at but the point has been made. The failure is partly due to ideological reasons and partly due to the fire fighting mode the political leaders constantly find themselves in. In the absence of any sustained improvement in the life chances of ordinary people and their children, many people remain disgruntled despite all the fire fighting that the politicians are engaged in. On the other hand, if a regime at least starts to steadily move in the direction of long term planning and sustained systemic change, many enlightened citizens and other progressive forces are more than likely to appreciate the effort, leading to a favourable public discussion on the subject. Unfortunately, this is not what we observe today.

Ven.Gnanasara withdraws FR petition
The Fundamental Rights petition filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven.Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera seeking an Interim Order preventing Police from arresting him over several allegations was yesterday withdrawn before Supreme Court by the petitioner.
Presidents Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera moved Court to withdraw the petition since his client has obtained bail.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Upaly Abeyratne and Justice Vijith Malalgoda decided to performa dismiss the petition without any hearing.
Filing a Fundamental Rights petition through counsel, Gnanasara Thera sought an Interim Order preventing the Organized Crimes Prevention Division from arresting him until the investigations against him concluded and advice of the Attorney General is obtained in this regard. Gnanasara Thera has cited the OIC of Organized Crimes Prevention Division and three others as the respondents.
He further sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 13(1) and 14(h) of the constitution have been violated by the respondents.
The petitioner stated that there is an island wide search for him to apprehend and arrest him and number of police teams have been deployed island wide for this purpose.
Gnanasara Thera had been released on bail on Wednesday (21) regarding two cases after being produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court.

It is organized by Forerunner AG National Youth Ministries along with other denomination churches with the purpose of uniting Christian youth spread across the nation, the trilingual Leadership Conference will be held on August 25 and 26 at Peoples Church Narahenpita.
This year more than 1,250 youth leaders from all denominations will come together as the Sound of Heaven on earth in an effort to empower the future of our nation to bring positive change. The two-day conference will feature sessions conducted by the Nations Institute & Youth for the Nations, Director Christ, Chris Estrada from Dallas, Texas, Youth Alive Australia, Director, Cameron Bennett, the Youth Alive band from Australia and prominent youth leaders from Sri Lanka.

In a generation driven by violence, oppression, injustice, and crime, the younger generation is called to raise a voice of hope to the nation. The conference and workshops create the first platform to thus empower the youth.

Wine..!
Twas a fancy restaurant we went to. The waiter not only had stiff upper lip, but same surgeon had turned his nose up in the air too. What will you have sir he smirked.
Wine! I said
Which one
Red!
Which one sir
Any wine thats red! I said pleasantly.
Whats with the wine asked the wife under her breath.
Good for the heart, I whispered and smiled at the waiter. I waited till stiff upper lip along with equally stiff nose marched off, then rummaged in my pocket.
You didnt bring your wallet the wife asked worried.
No, Im looking for that piece on red wine!
You brought it along with you
To show you, I said pleasantly, realizing red wine was making me pleasant even before I drank it.
Why didnt you show it to me at home
Thought Id show it, when I drank it, I said then managed to bring out the crumpled piece of paper, See what it says, I said. I didnt bring my glasses, said the wife, You read!
I didnt bring mine, I said, Waiter will you read this for madam
Stiff upper lip fell, upturned nose also.
Waiter!
Sir
Could you please read this for madam!
I dont read English sir! whispered crestfallen waiter and fled. Red wine, I noticed, made humble the proud, even before it was touched. I marveled at its qualities. It is good wine! I said.
You havent had a sip yet!
I can feel it I whispered, its effects are awesome!
I sipped the wine. I continued sipping it. I sipped second glass and then the third. The wife watched unhappily, What does the paper say about how much you should drink she asked as the waiter with suddenly fixed smile watched me try to read without glasses somewhat shakily from small printed page. I cant read, I said finally.
You cant read English sir asked the waiter happily. He cant read English! announced the waiter to his colleague and to some Russians in the next table, who smiled sympathetically at him.
Of course I can, I said angrily and got up from my table.
We walked out of the restaurant; there was red wine on the waiters nose.
How did the red wine get onto the waiters nose I asked next day as I nursed a terrible hangover.
Through your fist! said the wife, Red wine good for heart, but not good for mans temper!
Also not good for wallet..! I whispered as I paid lawyer, then surgeon to get waiters nose back to stiff upper position.
