JVP campaigns against alleged move to sell state assets
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will launch a public awareness campaign from today against what it terms as government efforts to sell key state assets.
JVP leader Anura Dissanayake addressing the media in Colombo yesterday vowed to galvanise people against the move and said its public awareness campaign will start today from the Colombo Fort.
He said selling state assets was not the answer to the governments economic woes. The government should make a honest appraisal about its performance during the last two years and try to rectify mistakes.
The JVP leader also slammed a proposed move to hand over a majority of shares of the Hambantota port to a Chinese company and also a decision to lease 15,000 acres in Hambantota to another Chinese company to set up a trade zone.
The people elect a government to use resources in the country with a good management for the development.
However, this government is selling and sacrificing the most important resources that belong to the people. As a political party and trade union movement, we would begin a street struggle against governments policy of selling and sacrificing countrys resources, he said.
Dissanayake said the JVP will hold a massive protest in Hambantota on January 5 against the the move.

Government trying to scuttle free education: CTSU General Secretary
Ceylon Teachers Services Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said yesterday this government is trying to scuttle the free education in a very subtle manner.
These attempts should be defeated to save free education. We are carrying out awareness programme to apprise the people in this threat to free education.
The government tries to privatise education system. Some Education ministry officials said schools will be turned into profit making centers. This is the first step of ending free education.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday , he said profit making means a business and this is how the government that promised to uplift free education is working.
We will protest on the streets with the people to defeat the conspiracy of destroying the free education, he said. As the first step to this, We will distribute leaflets among the parents to create awareness on this issue. We will also collect signatures from parents for a petition against the destruction of free education.
The government has placed an additional burden on the parents by collecting money for the various school projects.
Already at the beginning of this year, money is being collected from parents for painting schools.
Although the government initially promised to reserve 6 percent of the GDP for education, this has actually come down to two percent this year from 2.7 percent last year.
Commenting on the issue that around 300 children have been admitted to grade one classes in the Western Province schools by the Chief Minister, he said grade one classes in 26 schools have newly been started last year for admitting politicians children and their cronies.
We would like to ask the government the way these children were admitted to schools.

Addressing a meeting at the Hall de Galle in Galle, the minister said the country's march towards development had been blocked by communalism.
It was people of the north who suffered most from the war. War had become anathema for the northern people. The north today has no place for an armed struggle or separatism, the minister said. He said he has few friends in the political field trying to spread communal hatred for political gain.
He requested them fervently not to try and jeopardise the unity in the country. "No one would be allowed to take the country towards a war situation again," he said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the ceremony to lay the foundation stone for the Volkswagen motor assembly plant in Kuliyapitiya yesterday said that the people had to choose between providing jobs to the youth through foreign investments or handing the country once again over to a group which robbed the state of its resources. He observed that the people of the country had sacrificed immensely from the time of the war and that it was the duty of all political parties to help provide the people with the benefits they deserve.
They should all work for the countrys progress, the Prime Minister said.
The ceremony was presided over by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Prime Minister further stated, Many have asked me when the motor vehicle manufacturing plant in Kuliyapitiya was to start. They ridiculed it. The establishment of the plant can be taken as one of the first decisions taken by President Sirisena soon after he took office. Thereafter, we embarked on the path to establish a motor vehicle manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka. Though we
received permission to go ahead, the project was delayed by a year due not being able to find suitable land for it. The plant has the capacity to provide around 2,500 direct jobs. Prior to this, I participated in the opening of the Pannala Marks Company, the Prime Minister said. The company initially has the capacity to provide 3,000 jobs. Once we regain the GSP plus concession, it will be able to provide 2000 more jobs. On this day alone, we have started projects which will provide close to 7,500 jobs to people, the Premier said.
By next Thursday or Friday, several more factories are scheduled to start, he said.
They will create around 3,000 - 4,000 jobs. The Hambantota development programme this year alone is set to create 10,000 jobs. This shows that within a week alone, we have managed to provide around 20,000 jobs.
The factories which would provide 20,000 jobs will commence before President Maithripala Sirisenas inauguration anniversary on January 8.
Neither the President nor I will be satisfied by that however. The youth of this country need more jobs. For the last 30 years, we have suffered the impacts of war, so our development was restricted. We expected great progress to take place after the war, we hoped that the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers would get together but none of that happened. In the end we decided to choose Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate and take our country towards true development, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
We triumphed even through the suppression of that time. Thereafter, we promised to give the youth jobs. At this point, you must note the state of the country we took over. When we took over, revenue stood at 10 percent of GDP. This was not sufficient to meet our recurrent expenditure or to meet our loan repayments. We could not even beg for that money. Today our income has grown to be able to support our recurrent expenditure, the Prime Minister added.
The country was facing a massive debt burden. Our goal is to reduce that burden by the end of this year. We aim to not hand over that burden to the next generation. The President as well as I are visiting countries around the world to win over their confidence. We have started all programs having established a sound foundation. But there is more to be done. At the end of 2015, the establishment of a national government under the leadership of President Sirisena was just one step in that direction. The speed at which we have moved for several years has not been sufficient, we need to move faster. We have not yet pushed the accelerator to the foot board yet. In the next five years we hope to embark on a great journey and we have the support of all going ahead,Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

Having taken over the Onboard Security Team Operations (OBST) from Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd, the Sri Lanka Navy was able to earn Rs. 2.26 billion for the government from its operations in 2016.
Accordingly, during 2016, the Navy carried out 6,371 ship movements. Out of 6,371 ship movements, 5,928 and 443 movements were derived from the centres in Galle and Colombo.
Meanwhile, since the inception of OBST operations from November 13, 2015 until January 2, 2017, the Navy earned an income of Rs. 2.63 billion for 7,457 ship movements. Galle and Colombo operation centres have carried out 6,922 and 535 movements averaging approximately 573 moves per month.
The Galle and Colombo operation centres look after the receiving, holding and issuing of weapons, ammunition and other related equipment belonging to foreign as well as local On Board Security Teams. The earnings generated through OBST operations are directly deposited in the Consolidated Fund of the Sri Lanka government.
With the annulment of the previous agreement, the Sri Lanka Navy was entrusted the task of providing security to Merchant Vessels and supplying services to Security Firms involved in providing onboard security for Merchant Ships. The Navy took over these duties following a special directive issued by President Maithripala Sirisena. Since taking over the duties, naval personnel were involved in providing services to merchant ships carrying mainly weapons and ammunition. Since taking over these tasks, the Navy ensured that the security requirements of the merchant vessels which are frequenting the High Risk Area (HRA) are provided services efficiently by the naval personnel at Galle and Colombo harbours.

The two-year-old good governance government was not receiving a favourable response at the rallies, Ports and Shipping Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama said.
Addressing a press conference in Galle, Muthuhettigama said the President was making a genuine effort to solve country's problems, and they were supporting his endeavour. But the UNP government members led by the Prime Minister were turning a blind eye to their efforts as if they were deaf. However, they will endeavour to take good governance along the correct track in the future. Muthuhettigama said he was confident that the SLFP would attain a convenient victory at the forthcoming local government elections. He said he made this prediction as a person who reposed great confidence in the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He would also request former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to join their fold to march towards victory together. Mahinda-Maithri unity would be the best to set up a people-friendly government before 2020.
He said he would always endeavour to carry out the duties of his deputy ministerial post to the best of his ability.
He did not belong to the ilk that gave up entrusted responsibilities and reversed. They would do everything possible to prevent the sale of ports to foreigners, he said. Today there were strikes island wide. If this trend continued, they would be in a deep trouble.
Therefore, he would request the President to intervene and resolve those problems, the Deputy Minister said.

He, however, said that all army personnel of the said camp were transferred and new troops from the same regiment were posted within a few hours and therefore, the news item is factually inaccurate.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government would initiate several projects around the country by January 8, which would create over 20,000 jobs.
He was speaking at the ceremony to lay the foundation stone for an automobile assembly factory in Kuliyapitiya yesterday.

He said, both the President and he would travel the world to find the necessary investments to start new projects that would benefit the country: We need to increase our revenue.
Our export foreign exchange is not enough. So we need to bring many foreign exchange generating projects into the country, for that we have to encourage industries and tourism, the Prime Minister explained.
Responding to criticism about the Kuliyapitiya automobile assembly factory the Premier asked if developing this country is wrong and said he was hopeful that the younger generation would buy motor cars manufactured at the Kuliyapitiya factory.
He also took the occasion to assure the public that the remaining debt burden would not be passed to the future generation and that the foundation to fulfill the peoples aspirations would be laid by 2020.
The new factory in Kuliyapitiya was established fulfilling one of the election promises of the national unity government, appointed with a mandate in 2015 to generate about 2,500 new job opportunities in the area.

All French citizens are organ donors, unless they opt out

Every citizen in France has automatically become anorgan donorunless they decide to opt out, due to a significant change in the law.
The new rules, which came into effect on 1 January, sees Frances policy align with a number of European countries such as Spain and Austria, where presumed consent means anyone can become a donor of organs and tissues when they die unless they specifically choose not to.
In France, people will now need to sign up to a newNational Rejection Registerto ensure they do not become organ donors, which medical teams will check at the time of death before considering organ or tissue removal. A total of 150,000 people have already signed up to the register.
If it is not possible to sign up to the register, people can also sign and date a written refusal and leave it with a relative, or make an oral testimony to a relative who will then need to attest this wish to a medical team.
The UK rejected a system of presumed consent in 2008, instead opting for increasing public awareness about organ donation.
This system was overturned in Wales, and in 2015 it become the first UK nation to implement presumed consent.
Outside of Wales, people in the UK must register as a donor, and it is common practice to let a relative know if someone would like to be a donor or not for doctors to take into consideration.
According to NHS Blood and Transplant, 6,416 people are currently waiting for a transplant in the UK. The number of people who have received a transplant since April 2016 is 2,726.

'Minorities get a good deal from the Sri Lankan electoral delimitation panel': Bastianpillai

COLOMBO: Sri Lankas minorities have got a good deal from the Electoral Delimitation Committee, panel member Dr. P.Balasundaram Pillai told the Express on Tuesday.
The minorities have a good deal whether the constituency concerned is to elect a representative on the Proportional Representation System or the First Past the Post System, Pillai said.
The interest of the parties of the majority community has also been safeguarded, he noted, and added that the proceedings of the multi-party committee showed complete agreement on the principles adopted.
Any issues that still remain will be sorted out when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe meets all the political parties in parliament on January 9, Pillai said.
However, the process was disrupted when two of the five committee members representing the ruling United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Sirisena faction), did not sign the report.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the committee, Asoka Peiris, decided to submit the report because the majority of the members had signed it. He also wanted to meet the criticism that the committee was taking too much time over the report. 
But when it was submitted to Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha he refused to accept it saying that two members had not signed it.
According to Prof.Pillai, the Minister said that the two members must say in writing, why they did not sign, or submit a dissenting note.
I expect them to sign or do as the Minister said, in the next few days. However, I I believe the matter will be sorted out when the Prime Minister meets the political parliament in parliament on January 9, Pillai said.
Trick to Delay Elections
The Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP, which goes by the name Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), views the development as nothing but another trick to delay elections to the local bodies which have been due for the past year and a half.
SLPP chief, Prof.G.L.Peiris told Express that the UNP-SLFP (Sirisena) coalition government has been trying every trick in the book and outside the book to thwart the local bodies elections.
These elections have been delayed by an year and a half only because the UNP-SLFP (Sirisena) coalition is scared of losing them, he said.
Indefinite postponement of elections is a gross violation of a citizens fundamental right because suffrage or franchise, is a basic right in a democracy, Peiris said.
He accused the leaders of the UNP and SLFP (Sirisena) of asking their representatives in the Delimitation Committee not to sign the report. He also recalled committee chairman Asoka Peiris telling a local newspaper that the government had been asking him to go slow on the report.
When it was to be submitted at the end of December, nobody from the government was available to take it, and when it was submitted this month, the Minister refused to take it, Peiris said.
