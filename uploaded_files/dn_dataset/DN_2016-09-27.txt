Norah  Jones:  Its so hard  for musicians  to make  money now

Singer Norah Jones calls the music industry messed up for young artists as no one is spending money on music anymore.
The Come Away With Me songstress is back with a new album after a four year hiatus. Day Breaks is Norahs sixth solo album, and hits shelves from October 7, nearly 17 years after her debut release.

A lot has changed since Norah burst on to the scene, particularly with regards to how people pay and consume music.
When asked by GQ Australia what financial advice shed give to aspiring musicians, the 37-year-old suggests being wise with money.
Try to, if you get any kind of deal doing anything, be super smart about it and aware of what youre signing. But you know, not everybody has that luxury, she said. Its really hard to make money playing music these days. Its really hard for young people, nobodys buying records, nobody is even paying very much for streaming services so its messed up for young people right now. But hopefully it will work out somehow someway.
Another area thats blown up in the last decade is social media and self-promotion. The Dont Know Why singer admits shes awful at that side of things, and was lucky to get her break before websites like Twitter and Facebook were created.
But I think it is really hard for musicians starting out today, its such a great tool, but not everyone I know is good at self-promotion, she pointed out.
You know, if youre not good at that part of it, its a lot harder. And a lot of artists I know, thats like the furthest thing from their personality. Sure, theyre excited by what they do, but constantly telling people to come check you out - thats like a whole other personality trait.

Skylar Grey:    Eminem encouraged  me to try rap

Skylar Grey credits Eminem with encouraging her to experiment on her new record.
The American singer-songwriter released her latest album Natural Causes on Friday (23Sep16), and shows off her rapping skills in the song Lemonade.
Skylar, who co-wrote Eminem and Rihannas 2010 song Love the Way You Lie, knew she wanted to rap at some point on the record and sought the 43-year-old superstars advice on her work.
This time around I was like, I want to try writing my own raps, to see if I could do it, she told Billboard magazine. The first song that I wrote as a rap I sent to Eminem and I said, Tell me if this sucks. Should I ever rap again and, because hes the best person to ask in my life, he called me and was like, You can rap.
So it gave me the confidence to keep going, and I do a couple of my features.
As a child Skylar, real name Holly Hafermann, performed professionally in folk duo Generations with her mother before stepping out on her own. She released debut album Like Blood Like Honey in 2006 before following that with Dont Look Down in 2013, which featured guest appearances from Big Sean, Travis Barker and Angel Haze.
But for Natural Causes, the 30-year-old wanted to try something completely different.
This time around I was able to be a little bit more free, creatively, she explained.
I feel like there was less expectation on my own part. I just wanted to make an album that really spoke to who I am as an artist. I put a lot of expectations on myself for the first one.
Skylar, who cites Radiohead, Bon Iver and Kendrick Lamar as some of her key inspirations, adds that she hopes shes created her own sound with the new record.
Now I feel like the album has come a place where its a good combination of all the things I love about my favourite artists, she smiled.
