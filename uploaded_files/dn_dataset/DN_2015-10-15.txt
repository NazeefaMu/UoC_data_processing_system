Citrus Waskaduwa celebrates World Tourism Day 2015
World Tourism Day is celebrated on September 27 every year. The date has a special significance as it was chosen to mark the anniversary of the day when the statutes of the United Nations World Tourism Organization were adopted in 1970. This is considered a major milestone in the history of global tourism. The World Tourism Day is observed to create global awareness about the importance of tourism and its impact on society in various fields. The theme of World Tourism Day 2015 was one billion tourists, one billion opportunities.
Citrus Waskaduwa celebrated World Tourism Day 2015 on September 25 by conducting an awareness programme for school children. Seventy five Advanced Level students and ten teachers from Pothupitiya Maha Vidyalaya, Thissa Central Wadduwa, Kaluthara Vidyalaya, Holy Family Convent Kaluthara and Balika Vidyalaya Kaluthara participated in the day-long programme held at the hotel.
The goal of the Citrus Waskaduwa World Tourism Day programme was to make young adults more aware of the industry and show them the prospects that exist in the industry for a future career. The main activities for the day included building awareness on various aspects of the hotel industry and the overall operation of a five star hotel.
The programme began with the accurate and appropriate guidance for the children in terms of career paths in the hospitality industry, career expectations, achievements as well as highlighting the skills and opportunities to follow a lifelong fulfilling career.
The students were also directed through the operations of the hotel, including Front Office Operations, Housekeeping, Food & Beverage, Banquets, Finance & Accounting, Human Resources, Security and Administration.
To add in a bit of health awareness for the children, Executive Chef Buddhika Ranjeewa Dayananda highlighted the importance of a healthy and balanced meal required to develop physical and mental needs of a student, whilst demonstrating ways and means of how they can prepare such meals on their own.
We identified that students dont often get the practical experience which helps them in securing employment but most importantly of all, helps them to ascertain in which area of the industry theyd like to pursue a career. It is also important that we continue to promote hospitality as a great career option, for the future of tourism lies solely in the hands of the young ones. Therefore, it is imperative that we not only bring about awareness to them, but also stretch out our hands and give them all the support they need to be a part of this growing industry, Citrus Waskaduwa General Manager Palaka Perera said.
Prior to this programme, on September 21 and 23, Palaka Perera along with the staff of the Hotel engaged in an environmental cleanup including a complete cleanup of the beach. Deputy General Manager Chef Sudusinghe stressed on the importance of environmental sustainability in the operation of a hotel.
The very essence of tourism is based on a clean and natural environment. The hotel industry represents one of the major pillars of travel and tourism, and hotel facilities have been documented as possessing a negative impact on the environment. It is therefore crucial to induce a more environmentally sound development, operation and performance in this sector. As leaders of this sector, Citrus Waskaduwa strongly believes in the propagation of green tourism and the sustainable future of the sector, he stated.

Cleaning up one of Sri Lankas finest beaches
Though Sri Lanka is rimmed by some of the worlds best beaches, few compare with the wide, white, miles-long stretch of sand that runs north of Trincomalee past Pigeon Island and Nilaveli to the lagoon mouth at Kuchaveli. Development has brought growing prosperity (and more visitors) to the area since 2009, but Kuchaveli Beach has remained remarkably unspoiled and not crowded. The few hotels dotted along its length are, on the whole, environmentally conscious and tastefully inconspicuous. At Kuchaveli, getting away from it all is still a genuine option.
Keeping it that way is an important priority at Jungle Beach, Uga Escapes luxury boutique hotel at Kuchaveli. Located where three ecologies  lagoon and mangrove forest, tropical seashore and Dry Zone forest  intersect, the hotels main attraction is the stunning biodiversity that surrounds it, and into which it blends so perfectly. The owners and management of Jungle Beach have good reasons to preserve Kuchaveli Beach  as well as the surrounding area  in pristine natural condition.
The Uga/Kuoni Big Beach Clean
Earlier this year, Uga Escapes got together with one of its major business partners, Kuoni Travels of Switzerland, to undertake a major clean-up of Kuchaveli Beach ahead of the main visitor season. In the months before the season opens, spring tides, monsoon rains and the activities of local fishermen tend to leave a lot of debris above the tideline. Some of it is plastic, unsightly and eco-unfriendly.
Working together under the direction of Jungle Beach General Manager V A Sivapriyan, two teams comprising hotel staff and visiting Kuoni travel agents from the UK began the Big Beach Clean. One team began work to the north of the hotel, the other to the south; both converged on the hotel. Involving lots of bending and stretching, squatting and kneeling, digging and hauling, the work was hot and strenuous; yet not only were the teams themselves enthusiastic, but several Jungle Beach guests happily joined the effort on their own initiative. Within 3 hours, a 2km stretch of beach fronting the hotel was clear and spotless.
Throughout the exercise, great care was taken to protect and preserve plants, animals and their habitats. Team members were closely briefed about what to pick up and what to leave alone.
Keeping Up the Good Work
The Uga/Kuoni Big Beach Clean was such a success and Sivapriyan was keen make it a regular event. In addition to the environmental benefit and business value of a clean beach, he noted that participating in the effort provides a pleasant holiday experience to our valuable guests, adding that it will also help showcase our commitment to sustainable tourism in Sri Lanka.
In the same spirit, about thirty Jungle Beach staff also took part in the governments Clean Beach 2015 programme on September 22, cleaning up almost 2km of coastal area adjoining and removing 20 bags of plastic debris.
Uga Escapes CEO Ramli Ghaffoor confirmed that beach cleans are regular events not only at Jungle Beach but at the companys other luxury beach resorts. Uga Escapes has always been committed to sustainable tourism, and beach clean ups have been an integral part of our sustainability efforts.
During our beach clean ups we aim to cover as much ground as possible and do not limit ourselves to the beach area closest to our properties, though cleaning up one beach is only a modest contribution to that goal, every little bit helps, he says. Its part of the bigger picture.
Jungle Beach is a resort owned and managed by Uga Escapes. Uga Escapes is a fully owned subsidiary of the Finco Group. Incorporated in 1963, the group comprises several companies recording success in diverse fields. In addition to Jungle Beach the company owns boutique properties offering unique experiences across the island that include- the 20 luxury villa Ulagalla Walawwa in Anuradhapura, UGA Bay, Passekudah, Residence by Uga Escapes in the heart of Colombo and the latest addition Chena Huts in Yala.

Court dismisses request to withdraw complaint
Colombo Additional Magistrate Tilina Gamage yesterday turned down a request made to withdraw the complaint against 11 suspects including former ITN Deputy General Manager Sudarman Radaliyagoda and former TRC Director General Anusha Palpita over their alleged involvement in the abduction of a child from the custody of his mother during presidential election campaign.

Meanwhile, SSC Ratnayake further stated that the Attorney General would take necessary steps to indict the suspect in High Court over an offence under Section 80-1 of the Presidential Election Act and charge of mentally abusing a child.
Counsel Pricy Perera, Ruwan Udawela and Akalanka Ukwatte appeared for the suspects. Further magisterial inquiry fixed for December 17.

Deathtraps loom in Colombo
Colombo city authorities have drawn criticism from many quarters for turning a blind eye to potential deathtraps on the roads of the capital city.
This highlights not only the negligence on their part, but also the absence of a holistic vision when it comes to road safety issues.
The electricpost brokenat threepoints atPamankada
For many decades, the road system in the Colombo city, the commercial capital of the country, has been put to question due to the poor maintenance of roads. Over a million people and millions of vehicles enter the city every day. They are in serious danger due to the poor maintenance of roads.
The Daily News went on a city round to look into the condition of roads in the Colombo city area to demonstrate certain hiccups of authorities when providing basic facilities to the public. Numerous potholes and puddles can be witnessed while electric wires lay dangerously on several roads. Some roads which were in good condition for sometime after being repaired, have cracked and sunk. Some have become the motorist's nightmare, owing to the poor condition.
A hole had been dug for the last 10 days near the traffic lights at Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Slave Island. However, no action had been taken to complete it.
A shopkeeper in the same area, Rilwan Aadam said there is a huge drainage problem in the area which had not been solved yet. The situation is worsened by the constant digging of roads by authorities.
Authorities said they would improve the drainage system. However, no proper methods have been adopted to do so. There are also parking issues in the area due to the poor condition of roads, Aadam said.
A large hole is also visible near a school which has been there for the past 10 days.
Dimuthu, a resident of Pamankada said there are a lot of potholes on Stafford Road, from Kirulapona to Pamankada bridge. Stafford Road is one way and there are no other alternative roads. Therefore, it has to be maintained properly, he said.
Meanwhile, Malay Street at Slave Island was damaged due to inclement weather. All vehicles and buses travelling to Pettah had undergone numerous inconveniences yesterday.
Residents in the area said they informed the Colombo Municipal Council and the police about the pothole on the road.
They had also informed that although main roads are cleared and carpeted, connecting byroads are not up to the same standard and are neglected.
The people in the area face many difficulties during the rainy season, residents said. They alleged that the road work is taking longer than necessary.
"The roads have to be made. However, authorities are not considerate of the people who live in the area. They need to be efficient in their work. They must consider the timing with regard to reconstruction work. For example, they should work on weekends and during night-time. The road work tend to drag during weekdays as they work with the heavy traffic," a resident three wheel driver said.
Drivers said their vehicles often broke down and developed technical defects that required repairs at heavy cost due to the poor state of the road. Drivers always try to avoid potholes in fear of possible damage to vehicles. This could result in accidents, they said.

Electricity wires were lying exposed at Flower Road yesterday, threatening people's lives. Some one could easily touch the exposed wires. The threat is heightened due to wet weather.
High voltage electric wires come from a variety of sources. Some from electricity substations from which the supply is distributed while others from connection boxes which have been left uncovered on pavements.
The Road Development Authority (RDA) is responsible for the maintenance and development of highways and ensuring that road networks in urban and rural areas are safe and in usable condition for motor vehicles and pedestrians. When the Daily News contacted RDA Project Director K. Amaraweera to ask about the holes dug near Sir James Peiris Mawatha, he said he had not received any complaints pertaining to the issue. He added that he needs to check whether the road belongs to the RDA or not.
Some roads in the city are under the RDA and some are under the Colombo Municipal Council, he said.
When questioned about several other roads, he stressed that he needs to confirm whether the roads belong to the RDA or not before commenting to the media.
A Colombo Municipal Council senior official said in the city limits, around 50 roads are under the RDA. They are also maintained by the CMC when the RDA maintains the Marine Drive, W. A. Silva Mawatha and Baseline Road.
When questioned about the holes dug on roads, the official said excavation permits are given for some projects for one or two weeks. Once the drains are open in the process of road development, it takes sometime to cover it due to the work taking place. Thus, there is a practical difficulty, added the official.
Responding to questions about the maintenance of roads, the official said: "Roads get damaged due to inclement weather. But our maintenance crew inspects roads daily. If there is a crack, we carpet the road to prevent it from spreading.
"We don't have enough staff to look into the issue immediately. But whenever residents or people complain, we properly looked into these things," he said.
The official said the life time of a road is measured by its usage. The Ceylon Electricity Board, Telecom, private telecommunication institutes, Water Board and other authorities dig roads to provide water or telephone connections. The authorities obtain permission for one or two weeks from the CMC and the police to begin their project.
With the increase of development projects in the Colombo city, it is hard to maintain rehabilitated roads. There is also a huge increase in the number of vehicles entering the Colombo city, he added.
Referring to Malay Street, the official noted that the road is often used by other authorities for estimation purposes. Therefore, it is difficult to bring the road to the original condition. The roads are often damaged.
Many roads need to be re-carpeted as the premix carpet is damaged due to frequent use.
If potholes are repaired, drivers will not need to suddenly swerve their vehicles to avoid them which will help reduce accidents. Then it would be a pleasure to drive on Colombo roads and safe for travellers and pedestrians.

In defence of MR
The Media Secretary to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that bringing the former President before the Commission of Inquiry is aimed at giving a wrong impression to the public that he had engaged in wrongdoing and to gain political mileage.
The former Presidents Media Secretary Rohan Welivita in a media release stated that Mahinda Rajapaksa appeared before the Commission to Probe Serious Acts of Corruption yesterday in response to a letter sent to him by the Commission and the letter has mentioned five matters which are under investigation by the Commission.
The release also states : The first matter that is under investigation by the Commission is the appointment of Anura Siriwardene as the Chairman/CEO of Independent Television Network at a time when the position was not vacant.
This appointment is not made by the President, but, officially by the Secretary to the Treasury as the Treasury owns the majority of the shares of ITN. This appointment had been made after the former Chairman left that position.
The second matter under investigation is an alleged financial loss caused due to an
advertising firm by the name of Media Factory not paying dues owed to ITN for televised ads. ITN had issued a letter dated 27 January 2015 claiming what was due to them and Media Factory had settled the outstanding amount in full. ITN has under signature accepted that the payment has been received.
A financial loss of Rs. 24 lakhs allegedly caused by an advertising firm by the name of Special Solutions not paying their dues to ITN is the third matter under investigation. We understand that all outstanding amounts due to ITN with regard to this transaction have been paid by the said advertising firm. It should be borne in mind that when
advertisements are repeated many times, all media organisations broadcast a certain proportion of them free of charge as an incentive to advertisers.
The fourth matter under investigation is the allegation that up-front payment was received for advertisements promoting presidential election candidate Maithripala Sirisena, but that these advertisements had not been aired and Rs 86 lakhs had been returned thus depriving ITN of an income the institution should have received. This is an internal administrative matter of the ITN. The letter sent by the Commission to the former President also states as the fifth matter under investigation the allegation that Maithripala Sirisena had been charged twice the usual amount for advertising thus discriminating between two equal presidential candidates. This too is an internal administrative matter at ITN. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa contested the January 2015 presidential election as the candidate of the UPFA. The presidential candidate of a major political party cannot possibly supervise the advertising campaign carried out on his behalf. Campaign advertisements are given to media organisations by the advertising firm retained by the candidates political party. The candidate or even his political party very often has no direct contact with the media organisations over advertising.
In any event, all matters relating to campaign advertisements are handled by the political party or alliance of the candidate. As such these matters are not the responsibility of the candidate but of the relevant political party or alliance. When it was proposed within the SLFP that President Mahinda Rajapaksa should contest for the presidency for the third time, it was the present Chairman of the party who seconded that proposal.
Summoning the former president before the Commission to Inquire into Serious Corruption over matters of this nature is undoubtedly an attempt to convey to the public the impression that the former president had engaged in wrongdoing and to gain some political mileage thereby.

EDB to stamp Brand Sri Lanka in global Batik map
The Export Development Board (EDB) has stepped up its efforts to stamp Brand Sri Lanka in the global Batik map-and linking with top institutional stakeholders.
The EDB is directly accessing the SMEs of the country in this new initiative. 24 leading Lankan SME Batik manufactures are displaying their samples to gain access to high end markets while sharing experience and knowledge with experts in the industry,EDB's Acting Director General Himali Jinadasa said yesterday.
Sri Lankan Batik products are premium products. Our Batik sector is so good that once Unilever purchased a Lankan made Batik saree for no less than 15,000-not rupees but dollars! said Erik Sooriyasena (leading exporter) and added: With today's initiative, we begin a long process of linking Lankan batiks to global market.
Addressing the EDB Seminar and Sample Display Event of Lankan Batik Manufactures on 8th October at the auditorium of EDB where 24 leading Lankan SME Batik makers splashed the Forum with the best of their wares and designs.
The session was assisted by Erik Sooriyasena (leading exporter and artist), Colvin Settinayake (veteran art and batik master craftsman) and Selyna Peiris (Director - Selyn Exports) as resource persons. Representatives from two leading giftware and lifestyle companies were invited to explore possibility to market linkage of the products manufactured by SME batik manufacturers to high-end markets.
Indonesia is recognised today as the world's leader in Batiks with UNESCO acknowledging Indonesian Batik as cultural heritage. It is believed that Batik was introduced to Sri Lanka by the Dutch colonial masters and was promptly adopted by women of Kandyan kingdom, thereby kicking off the Batik tradition in Sri Lanka.

Errant foreign employment officers brought to book
Foreign Employment Development officers who engage in various malpractices such as formulating fraudulent family background reports about women destined for foreign employment have earned the ire of the Foreign Employment Ministry.
A group of 16 such development officers who resorted to this, have been suspended from service while six others who formulated such false reports have been interdicted by the Ministry Secretary.
This follows the setting up of a special Ministry unit by Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale to monitor the activities of Foreign Employment Development Officers. The Ministry has the mandate to formulate family background reports on women due to leave the country for employment. The family background report paid main attention towards the number of children in the family of the relevant women.
Such reports are not given to women with children below five years. Such reports are issued to women with daughters over 5 years if the father or a next of kin is prepared to take care of those girls only.
The relevant development officer is required to visit the home of the relevant woman for an investigation before preparing the family background report to satisfy himself that the particulars given by the woman in the application is true. Thereafter the report submitted by the development officer had to be counter signed by the relevant divisional secretary.
Once the report is approved by the divisional secretary he or she had to notify the Bureau of Foreign Employment through SMS. No woman is allowed to proceed abroad unless this relevant SMS is received by the Bureau.
The Ministry said employment agreements are not signed without these short messages received from the DS.
There are 1030 development officers attached to the 331 divisional secretariats throughout the country and there are 63 vacancies existing for such officers at present.

Eva Peron alive and well in Argentine politics
ARGENTINA: Eva Peron died more than 60 years ago but her spirit remains alive and well in Argentina, especially with presidential elections just around the corner.
Outgoing President Cristina Kirchner speaks often of Peron's work for the poor. The likely future first lady is drawing comparisons to her. And Peron's grand niece may be part of the next government.
As Argentina on Saturday celebrates the 70th anniversary of Peronism, the populist movement founded by Eva and President Juan Domingo Peron, the country is in full campaign fever ahead of presidential elections on October 25.
The face of Evita, as Argentines call her affectionately, appears on two facades of the labor ministry in Buenos Aires, bearing testimony to the influence she wields over Argentine politics.
Kirchner, like Peron, was wife to a president before being elected head of state herself and serving from 2007 until now, and she alludes often to her example.
"She continues to fascinate us," Kirchner has said. "Her ideas, her gestures, her actions, her convictions, the rights she gave to her people, are more present than ever."
Presidential frontrunner Daniel Scioli's wife, former model Karina Rabolini, has been compared to Peron, as she likes to meet with poor people in far flung, forgotten provinces.
But the one who evokes Peron most is her great niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriguez, who looks to have a bright political future.
This 47-year-old divorced mother of a 12-year-old daughter wears her blonde hair in an Evita-style bun and does bear a resemblance to her.
An architect by training, Alvarez Rodriguez got into politics after the economic crisis that erupted here in 2001.
If Scioli wins the presidency, it is understood that Peron's descendant will play a crucial role in the next government.
It is rumoured that she might be named minister without portfolio, or speaker of the Chamber of Deputies to build bridges between supporters of Kirchner and Scioli.
Alvarez Rodriguez says she is proud to be a natural heir to a woman who has "left her mark on the country forever."
But she is discreet about her links to Peron, and prefers to talk about the platform of the leftist Front For Victory, the coalition that has been in power since 2003 and hopes to retain it.
"I feel that it is a huge honour to share her blood, to have her in my family. But she is a figure who surpasses me, who surpasses all of us," said Alvarez Rodriguez, granddaughter of Blanca Duarte, one of Evita's older sisters.
"The blood of Eva flows in all of those millions of people who love her so much in Argentina and who remember her as if she were alive," she said.
At what used to be a home for single mothers that was founded by Peron in 1948, Alvarez Rodriguez has created a museum honouring the late first lady. It is visited more often by foreign tourists than by local Argentines, however.
She wears a bracelet that was owned by Peron. And she remembers clearly the first time she learned about "the illuminated one," as Eva's mother called her.
"Without a doubt, for any woman involved in politics in Argentina and in Latin America, it is inevitable to refer to Eva Peron. For me it is very powerful, although for years I turned my back on it. At my house we said you cannot rest on Evita's laurels," said Alvarez Rodriguez.
Peron's critics "say she introduced the evils of populism, that she distributed social benefits without asking people to make an effort in exchange for them," said political scientist Carlos Fara.
"I think that there is a very strong social prejudice among the well-to-do classes."
Rabolini added that "regardless of whatever political party you support, Eva Peron has been a great example for everyone." - AFP

French Travel agents arrive for Cinnamon Treasure Hunt 2015
Creating new avenues that are aimed at broadening the commercial scope for generating travel markets, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts launched Treasure Hunt 2015 at the annual International French Travel Mart (IFTM) which took place in Paris recently. The shortlisted travel agents who are to embark on a unique journey to Sri Lanka on a week-long tour, as part of The Treasure Hunt, will be touring the island from October 10 to the 15.
The Treasure Hunt, a mega familiarization tour targeting an elite group of French Travel agents, is presented by Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts as a part of advancing Sri Lankas position in the growing landscape of global tourism and hospitality. Designed specifically to promote and re-introduce the country to a specific travel audience, the tour will assist in increasing the number of French travellers to Sri Lanka in the future.
With improving economic, political and social conditions, Sri Lanka is once again becoming the preferred destination for travel agents and long haul travellers from across the globe. And although there have been several technological advancements in the travel and tourism industry today, the key role that the travel agents and tour operators play is still of vital importance.
The Treasure Hunt targets the travel agents in France and has been a tremendous success in the past. With close to 4000 travel agent outlets across the country, the role that these agencies play in convincing, encouraging and or discouraging a potential client remain very critical. And so, we felt that it would be fitting to have a mega familiarization tour such as this to create more awareness and give them a first-hand experience of the destination, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts Head of Brand Marketing Dileep Mudadeniya said.
This mega familiarization tour is hosting a group of 60 travel agents in all expenses paid trip to Sri Lanka, where they will be given the opportunity to visit the main tourist destinations of the island while participating in a competitive Treasure Hunt. During the tour, participants will be assigned teams and will engage in finding treasures based on clues given to them by the organizers. This event adds an element of excitement, as it is not the average familiarization tour where agents are taken to view sites and given tours outlining the products and services offered by a destination. The Treasure Hunt presents an interesting perspective both creatively and interactively providing more value in promoting Sri Lanka as a premier tourist destination.
Their itinerary will include a visit to the North Central province commencing with two nights at the Cinnamon Lodge Habarana where they would visit places of interest such as the Minneriya National Park, Sigiriya and Pollonaruwa. Next they would proceed to the East of Sri Lanka for an overnight stay at Chaaya Blu Trincomalee where they would visit the Trincomalee Fort and Batticaloa. From the East, the group would travel to the lush hill capital of Kandy with stays at Cinnamon Citadel. Here they would get to experience the sights and scents of Kandy at the well-known Kandy market and also visit the Dalada Maligawa and Peradeniya Botanical Gardens. The final leg of the Treasure Hunt would conclude in the Southern Coastal belt of Sri Lanka where they would be hosted to a Gala Dinner at Cinnamon Bey Beruwala, followed by an awards ceremony to recognize the winners of the competition.
This event will take place in tandem with the agents experiencing the countrys lesser-known sites and popular destinations. The tour will also make it possible for the participants to interact with local communities and gain insight into indigenous village life, local customs and traditions, Sri Lankan cuisine and renowned Ceylonese hospitality.
The Treasure Hunt 2015 is powered by the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines and Walkers Tours Limited, the official ground handling partner, and supported by the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau (SLCB).

HC acquits Dhanuna in Hi-Corp case
The Colombo High Court yesterday ordered to acquit and release Dhanuna Tillekaratne from the HiCorp case, on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Tillekaratne had been charged under Public Property Act for aiding and abetting to cheat US$299,061.25 of public funds through the Hi-Corp Private Company Ltd by forwarding forged bid documents to the Sri Lanka Army for certain supplies to the Defence Ministry 2007-2008 after
convincing the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) to deposit the money while appearing as an agent of British Borneo Defence Company in Australia.
High Court judge *Devika de Livera Tennakoon ruled that evidence given by the witnesses representing SLA had denied the accused's involvement in preparing and forwarding forged bid documents to the SLA.
Counsel Asela Rekawa who appeared on behalf of the accused had made a request that his client be acquitted from the case because the witnesses in the case denied his client involvement in preparing and forwarding the forged documents.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was also made as an accused in the Hi-Corp case was acquitted from the case over a double jeopardy issue; where charges in the indictment in the High Court case were similar to that in the second Court Martial trial in which Sarath Fonseka was sentenced.
Thus no action could be instituted twice against an accused on the same charges.

Shobhaa De at SLID Black Tie dinner
Hurrah for Creativity and to Hell with Conformity
Taking a delightful turn from its usual corporate training programmes, workshops and seminars, the Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID) brings together an elegant evening, starting with cocktails extending to wining and dining at an exquisite six course dinner whilst listening to the most glamorous Indian editor and one of the most distinguished literary writers of South Asia - Shobhaa De. She will address the gathering on October 16 at the Kings Court, Cinnamon Lakeside.
Hurrah for Creativity and to Hell with Conformity is Shobhaas chosen topic for the evening, followed by an interview with Ashok Ferrey who will get the best from her! She is known for being outspoken and controversial whilst holding an elevated position in the literary world. Being a novelist and a columnist, she has contributed profusely to South Asian literature.
Having graduated in psychology from St. Xaviers College (Mumbai), her first career choice was modeling which she pursued for some time proving herself, later switching her career to journalism. Shobhaa offered her editorial skills to renowned magazines. Her column for The Times of India named Politically Incorrect comments on various issues ranging from social, economical to political dynamics, earning great praise. Subsequently, she chose to write novels with her debut entitled, Socialite Evenings, which explores the dynamics of elites of Indian society, highlighting the decay of the social values, morality and culture. She portrays the socialites as immoral and degenerated people who have traded their moral values for materialistic gain. The novel was heavily criticized for its controversial content, though it sold out and gained commercial success.
Shobhaa Des literary writing journey eventually turned her into Indias bestselling author. More than 17 of her novels climbed the bestselling books charts at once. Her works have been translated into many languages. The reform and rise of womens fiction is accredited to Shobhaa for her daring to voice her thoughts in her writing. Her second novel, Starry Nights is allegedly inspired by two famous Bollywood off-screen couples. The book discusses the dynamics of the Indian showbiz industry. Yet again it was an instant success establishing Shobhaa as a distinguished writer. Her other book named Spouse  The Truth About Marriage surveys the institution of marriage in the urban society. Over 20,000 copies were sold on its first day of official launch.
Her style of writing is deemed a breath of fresh air in Indian literature. Her highly individualistic style does at times seem provocative and bold. The worrisome behavior and attitude of our generation is an issue she examines and discusses often in her writings. Besides literary writing, Shobhaa is also recognized for her scriptwriting for Indian television soaps. Moreover, her television appearances have increased with her popularity. Her regular participation on several television debate shows earned her an esteemed position in electronic media.
The proceeds from this event will go towards SLIDs endeavor in taking the message of Corporate Governance to the provinces. SLID organizes many programmes focusing primarily on the topic of corporate governance. These programs are held on a monthly basis mainly for the corporate fraternity of Colombo. However with the growing disparity between the corporate in the Western province as opposed to the others, SLID has begun to expand its target group by organizing seminars on Conducting Business Responsibly in other provinces, totally free of charge. Over the past years the Institute has organized 11 such seminars in Gampaha, Kandy, Ratnapura, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Hambanthota, Matara, Vavuniya, Mannar, Killinochchi and Jaffna, and plans to cover Ampara as well within the next few months.

Immigration offences: two Lankans to be deported from UK
Two Sri Lankan men will be deported from the UK after committing immigration offences.
Home Office Immigration Enforcement officers made the arrests at Sabeeh Mini Market, Gurnards Avenue where both men work.
A 33-year-old man was found to have overstayed his student visa and a 23-year-old man was found to be a failed asylum seeker.
The business was served with a notice warning that a financial penalty of up to 20,000 per illegal worker will be imposed unless they can demonstrate that appropriate right to work document checks were carried out, such as seeing a passport or Home Office document.
Home Office Inspector Robert Tompkins said: "We are working hard to identify, arrest and remove people who are abusing the UK's immigration system.
"All of our operations are intelligence led and information from the public is a vital part of this work. I would encourage people with detailed and specific information about illegal immigration to contact us.
"Employers who use illegal labour are cheating the taxpayer, undercutting businesses who play by the rules and depriving legitimate job seekers of employment opportunities. "Those who ignore the rules, and do not carry out the simple checks to ensure their employees have the right to work in the UK, will face the consequences."

Judiciary dignity misunderstood
Issue No 1 SW makes us believe that we are possessed of an impeccable infallible and ideal judiciary with a long history committed to the hallowed values of independence and integrity.
All manmade institutions in there incipient stages were equipped mainly by men of great of integrity; however this purity could only be maintained only if the conditions on which the institutions were founded were not adversely affected. Judges and the Judiciary are like other organs comprise of men and women of human failings. It is the atmosphere and the conditions which prevail in the protection of the judiciary that guarantee its independence. Whatever the provisions are constitutionally and legislatively created if in fact legislature becomes the mere adjunct of the executive and judiciary is directly opened to the influence of the executive the mechanism provided the independence is bound to be tampered with.
With the emergence of the superpower Executive under Jayewardene regime where by a constitutional sleight of hand, eight Supreme Court judges were sacked by the executive president at his whim and fancy. This left the judiciary in most vulnerable position and a lastingly servile quality was the infused into the judiciary. It culminated in the attempted impeachment of the then CJ. The resulting position was an intimidated and emasculated judiciary. Such a situation inevitably begets a diabolically corrupt an evil product in the form of a phenomenon represented by Sarath N Silva CJ whos nearly decade of stewardess as CJ is a regarded darkest chapter in the history of judiciary in this country.
Misappropriation of public funds
Victor Ivans book the unfinished struggle about the Sarath N Silva era is the most telling indictment on a Chief Justice and the judicial system under him, ever written in the legal history of our legal annals. The fact that no attempt has been made up to date to controvert the allegations in his work is ample testimony of the accuracy of the facts there in.
Sarath N Silvas post retrial conduct is not second to his incumbency. For he brought to judiciary to its very nadir by his confession of his corrupt judgment to exculpate former president from incarceration for a massive fraud and criminal misappropriation of public funds.
Mahinda Rajapaksa shamelessly dismantles the last vestiges of the mechanism of the independence of the judiciary and the Attorney Generals Department. Thus judges who not prepared to do his biding incurred his wrath culminating in famous impeachment Dr. Shirani Bandaranayke. It was nationally and internationally the most dastardly and corrupt incident in the judiciary which stinks to high heaven.
Although a constitutional machinery was provided it itself was essentially flawed in the most arbitrary salvage and barbaric manner in which it was executed by and MRs lackeys leaves nothing to be desired.
It was obvious that all powerful Executive who had the entire legislature under his thumb and prepared to do his bidding fulfilled his whims by punishing the CJ and got his goons underworld elements to humiliate the CJ and oust her in the manner that shocked the conscious in the entire civilized world. It appears that SW has completely glossed over this history that cannot be erased from the democratic world. It is that same loss of memory that prompts him praise Mohan Peris as an exemplary CJ who was MRs emissary sent to justify the disappearance of journalist Eknaligoda at the HR committee in Europe there in a despicable attempt to save face of his lord and master openly and unashamedly prevaricated by stating that the disappeared journalist was living in a foreign country. As a sequel to this incident in a local court he was constrained to admit that he lied abroad about the very journalist.
His conduct as Chief Justice was hilariously shameful when he is accompanied by his Lord and Master to the Vatican and joins in the private New Year celebrations in his private residence.
MR regime
The crowning moment of his carrier was when MR was breathing his politically last breath at temple trees where he rushed to give him life saving dose of political elixir so that he could extend his political life despite the emphatic verdict of the people at the midnight of 8th January 2015.
It is sufficient testimony to his judicial integrity and is a pity that the plot has not being unearthed. It should have definitely led to a bloody civil strife master minded by MR military siblings Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Thereafter Mohan Peiris started bargaining for a diplomatic post to give up his position as CJ and sought to obtain Presidential blessings to continue as the CJ with an unreserved promise to give judgements as per the wish of the Executive. If he continued as CJ he would have blended backwards to do the bidding of the present leaders in the same servile manner.
SW also raises the other issue that the BASL headed by Upul Jayasuriya was politically motivated which according to SW militated against avowed the objectives of the BASL and contributed to this regime change. That the BASL should have been alive to the political conditions of the MR regime is truly the function of the BASL. In that his treatment of the Judiciary and his human rights record were matters that directly concerned the legal fraternity and the community which it was bound to serve. SW should also remember that the BASL was not the only professional organization that joined in Unison to establish the law and order of the country which was ruled by the law of the jungle. In this endeavour Upul had every thing to loose including his life as Rajapaksas sent killer squads from the state intelligence services gunning for him. Upul was unshaken and faced such threats with fortitude. He led the bar fearlessly with the support of entire Bar with the exception of those who have had the benefit of diplomatic postings and other crumbs of the then regime.
However the BASL in keeping with its traditions of impartiality and fair play to acquaint itself about the two main policies of the two main Presidential Candidates and invited them for a public discussion monitored by a highly enlightened panel. But MR has nothing to do with it whilst the other candidate responded. BASL did not desire an ex parte discussion. Therefore our membership was denied the opportunity.
Thereupon the BASL being aware the machinery of corruption, bribery and violence that was to be set in motion at the Presidential Election carried on a highly effective campaign to ensure a clean and in corruptible election.
BASL is proud being instrumental to bringing about a clean election where the people were free to articulate there choice of the leader amidst obstacles. It is indeed in the best traditions of other bar associations like Pakistan and Malaysia etc.
It is in this context that SW raises the question that about the High Commission of Human Rights recommending a hybrid tribunal probe into excess due to a civil war in the North.
It might be reminded to SW that the very idea of an international tribunal stemmed from on solemn undertaking given by MR immediately after ending of the war which he contemptuously abandon with his usual obstinate approach.
International community
However as it now stands there are consensus that the local tribunal with international assistance from foreign judges etc., should be the structure the tribunal that should be set up. The participation of international element is the direct result of the loss of confidence not only in the domestic community but also in the international community on our judiciary as it is presently constituted.
This has led to foreign participation in order to give this probe a meaningful content and element of credibility in the communities affected by war as well as in the international community. The view of the Tamil community seeking an international inquiry is voiced by the CM of the NPC.
Whatever the nature of the inquiry, its objective is reconciliation, accountability, harmony between communities within the territorially integrated country. Unless and until various communities of this country are prepared to accept there culpability and accountability in the past reconciliation among the various communities will be a futile dream.
As far as Sir Lanka is cornered foreign tribunals are not alien to it. We remember the Commission of inquiry appointed by the former President D. B. Wijetunga to inquire the death of Hector Kobbakaduwa and nine other officials. It was headed by a judge from New Zealand and two others from Ghana and Nigeria which more fully completed the inquiry and submitted a report.
Therefore it is the duty of the well meaning citizens of this country to accept this tribunal which has to function according to the Sri Lankan Laws  so that final aim of integration and reconciliation will become a reality. Otherwise we will continue to become a barbaric nation having internecine warfare at there regular agenda with no hope to building a united nation committed to territorial integrity and fully reconcile healthy nation.
The other issue raised by SW is regarding the BASL been funded by an organization called USAID. I have been the member of the Bar Council from his inception and aware that it has received funds from various agencies like LAWASIA. However under the last regime and the present regime of the BASL there was a remarkable rise in the improvement of the working conditions of the lawyers like bringing the Colombo Law Library to a position that it stands on par which in any law library in any developed country. The continued legal education program without any break and holding of round table discussions with, out station bars and the improvement of the local Bars by updating their libraries are some of the projects funded by the USAID. Sophisticated and modernized BASL Auditorium named in memory of the 1st President of the BASL Dr HW Jayawardena QC at a cost of Rs 12 Million is a testimony to the role played by the USAID project.
Countries that grant aid to uplift our legal system and legal fraternity have also a self interest in giving aid in that it is to their interest that our legal system upholds the rule of law and independence of the judiciary for the reason that any genuine and bona fide investors, businessman and other groups from countries like UK. US, Europe would like only to invest commercial and have commercial relations with a country where the rule of law, equality before law and independence of the judiciary prevail. It is those countries that which do not value such tenets that would like to deal with countries where the law of the jungle prevails like in the previous regime where unsolicited transactions, Commissions, bribery, corruption sleazed became the order of the day and judicial discipline thrown to the winds.
Bar Association
This same project that was agreed with the then Ministry of Justice was withdrawn by the USAID due to the appalling conditions of the Rule of Law was saved by Upul who was the then President of the BASL, was a feather on his cap as he knew very well that the Rajapaksas had cut all the support it used to get from its traditional sources and state corporations.
In this context we are all aware how MR regime accepted funds by way of loans from foreign countries and almost mortgaged the country and placed the country in grave jeopardy where territorial integrity and our sovereignty were seriously compromised and the country is today facing serious impasse as a consequence.
We must thus appreciate USAID in this spirit which is in the mutual interest of the Donor and the Donee that Democracy, Freedom, Fair play and Rule of Law prevails resulting in peace, prosperity and harmony among countries. However it is important that this aid is not concentrated at the top but should trickle down to the grass roots. However our freedom as a robust fearless Bar Association and our independence should in no way be compromised and sacrificed at the altar of any aid local or international. I am confident that the present and past Presidents and its Committee are and were, respectively, fully mindful of such pitfalls when they accept such funds with no strings attached and utilize them with total accountability, integrity and transparency which will silence such critics like SW.

He made this observation in response to a query by a media personnel at yesterday's Cabinet briefing at the Information Department Ministry auditorium.
The minister said due to the bilateral agreements between the two countries and as Sri Lanka considers India a friendly neighbour, the government has taken this policy decision.
Senaratne also stated that this matter could be complained to the European Union or the Indian Ocean Commission and added that no complains would be made before any of the entities due to the policy decision.
Minister Senaratne said in response to a question raised by a media personnel that there are no political prisoners in Sri Lanka but terrorist suspects.
He said the government will take legal action against those suspects if there's evidence against them or release them if there's no evidence.
The minister in response to another media personnel stated that there was no justice in law not being implemented against KP who was arrested on suspicion of being the LTTE international leader. He said there were discussions regarding the issue. Senaratne also revealed that there are some sections attempting to protect leaders of previous regime by violating KP's freedom of speech.
He said KP had told a journalist attached to a weekend Sinhala language newspaper that he had no freedom to speak. He said that according to the journalist there had been several Army personnel there.

Lankan migrants use India as springboard to reach Australia
Even as migrants from poor and war-torn countries continue their risky journey to European countries for a better life, the data available with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, Australia, reveals that 171 Sri Lankan illegal migrants, including nine females and nine children, managed to reach Australian coast over the years.
The data further stated that many of those migrants used the Indian sub-continent as their springboard to reach the Antipodean.
However, the precise break-up of Lankans who illegally migrated to Australia from India is not available with the department.
According to the data provided by the Australian Consulate, as on August 31, 2015, 2,028 people were detained by the Australian Immigration authorities and sent them to immigration detention facilities. The number includes 1,807 in immigration detention on the mainland and 221 in immigration detention on Christmas Island of Australia.
Out of the 2,028 people, around 407 were from Iran, 184 from New Zealand, and 171 from Sri Lanka, followed by 142 from China and 121 from Vietnam.
Speaking to 'Express' through an e-mail communication, Deputy Consul-General for South India Jon Bonnar said it has also been estimated that over 1,200 people were died at sea trying to reach Australia between 2008 and 2013.
There were no known incidents under Operation Sovereign Borders involving loss of life since December 2013, he said. He added that no separate statistics are available about the nationality of the dead people.
However, 735 were people were also allowed to live in the community after being approved for a residence determination as on August 31, 2015, the report said.
When asked if the Australian authorities would take any additional preventive measures in the wake of recent illegal migration attempt by a group of Sri Lankan refugees from Kerala coast, he said there is already the Australian Government's tough border protection measures like the Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB).
Under OSB, anyone who comes to Australia illegally by boat without a visa will never be allowed to settle in Australia and no exception are made to women, children and unaccompanied children.
When asked if they would take up this issue with the Government of India in the wake of the recent attempts of migration from here, he said: "The Government of Australia and Government of India already have a good working relationship on the issue of illegal migration through the bilateral Joint Working Ground on Counter-Terrorism and Trans-National Crime."

Colombo is getting to be a pretty fashionable capital city. Here are a few stylish individuals we spotted out in Colombo on a sunny weekday morning. Shifani Reffai asked them for a little insight into their looks.
1. We were lucky enough to bump into fashion designer Abhisheka Wimalaweera, who surprised us with her very minimal kurta and jeans, in a city thats increasingly sporting a more Western look. Weve all got different body shapes - and you need to be mindful of your own when youre picking out an outfit, she advised.
2. Shehan sports a classic monochrome look, both youthful and trendy. He and his friends look up to the styles of famed footballer and model David Beckham.
3. Kavindi, Shialin, Prasansha and Chamodi generally like the high waist look. Its different from the mainstream style in Colombo. Some of the looks they admire are the ones flaunted by Sonam Kapoor, Naomi Campbell and the runway shows featuring Victoria Secret models.
4. Amalan says he usually makes sure there are prints on his clothes, whether flora or trees or whatever else. When asked about his style he said I guess this is kind of the semi-hipster look.
5. Shivanthi and Leah are from the UK and were caught unaware enjoying the sun in their bright, summer get-ups. When asked about their choice of colourful cottons, they said, Because its comfy!

Thilakarathne presented the district development review to the meeting. According to the reports of the review, Rs 2,689 million has been allocated for the year 2015 by the government to carry out 2,732 development and infrastructure development projects in the district.

He stressed that every farm established throughout the country aimed at agriculture development should be well and properly utilized.
"All farms under the provincal councils and the central government should be well utilized by the relevant officers. These farms are capable of producing a great portion of the seed requirement of the country. By next January the progress of these farms will be evaluated. If there is no proper progress, tough action will definitely be taken" the President stressed.

President Obama crashes California wedding
US: Stephanie and Brian Tobe's golf course wedding had an unexpected guest: Barack Obama.
While visiting California, President Obama enjoyed a round of golf at Torrey Pines Golf Course in La Jolla, where Stephanie and Brian were about to tie the knot on Tuesday.
"We saw the two SUVs that were the Secret Service SUVs, so then we knew he was on the course," Brian said.
"We got word that we needed to delay the ceremony or start immediately," Photographer Erin Youngren told CNN affiliate KGTV.
The couple opted to wait for the President to finish the 18th hole, and enjoyed champagne while trying to catch a glimpse of him. Brian and Stephanie were content with seeing the President from the window of their hotel suite, but their photographer had some other ideas.
"I said I bet you if we went down there he would take a picture," Youngren said, "Stephanie was like 'YES,' and she took off running." They made it just in time. The President took several pictures with the ecstatic couple.
"He was so kind and gracious, especially to the couple," Youngren said.
"It was a life moment that none of us will ever forget," Erin Youngren wrote on her blog.
Last year, President Barack Obama had apologised to a couple after his golf game in Hawaii forced the bride and groom to relocate their wedding.
The couple, both captains in the Army -- had previously invited Obama to their wedding, knowing that he'd likely return to his family's vacation spot for the holidays.
The couple, Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr, received an RSVP from the President declining the invitation but sending them good wishes.
Later on they were told they'd have to relocate their wedding venue away from the golf course, which is located on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, because the President was planning to play golf.

The former President was summoned before the Commission to obtain a statement from him over five allegations including the financial loses to Independent Television Network for televising advertisements in support of him at the last presidential election.
Rajapaksa arrived at the Commission at the BMICH yesterday morning. Defence Counsel Gamini Marapone appearing for the former President raised objections that serving judges of the High Court cannot be appointed to function as members of the Commission.
Although a ruling on Marapone's objection was due to be delivered during yesterday's sittings, Commission Chairman High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena postponed the order for today.
Counsel Marapone made three more objections on behalf of the former President in addition to the main objection.
Former President Rajapaksa's counsel Gamini Marapone objected to make a statement at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Investigating into Mass Scale Corruption and Frauds which was headed by a Colombo High Court Judge since High Court Judges have no power to involve themselves in the activities of other Commissions outside their courts activities.
Thereafter, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara also submitted counter objections to the Commission . The Commission after considering the submissions adjourned sittings for 20 minutes.
When the Commission resumed sittings after 20 minutes interval, Commission Chairman High Court Judge Preethi Padman Surasena announced that the Commission decided to put off the verdict for today.

Sangaree pleads for fasting prisoners
TULF General Secretary V. Ananda Sangaree in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested to release detainees who are engaged in a fast unto death in various prisons without any punishment.
He said that these detainees should be released without punishment as they had already served 20 years in jail.
Sanagaree has proposed a procedure through which about 250 detainees in various prisons can be released.
Sangaree through his letter has proposed to select a modern building in one of the prisons with all facilities and have all those prisoners transferred to that building under one set of officers.
"Select few retired judges both male and female and form few panels to inquire each case and to release them accordingly. That the panels are empowered to deal with them and recommended their release,"he said.
Excerpts of the letter:
All these years all the politicians who intervened on behalf of the prisoners claimed them as political prisoners and their claims had been consistently disputed as offenders by the Hon. Minister of Justice. There must be a fixed term of imprisonment as punishment for any offence and there can't be more than 20 years for any offence in the penal code (Exclusive of fines). If they had been detained for 20 years obviously they are over punished.
Your Excellency I am not arguing with you about these cases. I am only pleading with you to deal with their cases wit the sympathy each case deserves.
Recently a judge had discharged a Brahmin woman who had been in prison for over 20 years. If the case had been taken up for disposal 20 years back, she need not have served a long period in jail. Above all Your Excellency, the tradition of the Brahmins is that they can't eat in the presence of others and are governed by many other such rules. Further more, if I have not still reached the level of a lawyer, may I plead with you as a laymen, at least to adopt the following procedure to release them.
Select a modern building in one of the prisons with all facilities and have all those prisoners transferred to the building under one set of officers.
Provide them all facilities that they are entitled to, to make them more comfortable. Select a few retired judges both male and female and form a few panels to inquire each case and to release them accordingly. That the panels are empowered to deal with them and recommended their release. The complicated cases if any can be dealt with by senior lawyers or judges and recommend for release without any punishment since they had already served 20 years in jail.
Please consider how your predecessors tackled various matters including those of combatants. I need not tell you how problems should be solved to a person who can arbitrarily save a person condemned to death.

Anti-imperialism: Rhetoric and reality
The old clique twice kicked out by the people on January 8th and August 17 for imposing an authoritarian regime on them have again appeared in their thread-bare garbs and are rehearsing for another circus performance. While the conductor is behind the scene prominent on stage are the comedians belonging to the fringe outfits of the UPFA. As before their proclaimed credo is "Salvation of the country".
They say that imperialism is trying to devour our country, to annex it to their empire. Is this news All those who have even a little knowledge of world affairs and history knows the objectives of imperialism. Imperialism thrives on the subjugation of dependent countries.
However the world has changed much. The system of subject colonies has been thrown overboard. Imperialism now uses neo-colonialism instead of direct colonial rule. There is an unholy trinity - the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization that directs neo-colonial plunder of dependent nations. A rational struggle against imperialism should obviously oppose this holy trinity.
Political agendas
This could be done both within and outside these organizations and in alliance with similarly placed developing nations. It cannot be an isolated struggle. Hence real anti-imperialism means a relentless struggle for an independent economic development. This serious and long drawn-out struggle cannot be replaced by rhetorical onslaughts on imperialism in public which reminds one of ill-disciplined village drunkards challenging everyone under the influence of liquor.
Most governments in office collaborated with imperialists to develop and consolidate capitalism in the country while engaging in tirades against imperialism to gather support of the masses for their political agendas. They never dreamt of bypassing or replacing capitalist relations. Though several anti-imperialist measures were taken by the national bourgeois in power in alliance with the working masses they began collaborating with imperialism especially after the middle of the 1960s.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa administration also followed the same path. It did not hesitate to offer privileges on multi-national companies or obey the dictates of international financial agencies. No could anyone say that it acted in a people-friendly manner. Rajapaksa administration did not clash with imperialism on the economic front. It clashed basically on certain human rights issues which arose in association with the war and the war environment. Western nations became sensitive to this situation since a considerable Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora lived as refugees and citizens in them. At the same time the Rajapaksa regime pursued a repressive domestic policy in an effort to perpetuate its rule. The consequences of its nave and foolish foreign policy led to the seclusion of Sri Lanka in the international community.
Pseudo-patriotic slogans
This shows that the political forces that rallied round the Rajapaksa regime were not anti-imperialist in deed despite their strong anti-imperialist rhetoric. That is why one should not be carried away by their present pseudo-patriotic slogans and rhetoric. They are merely means to regain political power by hoodwinking the masses and exploiting their love for the motherland.
Their entire argument is based on a false premise that says that western nations and India are out to bifurcate Sri Lanka. This is a total fabrication. Really all countries recognize the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and defend it. It should be remembered that some of them provided strategic assistance to Sri Lanka during crucial moments in the war. It is only those whose imagination has gone wild that could conclude that India which has banned the LTTE would support a separate State led by it in the backyard of India. Similarly it is not to the interest of India to have an unstable Sri Lanka as a neighbour.
Though it is not the reality let us for a moment assume for the sake of argument that there is a threat of bifurcation facing Sri Lanka. In that case how could it be faced Obviously it would need the unity and strength of all Sri Lankans.
Mahinda Rajapaksa clique, on the other hand, is doing all it can to divide the people both racially and religion-wise. The consequence of such action is the weakening of the country and the people in face of an external threat. That is a situation favourable to imperialism as seen by the experience of Iraq and Syria. Certainly, the ultimate result of the action of the pro-Mahinda clique would place Sri Lanka in a really vulnerable situation.
The struggle against imperialism is basically a struggle for independent economic development. It is a long and arduous struggle. You need to educate, mobilize and guide the people to pursue that struggle. Anybody who abandons that task is no real anti-imperialist however much he berates imperialism day and night.
Let us not forget why the people defeated the government of Mahinda Rajapaksa on January 8 and again humiliated him on August 17. They did not vote against capitalism. They voted against the neo-fascist form of capitalism practised by the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. Actually they voted for democracy and good governance. They had, however, no illusions about the democracy they anticipated. Compared to the situation under the Rajapaksa regime much progress has been made in terms of democracy and popular freedoms. Much more ha to be done. It is also clear that there are forces opposed to a change inside the Government too. Hence, the delay in implementing many election pledges.
Constitutional changes
The struggle against the Geneva resolution is only a prelude to a bigger struggle that would emerge when the proposed Constitutional changes are put forward. Reactionary forces would definitely try to sabotage the drafting of a new Constitution. It is only through a new Constitution that present and impending changes could be made irreversible.
What is required to overcome imperialist influences is a domestic and foreign policy based on national requirements. Actually the foreign policy is only an extension of the domestic policy. An enlightened foreign policy is a must in order to develop cordial and friendly relations with all countries. For historical reasons most of our foreign relations, especially economic relations are with Western nations. Hence it would be foolish to neglect them, Similarly we have to develop relations with China and the emerging nations, especially of the BRICS group.
Needless to say that our relation with our closest neighbour India is a special one which has to be nurtured and developed. We have to be mindful of geo-political strategies of world and regional powers if we are to maintain our independence and defend our national sovereignty. For example, we should not be a party to the design of the United States to involve us in a strategic alliance to contain China in the Asia-Pacific region comprising the USA, Japan and India. It would be more appropriate to work towards a tripartite arrangement comprising India, China and Sri Lanka for maintaining pace and stability at least in the Indian sub-continent area. A similar arrangement is there in North East Asia between China, Japan and South Korea.
In the context of today's developing multi-polarity of the world non-alignment has a revived vitality.

Armed robbers with baby hold up shop
ARGENTINA: Three armed robbers with a baby have held up a clothing store in Argentina, attacking the salesman before ransacking the shop.
Security cameras recorded the criminals entering the store and carrying out the robbery, while the baby sat quietly on the floor.
Marcelo Taraborrelli, owner of the store 25 kilometres south of Buenos Aires, said a couple carrying the baby entered the store, posing as customers.
After asking questions, they told the salesman that "they would come back in a little while" because "they were going to get money from the teller" but when Mr Taraborrelli opened the door to let them out, a third criminal came in.
One hit the salesman and tied him up while the other two packed up their booty while the baby was left on the floor.
"He didn't walk, we think he was nine months to a year old," Mr Taraborrelli said.
"It was their strategy - it's obvious that the woman carried the baby to make it look like everything was all right. He was unfortunately the gang's innocent accomplice," he said.
Mr Taraborrelli reckoned he lost 50,000 pesos ($7300) worth of stock.
It is not the first time robbers have taken young children to a hit. Two men and a four-year-old were reportedly charged with robbery in Dallas this year, a couple was arrested last month accused of a street robbery in Atlanta, while two men were reportedly arrested in Chicago last week accused of taking a one-year-old along to several robberies. - AFP

China overtakes US in billionaire stakes
US: China has more billionaires than the United States for the first time after the ranks of the mainland's wealthiest, led by real estate mogul Wang Jianlin, swelled by 242, according to the latest rich list from Shanghai-based research firm Hurun.
There are now 596 US dollar billionaires in mainland China, Hurun said in a report released on Thursday. That number jumps to 715 if Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau are included and compares to 537 American billionaires, based on Hurun's calculations.
However, China's richest tycoons have some way to go before they catch up to their American counterparts as Mr Wang's US$34.4 billion ($47 billion) fortune is less than half the wealth of Bill Gates or Warren Buffett.
Still, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which owns cinema chain Hoyts and is one of the leading Chinese investors in Australian real estate, has seen his wealth grow more than 50 per cent from last year. That increase follows a string of overseas deals and the strong performance of the group's newly-listed cinema chain, placing him ahead of e-commerce giant Alibaba's Jack Ma and beverage king, Wahaha Group's Zong Qinghou.
The IT sector is the fastest-growing source of wealth in China, according to the Hurun research, with its number of rich-listers jumping 43 per cent from last year. They include Cheng Wei, a former Alibaba executive who left to co-found ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi, which is locked in a fierce battle with Uber to win over commuters and dominate the Chinese market.
Mr Cheng, 32, is one of the country's younger billionaires along with Frank Wang Tao, the 35 year-old founder of Dajiang Innovation Technology, which dominates the consumer drone market. Elsewhere in the IT sector, Lei Jun, founder of China's biggest smart phone company Xiaomi, doubled his wealth to US$14.4 billion from a year ago and moved up to fifth rank. - AFP
