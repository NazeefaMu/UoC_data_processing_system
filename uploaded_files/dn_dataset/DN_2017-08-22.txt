Lankas surgical service at international standard
The quality of surgical service in Sri Lanka is on par with international standards today. Currently, there are nearly 300 surgeons in Sri Lanka and the number is expected to double within the next five years, College of Surgeons of Sri Lanka President Prof. M D Lamawansa said.
Addressing the inaugural session of the 46th annual conference of the College of Surgeons of Sri Lanka at the Grand Kandyan Hotel in Kandy on August 18, Prof. Lamawansa said the main objective of their membership was to provide a quality service at the proper time. To ensure such quality service, it was important for surgeons to meet and deliberate at regular intervals.
He said their association had its beginnings in 1871 and the annual conference held regularly had been vital for maintaining high standards by updating their knowledge and experience.
He said they had received the tacit co-operation and assistance from the government too for carrying out their duty to the country.
As diabetes leads to other complications like heart attacks, loss of vision, kidney ailments and amputation of limbs following ulcers, they had paid attention towards setting up special counselling at hospitals.
Consultant Surgeon Dr Rasika Kotakadeniya said cancer and Hernia operations were performed without delay in Sri Lanka while patients in many other countries had to languish in a waiting list for nearly 6 months to get the surgery performed.
Prof. K B Galketiya, Prof Srinath Chandrasekara and Consultant Surgeon Dr Sameera Jayasinghe were among the other participants.

The Media is considered the fourth government in a democratic country. If the media of a country is independent, that country will progress economically and spiritually. Therefore, the media should be in the forefront of the countrys development, Head of the Bakeer Markar Centre and former Media Minister Imithiyas Bakeer Markar said.
He was addressing a media workshop of journalists in the North Central Province on the reconciliation-friendly journalism and discipline in reporting held at the Anuradhapura Creston Park Hotel Auditorium recently.
The National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry and Bakeer Markar Centre organised the workshop. He said the country was in a war against terrorism for three decades. We, as a nation must not allow any space for terrorism and allow the law and order of the country to prevail thereby providing equal opportunities for all communities in the country, Bakeer Markar said.
He said a reconciliation media network must be established very soon to ensure that people gets unbiased news.
Even though the war is no more, peace will not dawn automatically. We have to achieve reconciliation with much effort and proper initiatives. The media should be in the forefront in this regard, he said.

A Bill to legalize the termination of pregnancy on two specific occasions will be brought to Parliament soon, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
The two instances are if a female is made pregnant due to rape or if a foetus is diagnosed with Lethal Congenital Malformation.

Ajith is a cross between James Bond and Rocky
The much anticipated trailer of Ajiths Vivegam was released on Wednesday night and it promises to be a solid entertainer. Going by the visuals, it looks like a high-budget action fest where Ajiths character is a cross between Sylvester Stallone in Rocky and a suave international agent, say James Bond. To a large extent, the credit goes to Ajiths amazing transformation. The actor is looking fitter than ever before and has also sports six-pack abs.
The trailer clearly gives us a glimpse of the films theme and its to rise against all odds. Ajith is described as the phoenix (bird) that rises out of the ashes. We have already seen how Ajiths never give up has become a youth anthem and found its way even on T-shirts.
We also get a quick glimpse of Ajiths personal side and there are fleeting shots of Kajal Aggarwal, who plays his wife. This is the first time she has teamed up with Ajith and their pair has already drawn attention thanks to the promos. We are going to see Ajith in very different avatars - as a dutiful agent, as a loving and caring husband and finally as a revenge-seeking man. Vivek Oberois role is going to be one of the highlights and it looks like he turns rogue and will locks horns with Ajith.
The Hindustan Times
Vivegam starring Ajith, Kajal Aggarwal and Vivek Oberoi will be screening at Capitol Maradana, MC Colombo, MC Jaffna, Cinecity, Cineworld, City Cinema Mt. Laviniya (9.30 pm) and other film halls islandwise from August 24. It is a CEL release

Aspiring for immortality
Talent, commitment and simplicity are the pillars of Judy de Silvas career. A lady who has been singing since the age of seven she has been successful because she is down to earth and has never let fame get the better of her. Melodies speaks to Judy De Silva who is selectively passionate.
We have heard so many stories of child stars going wrong. The music industry is very competitive and demanding. Judy experienced fame at a very young age, becoming a child star, but has remained stable and she has her mother and her grandmother to thank for that. Like anyone in this world she has had her share of problems yet she has always had family.
I was brought up by two iron ladies - my grandmother, Evelyn, and my mother, Kanthie.
I have had problems like everyone in life and that has sometimes affected my career, but I have always found my strength to pull through without losing my cool thanks to "my rock", my mother and of course the rest of my family. If you have a strong family no one can burn you, and also if you are not too ambitious the impact of losses is less painful, said De Silva.
A lady who enjoys life in her own way she has done many cassettes and CDs with Sohan & X-Periments, one album with her mother including English Originals, One Sinhala album with 16 originals, One Album with Eternal Soul with Sinhala originals and about 10 singles in Sinhala and English.
Beautiful lyrics
De Silva has been singing from around the age of seven with her mother who is a singer by profession herself. She started singing professionally in 1985 with Debbie Arnolda who was the best one girl orchestra and had the best equipment at that time. Her father the late Bobby Arnolda (uncle Earl) was De Silvas first manager, from who she learnt what it was to be a performer.
Of course I enjoy music but I'm not passionate about music in whole, it all depends on my mood as to what type of music I'm passionate about. I enjoy life in my own way. I have always liked quiet surroundings. My life may seem boring to some but it's a lot of fun for me, explained De Silva.
Like any brilliant artiste Judys creations come from within. She uses her imagination and writes beautiful lyrics. That is why she is so successful. That is why she is one of the most respected women in the music industry in Sri Lanka, but admits that when composing tunes it comes from within. Locally she admires the talent of "Umara & Umaria" and Nirosha Virajini. Internationally she loves many artistes, but Whitney Houston is on top of the list.
When it comes to goals, plans and ambitions, she takes life as it comes. This approach she has had from her school days. She is content with what she has and who she is. De Silva has had the backing of the very best in the industry - Bobby Arnolda and Sohan Weerasinghe. Much of who she is, she attributes to them. Sohan Weerasinghe had a lot to do with De Silva forming an identity of her own.
I also won awards for the islands outstanding female vocalist, then got the opportunity to become an actress and won the Sarasaviya Lux Award for the "best new actress" for my first attempt in acting, said De Silva.
Various tunes
De Silva has had four mentors that have watched over her and have been a lamp to light the path before her. With their tutelage she has become a charismatic female musician capable of keeping an audience riveted.
I owe my success to my mom, from who I got my talent and learnt so much including standard songs and Jazz styles and the guidance in many areas. Then Lylie Godridge, who trained my voice, which has helped me to enhance my ability to sing, while being aware and being in control of my voice. Then Uncle Earl and Sohan. These four have given me the concrete foundation for my 32 year old career as a singer, said De Silva.
De Silva aspires to be immortal. Judging by the way she is going she may well be remembered, forever as long as music lives on, perhaps like all those great musicians before her. She has already made a mark in the industry. It is a distinct possibility.
What I want in my future is to do my own music and make a mark in the industry as a composer/song writer for my fans to remember me by, long after I'm done with singing, and to make the people who have contributed so much to my career proud. Even after we're all gone our names will forever be linked in the industry, said De Silva.
Some songs she does are ballads and dance and maybe even baila, rockn roll or even Latino. She says that whatever that comes from within her is created in various tunes and beats.
All songs I've written are heartbroken love songs except for "sweet daughter" which is a song for a wedding, said De Silva.
Having achieved fame at a very young age she has sound advice to anyone who wants to enter the music industry. Firstly it is to stay grounded however popular they become and keep things simple.
Work hard to make your fans happy. Do them justice, because they are very important. Listen to criticism more than praise. Dont cheat on singing by using current technology, because you will be doomed if you are asked to sing live! Technology is unavoidable, but is there to enhance talent not to create talent, she opined.

The two-day match at Fatullah, slated to start Tuesday, had been in doubt since heavy rain partially flooded part of the field.
It was the only warm-up fixture of the tour, Australias first to Bangladesh in more than a decade.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) offered alternative venues but the Australians were reluctant to change at the last minute due to security concerns.
The BCB has been fantastic trying to get us the game. The amount of rain hasnt helped, coach Darren Lehman told reporters in Dhaka.
We looked at various facilities around Dhaka. We feel for the people of Bangladesh with the amount of rain they have had. There are a lot of people in this country struggling because of the rain. So the thoughts are with them. AFP

The bell tolls for them (at last)
Things appear to be moving at long last. A full two and half years following the election of President Maithripala Sirisena to office, on a pledge to rope in the corrupt, the law is closing on the big time crooks and swindlers of the Rajapaksa administration. It is indeed inexplicable as to why the wheels of justice took so long to turn unless it was deliberately being stalled by interested parties as is now coming to light. True, laws delay is a perennial problem associated with Sri Lankas justice system. But this alone could not have been the reason. The trial in the murder of High Court judge Sarath Ambepitiya was concluded in a matter of seven months and the accused sentenced to death. Hence there was no reason as to why the present high profile cases could not have been dispensed with soon after the new government came into power. After all, prosecution of those involved in mega corruption was the main plank of the election platform of the Common Candidate, and as such, should been given the utmost priority.
According to our main story in yesterdays edition, 37 figures in the Rajapaksa government are to be hauled before courts in the coming days. Among them are former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former first son Namal Rajapaksa and then Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga. Former Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, Ex- Provincial Council Minister Udaya Gammanpila, former ministers Johnston Fernando and Mahindananda Aluthgamage are also among the lot. According to Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, indictments have been served on all the accused in the cases against them and trial dates have already been fixed.
As already mentioned, exposure of the wrong doers is long overdue, with the public clearly losing patience, wondering if government politicians were in fact lying when they spoke about the specific instances of corruption against the Rajapaksas. What is more, the culprits had taken to assume a holier than thou posture and has started pointing the accusing finger at government ministers and is currently going to town on the alleged Bond scam which is been heard by a Special Presidential Commission appointed by the Yahapalanaya government. The Ravi Karunanayake episode came like manna from heaven to the Joint Opposition which keeps hammering on, to detract from the serious allegations against its own members. With the cases against Rajapaksa and Co. now poised to be opened, there is the familiar refrain of a witch-hunt being launched against the former first family, to cover up the governments own shortcomings, particularly from Namal Rajapaksa, in a bid to throw dust in the eyes of the public.
It is not just the former ministers and their cohorts, all persons who held public office against whom there are multifarious allegations should be investigated and justice meted out to those found guilty. The law should pursue individuals who caused massive losses to the state by their acts of commission and omission. The authorities certainly cannot afford to overlook the hedging deal which caused an astronomical loss to the state. Nor can one ignore the Greek Bond losses in which the former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal had a direct hand. We say this because this personage has now offered to appear before the Special Presidential Commission to help unravel the alleged Bond scam, which clearly is a red herring laid to detract from his own misdeeds.
No stone should be left unturned to get at the accumulated loot, said to have been stashed away in offshore accounts, and expose the swindlers, who are today sitting pretty, thanks to the clear attempts being made to bury their cases. Not just the crooks, but their collaborators too should be brought to book. No doubt, every effort will be made by the offenders to create a circus at the court houses they are to be taken to by bringing in their supporters in numbers, as we have already witnessed. All measures should be taken by the government to prevent such theatrics where the rogues disport themselves as heroes. There have been several instances in the recent past where our court houses have been desecrated by politicians and men in robes. Such incidents should be prevented at all cost.
Be that as it may, the government must ensure that justice is meted out even handedly and acts of corruption in the Yahapalanaya government should also be probed with equal zeal. It has set a commendable example in this respect by demonstrating that it means business when a powerful government minister, no less, was hauled before a Presidential Commission and virtually subjected to an inquisition by the state counsel, a scenario unthinkable under Rajapaksa. It is hoped that with the prosecution of the wrongdoers of the former regime, for which the mechanism has now been set in motion, we would see an end to scourge of corruption, that has eaten into the vitals of this country, and society at large, and every politician and government official made accountable for their actions.

Broad proud to beat Bothams mark
BIRMINGHAM, Sunday  Stuart Broad paid tribute to the big influence of Ian Botham on his career after beating the England greats tally of Test wickets.
The 31-year-old paceman produced one of the wicket-taking bursts for which he has become known with a spell of three for four in 11 balls as England hammered the West Indies inside three days to win the inaugural day/night Test in Britain by an innings and 209 runs at Edgbaston on Saturday.
It left Broad with 384 Test wickets to outstanding all-rounder Bothams 383.
Only new-ball partner James Anderson, who has 492 Test wickets to his credit, is now ahead of Broad in Englands all-time list.
Broad, who has two Test hat-tricks to his credit, almost had a third on Saturday before Kemar Roach got his bat in the way.
No that Broad had long to wait to go past Botham, who was commentating on the match for television, as two overs later he bowled Shane Dowrich.
Broads links to Botham extend beyond his own impressive career.
His father Chris Broad, a former opening batsman, played in the same England side as Botham and the pair both enjoyed a successful Ashes-winning tour of Australia in 1986/87.
My dad made me watch On Top Down Under (the BBC video chronicling the tour) relentlessly -- 86-87, I was three months old (then) but I watched that throughout the early 90s.
Botham reserved some of his most outstanding performances for Australia, notably during the 1981 Ashes series where he starred with both bat and ball, while Broad took his Test-best figures against Englands arch-rivals with a remarkable return of eight for 15 that set up an Ashes-clinching win at his Trent Bridge home ground two years ago.
He is someone who has been a big influence on me, said Broad junior.
Obviously, playing with my dad and watching some of his performances against Australia, he is a huge legend of English cricket but someone who has given a lot back to this team, actually.
I was very fortunate to get my Test cap off him back in 2007.
He is someone who obviously has an influence on us, the way he performed against Australia. Broad added: He is someone who is passionate about English cricket and you can tell he wants us to do well.  AFP

China donates drinking water under Suwadiviyata Pen Dhothak programme
The Sri Lanka-China Buddhist Friendship Association implemented the first project Suwadiviyata Pen Dhothak programme to assist people in the Gomarnakadawala area who are in dire need of purified drinking water with the financial assistance of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka. This project was implemented on a request made by the Adhikarana Sangha Nayake of the North East Provinces of Amarapura Siri Sdhammawansa Nikaya Most Ven.

Grieve your dementia
It is astonishing how the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has recently made a quizzical statement at a function launching the Sri Lanka Podujana Lawyers association that he is still the SLFP leader after the SLFP leadership has been handed over to the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena.
I feel sorry that he is suffering from a kind of dementia that he forgets the past which he gave the SLFP leadership to the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena soon after his defeat in the Presidential election at a SLFP function held in Sri Lanka Freedom Party Headquarters in Darley road. His accusation that the appointment of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is unconstitutional and is also baseless because the Executive President in Sri Lanka after winning in the election can appoint his Cabinet and the Prime Minister of his own wishes according to the Constitution.
He should understand that real democracy prevails in the country now but not in the past during the dark reign of the Rajapaksa cronies. In a democratic party like the UNP, there is no harm in bringing a no confidence motion against one of its ministers or members of parliament. It is quite possible either for SLFP or the UNP or any other party to bring a no confidence motion against a member who transgresses the party norms.
He is blaming the Government that it sells the national assets but in the meanwhile he has forgotten he has sold more 50 acres of the Galle Face Green to a Chinese company to construct the port city. There are many other foreign deals he manipulated during his tenure of office which he has forgotten. It is lamentable that the present Government has to pay the price for the sins he has committed is intolerable for the poor people of the country.

Civilised warfare
If you are a Sinhalese, close your eyes and listen to a few of Nanda Malini's best songs. And then, reflect on her widely reported humble beginnings in a disadvantaged settlement in Colombo. Fortunately, for her and us, her innate talents were in music, not in any other institutionalized area of professional work where the rise to a higher level of competence and recognition has long been dependent on access to social and financial resources, besides having attended a privileged school.
Yet, in general, Sri Lanka has been more egalitarian since independence than other south Asian countries, largely thanks to universal free education introduced in the early 1940's. Since then, many people from humble backgrounds have risen to higher positions in diverse fields. University professors, top public servants, lawyers, medical doctors, engineers, etc. have hailed from diverse social backgrounds including disadvantaged social groups. Yet, increasing inequality within the education system and rapid population growth made upward social mobility more difficult in recent decades.
The experience of social marginalization and the inability to satisfy social aspirations encouraged much youth in all parts of the country to join violent rebellions since the early 1970's. Some of the protests that are on going in the country are also manifestations of the same unjust competition.
Modern egalitarian societies
Circulation of elites, a concept introduced and elucidated by a well known Italian Sociologist, Vilfredo Pareto, is a characteristic feature of modern egalitarian societies. In simple terms, this means that the individuals with the aptitudes and talents can achieve elite status in diverse fields irrespective of their birth status. Given the fact that the elites in diverse fields, in general, constitute a minority of individuals with exceptional talents and attributes, those members of the privileged upper stratum who do not achieve such qualities have to give way to the former.
This is what circulation of elites is all about. By contrast, traditional societies where birth status mostly determined the life chances of individuals, privileges and positions were reserved for those who belonged to traditional elite groups such as higher castes and feudal aristocratic clans. Pre-colonial Sri Lanka was not an exception in this regard.
The Western colonial rule, however, opened up some avenues for people outside traditional elite circles to achieve upward mobility but, as historians have documented, such mobility was not necessarily accepted without resistance. So, even when modern education was embraced by natives as an avenue of social mobility, educational institutions they helped build were used by them to protect their newly acquired privileges rather than to create opportunities for the underprivileged. So, the education system remained highly unequal until the introduction of C.W.W Kannangara reforms.
Equal opportunities
Circulation of elites is widely recognized in modern societies as a positive feature not only due to ideological reasons. Societies that place a high value on equality and equality of opportunity support policy measures that create equal opportunities. When people demand equal opportunities, policies and practices that deny them are resisted, at times even violently. On the other hand, extending equal opportunity to all segments of society is an effective way to develop the full human potential for the benefit of the entire society.
This is what many developed egalitarian societies have demonstrated in no uncertain terms. On the other hand, the upward and downward mobility of individuals is not a smooth process even in highly individualistic capitalist societies as many structural factors facilitate the reproduction of privileged groups to a large extent through processes of intergenerational transmission of wealth and cultural attributes. But this can be neutralized to a considerable extent by effective and deliberate measures of redistribution of wealth and opportunities such as progressive taxation and equal educational opportunities.
Education and other social policies in Sri Lanka today do not create equal opportunities for upward social mobility. Firstly, the education system does not help develop the full intellectual potential of children and youth in the country. Rural and urban disparities in education create many divisions among upwardly mobile youth and they have highly unequal life chances.
While many youths leave school early and take up jobs that guarantee no decent and stable future for them, those who remain within the system and reach the university level end up having highly unequal life chances. Compare the life chances of an engineer or doctor with those of an average arts graduate.
While the language skills of educated youth play an important part in determining employment and other opportunities, the failure to impart language skills to schoolchildren has continued to be a major source of frustration among youth contributing to various social issues including violent conflicts in the country. As is well known, the lack of language skills is also an important factor impeding educational advancement among youth leading to many adverse consequences. This is an issue that can be easily resolved if effective measures are taken.
Highest level of achievement
The phenomenon of elite circulation is not confined to the field of education and employment. It is equally relevant for politics, civil society, arts, and science. Free upward and downward movement of individuals based on their talents and capabilities is critically important for the well-being of people and social and political stability of countries.
What happens when dictators capture power and share power and privileges with a small coterie of relatives, friends and acquaintances The entire state apparatus decays.
The same can happen in civil society organisations, political parties, businesses, etc. Manipulation of political parties by those who capture them to bring in their own kind lead to their degeneration as we have witnessed in this country.
Former Singapore PM allowed his son to replace him only when he had acquired his own impeccable credentials and gained maturity. Though regimes micro-managed by dictators may eventually fall, the lost opportunities can not be easily retrieved because they are often permanently lost.
The value of unconstrained development of talents is clearly evident in the field of music. The likes of Amaradeva and Nanda Malini have enriched the lives of millions of Sri Lankans and their music soothes us on a daily basis. If their humble beginnings prevented them from reaching the highest level of achievement, the whole country would have been poorer. Why not create the same conditions for youth with diverse talents to do so in a whole range of other fields That would benefit not only them but the entire society as well.

Court rejects recalling of Udayanga's warrant
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday rejected a request made by former Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga to recall the arrest warrant issued against him through the INTERPOL over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF).
Colombo Fort Magistrate Ms. Lanka Jayaratne further rejected an application made by Udayanga Weeratunga challenging the impounding of two passports belonging to him as part of the investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft deal.
Defence Counsel Anil Silva PC appearing on behalf of Udayanga Weeratunga had requested to recall the arrest warrant issued against him through the INTERPOL and not to impound his passports.
The Magistrate observed that there are no reasonable grounds to recall the warrant against the suspect since he is alleged to have committed cognisable offences. Udayanga Weeratunga had been noticed to appear before the FCID but he did not turn up.
The Court had also issued notices to his local and foreign residences. A law abiding citizen should not behave like this, the Magistrate observed. Meanwhile, the Magistrate orally observed that the prosecutors should take necessary action against other persons involved in this alleged fraudulent transaction.
On June 30, the Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered to impound two passports belonging to former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga in the magisterial inquiry pertaining to the controversial MiG aircraft transaction.
Accordingly, a diplomatic passport bearing number D 3643585 and a general passport bearing number N 5400885 issued by the Sri Lankan government to Udayanga Weeratunga were ordered to be impounded by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in accordance with Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 51 C of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act. Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had earlier issued a warrant through INTERPOL for the arrest of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Anil Silva, PC submitted to Court that issuing of warrant against his client and impounding his passports had not been done in accordance with the law. He further said Weeratunga has been in Ukraine for nearly three decades.
The Financial Crimes Investigations Division(FCID) conducting investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft transaction informed Court that they have sought the assistance of INTERPOL to trace former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga who is currently living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The FCID informed Court that they were yet to ascertain Udayangas exact address in UAE and further said he has visited multiple countries including Japan using passports issued by Sri Lankan government.
The FCID conducting investigations into the MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga as a suspect in the case through a B report dated October 11, 2016. The FCID sought a warrant written in English through the Interpol from the Fort Magistrates Court to arrest former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA). The FCID told Court that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to serve notices on Udayanga Weeratunga who has been residing in Ukraine for several years.
The FCID had informed Court that Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack craft. The FCID said the deal amounted to US$14 million. On June 9, 2016, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued notices on Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up.The FCID had told Court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which were allegedly earned through the Mig-27 transaction. The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas.
In his complaint to the FCID,journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lanka and Ukraine.

Cricket is a game of many facets
I have seen the high wall of Lords ground, symbolically, as cutting off cricket from the outside world. Keep politics out of sports was the cry during the ha ho about the 1970 South African tour.
No sport runs deep into life than cricket in Sri Lanka. When watching a cricket match mood swings occur frequently.
Cricket in many ways is unique, yet to sing praises about it is to underestimate its humane quality.
It is a game of figures since it determines its outcome. A man may play billiards or snooker he will not look at a scoreboard to decide whether he is winning or losing. An interesting point here is that the players face in this game is permanently in shadow. Whereas the Australian, Indian, Sri Lankan or West Indian cricketers in action however and - regardless of their caps and colour - within minutes they will identify themselves by their methods, manner or attitude which goes to say that most games are skin deep; but cricket goes to the bone. It is worthwhile having a look at these countries.
AUSTRALIA - The Australians still play the game harder than any other country, recently they got what they wanted in their payment issue, they have never knuckled down to any threats posed on them. They are not sissies in the playing field and off the field they are always willing to have a friendly chat over a beer. The Australians have a rock solid cricket structure, from grade cricket to Sheffield Shield and then to the top rung, players are nurtured systematically so that they can be world beaters. By and large they also have a solid family life so that they can focus on their game without any distractions.
INDIA - India has improved in leaps and bounds in recent times, one may argue that its easy to pick talent from their vast population.This is not true because picking talent and nurturing them is a difficult task. They must be doing it with proper dedication and commitment by their scouts who must be incorrupt and honest. Their team is riding ably led by Virat Kohli. I feel that everything is in place in their cricket jigsaw. Due to their pristine culture the cricketers have a good family life most of their cricketers are geared not to have any distractions. They too have a cricket structure that is well in place and Sunil Gavaskar, the great cricketer and analyst had the audacity to state that Sri Lanka is no match for a Ranji Trophy side, for him to relegate us like that means there is something wrong somewhere!
WEST INDIES - The West Indian cricket were more less governed by their prima donnas, recently, headed by Chris Gayle. They are going through a lean patch at the moment, they too have talent and sooner than later we hope they sort their problems out. West Indian stroke play is exciting which nobody can match and their pace battery in the past has created havoc among the hapless batsmen as we all know.
BANGLADESH - Bangladesh are heading in the right direction, their cricket playing is under the able hands of Chandika Hathurusingha and some notable ex Sri Lankan players, all of them has had a raw deal back home. As they are an emerging nation in world cricket, the support they get from their crowd is tremendous, just like the Sri Lankan scenario in the mid-nineties.
SRI LANKA - At the moment Sri Lankan cricket is in dire straits; how can a team beat the Australians a few years back and get then get Indian washed with the best detergents. The set up has hardly changed, then and now e.g. players, selectors and the up above. Sifting through the rubble I point my finger at the commitment of the players and their lackadaisical attitude along with the shuffling of captains like a pack of cards.No one in this present team is playing for their country and in some instances not even for themselves.
Once a captain is changed and not being dropped from the team, that person pretends to carry an injury and underperform, it is an absurd state of affairs. We have had Lasith Malinga, Rangana Herath, Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga and Dinesh Chandimal as captains, except Chandimal (yet to be properly tested but disappointing thus far) have not delivered at all. They have given records to their opponents on a platter. These captains have their favourites and enemies and the players commitment suffer as a result.
Lasith Malinga the prima donna has done the country proud but he should be shown the door, since his physical fitness is very poor and his commitment to his fielding is abysmal.
Angelo Mathews is not a fitness fanatic too, and when he fields he takes one catch and drops three, when he bats threes become twos and twos become singles which bugs the opposing batsmen no end. He is resting his muscles too by not bowling.
Rangana Herath with his battered knees has definitely seen better days, high time he retires now. He is another passenger in the field.
Upul Tharanga has a lackadaisical attitude although his cover drive is pleasing to the eye. At his age he should think of retirement as well.
Dinesh Chandimal - Now that he has got the much awaited Test captaincy, he should forge the team together, his field placing was much to be desired in the recent series and when you have three past captains on the field, at best they can confuse you more than been useful to him. I bet if Chandimal had his way he should have depended on his own judgement, and done better. He was batting well in the third Test but did not play with soft hands to the spinners and was plucked by the Indians in the leg trap.
Kusal Mendis - His talent is there and has scored many runs but his running between the wickets is horrendous, at times it looks as if he is bored with batting and looking for a way to get out. In the future he should think of the team first and foremost.
Niroshan Dickwella - The way he got out trying the Dilscoop was diabolical and at that time Sri Lanka was in dire straits, he should put the side before self in the future.

Deepwater Horizon : An extremely intense ride
On April 20th, 2010, one of the worlds largest man-made disasters occurred on the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico.
Deepwater Horizon is directed by Peter Berg and stars Mark Wahlberg. Its a true story of the workers caught in the horrible oil disaster that occurred on Deepwater Horizon. This was widely publicized as the worst oil disaster in the U.S history and its the story of the people who were caught in the middle on this horrible day. The film focuses on events leading up to this disaster, how it possibly could have been prevented and how these people survived. It is also a tribute to those who did not survive the event.
This is not the first true story that Peter Berg has made with Wahlberg. The last one was The Lone Survivor and in fact this will not be the last. They also have a movie called Patriots day which is also based on true events in the making. So this is movie number two in their unofficial based on true events trilogy. As soon as the disaster begins Deepwater Horizon was a nonstop immaculate mastery. Its very easy to watch a film like this that technically encompasses nonstop action. Just think that it is mindless without ever actually realizing how much work truly goes on into the technical things on display in this film.
Terrible disaster
This is a very realistic and gritty depiction of a terrible disaster. There is never a moment in this film where I went thats a Hollywood moment! Thats one of those fake moments that make us feel like were watching a movie. This film feels very realistic. Aside from some close-up views of inside the oil pipe where we see gear shifting, it almost felt like one of those tube webcams had been stuck down there. It didnt feel like we were watching a Michael Bay movie so to speak. It felt very in the moment. All the action was captured extremely well.
Honestly, its the same basic structure of The Lone Survivor. We set up some likable people in the middle of a terrible situation and once that situation goes down and chaos erupt again, its nonstop from there to the end just like Lone Survivor. But it totally works in this movie. A lot of that is due to a surprisingly effective first act. These characters that are set up are actually very well drawn. I expected this film to be technically masterful in regard to all of the stunt work and the explosions. I expected all of that to be done very well.
Theres a great scene where Wahlberg reminded me of me. He takes a lot of pride in his office being perfect and when he asks someone whos leaving his office wheatear he had touched any of his stuff and the person says no. And after he goes in his office and things are moved and turned around and it reminded of me. Whenever a family member comes in here and borrows one of my stuff and puts them back crooked, I notice it. Thats me. I love that quirk that was given to his character. I can relate to his OCD habits with the things that he collected or that he appreciated. His family life with his young daughter who has a school project and his wife played by Kate Hudson - these are all things that help us care more about his character. They really do take the time to set up a natural environment in which all of the people exist and work and it feels completely real.
Halfway point
So when the really bad stuff starts happening you really do care for those characters and you want them to get out of this situation. Kurt Russell is also really good in this movie and theres a fantastic scene between him and John Malkovich who I did not know was in the movie before watvhing it. He plays one of the higher ups at BP (British Petroleum). This moment occurs towards the halfway point of the movie and it spoke everything that needed to be said with no one even speaking a word. Thats good direction and good acting.
At the end Deepwater Horizon was an extremely intense movie that depicted events that happened to people that could have been prevented and it was displayed in a very surprisingly mature way. That is something that I really enjoyed. If you are a fan of Lone Survivor I think this movie will probably be up your alley. Deepwater Horizon had also received two nominations at the 89th Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and for Best Sound Editing.

Dowry debate: Until debt do them part
Down in this neck of the woods they call the subcontinent, securing financial stability through marriage is still seen as a matter of utmost importance for many a young man. Although there is a cultural precedent for precisely this sort of male ambition it would pain a lot of so called gold-digging Sri Lankan males to admit it.
Many would not publicly acknowledge pursuing wealthy women with such fervour, but it certainly does happen. A woman without a substantial dowry, no matter how upright and desirable, is viewed as being far more attractive if her parents are willing to part with a substantial chunk of the family wealth.
Those less alluring brides-elect in the looks department are usually at a significant disadvantage when it comes to the matrimonial stakes, although such slight drawbacks can easily be varnished with thick layers of cold cream and wads of cold cash. You see, the extra moolah, property and wealth that come from these unions are a great boon to posterity, sometimes for many generations.
In our society, dowry which is given to the bride by her parents is an acceptable and an established practice. It is an ancient custom, and its existence may well predate records of it. To be perfectly truthful when it comes to marriage certain people are always handing out or demanding a matrimonial prospectus. Just look at the matrimonial advertisements published in some of our leading local journals. Some even pronounce the word matrimony to sound as if it were matter-of-money.
Unfortunately, dowry is a very serious matter in India, not just because it is still widely practiced - despite laws against it - but because it precipitates far too much violence against women. Some fall victim to mysterious kitchen accidents, accidents that somehow never occur when the mother-in-law is cooking. However, the practice is not as prevalent in Sri Lanka as among some of sub-continental neighbours. Fortunately in Sri Lanka the status of women is relatively high, especially in comparison to other South Asian nations. But we are all aware that the practice still exists here where it is expected among many groups for the brides family to give the groom a dowry.
The anti-dowry cynics may tell you that determined dowry hunters may as well follow the customary role with rude shamelessness asking affluent parents for their daughters hand with: Your money and a wife allows me a life with no strife. But the incurable romantics among us contend we should marry for love. They claim we should search for our soul-mate. Or at least thats what the movies tell us.
But the school of thought that is considered mercenary when it comes to marriage does not share this idealistic outlook. They declare the reality is a bit more complicated as well as impractical. Many of them assert that there is an easier and less challenging way to tie the knot without tying yourself up in knots.
They insist that it is irrational to follow the romantic types to the altar or poruwa by working hard, taking risks, maybe building your own business or developing your career. For the dignified male that has been the traditional route to financial success. Of course, there is another highly traditional path that another part of our community practices to acquiring wealth that isnt talked about quite as much these days: Marrying money.
My good friend Marcellus, we call him Marcy for short, who married for love considers marrying for money quite repugnant. Nothing makes him more agitated and causes him to flip his lid more than the subject of dowry hunters and anyone bent on marrying for money. He is a vociferous anti-dowry lobbyist and contends that marrying for money is a repulsive idea.
Marcellus who is an incurable romantic can be quite merciless when it comes to lashing out at anyone who does not share his idealistic outlook. He claims that when he married nobody brought up the question of dowry. He elaborates: Not my bride, not my in-laws, not my mother, and certainly not me.
If I had even hinted that I wanted a dowry, my bride would have immediately called off the wedding. And as if that wasnt bad enough, she would have also refused to go on the honeymoon.
He cites the example of another of our acquaintances named Prosper who he claims settled down for shekels. Marcys stand on the subject has always been in diametric contrast to that of the conformist-minded Prosper. Both the unconventional Marcy and the traditionalist Prosper have always been at loggerheads over the subject of dowry.
You will have realised by now that there had been no love lost between the two adversaries. In fact when the debate on the subject got a bit hot under their collars Marcy said he actually told Prosper that his parents should have been congratulated for christening him appropriately. He baited Prosper by telling him that his name must have been a shortened form for prospector. He told Prosper: After all, they must have known you were a born gold-digger from the time you came squealing into the world.
Marcy says: He values money more than love, beauty or virtue. Its that simple. Love, romance, or looks were never a priority. For the right amount he can love anybody! His wife provided a lifestyle and thats what he loved. But then he did not bargain for the fact that with all the benefits money could buy he had to go along with a life time of bickering and suffering.
Marcy quite uncharitably says that Prospers wife had an uncanny resemblance to her family pet, or was it the other way around I say uncharitable because the family pet happened to be a bulldog. He swore that the likeness did not end with the same facial expressions and heavy physique of the family hound. He elaborated that when she spoke she rumbled and yelped and most of her dialogue was made up of biting sarcasm with bared incisors.
As if this was not bad enough Marcy claimed with defamatory temerity that Prospers 97-year-old-mother-in-law still calls the shots on the home front and reminds him constantly that she grubstaked him before he became a financial success. Says Marcy: Imagine living with a geriatric in-law who is really an outlaw in petticoats! Hows that for choosing a family because of their fiscal fitness
The story goes that Prosper had decided to walk out of the dispute. But all in all, it had been an exciting ding-dong debate on the merits and demerits of matrimonial endowments, of whether to condone or divorce the dowry system. The bridle was finally reined in over the issue of Bride and Prejudice. And very likely to remain so, for Prosper and his wife at least, until debt do them part!

Dry rations and drinking water for drought affected

President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to give dry rations to farmers affected by the drought is being carried out continuously.
The program is covering 13 districts and the items given include flour, dhal, sugar, lentils and canned fish. Farmers selected by District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries are issued this dry ration through the co-operatives.
President Sirisena recently made a visit to Kabithigollawa to look into the problems faced by the famer community due to the drought and instructed to provide dry rations as we as drinking water.
According to the presidents instructions, drinking water is being distributed with the support of Sri Lanka Army. An extensive program is in effect to provide drinking water for 250,000 people in 117 divisional secretariat divisions in 20 districts.
Meanwhile, a discussion in this regard was held under the patronage of Presidents Secretary Austin Fernando yesterday (21st Aug.) with representatives from Ministries of Disaster Management, City Planning and Water Supply, Home Affairs and Finance.
At this meeting, it was decided to increase the drinking water supply and to extend it to the night as well. They also discussed to purchase more water bowsers.

Earliest traces of Diplomacy
Book Review
Title: Buddhism in UN system
Author: Jayantha Pathirana
The present work is on Buddhism in UN system. He has produced this work with the conviction: I quote  Now I firmly believe that the UN system could harness the teachings of the Supreme Buddha who had been taught 2561 years ago, and would be pertinent and applicable to the development of the objectives of the UN system (p. ix). Interestingly the publication of this book coincided with the celebration of UN Vesak Day, held in Sri Lanka just after this Vesak which marks the 2561st year in the Buddha era.
As many of you know, a resolution was passed in an International Buddhist Conference held in Colombo in 1998 to request UN to declare Vesak an international religious holiday. In 1999 our then Foreign Minister, the late Lakshman Kadirgamar tabled the resolution and as unanimously adopted by UN General Assembly Vesak as a day of observance. In 2016 it has been upgraded to an optional holiday, still falling short of making Vesak a full-fledged UN religious holiday. Lets hope that it will happen soon!
When we think of UN we are thinking of a gigantic and global organisation the scope of which the entire globe we live in.
What does the teaching of the Buddha teach in ancient India about 25 centuries back has to do with this global organisation With globalization, religion today has become globalized. This is in an organisational sense. But what is even more important is for a religion to have a global vision at its very foundation. As I have mentioned in the foreword to this book, the Buddha, as Prince/Ascetic Siddhartha, began with such a vision, in fact, a vision expanding much beyond the globe we live into the universe which is described in the Buddhist texts as the system of ten thousand worlds. Let me quote again what was in Siddharthas mind when he renounced his household life in search of what is wholesome (kim-kusala-gavesi).
Universal significance
Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment while I was still a Bodhisattva, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me: Alas, this world has fallen into trouble, in that it is born, ages and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this suffering (headed by ageing and death). When now will escape be discerned from this suffering. (Samyutta-Nikaya: Nidana Samyutta: The Connected Discourse of the Buddha, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, p. 537).
What is revealed in this statement of the Buddha is not the popular view that Siddhartha left home in search of freedom from his own suffering. The focus here is not oneself but the world including oneself and all others. Interestingly it is said that at the conclusion of his first sermon which outlined the four noble truths, the crux of his message to the suffering world, it spread to the highest point of the world system, Akanitthaka Brahma world. One could again dismiss this type of statement as a mere result of religious sentiment. But I think this has a more important figurative significance, namely, that the word of the Buddha had a universal significance, applicable to all sentient beings without any limitation.
If UN and Buddhism have anything in common it is this global/universal view. The destruction caused by the 2nd World War was the immediate reason behind the birth of UN. It was to adopt measures to prevent recurrence of another similar catastrophe and at the very beginning, it identified the ultimate location of war in human mind, an analysis not different from that of Buddhism. Even though human problems originate in the human mind, it does not function in isolation. What happens in mind have causes and conditions outside. The answers cannot merely be inner but require outer solutions requiring structures to implement them. What the author of this book means by combining the UN and the teaching of the Buddha must be to underscore the relation between inner and outer.
The key themes of the book are peace, security, disarmament and human rights, themes associated with UN quite closely. The author proposes that these lofty goals can be achieved by making use of the teachings of the Buddha. Although this is not a totally new piece of information what it noteworthy is the way these UN goals are connected with Buddhist insights. The author deserves our praise for the commendable job he does in order to establish his case.
At this point, rather than summarizing the content of the book, let me briefly address an issue that comes up in discussions of Buddhism in conjunction with themes such as violence, peace and human rights and then wind up. I think it is particularly pertinent to discuss this matter taking into consideration the fact that this book contains a chapter on hysteria on Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka and also the current state of affairs in which Buddhism is being taken to task for allegedly using violence against Muslims. The title of the latest book edited by Professor John Holt Buddhist Extremists and Muslim Minorities says it all.
The often asked question in this context is: how can Buddhism, a peaceful religion, resort to violence The implicit assertion is that while others are free to do whatever they like, Buddhists, being followers of a peaceful religion, should bear such activities without any violent reaction.
Buddhist political philosophy
This position does not leave much for Buddhists, either they have to let others destroy them or simply concede defeat and save their lives. History reveals that Buddhists have done both depending on situations. However, they also have resisted violence and have returned violence with violence by way of resistance and have managed to survive amidst those who are there to destroy them. But, according to others, this is in violation of the Dhamma! It appears that the only consistent position a Buddhist is left with is self-sacrifice. If all Buddhists chose this option Buddhism would have died long back. Fortunately, the majority have not resorted to this option. And the common sense says that this cannot be the Buddhist answer.
On the one hand, there is an inconsistency and irony when one who does not accept the Buddhist religion admonishes Buddhists to be peaceful. If the opponent says so in order to drag the Buddhist to the war/conflict by showing untenability of the Buddhist position then that is at least fair. But when the opponent admonishes the Buddhist he does so in order to stop the latter adhering to violence, so that he himself is benefitted by that. In doing so the opponent is falsely contributing to the view which he does not really believe in and aims to get undue advantage from the belief system of the Buddhist. In other words, you make use of the Buddhist teaching itself to make the Buddhist an easy target!
Perhaps, in this context, we can draw some lessons from the long history of Buddhism: Emperor Asoka who followed the Buddhist political philosophy gave up aggression for good. This, however, does not mean that he dismantled his army.
Although, the armed peace (to borrow from SWRD Bandaranaike, former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka), is not the best option it is inevitable for a country to have an army to protect itself. The Buddhist monks of Chan/Zen tradition of ancient China and Japan developed karate (empty hand) only as a way of self-defence (for they did not believe in self-sacrifice when their existence was at stake). Accordingly, Buddhism is not peaceful to the extent that it admonishes its followers to embrace death/extinction rather than fighting for survival.
The discussion on violence brings us to the issue of human rights. Thanks to UN we have an elaborate conception of human rights and we consider human rights to be sacrosanct and inviolable. But what baffles the common sense logic is when we hear about human rights of terrorists who speak only the language of the gun. Sri Lanka armed forces which terminated the LTTE terrorism has been accused of violating human rights of terrorists. The question is: whose human rights that matter, those of terrorists or of their victims If there is such a thing called human rights of terrorists and if Sri Lanka armed forces violated their human rights, one thing is clear, namely, that in doing so they have safeguarded the human rights of more than twenty-one million people in this country. What the Prime Minister of England recently said to the world after the Manchester attack clearly shows that human rights are not final.
The author of this book has discussed the theory of Buddhism and has taken pains to show how Buddhism has answers. In my presentation, I tried to highlight some of the practical issues associated in particular with Buddhism. But not only Buddhism but also religion, in general, is under increasing scrutiny today. According to some, the answer is to abandon religion altogether and embrace secularism with the hope to make an end to religiously motivated problems.
Emotionally dishonest
According to some others, the answer is to adhere to relativism and opt to follow all or more than one religion. In my opinion, both these options are misguided. Secularism, while doing away with the ills of organised religion, robs humanity of what is good in it. Relativism, leading to simultaneous dual or multiple religious belonging, could be intellectually lacking, emotionally dishonest and spiritually confusing. What is problematic is not adherence to a particular religion, but to hold that any religion, except that of ones own, should not exist. So long as there is even one religion that believes that it alone should exist and all others should perish there will not be peace in the world. This brings us to the need for religions to come up with an ethics that transcends themselves.
Finally, the author of this book, Jayantha Pathirana, tells us that Buddhism can give eyes to the UN system. This does not need to be understood as a parochial assertion that only Buddhism can do it. All religions will have their own ways to achieve this result. Jayantha Pathirana, on his part, has brought into light the religion he knows best and follows in his life. We must congratulate him on this job done well.

Emirates  showcases its  A380 to Colombo passengers
In a bid to showcase its world-class onboard product and service to its Sri Lankan market, the award-winning Emirates airline flew its third-generation A380-800 aircraft from Dubai to Colombo and back on August 14.
This 21st century twin-deck aircraft with upgraded fly-by-wire technology is the world's largest and most spacious aircraft with the quietest cabin in the sky.
It's two passenger levels offer an entire deck worth of additional space. The return flight EK 655 from Colombo to Dubai at 10:10 pm on August 14, for instance, carried a full load of passengers with 14 in First Cass, 76 in Business Class and 429 in Economy Class.
Apart from passenger loads, the A380 is the aircraft of the century for its cleaner, greener, quieter and smarter technology, as the aircraft sets the bar for its low fuel consumption and noise level and reduced CO2 and NOx emissions.
The A380 has innovative cabin air supply technology with cabin air regulated every two minutes to keep the atmosphere fresh while natural light is provided by 220 windows.
Six high-level air outlets as opposed to the industry standard of two keep customers refreshed throughout the flight.
A wide staircase takes premium passengers to the Business Class and First Class zones.
A special feature of the Emirates' A380 is the onboard lounge for First and Business Class passengers. The lounge creates a comfortable ambience with passengers chatting on sofas or standing around the bar enjoying the finest premium spirits, wines and delicious canaps. A 42 inch LCD screen shows the aircrafts position and views from its external cameras.
Business Class on the A380 features has a seat configuration of 1-2-1 so that every passenger has easy aisle access. Seats are spacious and comfortable and extend to form a fully-flat bed. Each seat has a mini bar, large personal table for work if needed, separate foot rest extension (electrically operated), storage space for laptop and shoes, adjustable headrests and noise cancellation headsets. Each seat has dual USB ports too.
Each Business Class seat has a 20 inch high definition LCD screen.

An in-seat phone can be used to call passengers onboard as well as outsiders, send an sms and email. Free wifi (upto 10mb) is available on the A380 for all three classes. Among other comforts, First Class has a door to each seat ensuring privacy as well as shower spas.
Champagne or fruit juice was served before departure on Business Class. Dinner was a six-course meal served on Royal Doulton bone china. Canaps or mixed nuts accompanied aperitifs. An extensive selection of complimentary drinks was served throughout the flight.
Dubai International's airport's vast Terminal 3 is dedicated to Emirates flights. Special A380 aerobridges enable passengers to disembark from the upper deck. A train takes passengers from Immigration to baggage collection. Emirates says the launch of Terminal 3 in 2008 is the most successful launch of a terminal of its size.
Emirates has 96 A380s which fly to 48 destinations, a third of its global network. There are 23,000 A380 crew and onboard the August 14 flight, the crew comprised 19 different nationalities bearing testament to Emirates being the fastest growing international airline. While incorporating world-class standards, Emirates is committed to ensuring a cosmopolitan crew and cuisine to cater to its passengers on individual routes.
In all, Emirates has 259 aircraft with more on order and serves 157 destinations (including 16 cargo-only points) across six continents.

Family trio serenading Sri Lanka since 2013
V3, the family trio that play music to serenade the soul, have a unique sound that finds them in demand by discerning music lovers across the island. With a repertoire that covers music from Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and others across a wide spectrum spanning modern classics and retro staples they are able to make each song their own. Further compounding this uniqueness is their incorporation of a ukulele that almost seems out of place until you hear it being played.
The three Vittachis, hence the name, have music coursing through their veins. Lenny, the father and senior partner, has an enviable music pedigree having been a member of top folk rock group Flame, then forming the much sought after Elixir before keeping it in the family with V3. Son Joshua is a multi-instrument playing prodigy. Daughter Shaenali has the voice of an angel with an inclination towards jazz and like her brother is a multi-instrumentalist playing the piano, guitar and ukulele.
This family of musicians play almost any genre of music and accommodate any request as testified by their impressive list of events at diplomatic functions, corporate events, weddings, and private soirees. These days V3 can be found playing at The Station on Saturdays from 7pm and Lenny plays solo at the venue on Wednesdays from 7pm

Giving back to music
When it comes to local talent in Sri Lanka, the talent is huge. We have singers who can perform Western genres and at the same time perform our own Sri Lanka genres like Baila. Then there are singers like Victor Rathnayake and Nanda Malini who are a purely Sri Lankan class of their own. It is this niche that Vijith De Silva falls into.
De Silva has been in the industry for the past 25 years and has planned a concert that will feature the very best of his songs. Melodies speaks to De Silva who is doing this for his fans.
Alongside De Silva, there are a number of talented artistes performing, some of whose names are instantly recognizable. They will give the concert the added boost that is needed.
It has been 25 years since I put out the cassette Adara Lokaya. I entered the field in 1992. At this concert I will be doing 22 songs. The artistes who will be playing alongside me are Rohana Bogoda, Jagath Wickramasinghe, Rohan De Silva, Somasiri Madagedara, Champa Kalhari, Dammika Walpola, Charitha Priyadarshani Peiris and Sudath Silva. This concert is free of charge and anyone can come, said De Silva
This will be a wonderful event for De Silvas fans and true lovers of music and will feature the best of a 25 year journey that has gathered a devoted fan base. My fans have always been a source of strength and courage to me.
De Silva began as a professional photographer. You could say it runs in the family because his father was a photographer as well. However it seems that this talent for photography was equally matched by a talent in music. As a wedding photographer he used to sing songs at weddings. And De Silva decided to make music his vocation. And in doing so cemented his place in the annals of Sri Lankan music. From his younger days he had this ability to make music and doing concerts was inevitable. 1990 I started singing four of my own songs which led to a career in music. In this chosen field of mine I met so many influential people who helped me along my journey. I am doing this for my fans as well as the industry. But I am also doing this concert as a mark of appreciation for all those who touched my life and helped me become the musician that I am now. They have been amazing. I believe in the power of friendship and brotherhood, said De Silva. De Silva says that Music is a universal language and people naturally become interested in it and fall in love with it. Sri Lanka has a rich musical culture because of greats like Master Amaradeva and Sanath Nandasiri. This was extremely soothing and pleasing to the mind of De Silva. The culture had a lasting effect on the young De Silva.
Their songs have had an influence on me. My concert is a way of giving back to all of society, for all these positive influences that have shaped my career right throughout, pointed out De Silva.
De Silva feels fortunate to be in this profession because it is equally rewarding to his fans and to him. The joy that they receive is the joy that De Silva receives. De Silva insists that his journey in music is not phenomenal or fantastic. He maintains he is still continuing in humility. In his career he has formed many warm relationships. A man who has no great expectations he has correctly comprehended the transient nature of life.
Life is unpredictable and uncertain. When I look at the world I have seen the way misfortune and fate have brought people down. People have been ruined in this world. We have to live life to the best and live in a stable way but we cannot tell what the future holds for us. That is the nature of life. You need a solid foundation, said De Silva.
His message to anyone is very simple and that is not to be proud but be humble.
The concert will be held at Ape Gama Battaramulla at 6.30pm on August 26.

Govt to pump Rs 3.5 bn for Industrial Park in Kalutara
The Government will invest Rs. 3.5 billion to provide infrastructure to set up the Industrial Park in Millaniya, Kalutara, said, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe. This would be then offered to Rojana Industrial Park Public Limited of Thailand.
This Park to be built on a rubber estate belonging to the Horana Plantations would be ready by 2018 December covering an area of 150 acres. We are in the process of acquiring land for the project and also talking with CEB, Water Board and the Road Developed Authority to get water and electricity to the venue. Normally it takes about five years to get all the approvals and build the infrastructure which we hope to do in one year, he said.
Under the phase one we expect an investment in the excess of US$ 500 million. The existing parks are almost full and Sri Lanka has not had any new industrial parks developed after the early 2000s. To bring in investors we need parks of this nature, Senasinghe said.
It has also been proposed to create a special exit at Palpola in the Southern Highway between Bandaragama (Galanigama ) and Kalutara (Dodangoda) to provide easier access to the zone.
Meanwhile Rojana, a joint venture between Japans Nippon Steel and Thailands Vinichbutr Group, signed a letter of intent to set up an Industrial Park in Millaniya, Kalutara yesterday at the BOI auditorium.
Chai Vinichbutr, Vice President, Rojana Industrial Park Public Limited a big operator of industrial parks in Thailand, told Daily News Business that the investment climate in Sri Lanka was very good and this was the reason they decided to set up this venture in Sri Lanka. We were also attracted by Sri Lankas unique geographical location and also investor friendly legislature, he said
Vinichbutr said that they have over 500 companies in their industrial zones in Thailand for 30 years.
We have set up factories with them and we will talk with them to set up their operations in this Park. We aim to draw investors making electronic home appliances like television sets initially and later get auto parts manufacturers. We will also market some of these products locally. The minimum labour wage in Sri Lanka too is still workable for foreign investors, he remarked. Rojana are expanding their operations in Thailand and are currently developing two new Industrial Parks in the Eastern Seaboard of Chonburi Province.

Minister Senaratne made these observations at the inauguration of a new bus stand at Dompe, Kirindiwela recently.

Make your lip colour last
Pick the right formula. Swatch test a lipstick before buying. Apply it on your hand, let it dry. Dab an alcohol-based toner on the edge of the swatch. Rub it and see how much it fades. Follow the same with a lotion. This is how you know the formula will not betray you.
Don't apply lipstick on chapped lips. When you apply a matte lipstick on chapped lips, you start picking your lips, because they feel rough. Or you apply lip balm on top. All of these make lipstick peel and come off.
Prime your lips by using a hydrating, thick cream as base.
Use lip liner. Lip liner might have started out as a product with which one outlines their lips, but off late, it has become very popular for filling in lips. Extremely pigmented and hard, they are formulated to be a lot more matte than lipsticks and hence, stay on the lips longer. Therefore, a lip liner base, is crucial if you want your lipstick to stay put.
Layer. First, apply your lipstick. Then, pat the colour down with your fingers. Now, apply another layer of lipstick. After this, dab a tissue between your lips and dust some powder on the tissue. Follow this with one final coat of lipstick.
Eat right. Oil can remove any makeup, however stubborn or transfer-proof. So, eating carefully, and eating the right food, is important. If you are going for a dinner date, or an important meeting which involves food, be careful not to order something very oily. And take small bites.
Reapply. If all else fails, reapply your lip colour liberally without feeling self-conscious. The Times of India

State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim requested heads of state banks to take necessary arrangements to rescue the people from the clutches of informal money lenders who charge heavy and unconscionable interest rates and reach them with easier loan schemes for their benefit.
He made this request at a Ministry progress review meeting held at the Ministry auditorium on August 18.
The Minister who requested state bank heads to pay more attention towards the extension of facilities provided to small and medium scale entrepreneurs added that special attention towards fishery, animal husbandry and agricultural industries and promotion of export-oriented production was a national priority. He also requested state banks to have discussions and forward proposals for the development of small and medium scale enterprises and submit them for consideration in the preparation of the next budget.
The Minister who analysed data relating to the past and present operations of state banks observed that a large sum of money had been written off as bad debts by state banks during the previous regime. Observing that bad debts written off in recent times had reduced drastically, he said steps should be taken to bring this down further.

Muguruza routs would-be No. 1 Halep for Cincy title
CINCINNATI: Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza humbled second-ranked Simona Halep 6-1, 6-0 in Sunday's final of the WTA Cincinnati Open, denying the Romanian the world number one spot in the process.
Sixth-seeded Spaniard Muguruza needed only 56 minutes to capture her second title of the year and her first in a US event, taking the $522,450 top prize in the last major US Open tuneup.
The American swing was never going my way, Muguruza said. Finally, this year, I improved that.
It marked the third loss of the year for Halep when she was playing for the top ranking, also falling in the French Open final against Jelena Ostapenko and the Wimbledon quarterfinal against Johanna Konta, each time after taking the first set.
Maybe I feel the pressure and I don't realize it, Halep said. Maybe I just played bad.
Halep's coach, Darren Cahill, told ESPN the French Open loss still haunts her, saying: There's still a little leftover residue from Paris. It takes some time to get over that. Halep apologized to spectators after the embarrassing defeat, thanking them for support even if I played so bad and Muguruza played so well.
It was a big shame to lose 6-1, 6-0 in the final, Halep said. I got dominated. I can't control anymore the points. That's why I got down in my confidence.
Muguruza admitted after the lopsided win: I feel a little bit bad. But I want to be in her position. I wanted to win. What can I do Czech Karolina Pliskova, a semi-final loser to Muguruza, will remain world number one by a five-point margin over Halep. It's still there. I still have a chance, Halep said. Maybe one day I will be there.
Serena Williams had been number one before her pregnancy break began earlier this year. Muguruza, who jumps to third in Monday's rankings, becomes a favorite to capture a third career Grand Slam crown in Flushing Meadows after taking Wimbledon and last year's French Open.
I'm happy people see me as a favorite but it not always happens that you win a tournament and then go ahead and win a Grand Slam, Muguruza said. I'm happy to have the confidence. Beats not having it. Muguruza, 25, broke Halep, 23, for a 2-0 lead and Halep double faulted away another break in the sixth game before Muguruza held to claim the first set in 23 minutes, aided by 15 Halep unforced errors. She was hitting pretty strong and started dominating me from the first point, Halep said. After a few games I started to go down in confidence. I think she was just too good today.
In a 12-minute fourth game in set two, Halep netted a forehand and sent a backhand wide to squander her only break chances. Muguruza broke again in the fifth game and held serve to seize the crown.
I was looking to be aggressive from the first moment, Muguruza said.
I felt very comfortable. My level was very high. Especially in the second set I felt I could raise it a little bit more and close the match. Halep must now set aside the humiliation to focus on the US Open.
I know I have to forget it. I have a much bigger tournament coming up, Halep said. I don't want to go down too much. I don't want to analyze too much.
It was a bad moment on court but it's just today.  AFP

Nadal hails unbelievable climb back to No.1
Paris: Rafael Nadal described as unbelievable his climb back to the world number one spot for the first time in three years and confirmed in the latest ATP rankings released on Monday.
The Spaniard, who learned he was going to reclaim the ATP summit a week ago, last topped the mens charts in July 2014.
The 31-year-old Spaniard, who won his 15th Grand Slam title this year at Roland Garros, deposes Britains Andy Murray, who withdrew from the tournaments in Montreal and Cincinnati with a hip injury.
Nadal, who has spent 141 weeks in the top spot, has struggled with knee injuries since first becoming No. 1 in August 2008 after a Cincinnati semi-final run. He has admitted doubting he could ever regain the number one spot after so many years.
Being No. 1 after all the things that I have been going through the last couple of years is something unbelievable, the Spanish great told the ATP.
Nadal, knocked out in the Cincinnati quarter-finals last week by Australian Nick Kyrgios, had slipped to as low as 13th in the ATP rankings midway through 2015.
And his path back to the top one week before the closing Grand slam of the season at the US Open was hailed by Chris Kermode, ATP Executive Chairman and President.
To regain the No. 1 ranking nine years after having first reached it is unprecedented, he said.
Rafa has been setting records throughout his remarkable career and this one is as impressive as any. It shows incredible dedication and longevity, and we congratulate him on this amazing achievement.
Kyrgioss progress to Sundays Cincinnati final earned him a five-rung rise to 18th with the man who beat him, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, breaking into the top 10 in 9th.

Now, coach Nic Pothas complains of interference
DAMBULLA: Interim head coach Nic Pothas said that too many cooks are spoiling his efforts to revive the beleaguered Sri Lanka cricket team following another heavy defeat in the first one-day international against India at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium on Sunday.
Sri Lanka whitewashed 3-0 in the Test series by India was hoping for a change of fortunes in the five-match one-day international series that began at Dambulla but to the dismay of their fans whose patience has been tested almost to the limit they were thrashed soundly by nine wickets.
A few fans showed their displeasure by staging a protest and carrying slogans in front of the team bus at Dambulla after the match before the police managed to clear them away.
India chased down Sri Lankas total of 216 using up only 29 overs a performance that led Pothas to comment at the post-match press conference: It swings between hurt and embarrassment. Emotionally you get angry. You get frustrated. Am I angry with the players Absolutely not. The players work as hard as anyone can ask of them. Theyve been superb.
The support staff has been out of this world, brilliant. They work endless hours with planning and helping the boys. You cant fault anyone within that changing room. Yes, we didnt play our best cricket today. Thats pretty obvious. You do get angry. To say too many cooks is probably accurate.
Sri Lanka Cricket administrators have been accused of trying to interfere in selections and in other areas that led to the resignation of coach Graham Ford at the end of the Champions Trophy in June. Ford was replaced by Pothas who was then the teams fielding coach.
Pothas said that if he was in control he could give a deadline for the improvement of the team but it was not the case here.
If it was up to me and we had control over what we did, then we could probably give you a timeline. Its a question you probably need to ask a few other people as well. For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months. Youd see massive improvements, said Pothas.
These are seriously gifted players. They are very, very gifted players. You give them a little bit of time  you give them a little bit of love, a little bit of care, and build up that confidence, youll see results quick.
Pothas also pointed out that constant changes in the team was also affecting performances.
When you get consistency within a team of players, you will see improvements in performance. When were getting new players every game, it gets very difficult from a confidence point of view. From the players point of view its very difficult. Its difficult for us the coaching staff to create a strategy, said Pothas.
Injuries to players have also played its part in the team being changed constantly. If you look around the world at sports teams, and you look at the percentage of players that is acceptable to become injured, we are well within those limits, said Pothas.
Yes its frustrating when you see players get injured. Some of them are injuries that you cannot control. Asela Gunaratnes thumb you cannot control. And fast bowlers do get injured. They work hard. What they do is tough. But if you look at our percentage of injuries we have for the size of the group of players that we are trying to service, we are much better than the percentage.
Pothas accepted that to lose nine wickets for 77 runs after being 139-1 at one stage was unacceptable and added, Weve got to take that on the chin as staff, as players, and thats the reality of sport.
We probably didnt read the situation well enough. Yes, there were some execution issues as well. What we always try to drive home in the changing room is if you make the right decision but dont execute, were more than happy with that situation. Today we were a little bit more on the making the wrong decisions side unfortunately.

Pakistan to host World XI, Sri Lanka and West Indies
Lahore: Pakistan Monday announced the return of international cricket to its soil, with three separate sides scheduled to visit after years of isolation over security concerns.
A World XI tour kicks off in September followed by a short visit by Sri Lanka for a Twenty20 match in October, then a Twenty20 series against the West Indies a month later.
We are getting positive signals and the doors of international cricket are opening on Pakistan, Najam Sethi, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, told a press conference in Lahore.
The tours are seen as a big step towards Pakistan once again hosting major international outfits after militants targeted the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009, killing eight people and wounding at least seven players.
Since the attacks Pakistan has only hosted a limited-over series against Zimbabwe in 2015 while Bangladesh, the West Indies, Sri Lanka and Ireland turned down offers over security fears.
Pakistan has also been forced to play their cricket in the UAE for the past eight years including two editions of the Pakistan Super League Twenty20 (PSL).
But security has dramatically improved across Pakistan in the last two years, signalling hopes for the slow revival of international sport in the country.
In March, Pakistan successfully hosted the PSL final in Lahore with English players Dawid Malan and Chris Jordan, West Indies Darren Sammy and Marlon Samuels and South Africas Morne van Wyk and Zimbabwes Sean Ervine competing.
The matchs success pushed the PCB to expedite efforts to convince more teams to play in Pakistan.
We will play a full series with Sri Lanka in the UAE after which Sri Lanka will come to Lahore for a Twenty20, so things are shaping up, said the PCB boss.
Sethi said he will announce the names of World XI players in the coming days, with the team being managed by former England coach Andy Flower. - AFP

Pettah floating market will be made most popular in Colombo: Musthapha
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said steps would be taken to make the Floating Market in Pettah the most popular tourist destinations in Colombo.
He was addressing a meeting of tourist industry entrepreneurs and Pettah Business Association members recently.
The minister said an open area was essential for tourists to buy Sri Lankan food items, handicrafts and to enjoy environment in the Colombo city.
I believe, the Colombo floating market can be upgraded to that level. I will take necessary action through my ministry to coordinate the process and make the dream come true.
The meeting was called to seek views of stakeholders to make the floating market a better place for tourists.
Sri Lanka has exceeded around 1.2 million tourist arrivals during the last seven months. Tourism is one of the highest foreign exchange earners. The Colombo city will be made the best and the most popular tourism destination in South Asia and for that a favourable environment for tourists should be established in Colombo, he said.
As a part of the plans, a food fiesta will be held on August 24 and 25 at the market.
The minister said more local food stalls, sanitary facilities would be established in the market.
He said several foreign investors were willing to invest in the project.

## Title: The promise of religious freedom in SL
## Supertitle:

The promise of religious freedom in SL
Religious freedom in Sri Lanka supposedly abounds. At least that is what the Constitution requires, declaring that, Every person is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and giving citizens the right to manifest their religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, or teaching, in public and in private. But, according to a new report released by the United States Department of State, and signed off by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the island nation could be doing better.
Every year, the United States releases an International Religious Freedom Report, charting the status of religious liberty in countries across the world. This is largely because of the enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act that the United States passed as law 19 years ago, legislation which placed the promotion of religious freedom as a central element of Americas foreign policy.
Legal Framework of Religious Freedom
This past years (2016) report on Sri Lanka, released last Tuesday, begins by laying out the legal framework governing the status of religion in the country. It notes that a 2003 Supreme Court ruling determined the state was constitutionally required to protect only Buddhism; other religions were not accorded the same fundamental right of state-provided protection. This falls in line with the Constitution, which gives Buddhism the foremost place among the countrys religions, committing the government to its protection.
According to the report, the National Christian Council and several Muslim groups have said they supported a secular constitution that did not privilege any one religion.
The report also references the eminence of religion in general in the country, which manifests itself, among other ways, in Sri Lankas educational system. Write the authors of the report: Religion is a compulsory subject in both public and private school curricula. Parents may elect for their children to study Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, or Christianity. Students are not allowed to opt out of religious instruction.
Finally, the legal framework aspect of the report explains, Matters related to family law, including divorce, child custody, and property inheritance, are adjudicated according to either the customary law of the applicable ethnic or religious group or the countrys civil law. In this section, the report alludes to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA), which activists from within and without Sri Lankas Muslim community have been petitioning to amend. And yet the report spends a mere two sentences on it, writing that while the government had appointed a committee to propose amendments to the MMDA, the committee had not yet released its findings.
Differential Treatment of Religions
In a meaningful commendation, this years report made note of Sri Lankas constitution, which does enshrine the right to religious freedom. And yet the report also took Sri Lanka to task for the ways majority and minority religions can often receive differential treatment.
A primary concern of the report is that, according to the Centre for Policy Alternatives, several religious extremist nationalist organizations allegedly regularly espouse hate speech and continue to enjoy impunity from arrest and investigation. The authors of the report wrote that these extremist groups have continued to promote the supremacy of the countrys ethnic Sinhalese Buddhist population and propagated views hostile to members of religious and ethnic minorities. Still, the report conceded, this is not occurring to the same extent permitted under the previous government.
Such a distinction seems crucial, given that a country can only ever be authentically measured against its own history. The report pays little mind to that, though, and doesnt adequately address some of the complexities that have led to such religious tensions in Sri Lanka. For example, there is not a single reference of the nearly thirty year civil war from which the country is still recovering.
The annual report also alleged a general leniency by the government when handling matters involving the religious majority. It detailed two main ways in which this is supposedly happening. First, it claimed that the government continued to permit the construction of Buddhist statues in non-Buddhist areas despite strong objections from members of the Hindu, Muslim, and Christian communities.
Civil society groups and politicians in the North and East stated that the construction of Buddhist shrines by Buddhist groups or the military in parts of the Northern and Eastern provinces became contentious symbols of perceived Buddhist Sinhalese religious and cultural imperialism. The North and East are predominantly Hindu and Muslim, and some Buddhist shrines were erected in areas with few, if any, Buddhist residents.
Second, the report critiqued the government for not yet prosecuting extremist monks involved in attacks against Muslims and Christians in 2014. Whether or not this is a systemic problem, the claim is an extension of one made by the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka (NCEASL): that on multiple instances police reportedly failed to respond to, or were reluctant to arrest or pursue, criminal cases against individuals instigating attacks on religious minority sites.
According to the report, legal experts who had experience representing minorities with discrimination claims noted that the prosecution of perpetrators was rare.
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, could not be reached for comment on the matter.
The report also went into detail cataloguing the state of religious freedom for the minority religions in Sri Lanka. According to the NCEASL, there were 85 documented cases of attacks on churches, intimidation and violence against pastors and their congregations, and obstruction of worship services during the year.
The NCEASL also claimed that newly established churches faced major difficulties in registering, and have alleged pressure and harassment by local government officials to suspend worship activities classified by the government as unauthorized gatherings.
For Muslims in Sri Lanka, the situation is often sub-par as well. There have been claims of majority religious figures defaming the Quran, as well as Muslim prayer rooms in universities and mosques being vandalized. The Muslim prayer room at the Jaffna University has been vandalized three times in the past year; the grand mosque in the Nikaweratiya area of Kurunegala District was attacked with gasoline bombs in November. In neither of these incidents did the police make any arrests.
Minority Rights Group International, an international non-governmental organization (NGO), reported 60 instances of hate speech, acts of discrimination, or attempts to desecrate or destroy Muslim religious buildings in the first half of the year. Religious extremists specifically have been caught using racial slurs when describing Muslims and other ethnic minorities at public rallies and in media statements.
However, extremists in the United States have made similar slurs toward the Muslim American community as a whole, and specific Muslim Americans. These include politicians and religious leaders. The President of the United States, who ostensibly wrote the introduction to this report, was the very person who, during his campaign, promised a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, a threat which violates the very core of what religious liberty means. And yet, in critiquing the treatment of Muslims and other religious minorities in Sri Lanka, the United States International Religious Freedom Report never concedes that America, too, is far from perfect in its treatment of religious minorities.
Notably, the report barely mentioned the status of religious freedom for the Hindu community in Sri Lanka, who make up 15 percent of the countrys population and a vast majority of the countrys Tamil community.
US Governments Efforts to Facilitate Religious Harmony
The report concluded by reiterating the U.S. governments position on religious freedom in Sri Lanka, that it is an imperative, and that even greater interfaith harmony should lead the path forward. It ended on a positive note, detailing the governments attempts, via its Embassy in Colombo and its Ambassador, Atul Keshap, to facilitate such harmony in the island.
The U.S. Ambassador urged political leaders to take action to defend religious minorities and to protect religious freedom for everyone. The Ambassador encouraged the government to make the national reconciliation process inclusive of religious minorities and to be protective of minority rights and sentiments. Embassy personnel also met with religious leaders to urge them to assume a leadership role in bridging the ethnic and religious divide in support of interfaith harmony, the report stated.
The Embassy continued to support programmes and host events designed to promote dialogue among religious and ethnic groups, and embassy officers met regularly with leaders and representatives from a broad range of religious groups to encourage them to play a leading role in reconciliation.

Romance in a new guise
M Safeer is back with a new production titled Swings of Love. The drama features Italian artiste Julia Filippo. She will be carrying all the action on her shoulders since she is the only character who will be on stage to relate all the incidents centering on the drama. However a production which is based on one character along is not new to Julia. She has acted in another solo Knots Rules to be Happily Unhappy
There are no other physical characters on stage. There are only swings which symbolizing the presence of other beings. It runs for around one hour. When you are alone on stage you feel the weight of the whole performance on your shoulders. It is a huge responsibility. However you also have the possibility to relate whatever you want to say and the time to establish a contact to take this message across, Julia explained on her role in Swings of Love.
This is my second visit to Sri Lanka. I was here two years ago for the Colombo International Theatre Festival. I presented the production Knots Rules to be Happily Unhappy there. It is about a woman on the streets. She fell in love with a man, got pregnant and was thrown out of the house by her family. It is about the life of a homeless person. It is a little bit more social than Swings of Love, she said.
Born in Rimini, Italy in 1984, Julia studied physical theater in France.; She graduated from the school Arsenale of Milan - Lecoq method (2005). She is an actress in many projects such as: Un bar sotto il mare Novelli Theater (2003), La Cantatrice Calva Arsenale Theater (2005), Sabbia  Nessuno ci guarda Franco Parenti Theater (2008), Dio Mercato Chorus Ringhiera Theater (2008), Imraa, Jin, Xaniman, Women Hidden Theater (2009) with the direction of Annet Henneman.
In 2008 Julia directed the opera La Bohme in Teatro dei Vigilanti. She joined the company Living Theater of New York in 2009 in the tour of Israel and Palestine and in 2010 in the tour in Belgium with many performances. From 2010 she collaborated with Teatro Era of Pontedera with the performances Abito, Iter and Lisboa that toured Japan, Brazil, Italy, Portugal and Denmark. She took part in the show The Clinic of Blinded of the director Pierangelo Pompa with the company Laboratorio di Altamira in 2013.
Swings of Love recreates the sensations born in a woman on natural wonders of love, coition and violence. Julia is training for one month with the team before heading back home. Speaking about the experience of acting in a Sinhala production Julia say, Swings of Love is scripted in a poetical manner. It is about the last woman on earth. It is like an ode to love, life and women in general. Taking part in this production is a different experience for me for two reasons. Firstly I have a playwright who is very much present with us. The script is our base and we follow that. The language is also different for me. It has a beautiful rhythm.
She stresses that collaborations are very important in artistic work.
I believe that our attempts to mix two cultures are brave. This is forming a communication between two diverse worlds. What we bring out is something short of a miracle, she noted with a smile adding that she has collaborated with Colombia, Denmark and France for productions.
Those countries are more near to my own. They are all related to Italy. Sri Lanka is an Asian country. It was truly beautiful to see how many differences we have in our daily life, Julia said adding that the language barrier was the main hurdle that the team had to overcome.
I had to translate Italian into English while the others had to translate Sinhala into English. English is not the mother tongue of any member in the team but the language that we use to form our connection, she said.
The premiere show of Swings of Love is planned to be held at the Pune IAPR international theatre festival in November. It will also be staged for three special public viewings at the Korean International Dio Performing Arts Festival in Seoul, followed by some invitation shows around the world. The script of Swings of Love is written by Manjula Wediwardena. It is translated into English by Dilini Eriyawala

Sidharth takes criticism from industry seriously
Bollywood actor Sidharth Malhotra believes in the power of constructive criticism, but says he takes criticism seriously when it comes from industry insiders. Within a short span since his debut with Student Of The Year, Sidharth has tasted a fair share of success and failure.
Asked whether he has learnt to handle criticism better after films like Kapoor And Sons and Baar Baar Dekho, Sidharth said, Well, I think film reviews dont really help an actor to grow or improve creativity because their words and comments are black and white... They are always inching towards negative or positive. And I understand that for them, they mostly concentrate on the business potential of a film.
He added, Only constructive criticism can help us to grow as creative people, as actors. Therefore, I take any constructive assessment seriously when it comes from insiders of the fraternity.
The actor said he tries to do new characters with every film, and then assesses if he has got it right or explores the flaws. These things matter for me to go to the next level. So, I take criticism seriously, depending on where it is coming from.

Sri Lankan Cricket coach Pothas seeks free hand to revive team

Sri Lanka cricket coach Nic Pothas says too many cooks are spoiling his efforts to revive the national team and has called for greater autonomy in the wake of yet another confidence-sapping loss against India on Sunday.
Sri Lanka were well beaten in the recently concluded three-Test series against India, losing the first two matches inside four days and the last one in three to be whitewashed 3-0.
If the home fans had hoped the change in format would bring a change in fortunes, they were left bitterly disappointed as India breezed to a nine-wicket win in the first One-day International in Dambulla, chasing down a 217-run target in under 29 overs.
You do get angry  to say too many cooks is probably accurate, Pothas told reporters after Sundays loss, voicing his concerns at the role played by Sri Lankas administrators and selectors in running the team.
You get frustrated. Am I angry with the players Absolutely not. The players work as hard as anyone can ask of them. Theyve been superb. Support staff have been out of this world. Brilliant, Pothas said. They work endless hours with planning and helping the boys. You cant fault anyone within that changing room.
Sri Lanka were thrashed in both Tests and one-dayers in South Africa, lost a home Test against Bangladesh and then failed to progress beyond the group stage at this years Champions Trophy.
It was followed by their first-ever ODI series loss to Zimbabwe in July, which prompted a frustrated Angelo Mathews to relinquish the captaincy of both the Test and one-day sides.
If it was up to me and we had control over what we did, then we could probably give you a timeline [for improvement], said Pothas, who was named coach in June following the resignation of Graham Ford.
Its a question you probably need to ask a few other people as well. For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over a period of six months. Youd see massive improvements.
These are seriously gifted players. You give them a little bit of time  you give them a little bit of love, a little bit of care, and build up that confidence, youll see results quick.
Pothas also asked the selectors to back a set of players and stick with them to give them confidence.
When you get consistency within a team of players, you will see improvements in performance, Pothas said. When were getting new players every game, it gets very difficult from a confidence point of view.
From the players point of view its very difficult. Its difficult for us - the coaching staff  to create a strategy.
The Sanath Jayasuriya-led selection committee has fielded 40 players in ODIs since taking over in May last year. There have been reports of a power struggle emerging after 1996 World Cup hero Asanka Gurusinha was appointed manager.
The result of the current series apart, Sri Lanka need to win at least two of the five games to gain a direct entry into the 2019 World Cup in England.

Sunshine Healthcare calls for private-public collaboration in pharma industry
Newly-elected President of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry (SLCPI) and Managing Director of Sunshine Healthcare Lanka (Pvt) Ltd Shyam Sathasivam urged the Government to consult and collaborate with all key stakeholders to address the major prevailing issues in the local pharmaceutical industry  particularly with regard to the formulation of a viable pricing mechanism for imported medicines.
Founded in 1961, SLCPI represents over 70 members who account for over 90% of the private pharmaceutical industry across the value chain from manufacturers, importers, distributors and retailers, providing the Sri Lankan patients with a range of over 800 pharmaceutical molecules from 364 manufacturers from across the world. The industry value chain has over 60,000 direct employees and over 240,000 indirect employees. The Chambers membership comprises major corporates in the local industry and is an affiliate of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce
Elaborating on his vision for the industry, Sathasivam called for greater relationship and rapport building between SLCPI membership and the Ministry of Health and National Medical Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and engaging with them on pricing and other matters. Resolving member issues on regulatory matters needs to be systematic and steps towards that will also be a priority, he said.
Establishing a protocol and norms for stakeholder management is critical for our business said Sathasivam. Defending our position with facts and white papers is definitely the way forward and must be done consistently,.
Outlining his vision for his tenure as president, Sathasivam said that skills building and setting standards for the medical representative teams is also a strong necessity. The image of our front-line team needs to step up. For this to happen, the industry must invest significantly in training and developmen.
Sathasivam spoke of engaging the services of institutions such as Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) in upping the level of professionalism among front-line medical teams.
At the end of the day, stakeholders must realize the true value of the pharma industry and not portray us negatively, he said, showing statistics on the impact on private pharmaceutical market due to major foreign exchange losses and price reduction, We kindly request the government to allow the industry to adjust pricing to the current exchange rate so that we could ensure a sustainable supply of quality medications while keeping in mind the end consumer.
The price control gazette in October 2016 enacted with overnight caused severe disruptions and losses along the supply chain of more than Rs 1 billion to manufacturers and importers. This led to significant increase in defaults of pharmaceutical retailers and closure or slowing down of SME pharma retailers and distributors. We humbly request that such directives should be applied only after providing the industry with sufficient time to respond by depleting current inventory and taking necessary administrative measures, he said.
Over the last nine months, we have slowly begun to recover the losses but enormous increases on all regulatory fees across the board had further impacted the entire pharma value chain including small retailers. These factors have the potential for negative socioeconomic repercussions at a national level; hence we request that the Government enter into consultation and collaboration with all key stakeholders in order to arrive at a fair and feasible pricing formula.
Sharing his thoughts on an outline for mitigating regulatory challenges, Sathasivam stated: Implementation of NMRA regulations and commitments has been a significant challenge over recent years. We look forward to working closely with NMRA on resolving import license and re-registration issues, getting clarity on all requirements for new registrations so that the approval time is definite and short.
He also spoke of the absolute need for improved relationship with the Regulator and the Line Ministry through the establishment of skills building initiatives and workshops to improve the engagement levels.

Supreme Court suspends 'triple talaq' divorce law

India's Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked the use of a Muslim divorce law until the government frames new legislation, a partial victory for Muslim women who had long argued that the rule violated their right to equality.
Three out of the five judges on the constitution bench ruled against the "triple talaq" law, whichallowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word "talaq" three times.
The judges said the law violated Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, which is related to equality, and protection of life and personal liberty respectively.
"This is a sensitive case where sentiments are involved. We are directing the Union of India to consider appropriate legislation in this regard," Justice J.S. Khehar said while announcing a six-month suspension on the practice of the divorce law.
"It's a very happy day for us. It's a historic day," said Zakia Soman the co-founder of the Indian Muslim Women's Movement, which was part of the legal battle to end triple talaq.
"We, the Muslim women, are entitled to justice from the courts as well as the legislature," she added.
Muslim women say they have been left destitute by husbands divorcing them through "triple talaq", including by Skype and WhatsApp.
Karuna Nundy, a human rights activist, told Al Jazeera that the Supreme Court's ruling is very significant.
"The judgement is progressive because it recognises that this talaq practice is extrmely oppressive to women and not essential to religious law," she said.
Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andola, a Muslim organisation, launched a campaign two years ago to ban triple talaq.
Triple talaq was already ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in a number of cases, including in February 2015.
A recent survey released by the BMMA found that 92 percent of the 4,710 Muslim women surveyed wanted a total ban on verbal or unilateral divorce.
Muslims in India, who make up the largest religious minority in the country, are governed by the Muslim Personal Law.
The legislation is not codified, which means it is open to interpretation by local clergy.
As a result, BMMA noted that Muslim women are "excluded educationally, economically and socially owing to government neglect and suffer from near absence of any legal framework in matters of family and marriage".
India's Muslim Law Board had told the court that while they considered the practice wrong they opposed any court intervention and asked that the matter be left to the community to tackle.
But several progressive Muslim activists have decried the law board's position.
"This is the demand of ordinary Muslim women for over 70 years and it's time for this country to hear their voices," activist Feroze Mithiborwala told New Delhi television station.
The current government supports an end to the practice and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said in many public addresses that the practice oppresses Muslim women and needs to be ended.

Symbol of civilisation
Going through the opinion of C V Vivekanathan attorney-at-law on Daily News of August 14, while seeking to point out a couple of factual errors, I am totally in agreement and support of Vivekanathan's question to the authorities: why then speaking of one country and one people without translating it into action
Vivekanathan has started his opinion by saying: The Lion Flag that was flying over the Kandyan Provinces for many years was hauled down with signing of the Kandyan Convention."
This statement gives the understanding that the Lion Flag is the Flag of Kandyan Provinces. But the fact is that Lion Flag is the flag of the country from time immemorial. Late Ven. Hisselle Dharmarama Thera giving evidence at The National Flag Committee in 1950 has stated that all kings who ruled from 3000 BC to 1815 (Sinhalese, Cholans, Dravidians, Kalingas, Gangas, Rajaputs, Giris, Wannis, Nayakkars) used the Lion Flag as the Royal Flag. It means the Lion Flag is the flag of the entire country, Sinhale, and not the flag of the Kandyan Provinces only.
E W Perera who brought the Lion Flag taken away by the British and kept in the Chelsea Hospital in England. His book Sinhalese Banners and Standards adds that King Devanampiyatissa went to the harbour with Lion's Flag in front to receive the Bo sapling brought by Ven Sangamitta Theri. Further, he says, it was also the flag of the country when King Parakramabahu VI was ruling the country from Kotte.
Original flag
Vivekanathan is quite right when he says that the four Bo leaves found in the present national flag were not in the original one. It is factually incorrect to say that the four Bo leaves were inserted in the 1978 Constitution by President J R Jayewardene. In fact, this change to Bo leaves took place in 1972. Those instrumental in that exercise were Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike and Cultural Affairs Director Nissanka Wijerathna.
Coming back to the Lion Flag, and subscribing to Vivekanathan's contention as to why talking about one country and one people without translating it into action. It is not the major, yet in fact the greatest single problem faced by the people of this country today. As Senator Nadesan said in his dissent in the report of The National Flag Committee, 'the ideal of national unity which I consider most important in the conception of a National Flag.'
In my view, this design is adopted, far from being a symbol of national unity will be a symbol of our disunity.
Today after more than six decades, it is the same thing that is happening, nay, actually done and practised. Talking about unity but working towards disunity. Talking and discoursing about unity and amity but working towards more and more disunity and enmity.
This whole process started with either modifying or corrupting the flag of the country by the people who were entrusted with ruling the country for the British. The intention of the British, when this country was given so-called independence, was to ensure continued exploitation of this country by the brown Sahibs, tamed and trained for the purpose, they were also given an instrument or an apparatus, called Parliament to guide them to do it.
Accordingly, they speak about the development of this country but in translating it into action they have no alternative but to help the international gang of exploiters calling themselves international community.
This could be safely and smoothly done only by undermining the sovereignty of the people of the country. In other words, by undermining, or removing of ownership of the country, the Sinhalese, the real owners of the country. It was the Sinhalese (Ceylonese) who handed over the country to the British in 1815. It is to the Sinhalese  (Ceylonese) the British gave back the country. In both these occasions, the ownership or the sovereignty of the country was symbolised by the lion flag, the Sinha flag of Sinhale.
The Cardinal imperial principal of exploitation of a country is divide and rule. In the process there cannot be one nation, it needs to be divided. That is how the brown Sahibs were trained. It is for this explicit reason that the Sinhale Sinha Flag, the flag of the country for millennia, was modified or changed. The real purpose was to create divisions among the people, and also disunity and enmity among the people.
Senator S Nadesan has very well explained this situation in his dissent to the National Flag Committee. It should also be remembered that there was a consensus in the committee about keeping the flag as it is.
As Vivekanathan has quoted, J R Jayewardene and Don Stephen Senanayake have talked much about keeping the lion flag, but in the final deliberations, they had to abide by imperial teachings and practices.
This change made in the Sinhale Sinha Kodiya, or the Lion Flag of Sinhale is, therefore, the root cause of all the problems that this country is facing today, ranging from terrorist war to Bond scam through frauds and corruptions of parliamentarians and their henchmen.
Changing, making alterations, or disfiguring the Sinhale Sinha Flag, the hereditary flag of the country could, therefore, be considered as the worst ever crime committed against the Sinhalese, the nation of the country.
The Sinhale Sinha Kodiya or the lion flag of the Sinhalese flag is, in fact, a civilization flag. As such nobody on this earth could interfere with it and makes any changes.
What the so-called national flag committee has done is an unpardonable fraudulent crime. Joining or adding two stripes to the Lion Flag actually amounts to adding two clauses fraudulently to the title deed.
Therefore as Vivekanathan requested this error has to be corrected in the new constitution if the intention of which is to have unity and amity in the nation.

Terrorists tried to blow up plane bound for Abu Dhabi with bomb inside Barbie doll

This Barbie was a real bombshell.
Lebanese officials said they helped foil a plot to bring down a passenger plane that terrorists were planning to blow up with explosives hidden inside a meat grinder and a large Barbie doll.
The target, authorities said, was an Emirati passenger plane that was supposed to take off earlier this month from Sydney en route to the United Arab Emirates capital, Abu Dhabi.
Lebanons interior minister Nohad Machnouk told reporters that the bombs never made it on the plane because the handbag they were placed in was 15.4 pounds above the weight permitted by the airline.
Machnouk said the bombs were sent back to the would-be attackers home in Australia.
He said the attacker tried to bring two explosives on the plane in case one of them did not work. The second would be detonated by one of four Lebanese-Australian brothers who was supposed to be the suicide attacker.
One of the brothers is in custody, Machnouk said. It was not immediately clear how authorities uncovered the plot.

Rasathurai Thiruvarul, 40, of Jaffna, Mathiyarasan Sulaksan, 30, from Karanavai, and Ganeshan Tharsan, 26, of Nawalappiddy are the Tamil political prisoners who had gone into fasting.
The case against them had been conducted with only their confessions as evidence. One of the cases filed with the confessions of the above TPPs were rejected by the Magistrate who heard the case.
In this context, this case also might meet the decision of the other case as hearing had been nearly completed.
If this case is transferred to other Courts, hearing will start from the beginning again, the TPPs say.
It is like revenging by not punishing but letting to rot in detention, they say.

With time Sri Lanka will become good - Dhawan
DAMBULLA: Contrary to the barrage of criticism the current Sri Lanka cricket team is undergoing for their series of losses in recent months they have found an ally in Indias destructive opener Shikhar Dhawan whos 11th ODI century powered his team to a thumping nine-wicket in the first one-dayer played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium on Sunday.
Dhawan in his assessment of the Lankan bowling said, See of course this is a young side and they are in transition period where all the boys will mature. In international cricket you need to have that experience. The young boys are good but with time they will get better thats what I feel.
Speaking further Dhawan who slammed 20 fours and three sixes in his 90-ball knock of 132 not out said, I wouldnt say it is the worst bowling that Ive faced. I dont use those harsh words. The left- arm bowler bowls decent pace and even the other fast bowler they have a good fast bowling attack, even in Champions Trophy, they beat us. Its just that we have got a mature and very experienced side so that plays a huge role because how you handle pressure in situations matters a lot with experience. So I feel that with time the Sri Lankan team will do good.
However Dhawan admitted that fast bowler Lasith Malinga was on a downward curve.
He has been legend for Sri Lanka cricket and he has done great in international cricket in all formats.
He is a bit old now and with time I feel that his pace has gone down a bit thats why we can attack more as batsmen, said Dhawan.
This is natural because he has played so much cricket. Its just a cycle, life cycle, thats what I feel.
Dhawan said that he was playing in the same flow as he did in the Champions Trophy in England in June where he finished as the top run-getter with 338 runs (avg. 67.60).
I would say that the way I played in my debut match in Test cricket and the Galle match, I played quite similarly. I am trying to keep repeating the same mantra for myself, said Dhawan.
I really didnt think about the pitch. I was just watching the ball and playing it. I felt that the pitch was very good, the way Sri Lanka started the innings, and I thought they will score 300 runs but they unfortunately lost a lot of wickets in the middle and we dominated the game.
Dhawan said that maintaining the same levels of fitness was important for fielding because it plays a major part in all three formats.
Fitness was always there its just that it is now more in front. It is very important that everyone should be at the same level of fitness. One loose fielding can change the momentum and in todays cricket you have to be fit, its not like 10 years back, said Dhawan.
Then things were different, now it is very high paced cricket and you have to be fit. Its a very fair thing. If you are not fit then the team has to take that load and its not fair on the team. Its not just in Indian cricket, its every cricket team like Australia, England, etc. they all have fitness parameters so its good that we are doing it and becoming more professional.

Trump vows 'fight to win' in Afghanistan

President Donald Trump has said a hasty US withdrawal from Afghanistan would leave a vacuum for terrorists to fill.
He said his original instinct was to pull US forces out, but had instead decided to stay and "fight to win" - avoiding the mistakes made in Iraq.
He said he wanted to shift from a time-based approach in Afghanistan to one based on conditions on the ground and said he would not set out deadlines.
However, the US president warned it was not a "blank cheque".
"America will work with the Afghan government, so long as we see commitment and progress," he said.
Trump also warned Pakistan that the US would no longer tolerate the country offering "safe havens" to extremists, saying the country had "much to lose" if it did not side with the Americans.
"We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars - at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting," he said.
He also said the US would seek a stronger partnership with India.
Meanwhile, Trump made it clear he expects his existing allies to support him in his new strategy, telling them he wanted them to raise their countries' contributions "in line with our own".
US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis indicated in a statement "several" US allies had already "committed to increasing their troop numbers".
But Trump refused to be drawn on how many extra US troops, if any, would be deployed. He had been expected to say another 4,000 would be sent to Afghanistan, the number General John Nicholson, the top US military commander in the country, requested.
Criticising previous administrations, he said: "We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans."
However, Trump said there would be an escalation in the battle against groups like al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State.
"[They] need to know they have nowhere to hide - that no place is beyond the reach of American arms," he said.
But he also indicated there could one day be a peace deal with the Taliban.
"Some day, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political sentiment that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan," he said.
"But nobody knows if or when that will ever happen."
US combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but special forces have continued to provide support to Afghan troops.
Current US troop numbers in Afghanistan are about 8,400.
The Afghan government continues to battle insurgency groups and controls just half of the country.
Trump has previously supported pulling troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks.
"I took over a mess, and we're going to make it a lot less messy," Trump said when asked about Afghanistan earlier this month.
"We're not winning," he told advisers in a meeting in July.
His defence secretary has argued a US military presence is necessary to fight off threats from Islamist militants.
Defence Secretary Jim Mattis visited Afghanistan over the weekend, saying he was satisfied with the administration's new strategy.
Former White House strategic adviser Steve Bannon had called for the withdrawal of all US forces, arguing the war was unwinnable.
But he was fired by the president on Friday.

Tweak it right!
Tweaking your eyebrows the right way can make you look younger. Extra filling in your eyebrows can bring a huge transformation to your look.
Uneven brows: Create symmetry to find three main points -the start, the arch and the end of the eye brow. Use a micro-pencil liner to fill in the details between the middle of the brow and where they start to curve.
Patchy brows: For those with brows that have thick hair in some spots and less in some places, use a brow tint that matches your hair tone. This will help frame the eyes and slim the sides of the face.
Untouched brows: Never ever plucked, waxed, tamed or preened the brow Then you need to first trim the hairs that go past the hairline. To make it fuller and give it structure, use a pencil.

UNP request President to remove Minister Rajapakshe from office

The United National Party (UNP) Working Committee today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to adopt suitable measures to remove Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeydasa Rajapakshe from all Cabinet Ministerial posts.
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim told Daily News Online that the Working Committee made the decision following Minister Wijeydasa Rajapakshes non compliance to rectify the statement made by him against Cabinet decisions and party decisions, on or before August 21.
Minister Wijeyadasa was said to have agreed on August 17 to make a statement before the UNP Working Committee on or before August 21 rectifying the comments made by him violating collective responsibilities of the Cabinet of Ministers.
But the UNP Working Committee alleged Minister Wijeyadasa had continued to condemn Ministers and government policies even after the confrontation with the Minister.
With these turn of events the UNP Working Committee has informed President Sirisena of Minister Rajapakshes non-compliance to the agreement, and requested him to remove the Justice and Buddhasasana Minister from office, Minister Kabir Hashim said.

US destroyer, tanker collision : 10 sailors missing
SINGAPORE: Ten US sailors were missing and five injured Monday after their destroyer collided with a tanker east of Singapore, in the second accident involving an American warship in two months.
The guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with the merchant vessel Alnic MC near the Straits of Malacca in the early hours, the US Navy said.
Initial reports indicate John S. McCain sustained damage to her port side aft, it said in a statement as the ship headed to port in Singapore.
There are currently 10 sailors missing and five injured... Search and rescue efforts are underway in coordination with local authorities. Four of the injured sailors were evacuated from the warship to a Singapore hospital by helicopter with non life-threatening injuries while the fifth did not require further medical attention, the navy said.
The destroyer was sailing under its own power after the collision with the Liberian-flagged tanker at 5:24 am (2124 GMT Sunday). The ship had been heading for a routine stop in Singapore.
The vessel is named after US Senator John McCains father and grandfather, who were both admirals in the US navy.
McCain said in a tweet that he and his wife are keeping Americas sailors aboard the USS John S McCain in our prayers tonight -- appreciate the work of search & rescue crews. President Donald Trump initially said thats too bad in response to reporters shouted questions about the collision, as he arrived back at the White House after a holiday.
He followed up with a Tweet: Thoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway. It was the second recent collision involving a US warship after seven sailors died in June when the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged cargo ship in a busy channel in Japan.
After the latest incident Monday, a major search and rescue operation was launched.
Singapore sent three tugboats, and four navy and police coastguard vessels while Malaysia -- whose southern Johor state was close to the collision -- deployed eight ships and said it was going to send aircraft to help in the search.
A US helicopter was taking part in the search and two other American aircraft were expected to arrive soon, the navy said.
The ship involved in the accident is a Liberian-flagged tanker used for transporting oil and chemicals and weighing over 30,000 tonnes, according to industry website Marine Traffic.
The tanker sustained some damage but no crew were injured, Singapores Maritime and Port Authority said. There were no reports of oil pollution and maritime traffic in Singapore waters was unaffected, it said.
In the June accident, the collision happened in a busy channel not far from Yokosuka, a gateway to container ports in the Japanese capital Tokyo and nearby Yokohama.
The dead sailors, aged 19 to 37, were found by divers in flooded sleeping berths a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald. A senior admiral announced last week that the commander of the destroyer and several other officers were relieved of their duties aboard their ship over the incident.
Both the USS John S. McCain and USS Fitzgerald are part of the US Seventh Fleet, based in Yokosuka.- AFP

Variegated waters
The exhibition showcased the artists intellect, imagination, experiments, professional experience and consciousness, who indulge in creative work for their own independent and honest goals solely and collectively. That is not an unconscious copying by pouring some matter into a block. It is a broad, complicated and sensitive process. And it is not an artificial and impatient or a strained product.
The artists believe that the art is a social process of digesting of touching existing, social and cultural mechanisms in a most authentic way by a community with a broad appreciation.
Beyond the Water Margin is a creative effort of four watercolour artists who were united for the necessity of a collective creative approach, professionalism and self-satisfaction for the broadness of mutual understanding, the maturity of attitudes, collectiveness and the unity of diversity. It stands as a visual communication of satisfied self-expression as well.
Leaning in close to the paintings, the connoisseurs attempt to understand the hidden meanings. On another corner, the youngsters would capture these works of art on their smartphones. In the meanwhile, another crowd wants the artists to pose for a selfie.
There is more to a painting than gathering a collection for an exhibition. Beyond the Water Margin held at the Lionel Wendt for the past few days constituted four watercolour virtuosos with different themes and styles albeit roaming one path. The four artists include Gunasiri Kolambage, Basil Cooray, Sanjeewee Seneviratne and Nilusha Weerakkody.
Gunasiri Kolamge, the eldest of them all, needs no introduction since he has been in the industry for a lengthy period. He executed various experiments during the initial stages of watercolour in Sri Lanka. Educated at the then Government College of Arts, Kolambage naturally chose water colour as his perennial medium. He toys with this medium to combine European and Indian traditions. Kolambage represents the generation that follows the influential figures such as Stanley Abeysinghe, H B Perera, G S Fernando and Susil Premaratne, the fraternity of Sri Lankan watercolour tradition. With his experience at both home and abroad, Kolombage finally settled down with abstract paintings. Most of his paintings are woven around the disciplined lifestyle celebrated in Buddhist philosophy.
Unique style
Next to Kolambage is Basil Cooray who has earned repute for his professional accuracy in the visual medium. His could be considered a unique style with more emphasis on humanistic aspects like folk lifestyle. At the Lionel Wendt, he chose to paint several works on the similar theme. He banks on human figures and landscapes to drive his point home. Coorays three similar paintings (with slight differences), which symbolize the religious faith prevalent in the village lifestyle, are a classic example.
Sanjeewee and Nilusha represent the much younger generation. Sanjeewee has been inspired by the modern watercolour trends in the European and Asian regions. Keeping the urban society as his forte, Sanjeewee has bagged several awards at international contests. To an untrained eye, Sanjeewees paintings may not hold much water. But his paintings bear long-cultivated academic discipline as well as the fixed use of the watercolour medium. He uses tones generously to convey his expression. This enables the connoisseurs and enthusiasts understand the depth of his works.
The watercolour medium, according to Sanjeewee, is an ancient artistic tradition.
In Europe we come across Watercolour Artists Associations which are over 100 years old. These associations have annual activities such as contests and exhibitions to encourage watercolour as a medium, Seneviratne explained.
Apparently the Sri Lankan phenomenon is quite the opposite.
Nilusha Weerakkody makes an entry into watercolour as a fashion designer. His works carry a different perspective therefor. He finds immense inspiration in local cultures. In fact, Nilusha goes to a dramatic extent with reflective lighting to bring up the crux of the environmental, material and humane structure of the society. He notices the slightest things such as dew drops, glass surfaces, the visual motion of glazed metal, upside down reflections drawn on rained earth and lights of moving vehicles at night overlapping with street lights.
Different interpretations
We work on a similar platform, though our themes and styles are different. We see the light through one medium, watercolour. That medium harmonises our different interpretations, artist Sanjeewee Seneviratne said.
In Sri Lanka, this precious medium suffers according to Seneviratne.
We do not study watercolour in academies. The academies, of course, teach oil and acrylics. Thats why its difficult for a novice to come to the fore. Then you hardly see them engaged in watercolour art professionally.
This exhibition will be an opportunity for anyone to study watercolour medium utilized in different varieties.

What is trade facilitation and how can it benefit Sri Lanka
The World Trade Organisation (WTO), made their ultimate achievement at the 9th WTO Conference conducted in Bali, by finalizing the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in the year 2013 which came into effect in February 22, 2017 with 2/3 of the members ratifying the agreement.
It is paying more attention to customs procedures through effective cooperation between and other relevant authorities who become part and parcel of cross border activities. Further it caters to technical assistance and capacity building of Leased Developed Countries and Developing nations. Presently, 121 states have ratified the WTO agreement. In other words,these states have agreed to abide by conditions therein.
This Agreement contains three sections and section one covers 12 different articles namely: publication and availability of information, opportunity to comment and consultation before information entry into force, advance rulings, procedures for appeal or review, enhance impartiality non-discrimination and transparency, fees and charges, clearance of goods, border agency cooperation, formalities connected with importation, exportation and transit, freedom of transit and customs cooperation.
Section two of the Agreement covers, Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) provisions paving the path for preferential treatment for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Developing Countries. Section three containsprovision for formation of a permanent committee on trade facilitation at the WTO and membercountries establish national committees to facilitate domestic coordination and implementation of the agreement conditions.
What is trade facilitation
Many definitions of Trade Facilitation can be found in recently done studies.Trade Facilitation contains five essential features namely (as per study of ZAKI); simplification of trade procedures and documentation, harmonization of the trade practices and rules, transparent information and procedures of international flows, recourse to new technologies to promote international trade and more secured means of payment for international commerce. In another study done by Portugal Perez says, trade facilitation measures defined under two dimensions, tangible infrastructure such as roads, ports, highways, telecommunications etc. and intangible aspects such as transparency, customs management, the business environment.
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) outlines trade facilitation as simplification and rationalization of customs and other administrative procedures that hinder, delay or increase the cost of moving goods across international borders. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) articulates it as a transparent and predictable environment for cross-border trade transactions based on simple, standardized customs procedures and practices, documentation requirements, cargo and transit operations, and trade and transport arrangements.
In simple terms, it can be recognized as, making it simpler and efficient for traders to move their goods across borders. Doing Business Index compiled by World Bank is also taking Trading Across Borders as a significant evaluation criterion in ranking countries. Under this category, time to export with regard to documentation and border compliance, cost of exports in compliance with documentation and border procedures, importation time and cost related to border procedures and documentation are taken for detailed evaluation. This confirms the importance of cross border trading at every level.
Cost reductions and increasing revenues through trade facilitation
It is a known fact in the world, that the Trade Facilitation is reducing the cost of trade by considerable level in any economy. OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) has developed many indicators to this effect which help governments improve their border processors, decrease trade expenses and reach the best benefits through international trade. TFIs (Trade Facilitation Indicators) provide paths to governments to lineup and prioritize activities related to trade facilitation in a more targeted manner. Some of these indicators can be listed asinformation availability, involvement of the trade community, advance rulings, appeal procedures, fees and charges, formalities related to documents &automation, internal cooperation, external cooperation and governance impartiality. It is vital for any economy to monitor the progress of their trade facilitation processes.
It is significant to understand that countries decide to implement WTO TFA in two ways; full implementation, which means taking the commitment to implement all the conditions in the agreement including best practices and the other method is to implement only the mandatory conditions of the agreement. The benefits reaped by any economy is also varied depending on the level of implementation of the agreement. In other words, some conditions will have a greater impact in reducing the cost of trade. To be more specific full implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement will reduce the total costs of trade by 16.5% in low income countries and it will be 17.4% and 14.6% in lower middle income and upper middle-income countries respectively. In a situation where only mandatory provisions are implemented the total cost reduction will be around 12 to 13% only. (Source: WTO World Trade Report 2015)
Positive impact on exports
Further, TFA implementation will lead to increase of diversification of exported products in the range of 36% in LeastDeveloped Countries (LCD) and approx. 20% in other developing countries andincrease of export destinations by 59% in LDCs and 33% in other developed countries. Further, as per the World Trade Report 2015, implementation of the TFA could add up to 2.7 percent a year to world export growth amounting to 750 to 1000 billion USD, and more than half a percent a year to world GDP growth. (Source: WTO World Trade Report 2015)
Poor implementation leads to revenue losses
Inadequate border operations such as weak detection mechanisms and insufficient sanctions may lead to revenue losses. As a matter of fact, in Cambodia for example, only 25% of the goods are declared to customs showing greater loss of customs revenue.Due to complication of procedures it becomes monetarily rewarding to avoid customs.This may lead to various mal practices among the corrupt officials. All in all, studies have revealed that insufficient border procedures may lead to revenue losses equals to 5% of GDP.
Increase of government revenue
It is evident that implementation of TFA may lead to increase of government revenue in many ways. Namely, through the escalation of trade flows tax base and revenue collection may also increase. When the processes are simplified, the possibilities are high for traders to reduce informal activities and start paying duties, further, fraud detection in customs also will have a positive impact on revenues. The case study on Bulgaria confirmed that, improvement of customs legislations and practices, training customs officials, improving customs controls resulted an increase ofrevenue by 158%.In the same manner, Ethiopia experienced over 51% increase of revenues whereas Peru made positive changes in their system by introducing best practices and system automation to reap over 105% revenue.
TFA benefits for SMEs
It is a known fact that, SMEs represent 90% of the global enterprises and provide over 70% of the employment of the private sector and recognized as growth and innovation engine. In developing countries, SMEs are playing a vital role in bridging the development gap through poverty reduction, women empowerment and income distribution.
They are facing many difficulties and challenges in accessing international markets. It is an internationally accepted norm that policy level corrections are needed to ensure SMEs enter and continue to be in international trade. SMEs find it difficult to deal with regulatory processes associated with trading goods across borders. Recent studies have confirmed that reduction of complex border procedures will encourage SMEs to partake in more and more export/import activities.
With this background, WTO TFA gives a worthy policy outline for most of the countries including LDCs and Developing Nations, to address draw backs of SMEs. Many of the policies already in place in Asia Pacific and Europe, happens to be drafted with the existing importers and exporters in mind but not merely for SME community. Hence,SMEs contribution to the export revenue remains as low as 30%.
It is a known fact that in Sri Lanka, SMEs contribute more than 65% to the GDP of the country and increase of cross border efficiencies will bring many benefits for the SMEs such as their products getting diversified, reach many destinations faster than before. Even Multinational Corporations are making key decisions in relocating Global Value Chain investments, following transport costs and capacity and customs efficiencies.
Importance of National Trade Facilitation Committee
As per the WTO TFA, each member is expected to establish and maintaina national committee on trade facilitation in order to facilitate both domestic & international coordination and implementation of provisions of the Agreement. The role of this committee is much wider than documented, ensuring public and private sector dialoguethroughout the implementation process.
The National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC) is expected to follow a sequence of steps to comply with deliverables; define the mandate, identify a champion and ensure strong leadership, define the governance and legal structure, ensure the right balance between public and private stakeholders, establish clear terms of reference including the extent of the bodys independence, choose appropriate accommodation that reflects the bodys independence, establish a clear business or work plan of activities, ensure that the body is adequately and sustainably funded and monitor the progress of TFA implementation.
National trade facilitation efforts of Sri Lanka progressing
Sri Lankan government authorities have taken many positive steps towards implementing TFA conditions and requirements. A national need assessment was conducted in 2014 with the participation of government stakeholders inclusive of all the border agencies and private sector representatives. The governmentof Sri Lanka has been effectively engaged in communication with WTO on the said aspects. By 2015 April, a team of experts from World Bank Group was engaged with Sri Lankan counterparts on Sri Lankas self-assessments and categorization aspects.
On 31 May 2016 Sri Lankan government ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement where it came to effect in February 2017. In April 2016, Cabinet nod was given to establish the National Trade Facilitation Committeewhich is chaired by Director General of Sri Lanka Customs and Director General of Department of Commerce as the co-chair, the government sector and the private sector is well represented in this committee ensuring well bonded Public Private Partnership, in achieving the ultimate goal of implementing TFA in Sri Lanka. Taking the activities further, the World Bank Group, conducted another workshop for National Trade Facilitation Committee members, where category level tasks were assigned to border agencies on priority basis.
Additionally, Sri Lankan government requested, the support of World Bank Group for the development and implementation of web based Trade Information Portal, to develop the blueprint of the National Single Window operation, and to set up the Secretariat for National Trade Facilitation Committee under the leadership of Additional Director General Customs, and 2 consultants from the World Bank Group together with officers from Sri Lanka Customs and Department of Commerce. The World Bank Group in principal has agreed to extend said assistance to Sri Lanka. Above activities confirm the right path that Sri Lanka is taking to Implement TFA successfully.
