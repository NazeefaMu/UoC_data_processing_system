Big shakeout coming, markets stem losses as hedge fund sounds warning
After $4 trn losses last week, Australian shares fall 0.4% on Monday as US investor says markets have become complacent.
Financial markets are braced for more volatility this week amid predictions from the worlds biggest hedge fund that a big shakeout is coming.
The Australian stock market was the first to test the water on Monday morning and one point was down 0.7%.
But it rallied slightly in afternoon trade and bourses elsewhere in Asia Pacific also found calmer waters. South Koreas Kospi was up 0.9% while Hong Kong put on 0.8%. The Nikkei in Japan was closed for a holiday.
The FTSE100 is London is due to open up 1.25% according to futures trading, while the Dow Jones average on Wall Street is set to rise 0.7%.
Last week saw $4tn wiped off the value of shares around the world and the US market entered into an official correction after falling more than 10% from its record level in January.
Wall Street staged a late rally on Friday as the Dow Jones finished 330 points higher and the closely watched Vix index, or fear index, has dropped four points to 29 on Monday from 33 on Friday.
But Bob Prince, co-chief investment officer at the $160bn US hedge fund Bridgewater, told the Financial Times on Monday (paywall): There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we dont think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days.
Well probably have a much bigger shakeout coming.
David Bassanese, the chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said in a note on Sunday that despite the big falls last week, the selling could continue.
History suggests the depth of corrections  assuming the underlying bull market persists  dont usually get beyond 15%, so theres certainly some scope for market weakness before a bottom is reached, he said.
Investors would be jittery about US inflation figures on Wednesday, he said. The market was forecasting a fairly benign 1.7% annual prices growth, but anything above that was likely to result in more stock losses.
The fear of rising US bond yields and higher inflation thanks to higher wages is what sparked the current wave of selling on 2 February as investors digested the prospect of higher interest rates as a result.
Chris Weston at online trader IG said on Monday: A massive buildup in market leverage has been partially unwound in the blink of an eye and what started as systematic funds selling out of equity and futures positions, as implied volatility headed higher, has morphed into something far more broad-based incorporating many other market participants.
Craig James, CommSecs chief economist in Sydney, said the US rally on Friday gave cause for hope but traders were still likely to face continued volatility.
We may be a little bit softer at the start of trade on the back of the resources but overall I think its going to be a choppy session, he said. The volatility is still going to be with us for most of the week.

Election violence decreased
The number of victims of election violence has significantly decreased at this years Local Government election when compared to elections held in the past, the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) sources said.
According to the sources, a total of 243 victims were admitted to the NHSL and out of this number, some were directly admitted to the NHSL while others had been transferred to the NHSL from other hospitals located in various parts of the country.
In the previous years, around 300 victims of election violence sought medical treatment from the NHSL and daily around 300 were admitted to the NHSL. This year, only 243 cases were reported on election day, which is normal, the sources said.
An unusual incident reported to the NHSL is of a 34-years-old male from the Biyagama area who sought medical treatment from the NHSL after slashing his own throat as a result of an election bet. He had undergone an operation and is now out of danger, the sources added.

Fifty Shades Freed ties up tedious trilogy
Fifty Shades Freed" should mark the merciful end of the movie trilogy unleashed by E.L. James' novels, and there's plenty of artfully-lit airbrushed sex -- and unintended guffaws -- for those with a taste for midnight-movie-style chewy badness. Otherwise, the safe word should be "avoid."
Having finished the second chapter with a proposal, the third opens with a wedding, a whirlwind trip to exotic locales, and a reminder that marriage doesn't automatically mean the end of passion -- at least, for newlyweds with their own well-equipped, garishly decorated "playroom."
Pretty soon, however, the honeymoon's over, as the central couple tries to adjust to marital bliss. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) wants to maintain her career in publishing, but must deal with a wealthy husband, Christian (Jamie Dornan), who's overprotective, jealous and controlling. And while it might sound like a high-class problem, there's the business of managing all those ever-present servants, who insist on calling her "Mrs. Grey," mirroring the formal way they address her spouse.

He said the country was forging on the correct path of development under Yahapalana policies and the UNP would march forward from strength to strength under the able leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He also denied rumours about any division within the UNP and said the Party would march forward boldly after identifying and correcting its mistakes.

37,000 teachers from govt schools to get ICT training
As many as 37,000 teachers in Tamil Nadu will be offered a primer on using technology-aided tools in the classroom at a two-day workshop in districts across the state next month.
The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), which is currently overseeing the production of new textbooks for the revised syllabus next year, will conduct the workshop for Class IX and X teachers of all government and government-aided schools in Tamil Nadu, along with Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and information communications and technology (ICT) experts.
Nearly 220 ICT experts from within and outside the state will be brought in for the project.
Many students in these schools complain that even if there's a projector or smart board fitted in a classroom, teachers don't know how to put them to good use. The workshop will address this knowledge deficit by teaching them the basics of operating technology and familiarising them with digital tools which can be employed in the classroom.
"The idea is to make classrooms more digitised, in keeping with the curriculum change. For this, we will rope in ICT experts to train teachers of all subjects," said S Kanappan, director, TN wing of RMSA. The workshop, he said, will acquaint teachers with open source software, online study material and popular study apps.
"We are focusing now on concept mapping as part of the approach to the new syllabus. The tool which best suits a concept can be used by teachers in classrooms once we give them some grounding in digital platforms and technology," added Kanappan.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 15
Adopt the Blue Ocean  Strategy: it ultimately makes competition irrelevant

Today, let us recap what we have reviewed during the past few weeks. 
We know that turbulent times have hit worldwide economies. The competition for a share of the consumers wallet is becoming more severe. In Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgnes parlance, the Red Ocean is becoming more and bloodier. 
Companies can only further extend or stretch their markers in many product fields through the creative application of Blue Ocean strategies. 
What does Blue Ocean look like 
Any industry or market where multiple suppliers or products are competing is Red Ocean. Competition is high and there is blood in the water as a result of the ongoing war between competitors. Strategies in Red Ocean usually consist of lowering price or adding value to justify increasing price  both with the aim of increasing market share. After a while all the competitors start to look the same because all you can see is the churn. 
A good example of this is the bombardment of consumer product ads you see on television. They all offer the same thing. They throw around prices, payment plans, methods, promises that seem to get more and more ridiculous. The result being its hard to believe any of them and the reputation of the entire industry plummets. 
By contrast Blue Ocean is calm and peaceful. Nobody is there yet; the waters havent been disturbed. 
Sounds like a pretty good place to be, and it is. Of course, once Blue Ocean exists, others will be drawn to it and try to emulate. But there is no competing against first place in a new market. 
So, if Blue Ocean hasnt been discovered yet, how are we supposed to find it You dont find it. You create it. 
Start looking for non-customers 
This is the first level of upside-down thinking that Kim and Mauborgne ask of you. They maintain that in any category there are people who buy that product or service and then there are three types of non-customer: 
(1). Buys the product or service very rarely and resentfully. (2). Has purchased the product or service once and had a bad experience so will never buy it again, (3). Has never bought the product or service before and has little interest 
Now before you start thinking up all kinds of strategies to win over Non-Customer 1 and Non-Customer 2  forget about it! If you start with them youre already swimming in the Red Ocean, trying to outsmart what very smart competitors have already tried to achieve. 
The goal and success of Blue Ocean comes with attracting Non-Customer 3. This is largely due to the element of surprise. This type of customer never expected to like or want your product so when they do  they feel like they have discovered it themselves. They become immediate brand advocates. 
And what happens after you have attracted Non-Customer 3 and become a hit, is that types 2 and 1 will slowly move over as well, and finally you will even attract the customer of the old product or service. 
2. Dont aim to out-perform the competition 
This one can make marketers tear their hair out with anxiety when they first read it. After all the job of marketing is to analyze the competition, find the weaknesses and offer a superior product or service, isnt it 
That can certainly be the result of Blue Ocean Strategy but according to Kim and Mauborgne, it doesnt work as a starting place. The same goes for pricing. Dont set your price against the competition, set your price against substitutes and alternatives. 
There is a great quote on the Blue Ocean Strategy website: Stop benchmarking the competition. The more you benchmark your competitors, the more you tend to look like them. 
Traits 
In Blue Ocean Strategy, they describe the red ocean as where most companies compete, seeking customers from the same market as their competitors, Kim and Mauborgne suggest that companies break out of the red ocean of bloody competition by creating uncontested market space in the blue ocean that makes the competition irrelevant. Red Ocean Strategy focuses on existing customers, and has the following traits: 
Blue oceans are defined by untapped market space, demand creation, and the opportunity for highly profitable growth. In Blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. 
In increasing numbers of industries, supply exceeds demand. The business environment in which most strategy and management approaches of the twentieth century evolved is increasingly disappearing. As red oceans become increasingly bloody, management will need to be more concerned with blue oceans than the current cohort of managers is accustomed to. Much of the success attributed to some of the model companies in Built to last was the result of industry sector performance rather than the companies themselves. 
The approach to strategy in creating blue oceans was consistent across time regardless of industry. Every great strategy has focus, and a companys strategic profile, or value curve, should clearly show it. When a companys strategy is formed reactively as it tries to keep up with the competition, it loses its uniqueness. 
Challenging an industrys conventional wisdom about which buyer group to target can lead to the discovery of new Blue Ocean. Untapped value is often hidden in complementary products and services. The key is to define the total solution buyers seek when they choose a product or service. A simple way to do so is to think about what happens before, during, and after your product is used. 
The process of discovering and creating blue oceans is not about predicting or preempting industry trends. Nor is it a trial-and-error process of implementing wild new business ideas that happen to come across managers minds or intuition. Rather, managers are engaged in a structured process of reordering market realities in a fundamentally new way. 
A company should never outsource its eyes. There is no substitute for seeing for itself. Great artists dont paint from other peoples descriptions of even from photographs; they like to see the subject for themselves. The same is true for great strategists.
Reverse Course
To maximize the size of their blue oceans, companies need to take a reverse course. Instead of concentrating on customers, they need to look at noncustomers. And instead of focusing on customer differences, they need to build on powerful commonalities in what buyers value. 
The starting point is buyer utility. Does your offering unlock exceptional utility Is there a compelling reason for the mass of people to buy it Absent this, there is no blue ocean potential to begin with. The strategic price you set for your offering must not only attract buyers in large numbers, but also help you to retain them. Given the high potential for free riding, an offerings reputation must be earned on day one, because brand building increasingly relies heavily on word-of-mouth recommendations spreading rapidly through our networked society. 
Before plowing forward and investing in the new idea, the company must first overcome such fears by educating the fearful. 
Compared with red ocean strategy, blue ocean strategy represents a significant departure from the status quo. It hinges on a shift from convergence to divergence in value curves at lower costs. That raises the execution bar. Conventional wisdom asserts that the greater the change, the greater the resources and time you will need to bring about results. Instead, you need to flip conventional wisdom on its head using what we call tipping point leadership. 
As we all know, figures can be manipulated Even when the numbers are not manipulated, they can mislead. Salespeople on commission, for example, are seldom sensitive to the costs of the sales they produce. Tipping point leaders zoom in on the act of disproportionate influence: making people see and experience harsh reality firsthand People remember and respond most effectively to what they see and experience: Seeing is believing. 
To tip the knowledge hurdle, not only must you get your managers out of the office to see operational horror, but also you must get them to listen to their most disgruntled customers firsthand. Dont rely on market surveys. To what extent does your top team actively observe the market firsthand and meet with your most disgruntled customers to hear your concerns Simply put, there is no substitute for meeting and listening to dissatisfied customers directly. 
When you want to wake up your organization to the need for a strategic shift and a break from the status quo, do you make your case with numbers Or do you get your managers, employees, and superiors (and yourself) face-to-face with your worst operational problems Do you get your managers to meet the market and listen to disenchanted customers holler Or do you outsource your eyes and send out market research questionnaires 
Are you allocating resources based on old assumptions, or do you seek out and concentrate resources on hot spots What activities have the greatest performance impact but are resource starved What activities are resource oversupplied but have scant performance impact 
In the coming weeks, we are going to study few ideas from The Leadership Challenge written by Kouzes and Posner. The book is quoted as one of the most trusted source on becoming a better leader for the new generation of young leaders living and working in fast moving global environment.

The leading conglomerate recorded an increase in revenue by 18.4 percent from Rs. 30.5 billion to Rs. 36.2 billion for the nine-month time period.
The diversified groups profits-before-tax increased by 4.2 percent from Rs.1.4 billion to Rs. 1.5 billion in the third quarter, over the previous year, while revenue decreased by 6.8 per cent to Rs. 12.3 billion.
Earnings per share for the nine months increased by 5.5 per cent to Rs. 4.31 while it reduced by 6.6 per cent to Rs. 2 for the third quarter, year-on-year.

Maldives hotels segment performance has been improving with Heritance Aarah currently under construction, due to open by next winter.
In spite of strong performances by the flagship Heritance Kandalama, Heritance Tea Factory and Heritance Ayurveda Maha Gedara, Sri Lankan hotel segment performance faced challenges. The segments profits were boosted by the sale of M.P.S. Hotels (Pvt) Ltd during the period under review. In September 2017, Aitken Spence Hotel Holdings PLC, a Group company, divested its entire holding in its fully owned subsidiary M.P.S. Hotels (Pvt) Ltd that owned Hotel Hilltop in Kandy. The resultant gain on disposal of this investment is reflected under other operating income. The company is optimistic about the fourth quarter performance of the Sri Lankan hotel sector.
During the quarter under review, Aitken Spence signed the waste supply agreement with the Colombo Municipal Council and the power purchase agreement with the Ceylon Electricity Board for its waste-to-energy project in Muthurajawela. The company is pleased that the venture would help address two of the key challenges facing urban development in the country, by absorbing 700 tonnes of municipal waste per day and adding 10 megawatts of energy to the national grid. The company expects the project to begin operations in October 2019.
During the nine months under review the maritime and integrated logistics segments performed creditably, strengthened by a stronger performance by the shipping agency businesses, while the freight forwarding segments performance faced several challenges and did not perform up to expectations.

Alibaba to take US$ 486 million stake in China retail data firm
Chinas biggest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group Holding, will invest US$486 million for a stake in a domestic big-data firm focused on hotels and retail, as part of a push to deepen its offline presence.
The firm will buy a 38 per cent stake in Shiji Retail Information Technology Co via its subsidiary Alibaba Investment Ltd, Shijis listed parent said in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The deal is part of a new retail strategic cooperation, the parent company, Beijing Shiji Information Technology Co, said, referring to a shift by Alibaba and rivals to leverage big data to shake up Chinas huge but stalling retail market.
Alibaba has been strengthening its retail presence with more than US$10 billion of investments into bricks-and-mortar outlets amid rising competition in the space from rival Tencent Holdings.
Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the announcement by Beijing Shiji Information.
The latest deal comes after another Alibaba subsidiary, Taobao (China) Software Co, agreed to take a roughly 15 per cent stake in Beijing Shiji Information in 2014 for 2.81 billion yuan (US$446.3 million) to help bolster its online travel business.
Beijing Shiji Information said it provided software and data systems to hotel firms such as InterContinental Hotels, retailers such as Starbucks and entertainment companies.

Angry snowboarders hit out at dangerous Olympic final
Pyeongchang, Monday: Angry snowboarders said the dangerous womens slopestyle final at the Pyeongchang Olympics should have been cancelled after vicious winds caused a string of crashes on Monday.
Nearly all the athletes, including American winner Jamie Anderson, tumbled at some point at the frigid Phoenix Park, where strong winds forced Sundays qualifiers to be scrapped and also delayed the final for more than an hour on Monday.
It was the latest event at the Games to be disrupted by the swirling wind, with the prestigious mens downhill skiing moved to Thursday.
None of the snowboarders suffered major injury, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Ski Federation (FIS) faced questions as to why the final was not shelved.
The FIS admitted that conditions were challenging but defended the decision to go ahead with the event, saying the safety of the athletes was their top priority.
Enni Rukajarvi mastered the conditions better than most and took bronze behind defending champion Anderson and Laurie Blouin of Canada, but the Finn said her achievement had been overshadowed.
Most happy that no one got hurt really bad, she said.
Asked whether it had been the right decision to hold the event, she replied: It wasnt. It was better in the practice, but then it got really bad, so they should have cancelled it or moved it.
The 27-year-old added: The weather was bad and too dangerous and I got a lot of wind in my run, so that was bad, too. I had a fall and hurt my chin a little bit so it wasnt too nice.
On Sunday, 17-year-old Tess Coady, the youngest member of the Australian team in South Korea, was forced out of the Games after wrecking her left knee in training.
Coady blamed the weather and Austrian rival Anna Gasser said: So many people got hurt because of the wind already.
Gasser, who finished 15th, called the competition a lottery and said: I dont think it was a fair competition and Im a little disappointed in the organisation that they pulled through with it.
From my point of view I think it was not a good show for womens snowboarding.
Britains Aimee Fuller, who finished 17th after crashing, branded the conditions among the toughest she had competed in and said she had no chance of landing her last jump when she was caught by one strong gust.
It was for sure not what I wanted, not what I expected, not what I dreamed of for my Olympic final, said the 26-year-old, who was unhurt in the fall.
There were huge gusts of wind -- Ive decided to call it the Pyeongchang Gust.
Anderson, 27, became the first woman to win two Olympic snowboarding golds, despite briefly falling too in her final run. AFP

Anura Ratnayake- ex-Sri Lanka cricket scorer
I have not met Anura for some time since I published my third book Saga of the Maroons, his help was invaluable for me during that period. I have never met such a talented statistician who had facts and figures at his fingertips be it school cricket or Test cricket. Anura was a guy who never cowed down to anybody since he knew his onions inside out.
He broke his long silence by calling me recently. I hurried along the following day to see him at a place close to Godagama and six foot Anura greeted me warmly. It was a pity that Anura didnt have any takers at present.
Anura is unique in the scoring fraternity and has held different position in a career spanning 15 years.
When Bandula Warnapura was at the helm, Anura joined SLC as a rookie data entry operator. Some part of his work involved formulating statistics based on scorecards. He worked 20 days per month on a daily payment of Rs 350/day and the balance days of the month he was free to perform scoring duties since he was qualified to do so. During this period Anura sat for the finals of the All Ceylon Cricket Umpires Association final examination and came third in the batch. He recollected that the person who came first was a chap by the name of A.Franke who at present is the manager at the NCC and the guy who came second was a person by the name of Chamara de Silva who is in charge of the scoring duties at Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Anura lamented about the position that he was in now in comparison to the ones who finished first and second in that particular examination.
In the year 2010 he was promoted as the cricket coordinator of Sri Lanka School Cricket.
Anura stressed the fact that during this tenor D.S. de Silva was at the helm of affairs at Sri Lanka Cricket. He pointed out that De Silva was keen to improve the lot of schoolboy cricketers from remote areas and D.S. together with Anura visited those areas to improve their infrastructural facilities and also to give training for those coaches enabling them to obtain licenses. According to Anura, De Silva gave exposure to most of the schoolboy cricketers in the island far and wide.
Anura missed the bus for the second time, when seeking promotion, but this time by a mere whisker when he went for the interview in 2011, the post was Sri Lanka Cricket-School Cricket manager, this time around Anura came second to Carlton Bernadus. Anura agreed that Bernadus had better credentials but he was of the view that he should have got the assistant managers post which existed in other areas of SLC. Anura reminisced that some of the members of the panel consisted of D.S. de Silva, Nishantha Ranatunga and Sujeeva Rajapakse.
Anura stated that he was hard done again by the time he appeared again the post was for S.L.C. School Cricket Manager, for the third time he missed out as Senaka Angulugaha got the post.
Further blows came Anuras way when one guy above got the retiring age down to 57 years, as a matter of fact Anura categorically stated that this blow was targeted at Duleep Mendis who was not in the good books of the higher ups then. Anura lamented that there were guys who were well over that age limit who are still warming the chairs at the citadel.
Anura was also one of the founder members of Sri Lanka Scorers Association, he was also the president of that Association from 2012 to 2013. He was the official scorer of the Royal/Thomian matches from 2003 to 2013.
He now holds the position of Secretary of Sri Lanka Tape Ball Federation.
Tape ball cricket is mainly played in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh. According to Anura tape ball was introduced mainly to simulate turf wicket conditions. The ball weighs 69 gms and is heavier than a cricket ball which weighs 5 ounces. The cricketers who play tape ball develop strong shoulders and Shoaib Akthar is a classic example. By the way the originator of tape ball cricket is a Sri Lankan by the name of Waruna Kularatne. The present Minister of Sports has an idea of developing tape ball and Anura stated that he was being earmarked to be in charge of this project.
Anura still has many feathers in his cap, he is the Vice President of the Softball Federation of Sri Lanka till 2021.
Regarding the step motherly treatment he was dished out at the S.L.C. Anura candidly replied that he was an active member of the their staff welfare association and he was instrumental in the organization of blood donation camps, New year festivals, Christmas parties, funeral duties etc which did not go down very well with a certain inner circle which were differently inclined.

[APPRECIATIONS - (13-02-2018)]
Wilfred Harischandra Niriella
Lawyer, Miltary Officer par excellence
It is indeed a privilege to pen this epitaph as a token of gratitude to the late Colonel Wilfred Harischandra Niriella with whom I was indeed fortunate to be associated with since my childhood, and with whom I remained in constant touch till his recent demise. It was a very close comradeship of six decades.
He hailed from a very respectable family in Mahagama, in the Kalutara district. He was born in 1933, one among many siblings. He was a pillar of strength to all his siblings. His paternal affection to all his siblings was regarded with high esteem and appreciation by his family.
But his greatest asset was the pure and genuine heart he possessed. Also, his leadership qualities along with his honesty and integrity were formidable strengths he possessed. He always looked to lending a helping hand to others and was always generous with his family and friends, helping in any crisis, with whatever help needed without expecting anything in return, which is a rare quality these days.
After completing his primary and secondary schooling where he excelled in sports and academics, he joined the Law School to pass out as a lawyer.
He commenced his practice after joining the Kalutara Bar and went on to build a lucrative practice at both Kalutara and Matugama Courts.
He was a stickler for perfection. We can learn many things by looking at his life. One of them is punctuality and the other is honouring promises made. He was well organized and very methodical. His daily diary that he maintained is an example for the younger generation. His commitment towards achieving goals, loyalty to friends and generosity and willingness to help the needy were qualities rare in an individual. Indeed, his was a very generous heart.
He married Prema, who was also a person of many talents and an intellectual in her own right. They were blessed with a son Danajaya who is now a PhD qualified Environmental Engineer working for the Canadian Municipal Government.
His meeting Prema is especially memorable to me as they first met at my place when Prema came to give tuition to my sister and he being my brother's best friend was always in and out of my place. I, as a little boy then, was instrumental in their first introduction to each other. His love and affection for his wife Prema was unlimited. She predeceased him and he personally took care of her during her last few years.
Nirl as he was affectionately known by colleagues as well as friends and Sudu Mama by his nearest and dearest, was indeed a man in a million. I recall during his early career he owned a Fiat 600 into which is 6 feet plus burly frame could only just manage to wriggle into. Inspite of his busy schedule as a leading lawyer in the Kalutara Bar, his love for the military life and uniform saw him commission as a Second Lieutenant in the 2CLI to lead the contingent based in Kalutara. Niri was an officer of rare stature. He persuaded many of his colleagues also to volunteer for military service.
During the many emergency situations Ceylon was faced with during the late 1950s and early 1960, Niri was mobilized many times and he faced many near-death encounters. He carried out the most stressful assignments by tackling it head-on rather than delegating them. He was a man of action and always commanded his men to do their duty professionally and with dignity. He expected nothing but unswerving loyalty from his men. Niri had a tremendous capacity for staying cool under the most hazardous circumstances, never cracked under pressure, never wavered in times of crises and when he was attacked, he always stood tall and strong. After marriage, another important decision he made in life was to join the regular Army.
When the Army Legal Department was formed in the mid 1960s, Niri was an automatic choice owing to his legal background and experience in the volunteer force.
As a Captain therein, he handled many important and vital cases for the Army, which had an important bearing on the country's well-being. He always immaculately turned out and on ceremonial occasions dressed in full regalia, with his handsome features was an out of the world sight to behold'.
Niri owned an unique personality and he was a charismatic person. He constantly adhered to the Rule of Law. He led by example, acted on the courage of his convictions and was a man of unquestioned moral uprightness. Niri never hesitated to call a spade a spade.
His dedication to the military was legendary. He rapidly climbed the ladder to the rank of Colonel and was appointed to the post of Judge Advocate General to the tri forces, which was an early testament to his dedication. The story of his long and meaningful career in the army would undoubtedly fill many volumes.
We had many common interests which helped to maintain our personal association, in spite of our age difference. I always cherished his company and his conversations and we grew helping each other in good times as well sad times.
Niri was blessed with a brilliant visionary mind and was a pragmatic man. He was also a man of indomitable courage coupled with a burning ambition to succeed in life. It is very rarely in one's life that one come across a human of exceptional and rare qualities. Those who were fortunate enough to associate closely with Niri can count themselves lucky. He was a man of vision, a great planner and a perfectionist. The one thing he enjoyed most was making others happy. He would always say my forte is helping others.
He never sought personal gain, shunned publicity and never lost his identity and common touch. Even his wish and desire to be at his death is as follows: My wish is that absolute anonymity and simplicity be maintained at my funeral" and "there should be no Civil or Military ceremony in any form whatsoever.
Sadly, the last few years of his life were plagued by ill health which deteriorated rapidly with Prema's demise.
Niri's cremation took place at the Borella Cremation grounds amidst a large gathering of distinguished current and ex-army top Rankers and legal luminaries.
Niri was a devout Buddhist and the last few years of his life were spent in contemplation of the deeper aspects of this sublime doctrine. May these few lines be a tribute to our long and sincere friendship.
'Though you are no longer with us
We will always remember you forever
Sweet memories are treasured within our hearts
So precious and special to us you are
We will remember you with love
Unforgettable and irreplaceable
To live in the hearts we leave behind is not to die'
- Thomas Campbell
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!
Shanthakumar Ratnajeewa, Talawathugoda
Professor J. E. Jayasuriya
Visionary educationist
I consider it an honour and a privilege to be provided the opportunity to pay my tribute to late Professor J.E. Jayasuriya whose 100th birth anniversary falls on February 14. Unfortunately, I did not have the privilege of being a student of Professor Jayasuriya nor had any personal acquaintance with him. However, I was fortunate to get to know him through the prism of his publications and writings and verbal lore of his colleagues and students who have greatly admired and revered him.
Born on February 14, 1918, he started his primary education at Nawalapitiya Anuruddha Vidyalaya, then joined Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda and finally Wesley College, Colombo. In 1933, he sat the Cambridge Senior Examination and displayed his brilliance by securing the third place in the order of merit among all candidates of the British Empire. In recognition of his brilliant performance, he was awarded a scholarship to the University College, Colombo. In 1939, at the age of 21 years, he graduated with a First Class in Mathematics.
Prof. Jayasuriya commenced his career as an educational administrator being the first principal of Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya. In recognition of his abilities Dr.C.W.W. Kannangara invited him to be in charge of the central school established in the Ministers own electorate, Matugama.
On his return after Post Graduate studies at the Institute of Education, University of London, he was in charge of Mathematics education at the Teachers College Maharagama until appointed as a lecturer in the Department of Education of the University of Ceylon. In 1957, he succeeded Prof T.L Green as Professor of Education. He became the first Sri Lankan to hold that post.
In his capacity as the Professor and the Head of Department, Professor Jayasuriya undertook the task of professionalizing education. He was the role model for all the academic community with his professional attitude, open-mindedness, multi-disciplinary versatility and commitment to his vocation. It was his vision that made him initiate the first undergraduate degree in education, the Bachelor of Education at the University of Peradeniya in the late nineteen sixties, to ensure the pre-service training of graduate teachers. Even though the programme was suspended after a few years of operation, the majority of the first generation of B.Ed. graduates have achieved high professional status both locally and globally. The popularity of this course which is now offered at the University of Colombo testifies to the foresight of Professor Jayasuriya in developing this programme. However, while there are moves to expand the Bachelor of Education programmes it is necessary to review these programmes in the light of Professor Jayasuriyas vision to maintain quality in the B.Ed course he designed.
Professor Jayasuriya was a pioneer in introducing intelligence testing. The National Education Society Intelligence Test, which he helped to develop was the only standardised test available for teachers at that time in national languages. He also adapted the Ravens Non- verbal test to Sri Lankan standards. These were the instruments used in testing for many years.
The first National Education Commission ever to be appointed, in 1961/62 of which Professor Jayasuriya was the Chairman, proposed far-reaching reforms in many areas of education.
At a time when the Educational research was not in vogue in Sri Lanka, Professor Jayasuriya was a forerunner in the culture of research with an array of research on diverse fields. He was also a prolific writer of books and monographs, both in Sinhala and English. They are a great treasure trove to the students and researchers even today. Undoubtedly, he personified the ideal university teacher, dedicated to the three goals of a university: teaching, research and service to society.
Professor Jayasuriya was also known as the father of Population Education in the Asian region After premature retirement from University service he took up an assignment as the Regional Advisor in Population Education at UNESCO, Bangkok and worked there for five years. He headed a team of specialists to help the countries of the region to forge ahead with this novel program. Professor Jayasuriya developed and published a Source Book on Population Education in Asia which was widely distributed in the region and was influential in the evolution of the concepts and programming practices of population education. Further, he launched programming missions in the countries in the region which led to the establishment of population education projects. He was also responsible for setting up a clearinghouse of publications on population education at UNESCO Office to which he himself authored many articles.
As mentioned at the outset I was acquainted with Professor Jayasuriya through his books. I was fortunate to be one of the last batches of students to learn Mathematics using the set of books he authored. Learning Mathematics was a pleasure as the concepts were presented clearly and logically with adequate exercises to practice what is learned. Sadly this is not the case in relation to learning mathematics in Sri Lanka today.
Many who have written about Professor Jayasuriya has highlighted his forthrightness, fearless advocacy of the cause he believed in and an uncompressing intellectual honesty.
These qualities come through his writings especially in "Some Issues in Ceylon Education" which is a critical reaction to the distortion of his recommendations of the National Education Commission Report (1962).
"Educational Policies and Progress. During British Rule in Ceylon where he analyses the education system during British rule in retrospect, Education in the Third world  Some Reflections" which highlights the need to deviate from the western education models and how Sri Lanka has lost its direction in education policy.
At a time when Sri Lankas education reforms are being discussed, it is most opportune to step back and glimpse the views and vision of an educationist par excellence of yesteryears.
The medium of instruction, English language education, free education, expanding Bachelor of Education programmes, private sector involvement in education, these are all current issues which had been discussed by Professor Jayasuriya in his publications. In discussing the British period in Sri Lanka in retrospect he discusses many dualities that existed in the school system at that time. Regarding English language education, he states that compulsory English for all children in and above grade 111 is one of the greatest deceptions perpetrated on the people of this country. He cites two reasons to justify his stand. About 20 -25% of schools never had a single teacher of English and secondly, the calibre of the teachers recruited to teach English was substandard. Regarding free education, he says that education became indeed free for all, but what was free was a good education for the few and a bad education for the many. These statements are valid for the present as well. Hence, Professor Jayasuriya was truly a visionary educationist and his insights should guide the present policymakers.

Geetha Kusumini Howie (nee De Silva)
Beloved sister
The day I heard that you met with a tragic incident on November 27, 2017, and lost your life in an untimely and unbelievable manner, I could not believe, focus or envisage anything other than say to myself, Akka, you have not gone. You know I need you to be with me at this time, at my only sons wedding, the eagerly awaited family get-together which we have planned throughout the year.
We were to meet at the airport and hug each other and enjoy the holiday with our family at my place in Sri Lanka. Instead, I had to squeeze my mind with tears. From that day onwards, life was never the same to our family.
Geetha Kusumini, my beloved sister born in Kandy to my parents Upali and Kusumalatha as their first born baby in 1954 January 29, was a bundle of joy. According to my mother, they have welcomed her as a little princess to their family with decorations and comforts in the specially designed baby room.
Her first birthday frock is still with me as she wanted me to keep it as a token of her childhood memory before she migrated to the USA. She was looking forward to seeing all that old stuff when she visited Sri Lanka this time. I cant believe that cute frock is still in good condition for this past long years but the girl who wore it to celebrate her first birthday is no more.
She started her primary schooling at Mahamaya Girls College Kandy and later attended Southland College, Galle where she learned and nourished. She was involved with Girl Guiding, Home Science cooking, sewing, arts and craft, and drama and many other extracurricular activities. She grew with her special artistic ways as a beautiful lady. She had two siblings, me and my younger brother, Varuna who lives in the UK. As siblings, we share many memories in school, home and with friends.Though I am younger to her, we moved with each others friends and their families and I still can remember even the teachers at school sometimes misunderstood us as twins.
I can still remember how we played with our Paper Dolls. When creating dolls costumes, Akka was the leader and used her creative and artistic talents to create fabulous designs. I, who had no such talents, always appreciated the way she attended to all these fantastic creations. She had an inborn talent for art, especially for drawing figures and sceneries. She loved animals and children. I can still remember when we were living in Galle, how she treated newborn birds who lost their nests or parent birds. She had many pets during her childhood. I can remember the bird Myna, who freely moved through the house and the squirrel and parrot whom she used to keep in cages and fed daily.
She chose her life partner David Howie and got married in 1979 and was blessed with two children, Shahani and Shane. She always spoke highly about her daughter Sahaniss educational and professional achievements and later, she was so fond and loved Sahanis only child, her grandchild Evangeline. She loved Shane as her only good looking, handsome son. She always said Shane has her features. They migrated to the USA in 1989 and built their family nest in New York, Staten Island.
Although we lived apart in different countries, we were so close in our hearts. Every Sunday evening we used to have skype chats. My brother Varuna and mother who lives in the UK also joined and we used to have family chats. Modern technology helped us to be close.We enjoyed the cute behaviour of baby Evangeline over skype. Beyond that, Akka and I always used to have separate discussions for hours and hours, girl talk about fashion, friends, films and family. We even discussed Dhamma. Akka used to go to the temple in New York and listen to Suthra Deshana and when she wanted to simplify things, she used to come up with her notes on skype and talk to my husband Sena who has much knowledge about Dhamma.
Akka worked at Shiel Medical Laboratory as a Lab Technician and she was to start a new position with Quest Diagnostics in December soon after she finished her two weeks holiday in Sri Lanka. She was a responsible worker who always finished her work for the day before leaving the lab. This made her stay longer hours at work and sometimes she used to say that she even skipped her lunch when the workload needed to be clear on time.
She had many talents. She was an excellent driver. She used to drive anywhere in any country and her friends know how capable she was when driving. She enjoyed making cakes, cake structures, talented with flower arrangements, dress designing and cooking.
Her talent for nail art was excellent and admirable. Every Sunday, she came up with new patterns of nail art and proudly showed them to me. She herself can neatly apply these patterns to both her hands.
She was a healthy person and a livewire to the family. If this tragic death had not happened, she could have lived for many years, probably more than 85 easily.
I hope that she will not have such a death in Sansara and we offer all blessings and merits in her name for her to have a good life in her rebirth and make possible for her to reach the esteemed path to Nirvana.

Audi to launch 7 new energy vehicle models in China  by 2020
The Sino-German auto joint venture FAW-Volkswagen will roll out seven new Audi models of new energy vehicles in China by 2020, the company said Sunday.
The C-BEV, an electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) with a 500-km range, will be among the new models, said a statement issued by the company.
It will be the first high-end electric SUV Audi produced in China.
The company will also lease Audi vehicles to companies or individual clients, including services at airport, according to the statement.
Chinese carmakers have invested heavily in the new energy vehicle sector as the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology disclosed in September that the country had started work on a timetable to phase out fossil fuel cars.
Major brands, including Volvo and Chang'an, will stop selling traditional fossil fuel cars in the next few years and fully be engaged in new energy cars.

Back to the drawing boards
President Maithripala Sirisena has accepted Saturdays local government election results with equanimity, and vowed to effect the necessary changes that caused the SLFP to suffer an embarrassing setback. For its part, the UNP, too, appears to be chastised by the verdict of the people and are clearly seeing the red light. Party General Secretary Kabir Hashim said the services rendered by the government to the people, especially in the spheres of health and education has not gone to the public domain. He however said the people will, before long, be in a position to enjoy the dividends of the governments programmes.
In the meantime, the President has also sounded a warning that he would be taking some tough decisions very soon. It is not yet clear as to what these decisions will be. Whatever it is, both partners in the unity government will certainly have to look at things afresh and ring the changes, in cohesion, if it is to win over the estranged public. There is no doubt that Saturdays verdict was a clear backlash at the current state of affairs in government. Name calling by ministers and MPs from either side is not the best way to project stability in the government and may have impacted negatively on the electorate. The bickering must stop.
UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has already stated that the unity government will run its course until 2020. Hence, there is ample time to put the house back in order, and, look carefully at where things went wrong. Some are of the view that the personal popularity of Mahinda Rajapaksa was the sole factor that won the election for the pohottuwa. If that were the case he would have prevailed even on January 8 and repeated the feat on August 15. Nay, it was the cost of living factor that hit the government in the solar plexus. The government lost control of the phenomenon of soaring prices of essential items. True, like minister Hashim said, the floods, drought, and, natural disasters devastated the lives of people in unprecedented proportions, and, the huge debts, a legacy of the Rajapaksa regime, that burdened the economy had affected the lives of people negatively. It is equally true that these calamities were beyond the governments control. But even here the government was slow in reacting to the natural disasters and relief was late in coming. The Meethotamulla catastrophe was a good example of the governments tardiness in responding to the disaster, like, say, a Premadasa would have done. There can be little doubt that the gory scenes shown on TV for weeks on end evoked public resentment towards the government to a great degree. In addition, there were some own goals scored by the government too. Especially, the Kataragama Police shooting of a youth that led to the local police station being attacked by villagers could not have come at a worse time for the government.
The governments pitch to the voters, especially the rural voters, too, was flawed to a great extent. The humble villagers care a whit about corruption at Air Lanka, or, White Van abductions. Despite this, government ministers continued to harp on these themes instead of spelling out urgent solutions to solve the hardships of the farmers and peasants.
Be that as it may, the rude awakening to the government, by Saturdays verdict, it is hoped, will infuse fresh thinking into its leaders, to deal effectively with the burning problems of the masses. However, the President should also guard against precipitate action. There are, today, loud calls from sections of the SLFP, for a rethink on the feasibility of continuing with the UNP, in government. These are the segments whose cacophonous sounds failed to get their party anywhere at the just concluded elections. Even the Samurdhi portfolio held by a SLFP minister failed to deliver the goods. Besides, the SLFP will have only 93 MPs in parliament, even if it joins forces with the Joint Opposition, and, cannot hope to form a government. This sober reality, it is hoped, would dawn on the garrulous SLFP MPs who are demanding a change of composition in the government.
Premature celebrations
For all the brouhaha of the Joint Opposition on Saturdays LG polls victory of the pohottuwa, read Mahinda Rajapaksa, it fell well short of the magical 50% mark. The pohottuwa, or, Mahinda Rajapaksa polled 44.65% of the total votes cast, including from the North and East, while the combined votes of the Opposition (UNP, SLFP, TNA, JVP and the rest) shot well over the 50% mark. Whoever aspires to be President from the pohottuwa (MR is barred from contesting) will have to obtain 50% +1 vote to be President, at the 2020 election. It is moot whether there could be anyone within the pohottuwa ranks who can equal MR in popularity. This includes Gota, though, it is left to be seen, if he throws his hat into the ring, will he be willing to forgo his American citizenship. It is also significant that the next presidential election will have to precede a parliamentary election, and, if MR aspires to be Prime Minister, a lot will depend on the outcome of the Presidential poll.

The back of the mind and the bottom line
Angelo De Silva is my neighbour. Hes a friend and a brother. Today (February 12) is his birthday. I called to wish him.
All the best, good health and good times as you turn 27, I said.
Angelo has a lovely sense of humour. He is witty. His witticism is sometimes laced with vulgarity. The bawdiness would come later in the conversation. He laughed and said I think machang you were using the Presidents formula to calculate my age. You were a bit off. I am actually a few years younger!
It was my turn to laugh. Neighbours though we are, Angelo and I dont meet often. Times, walls, roads and a hundred other things get in the way. But when we do meet, we talk about life, our kids, our fears for them, the joys they give and how lovely it is that both our families appreciate trees.
His house is at a higher elevation and its from there that I get the full view of our garden. I never knew it was so green until I saw it from Angelos house. Angelo, for his part, is appreciative because in the midst of dozens of houses, ours is a rare patch of green.
So we talked about not seeing each other often as we should, made plans to meet up, and talked about the election results.
We named names, but thats not relevant here. I was thinking of the gap between word and deed, the things said and the things unsaid, whats apparent and whats hidden. I talked about things at the back of their minds, and Angelo quickly interjected, you mean the minds of their backs
We laughed. It was an interesting turn of phrase and I told him that he had given me an idea to write about. I expressed to him (and to myself) a word of caution: people might get the wrong idea. Angelo is kind and had a lot of confidence in my ability: youll be able to write it in some other way.
I was thinking about it, but then creativity aside, I had just spoken to some schoolchildren at a workshop on journalism, extolling the importance of truth and accuracy in reporting. I had also alerted them to the dictum facts are sacred, comment free. That, now, seems an escape clause, but then again there is a bigger gateway, something that the Vice Principal of my school told me 35 years ago, do what you think is right whether or not the world appreciates.
On the other hand, journalists always operate within sets of rules, said and unsaid. And so we craft or locate the things that need to be said in places permissible or decorate in such a way that the frill distracts and allows the unspeakable to be spoken.
But yes, it seems that some people and who knows maybe all people or the vast majority use minds of theirs backs. And its not only when it comes to elections. Its not only when it comes to governance, which is what Angelo and I were talking about.
Tad vulgar, though, and Angelo readily admitted. I told him that we should all be applauded as a citizenry for being able to laugh despite all the trials and tribulations that are such an integral part of our lives.
Yes, as a nation we forgive ourselves all the time for electing those we do who we later reject and thereafter forgive ourselves once again for electing another set of the same kinds of people.
We forgive our sins as we forgive those who sin against us, without waiting for divine approval or compassion. And so we have survived insurrections and wars, bloodshed and brutality, white vans and tyre pyres, insults and humiliation, one corrupt and incompetent government after other incompetent and corrupt governments. And we have retained enough life in our not so divine lives to laugh about it all.
And be a tad vulgar about it too.
Vulgarity is all we have, Angelo laughed.
Ill mention that too, I promised.
Please do, and since Valentines Day is a few days away you can say it from the bottom of your heart.or the heart of your bottom!
My neighbour and I rarely meet. He wont have having a birthday party. Ill just go home after work, Angelo said. I said If I do come that way (at a decent hour) I will drop by. Please do and it doesnt have to be on my birthday only, he said.
I am not sure I can make it. I dont have a birthday present for my friend and brother. This must suffice and it will reach him only after the fact. He wont mind. Its from the bottom of my heart.

The Battle of Lyceumers 2018 , the 3rd annual limited over cricket encounter between Lyceum International School, Nugegoda and Lyceum International School,Panadura for Nikitha Grero Challenge Trophy, hosted by Lyceum International School Panadura this year, will be held on February 17 at P. Saravanamuttu Stadium, Colombo.
This big match was initiated by Director of Lyceum International School Nikitha Grero in 2016 to ensure that Lyceumers too get the experience of a big match. This year Lyceum Nugegoda team will be led by versatile Pasindu rajapaksa under the guidance of Head coach Lal Senaratne and MIC Pathum Madhushanka while the Panadura team will be spearheaded by the team captain Sithira Tennekoon under the supervision of Head Coach Kapila Mahinda and MIC Rumesh Wickramasinghe.
Lyceum Nugegoda team won last years encounter by scoring 288 in 50 overs. Lyceum Panadura was able to collect only 139 in 45 overs for nine wickets. Nikitha Grero, Director of Lyceum International Schools stated, We have come to that special time of the year where Lyceum Nugegoda and Lyceum Panadura will meet once again,during a friendly game of Cricket at Lyceums Annual Big Match.
Cricket is a wonderful sport and a national game that many of our players support and dream to be a part of some day. I still remember how enthusiastic we all were once Cricket was introduced to this school. If not for the foundation that was set by our pioneer cricket coaches, the standard of cricket at Lyceum would not be where it is today. Our cricket teams have continued to shine and perform exceptionally well in many inter-international and/national school cricket tournaments and therefore, this event would provide a great platform for both teams to display their cricketing skills.
The Nikitha Grero Challenge Trophy cricket encounter will be mainly sponsored by CeylonAgro, Industries Prima Group. Next Click Studio, NCG Express (Pvt) Ltd, NCGAutomotive are the Co-Sponsors. Sri Lankas newest job search portalJobAds.lk has joined hands as the special sponsor of the event.

Brain drain in ICT sector on the decline - Ratnayake
The brain drain in the ICT sector is now reversing and this is very evident among Sri Lankans who are based overseas for 10 to 15 years, said chief Information Officer, Virtusa, Madhu Ratnayake.
Speaking at a special press conference last Saturday he said that today even the students who embark on higher education return to Sri Lanka to work. This clearly shows that the ICT sector is becoming very lucrative in Sri Lanka, he said.
Ratnayake added that they are happy about the attention the government is paying for the ICT sector and said Virtusa too were working with Universities in a bid to share their knowledge with the undergraduates.
Today gaming is on the palm top of almost every youth and when they do come for ICT related jobs they would have used gaming for almost 100 hours. This is an advantage when they come for ICT related jobs in Sri Lanka which also gets snapped up immediately.
Ratnayake said that Virtusa was recruiting youth from Sri Lanka annually and this was a sizable figure. He also said that they are also working with several Sri Lankan companies including ICTA.
Today youth are also engaged in multiple projects for multiple companies this is giving them additional revenue ,said Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Virtusa Corp, Keith Modder. He also said that ICT has opened new business areas that could have being done by existing companies. Two classic examples for these include UBER and AirB&B.

Bringing divided South Asia together through soul-stirring music
Wednesdays stunning performance by a symphony orchestra comprising Sri Lankan and Indian musicians under the baton of Indo-American Viswa Subbaraman, led the audience to believe that it was time South Asia, torn by conflicts for the last 70 years, eschewed animosities and conflicts and got together to revive those strands of South Asian history which had made the region a unique and vibrant cultural entity.
The need for using music to build bridges was stressed by the person who made Music Beyond Borders possible - Nirupama Rao, former High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, Ambassador to the US and Foreign Secretary of India - in her introductory remarks at the concert held at Ladies College in Colombo, organized by the Indian Cultural Centre in Colombo and the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
A music lover who learnt Western classical music under Soundarie David of Soul Sounds, Colombo. Ambassador Rao had taken up the task of bridging divides through music after retirement from diplomacy.
The idea of putting together a symphony orchestra of South Asian musicians germinated in the mind of the diplomat-turned musician after she met an equally creative mind in the US  the biologist turned orchestral conductor Viswa Subbaraman -- an Indo-American who was experimenting with a combination of Beethoven and Bollywood.
Rao and Viswa struck a friendship which led to the formation of a South Asian symphony orchestra. At present it has only Sri Lankan and Indian musicians. The Sri Lankan musicians, who form the bulk, are drawn from the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) and the eight players are from the Bombay Symphony Orchestra. .
But Rao is keen on expansion with players from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. She appealed to the envoys present at the concert to help attract musicians to the orchestra from their respective countries.
Rao is hopeful that this will happen despite political divisions in South Asia, and quoted Nelson Mandela who said: We are all wired to love rather than to hate. The performance on Wednesday opened with Rossinis gripping La Cenerentola, based on the story of Cinderella. The majestic introduction with the bassoon and a trumpet yielded place to an Allegro theme suffused with fizz, charm and Italian elegance. The second theme had charming interludes by the clarinet, oboe and the piccolo which was followed by a melodramatic end showing the audience why Rossini is nicknamed Signor Crescendo.
The Piano Concerto No: 27 in B Flat Major K.595 by Mozart played by Marialena Fernandes, an Indian pianist from Austria, was plaintive and moving with the soloist breathing life into the score and drawing sustenance from it at the same time.
A lightly scored piece for piano, flutes, oboes ,bassoons and the horn, the concertos pervasive mood was subdued and somber although interspersed with moments of piquant playfulness and sudden loud interjections making the listeners sit up take notice.
The piece de resistance was undoubtedly the last item, the rousing Symphony No: 7 by Beethoven. In this work, ably conducted at the concert by the ebullient and passionate Viswa Subbarman, Beethoven had brought out the fullness of instrumentation through considered harmonies and liberal doubling, deftly overcoming the handicap of having meager instrumental resources. There were pairs of flutes oboes, clarinets, bassoons, trumpets and the timpani and of course the strings, but little else. The finale which is akin to a no-holds barred cavalry charge had the audience at the edge of their seats.
Subbaraman conducted the superbly trained young musicians with aplomb and infectious enthusiasm. The thunderous applause he got from the full house at the Ladies College in Colombo at the end was richly deserved.
In his short speech, Subbaraman said that he enjoyed working with Sri Lankan musicians. His remark: Sri Lankans are the nicest people, Ive known, which he made spontaneously, pleased the audience immensely. A firm foundation for future cooperation between musicians across South Asian borders had been well and truly laid.

12 Strong
Brotherhood of battle
Breaking away from his Thor image Hollywood actor Chris Hemsworth leads the mission as Captain Mitch Nelson in 12 Strong a powerful war drama from Alcon Entertainment. Directed by Nicolai Fuglsig the movie is based on the book best-selling book Horse Soldiers.
The incidents from the film are from true life incidents which occur in the aftermath of 9/11.
The filmmakers could have made more use of the narrative format involved in the plot as the story does not delve deep enough to explore the larger involvement of the U S in the matter. The most glaring flaw is the decision of director Fuglsig and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to forgo character development. That might have worked in the recent World War II drama Dunkirk, where the harrowing event was the star of the film, but not here with all the emphasis on Hemsworth, taking his character on a ride from a soldier who thinks with his head to a warrior who follows his heart. Fuglsig spends little time establishing the films big ensemble before hurling them into the fight. The result is a cast of stereotyped characters - the do-anything, the strict colonel, the sergeant badass and the one who minds the child soldier.
Oscar nominee Michael Shannon too contributes to the project alongside Hemsworth. As Hal Spencer, Shannon flexes muscles and carries the action forward, pumping adrenaline into the war scenes.
Despite the lack of depth in the movie the actors carry off their roles well. This makes it quite watchable. It infuses heart and character into the drama.
Though the story might not be quite feature film material it reminds one of the reality, the horrors that one faces in daily life when a nation is torn by war.
12 Strong is currently screening at Majestic Cineplex.

Celebrating 70 years with a symphony
Retired Indian Foreign Secretary and Ambassador Srimati Nirupama Rao had a vision for South Asia. And that was to do her part in creating unity amongst South Asian nations through the power of music. Rao correctly identified that this awakening is essential for South Asia at this juncture in time.
The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka is an internationally acclaimed orchestra with the ability to make Raos dream a reality. And that was what exactly happened last week at Ladies College Auditorium when the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) presented the concert Music Beyond Borders.
The concert, combining Sri Lankan and Indian musicians was astounding. The music created by internationally acclaimed American Conductor Viswa Subbaraman and the highly talented pianist Marialena Fernandes was this awakening. Their music was spellbinding. Fernandes really got the crowd going with her prodigious skill at the Piano and Subbaraman was at his best.
You could sense the euphoria of the crowd. It was almost tangible. Ambassador Raos quotation before the concert remained in our minds  We as human beings are essentially wired to love and not to hate. That is the true power of music, and that was what we all sensed that day - The transformative power of music.
Because you could appreciate the music that they made. You might be into jazz, R&B or rock, but you could appreciate their music, because you could see their passion. And seeing that passion gave you a positive vibe. Seeing that passion and commitment struck a chord in you.
For me, the type of music that the Symphony Orchestra put out is an acquired taste. Having watched many of these concerts I can appreciate this love. Unity. You fall in love with its uniqueness. You fall in love with this genre of music. Once you witness a performance like what took place last week at Ladies College, you will never turn down a chance to make another visit.
It is this awakening. You may have watched a hundred concerts but everyone is different because at every concert you become a little more aware of life and yourself. That too is the power of music that took place last week. Every song is different because when you sit down at a concert, you sit down with your life experiences. And when you listen to music like this, you begin to reflect upon your life experiences while watching the concert, and it speaks to you. It has a message for you. The music speaks to your heart. It is an awakening.
All in all it was well put together. It showed a lot of hard work and desire. Because, if you dont have the desire you cannot do anything. And I saw that desire in the performance last week. They wanted to please us. They wanted to make us happy. They wanted to give us a fabulous time and for this we must salute them. It was a fine evening.
Ambassador Rao, pointed out that what was seen that day was the beginning of a journey that is underscored by the vision that we in South Asia can work together in harmony.
We can now put all contention and conflict behind us, and bring together the vast number of talented people and through the power of their example, show the way forward towards a future of peace and harmony for this vast region that we belong to. Our common culture and shared history unite us. We also face common challenges which we will surmount together, said Rao.
She commented that the germ for the idea came from her years of diplomacy and understood there is so much potential for peace in this region that we are living in.
But we have to break the shackles and overcome the obstacles to reach that goal. So I began to think of the idea of bringing together musicians of our region to form a South Asian Symphony Orchestra. Of course the SOSL has created a wonderful example for their presence in the industry for 60 years. But we really need to strive towards synergy in our region, said Rao.
Recently Rao was in Sri Lanka to deliver a lecture on Mahatma Gandhi and happened to be here on the inaugural day of the world choir games that was held here.
I was sitting next to the honorable Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, at that function. I mentioned the idea I had to the Prime Minister for a South Asian Symphony Orchestra. He was very enthusiastic and since both Sri Lanka and India are celebrating 70 years of Independence, we thought it would be ideal to bring together musicians of the two countries, to perform in a concert to mark the 70 years of Independence, added Rao.
Rao extended her heartfelt gratitude to all those from India and Sri Lanka, who contributed with sponsorships and made the event possible.
So as the next step we want to more sponsorships, we look for more support, we plan to create a trust here in Sri Lanka, and we would like to create an endowment which will permit us to have more activities of this nature. We want to get musicians together. We want to conduct master classes and workshops. We want to bring in other countries because this is not about only India and Sri Lanka. I dream of seeing Afghans, Bangladesh and Maldivians, Bhutanese and many more to come together and show their prowess, explained Rao.
Rao recalled a statement made by Lakshman Kadirgamar who said that South Asia is meant to be one. It is meant to be united. We are meant to communicate better with each other.
Music becomes that Universal language. Nelson Mandela once said that  We as human beings are essentially wired to love and not to hate. So we need to put our divisions behind and move forward and the youth are key to this, pointed out Rao.
Chairperson of the Board of Governors of The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, Sharmini Wettimuny, spoke about the exciting synergy that is the launch of the South Asian Symphony Orchestra. Wettimuny pointed out that music needs no translation and does transcend borders.
The SOSL is honored to host the launch to the South Asian Symphony Orchestra as the musicians from Sri Lanka and India Collaborate in todays concert.
The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka has been performing regular concerts for 60 years. Ambassador Rao made a request from me, that the SOSL become the nucleus of the South Asian Symphony Orchestra so that the musicians of Sri Lanka and India can collaborate. To this we said yes! And that we will agree to support the forming of this new Orchestra. We are very privileged, said Wettimuny. Wettimuny pointed out that in an Orchestra, people of different regions and different cultures come together as a unified force, as they work towards a common goal of harmony and balance.
Music Beyond Borders exemplifies this unity as the musicians from India and Sri Lanka, who come from across many borders and speak over six languages, perform together in perfect harmony through the common language of music and their shared passion for music, stated Wettimuny. Wettimuny stated that it was no easy feat getting all of this together, but with the help of Ambassador Rao they accomplished all of this in a short time and put together a concert of this magnitude.
We were able to get musicians from many ethnicities and we are now able to stage this highly successful concert. I appeal to you diplomats, to help us establish contact with musicians in other countries. On behalf of the SOSL I wish to extend my thanks to Ambassador Nirupama Rao for her commitment and her untiring efforts to making this concert a reality.
I wish to thank Conductor Viswa Subbaraman and pianist Marialena Fernandes and the musicians from India who have traveled many miles to be here. I would also like to acknowledge the support given by his Excellency Taranjit Singh Sandhu for his support as well. As the SOSL, we deeply value the support of all our sponsors to sustain this genre of music in Sri Lanka. Tonight we have musicians performing as one unit. They are bonded by the common language of music and their shared passion of it, explained Wettimuny.
The concert took place on Wednesday February 7 at 7.30pm at the Ladies College Hall.

Day of the incorrigible Love sniper in a diaper
Tomorrow, Wednesday, February 14 is V-Day. And the cash registers have been jingling incessantly throughout the whole of last week. For days tainted by commercialism Valentines Day gives Christmas a run for its money - big money. It is heralded with a superfluity of marketing initiatives by cunning companies to cash in on the general emotional cupidity and stupidity on display.
Yes, it is that time of year again. Love is in the air, romance begins to settle over everything and we are all forced to wade knee-deep through images of hearts, cards, perfumes, flowers, cuddly bears and chocolates.
That is why on V-Day you observe a great deal of people walking around feeling light-headed and full of love. Yes siree, Stupid Cupids arrows seem to be sending everyone quivering into a trance in romance.
The greeting card industry, florists, jewellers, confectioners and restaurateurs all rake in zillions of bucks during V-Day every year. Now, dont get me wrong, I am not against romance. I think romance is an important part of the man-woman relationship. Yet, throughout the years I have found that there are many different types of romance. And it doesnt necessarily involve flowers, chocolates and lacy heart shaped cards.
Often it appears in the smallest of actions, and in the simple, quiet moments of everyday life. I would choose comfort, security, and old-fashioned loving devotion over wildly romantic encounters any day of the week. All you florists, confectioners, perfumers and card sellers are welcome to send your hate-mail to the address below.
But before that cherubic, chubby imp starts stringing his bow and ruffling his wings it would be a good idea to get ready to run like the blazes. That is because Cupids arrows have been known to have caused mischief and mayhem from the time his darts drove Daphne away from Apollo. History has established that he is a lousy shot.
Yes, Stupid Cupid often gets it wrong. It seems pretty obvious that the little bounder has a capricious disposition and I suspect a malicious streak as well. His arrows are lethal weapons to the lovelorn and he sometimes uses them cruelly. In this day and age he terrorises a good many hearts. Still some people say: If only Cupid would re-arm and update his weaponry, with no strings attached. Someone suggested that instead of a bow and arrow, he should be equipped with a semi-automatic weapon.
With a real weapon, the rascally son of Venus could bar adults - and by adults I mean parents and teachers - from making children swap Valentines. What the heck are they trying to do with these very small kids anyway Aiming to churn out whole generations of Valen-tinies, I guess.
Besides, think about the incurably romantic oldsters They would be spared a world of grief when they are pierced broadside and the feelings are un-mutually one-sided. Sometimes plot does not always race at a pace that suggests love is just about the only force that keeps the universe moving with ever-palpitating geriatric hearts. To be sure the missile does not always keep to the straight and narrow. It flies awry often. To add to the confusion the fanatical freak does not always hit dead centre.
I suspect sometimes it is because the over-zealous scamp likes to use certain people as target practice. To be sure of hitting the target, he shoots first and calls whatever he hits the target. But do not make the mistake of advising the arch little archer to improve his archery skills because he will turn around and fire back smugly: If practice makes perfect, and nobodys perfect, why practice
Personally, I think this urchin dressed only in a diaper, flying around blindfolded and shooting arrows at folks, is just plain dangerous. Oh sure, it may seem like fun and games, until somebody gets an eye or both eyes put out! And then everybody invariably spews out the hackneyed clich that love is blind.
What is Valentines Day and exactly what are we celebrating Many different stories surround this special day we celebrate in honour of the Patron Saint of Romance, a third century Roman martyr named Valentine. According to legend, Valentine was a priest in ancient Rome.
He was executed by the Roman Emperor, Claudius II, for running around in a diaper while shooting sharp objects at people. No, wait a minute, Cupid does that. Sorry, I will get down to changing only Cupids diaper. Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is questionable, the stories certainly emphasise his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic, and, most importantly, a romantic figure.
Anyway to get on with it, the misinformed Emperor Claudius, felt that married soldiers were not as ill-tempered, brainwashed and eager to do battle as the unmarried troopers. But St. Val being a hopeless romantic and realising the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages in secret for young lovers. When Valentines actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. Valentine was beheaded, which may have possibly inspired the adage head over heels in love.
And there was our long-time associate Percival. We rephrased his name to Vul-Percy, which in Sinhala parlance could mean anything from libertine to lecher, or cad to lady-killer. Vul-Percy gifted a lovely lass he fancied a heart-shaped box of chocolates on V-Day which she refused to accept. Worse still was her acerbic comeback: Sorry Percy, but I decline being your Vul-entine!
But closer home there was my old friend and former schoolmate nicknamed Surchepps, who I have deservingly immortalised in many of my satire columns.
He was an inveterate punster and a darned good one at that. As an alumni of St. Bens he had a sort of paradoxical rivalry with a pretty, witty Shepherdian, in the convent next door. Her name was Mercy, although she never lived up to her name when crossing swords in any verbal battle.
At a social gathering once we matched Surchepps with Mercy in a fun debate on love that called for insults in rhyming couplets. I was voted unanimously as moderator and set out the rules which decidedly forbade profanity of any kind. Surchepps won the coin toss and fired the first volley: Of loving beauty you float with grace. If only you would hide your face.
Mercy returned fire: I want to feel your sweet embrace. But leave that paper bag on your face.
Surchepps: Violets are blue, roses are red. I hate your guts and I wish you were dead! Mercy: I see your face when I am dreaming. Thats why I always wake up screaming!
As moderator I had to step in and cry halt to the debate when I observed it was going too far. Surchepps: My feelings for you no words can tell. Except for maybe go to hell! Mercy: Violets are blue, roses are red. Shame, your backside is the size of a shed!

Wellawa triple murder case
Death sentence for ex-Army officer
The accused in the Wellawa triple murder case was sentenced to death by Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara yesterday.
The accused, former Army Officer R.M. Rathnayake, was indicted by the Attorney General with committing the murder of R.M. Dharmasena, R.M. Abeyrathna and Chandana Kumara Jayarathna on March 29, 2004, at the Wellawa Police Station.
The accused had shot them.
The prosecution with assistance from State Counsel Tharaka Dharmasiri had proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

According to present ITF wheelchair tennis rankings, Dharmasena is ranked 95 and with this victory he will be able to better his world ranking. The 28-year Sri Lanka Army player in his short tennis career reached the singles world ranking 91 and doubles ranking 41 in June, 2017. At present Dharmasena is ranked world number 47 in doubles rankings.
Dharmasena showed great promise from the beginning of the final, winning the first set comfortably. But Sang-Ho OH bounced back strongly to win the following set. Dharmasena came up with a superb performance in the third set and sealed his victory routing his Korean rival with ease.
Altogether 14 Sri Lankans entered round one of the mens singles event and only three of them reached the quarterfinal stage.

The ITF Wheelchair World Team Cup qualifications too will be held in Sri Lanka from February 22 to 25.
Sri Lanka has come a long way in the international wheelchair tennis scene, producing some players among world top 100 and the forthcoming four tournaments will provide great experience to local players while allowing them to improve their world rankings. Wheelchair tennis has become a Paralympic medal hope of Sri Lanka and hosting international tournaments will greatly help to mould Lankan players as international stars.

Drastic drop in MRs vote, from 2015  Mangala
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who commanded 5.77 million votes (47.6%) at the 2015 Presidential polls was barely able to muster 4.95 million votes (44.7%) at the recently concluded Local Government Elections, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said. Issuing a press statement on the outcome of the LG elections, Minister Samaraweera yesterday noted that a resounding majority of citizens numbering 6.1 million (55.3%), marched to the polls last Saturday and voted against a return to Rajapaksa rule.
Taking note of the election results, Samaraweera however said; Today, the people told us that we have not done enough.
Despite the sincerest of efforts to inject haste and independence into a dilapidated justice system over the last three years and empower the police with the tools they need to successfully investigate complex crimes, murderers and fraudsters remain at large. Despite our government being the first in the nations history to insist that ministers must resign from the cabinet at the first sign of wrongdoing, and indeed the first to investigate allegations of corruption within its ranks with such vigour, justice is yet to be served, he added.
He stressed that the message from the people has sunk deep into the UNP and that the Government is committed to taking drastic measures to fulfill the promises made three years ago and maintain the public trust.
Our duty is to broaden our own voter base by delivering results, while joining hands with all honest and democratic political forces to uplift our motherland and ensure that Sri Lanka never again returns to rule by the sword.
That is our calling and we must not fail. Our democracy, our republic, depends on it, he added.
On the 8th of January 2015, fifty one percent of Sri Lankans voted for the vision put forth to them by our unity candidate Maithripala Sirisena: that the time for dictatorship in our country was over, and that those committed to re-establishing democracy in Sri Lanka must unite to ensure that government serves all of the people, and not a single family and their loyal disciples.
On that day, the United National Party, several stalwarts of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Peoples Liberation Front, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, the Tamil National Alliance, the Democratic Peoples Front, and altogether over 30 political and civic bodies came together to prove that Sri Lankans shared their vision of a Sri Lanka that was ruled by law and not through fear.
We promised to amend the constitution to restore independence to the public service, abolish the executive presidency, and enshrine the rights of all Sri Lankans into the legal bedrock of our legal system. We promised to bring those who robbed the coffers of the treasury to justice. We promised to hold accountable those who quenched their thirst for power with the blood of brave journalists and peaceful protestors. Most of all, we promised you a government that would be free of the rampant corruption that defined the decade that came before us, he said while emphasizing the efforts made in the right directions to fulfil the above obligations.
As we embark on this chapter in the story of our democracy, Sri Lanka can be proud of two remarkable things we saw last Saturday.
The first is the conduct of an election under the auspices of an independent elections commission and police service. Never before has a government shied from manipulating public personnel, funds, resources and state media into an organ of their political ends. We hope that under these independent bodies, Sri Lanka has seen the last of corruption, intimidation and violence marring our elections, he concluded.

Maha Shivarathri messages
Eliminate evil thoughts: President

I extend my greetings to all Hindu devotees the world over who celebrate the Maha Shivarathri with the objective of overcoming darkness and ignorance in life and the world illuminates the self-pride and selfishness of humans, with the desire for the well-being of the entire universe and peace in the world, stated President Maithripala Sirisena sending a message marking Maha Shivarathri.
The message added: Fasting on the day of Shivarathri is considered to be the most important and significant fast for the devotees of Lord Shiva and observance of this ritual with discipline helps a devotee to control the five sense organs in human beings while keeping the mind in precise concentration on an objective. Devotees of Lord Shiva believe that a person who indulges in a Shivarathri fast with sincerity, all through the day and night performing rituals with perfect devotion is absolved from all sin. Such a devotee reaches the abode of Lord Shiva and lives there happily ever after.
Furthermore, Shiva devotees believe such rituals will reduce the self-pride and selfishness of humans, paving the way for coexistence with each other.
Therefore, Shivarathri fast will eliminate the dark evil thoughts that emerge in the hearts of the humans and illuminate the wisdom and thoughtfulness. It will, invariably help to build reconciliation and coexistence with each other.
I extend my heartiest greetings to all Hindu devotees around the world who celebrate the Maha Shivarathri with the desire for the well-being of fellow human beings as well as to further consolidate the religious beliefs and the social well-being.

Entry refused.!
As I watch Trump disallowing outsiders into his turf, I wonder why those who want to go to his land of milk and honey dont make their own country, as good or better, so they can say, Ours is now better than yours sir! I imagined a day like that: Sir, says the only emigration officer on duty at the JFK Airport in New York, I havent got my salary!
Ive no money to pay you! says Donald, Theres nobody coming here anymore! Why arent they though
They dont need to sir! says his Vice President with a forlorn look, Theyve made their own countries better than ours!
Better than my America
Yes, Mr President! You kept shooing them away from your Garden of Eden till they made their own Edens! said the Vice President, Many of our own people have left to live there!
Whats so special growled Trump.
No walls Mr President! In the Edens they have built, theres no black or white or brown, everyone is treated equal!
You mean in those shih.les!
And theyve made that a sacred word sir! After you used it, it inspired them to come out of their shi..les and make them diamond mines!
So, lets go and have a look! I want to see what they have thats keeping them coming here! said the President, Come on lets check Asia!
The Presidents old Air Force One flew into the sky and kept flying towards Asia. Suddenly the president and his vice-president heard the distinct sound of other aircraft outside, Trump beamed. What I love, he said with a smile, Is the sound of Americas best fighter jets accompanying me everywhere
Im afraid youre wrong sir! said his VP, no longer can we afford the fuel cost of our planes guarding you. Congress passed, you fly alone!
The voice of a worried pilot came on the air, Mr President, those are fighter planes from Asian countries, they have ordered us to turn back!
Tell them who I am! said the President angrily.
It was when we did, that they ordered us around sir. They do not want you entering their countries!
What about Africa asked the President.
Im afraid the same applies there too sir. Theyve messaged, refusing entry!
The President looked out of his window, and saw green fields, unpolluted blue sky, and large cities with towering buildings, Looks like were still over America! he said with a smile.
No sir, said his VP, You are now flying over the very countries you called shi.holes!
Trump watched as his old plane turned around and flew back to what was once the richest country in the world. Passport sir asked the same emigration officer.
Dammit, you know who I am!
Entry refused..! said the officer with a smirk, as the President gasped.

A fairy tale from  Paris Fashion Week
The aesthetic of Ralph and Russo, the only extant British haute couture house, can be summed up as dresses in which to marry a prince. So while Kylie Minogue sat front row between the supermodels Karlie Kloss and Natalia Vodianova, and despite the actors Lupita Nyongo, Tracee Ellis Ross and Allison Williams wearing the label on the red carpet at the Screen Actors Guild on Sunday evening, the most significant name currently linked with the brand belonged to a certain Meghan Markle, who was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps Markle, who sparked rumours of a Ralph and Russo wedding dress when she chose the brand for her official engagement photo, is one of the brands 1.7 million social media followers. If so, she will have seen the shows finale, an off-white duchess satin gown with a draped bodice, long train encrusted with leaves of Swarovski crystals and lace veil embroidered with silk petals.
Ralph and Russo is sole heir to the grand British couture tradition of Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell. The designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo moved from their native Australia to London, where the business has been one of British fashions biggest success stories since it opened in 2007. They now employ more than 400 people, with a townhouse in Mayfair for client fittings and a large atelier where the embroidery department alone is 30-strong. Angelina Jolie wore a Ralph and Russo suit to Buckingham Palace when she was presented with her honorary damehood by the Queen.
Its many devoted clients desire fairytale, so that was exactly what the Paris show delivered: dreamy fantasies in frothy mint organza, blush pink silk gazar and ice blue Chantilly lace, and bombshell gowns in black velvet and metallic satin. There is no pandering to practical details at Ralph & Russo. Sleeves are largely absent, unless made from fine-spun silk fringing, and the few coats to be found are fashioned from ostrich feathers, or sheer tulle.

Faith-based Samson easy to relate to
Lindsay Wagner, who plays Samsons mother in the faith-based action film, Samson, said it was easy taking on the role since she has two children of her own who are always kind of living on the edge.
I have two boys, Wagner, who became an icon in the 1970s playing Jamie Sommers, the tennis pro who became a government agent with bionic strength, told Newsmax TV host John Bachman on Newsmax Now on Tuesday night.
They are both very physically active. Theyre certainly not of Samsons strength, but they are stuntmen, so they are always kind of living on the edge, and I really empathized with Samsons mother in the sense that every time he would leave the house, leave the village, she never knew if she would see him again.
So, it was very easy to relate to her journey, and when he was in emotional pain, which she learned a lot more about in the film  it hurts when your children hurt  so it just seemed like an easy thing.
Samson is based on the biblical Hercules, a man of supernatural strength who defends his people and sacrifices everything to avenge his love, his people, and his God.
The movie was produced by Pure Flix, a Christian movie studio that produces, distributes, and acquires Christ-centered movies.
They are definitely looking to do and are executing, for sure, films that more people can relate to, Wagner said. They are bringing them up that the values are whats important, the values are what are universal. And the personal journey, for example, in this case of Samson, hes a human.
Hes not from another planet. Hes not fighting gargoyles and things from other places. His journey, his battle are the same thing that we all go through. Its internal. Its his own demons, which he beautifully speaks about.
Taylor James, who plays Samson, said the movie is easy for any audience to connect to.
If you know the story, or if you dont, its a beautiful story, he said. So, whether its faith-based or not is irrelevant in my opinion. Its just rich in material.

Samson will be released from February 16 at Majestic Cineplex - Colombo/Empire Arcade -Colombo/Regal -Gampaha/Plaza - Kaluthara/Liberty Lite - Collpetty, Vista Lite- Ja Ela and other fuilm halls islandwise. It is a CEL release

Finlands Valila oldest Olympic hockey woman at 44
Gangneung: Finland forward Riikka Valila, who followed her brothers into hockey at age seven, is now a mother of three and the oldest women's hockey player in Olympic history at age 44.
In Finland's 3-1 opening round-robin loss to the United States on Sunday in their Pyeongchang opener, Valila also became the oldest Winter Olympian in Finland history, replacing figure skater Ludowika Jakobsson-Eilers, who was 43 in 1928.
"To be able to do it once again, to be able to do it in that age, I'm very thankful," Valila said.
"After Sochi, I felt good in my body and I still felt that I can improve, I can be better on the ice. I don't have to prove anything to myself or anybody else. I just enjoy playing... I'm getting better and I can help the team.
"After this season is over, if everything feels good, then I continue."
Valila, who has played on six bronze-medal world championship Finnish teams, helped Finland to Olympic bronze in 1998 in women's Olympic ice hockey debut. She was also on the 2002 squad that placed fourth but retired in 2003 to start a family. AFP

Gota says he is US citizen and no to PM post
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa admitting that he is a citizen of the United States of America, dismissed the idea of him accepting the position of Prime Minister if offered by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
He made this observation at the Bandaranaike International Airport on his return to Sri Lanka from United States of America last morning. His arrival follows the victory of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), backed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, at last Saturday's Local Government Election 2018.
Former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa responding told the media said that he is yet undecided on coming into active politics. Asked if he would accept the position of Prime Minister if offered by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Rajapaksa said that he cannot accept such a position as he holds US citizenship.
Am I supposed to become the Prime Minister of a government like this, Rajapaksa said in lighter vein.
Further questioned on his role in the present political scenario, Rajapaksa said; I have no role to play. I am just the former Secretary of Defence. According to sources, Rajapaksa returned to Sri Lanka from the United States via Dubai. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa extended his wishes to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna on its victory at the LG polls 2018.
People have spoken and the message is clear. The people cannot be fooled all the time. My heartfelt gratitude goes to all Sri Lankans who braved against all odds to cast their ballot for our Motherland. Rajapaksa said in a Twitter and Facebook message.

Haycarb records turnover of Rs10.9 bn
Haycarb PLC, the Sri Lankan multinational of Hayleys PLC reported revenue of Rs. 10.9 billion and profit before tax of Rs. 564 million for 9 months ending December 31, 2017. The profit after tax stood at Rs 473 million.
Haycarb PLC Managing Director Rajitha Kariyawasan said that the raw material shortages and resulting high prices continued to impact the bottom line adversely in Q3 of 2017/18. The deterioration of charcoal availability in Sri Lanka, India and Thailand driven by unfavourable weather conditions, resulted in significant increases of cost of manufacture in Sri Lanka and Thailand.
On the other hand, even though the raw material availability continued to recover in Indonesia during the period under review, the price pressure did not ease due to the high level of demand attributable to shortages of charcoal in other locations. In this situation the company has made significant efforts to revise prices of activated carbon in consecutive occasions through discussions with its valued customers. However, the lagging effect and the inability to pass the full impact of the price increase has resulted in lower margins compared to last year.
Kariyawasan stated that in this challenging environment, noteworthy savings were generated through increased efficiencies and cost reductions obtained via manufacturing processes and supply chain through lean projects.
He further said, the companys initiatives to acquire new customer accounts and market segments backed by a robust product development platform have also shown positive results and added to the bottom line.

Cumulative operating profit for the first nine months of the FY18 stood at Rs.2.9 billion; a YoY decline of 10.8%.
Our double-digit growth in consolidated revenue is preliminary drove by healthcare and mobility sectors. Despite consolidated revenue growth, our Bangladesh consumer business, pharmaceutical distribution, leisure and travel segments are all facing margin challenges resulting in reduced group earnings. Domestic consumer demand, mainly in the rural sector, remains soft impacted by higher headline inflation, poor climatic conditions persisting in parts of the country, lower levels of inward remittances and the VAT increase, Chief Executive Officer, Steven Enderby.
While recognising the pressures this exerts on operating profits we continue to invest in expanding our portfolio of consumer products both here and in Bangladesh, developing our digital footprint and driving profit improvement in our home and personal care business.

Most successful left-arm bowler in Test history
Herath returns home with a world record under his belt
It was business as usual for Sri Lankas leading spinner Rangana Herath who arrived home after helping his team win the two-Test series in Bangladesh 1-0 and with it also achieving a personal milestone of becoming the most successful left-arm bowler in Test history.
When you play cricket you dont expect those kinds of success but to reach the milestone is a big achievement, said Herath on his arrival yesterday.
The veteran spinner who has become Sri Lankas match-winner in Test cricket since the retirement of Muthiah Muralitharan eight years ago not only bowled his team to a series clinching win in the second Test at Dhaka but by taking four wickets for 49 runs in the second innings he took his tally of Test wickets to 415, one more than Pakistans left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram to become the most successful left-arm bowler in this format.
As a left-arm bowler when you reach the higher level those are the things that you can achieve but apart from that the most important thing is winning the game. I am happy with my achievement but much happy that it came with winning the Test and the series, said Herath.
I have to mention a few people who have made it possible for me to achieve it especially the coaches, family friends and Sri Lanka Cricket. Without their help I wouldnt have done it. I thank everyone who has been behind me throughout my career, he said.
Herath said that Chandika Hathurusingha coming as head coach has certainly lifted the playing standards of the team.
We have a good set up and especially with Hathu now we have a good environment. The knowledge he has he knows how to share it with the players and get the best out of them. Hathu and the coaching staff have done a lot of things so far. I know Hathu very well for the last 18 years from 1998 and I know how capable he is as a coach, said Herath.
Mentally the confidence has gone high in the team and we need to continue with the performances and the mentality. In the current environment we can hopefully do that, he said.
Herath is not getting any younger by the day he is 39 and is not looking too far ahead in his career which has been restricted to playing Test cricket only.
As I have always said I dont have big plans. I always concentrate on what my next series is. At the moment I am only concerned about the West Indies tour, Herath said. Sri Lanka are due to tour West Indies for a three-Test series in May.
With Herath nearing the end of a remarkable career the series in Bangladesh produced two promising spinners who are expected to take over the mantle once he retires.
One of them is off-spinner Akila Dananjaya who made a dream debut at Dhaka by capturing eight wickets in the match that included five wickets in the second innings.
Dananjaya was fantastic playing his first Test and taking eight wickets. I can see a big future for him and better performances from him in the future. He is not new for us because he has played in the T20 World Cup and ODI cricket and has been around as an off spinner. He couldnt get a chance to play Test cricket because of Dilruwan Perera. Finally when he got the chance he showed what he can do, said Herath.
Of the other spinner Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman, Herath said, Sandakan still needs to improve his bowling to get to where he should be. Akila was preferred because he has more control which is what Sandakan needs to improve on.
Suranga Lakmal, Dilruwan Perera, Roshen Silva and Lahiru Gamage who were part of the Test squad were the other Lankan cricketers who returned with Herath yesterday.

HNB installs 600th smart self service machine
HNB announced its expansion to its cash withdrawal and deposit touch-points, providing customers with more convenience to make cash withdrawals and deposits.
HNB recently commissioned its 600th Smart Self Service Machine (SSSM) at Kavitas Store, Ratnapura. With this expansion, the Bank has now effectively increased its cash touch-points extensively.
HNBs head of card centre and electronic delivery channels, Mangala P. Wickramasinghe, said At HNB, we are committed to placing customers at the heart of the banking experience. While we have seen increased usage of online banking and mobile payments, we also understand some of our customers do have cash needs and our physical banking touch-points remain an important part of our network to fulfill these needs. Over the years, through our strategic partnerships, we have increased our presence across Sri Lanka to make banking even more convenient for our customers.
In keeping with the banks recent efforts to expand its scope of technologically enhanced services, HNB has been driving progressive improvements into its SSSM network.
Having successfully implemented the very first cash recycling machine in the island, the Bank has incorporated cashless payments plus direct deposits to HNB Accounts, through its customer deposit machines (CDM). Even non- HNB customers could make utility payments through the CDMs, most of which are on a real-time basis.
As the largest payee aggregator in the banking industry, HNB has a portfolio of more than 80 plus registered payee partners from a range of diverse industries such as telecommunications, insurance, education and asset management. The collective needs of these partners are served by the banks state of the art payee system.
The partnership with Lanka Clear National Payment Switch has also extended all banking services which were limited to HNB customers previously, to a wider banking population. At a reasonable cost, HNB's ATM services could be accessed by customers of several other banks which are partners of Lanka Pay.
The tie-up has made possible for HNB to serve its customers plus those of certain designated banks as well as Sri Lanka's unbanked population, through various cash and non-cash related services.

ICCSL and NHRDC to host joint discussion forum
International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) together with National Human Resource Development Council (NHRDC) will be hosting a joint discussion forum where the key note presentation will be delivered by Jrn Rohde, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka.
The Ambassador will be presenting on the Germanys dual Vocational Training System: a model for other countries. This forum will be held at the Cinema Lounge, BMICH on February 14, 2018.
The German vocational education and training system, also referred to as the dual training system, is recognized internationally due to its combination of training embedded in a real-life work environment.
The dual vocational training system is firmly established in the German education system. The primary characteristic of the dual system is cooperation between organizations, on one hand, and publicly funded vocational colleges, on the other. This cooperation is regulated by laws and regulations.
Trainees who undertake this dual system spend part of each week at a vocational college and the other part at companies ensuring the industrial training and exposure. This dual training usually lasts for two  three and half years.
In Germany, about 50 percent of all school leavers go through vocational training provided by business organizations which consider that the dual system is the best way to acquire skilled group of employees who will be assets and key drivers in an organization.
In Sri Lanka, similar model has been practiced following the German dual training system. National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and the Ceylon German Technical Training Institute (CGTTI) follow the same principle of training while following theoretical learning which provide the framework for better employable recruits.
The key note presentation will be followed by a panel discussion which will be moderated by Dinesh Weerakkody, Chairman of ICC Sri Lanka. Panelist will be distinguished members of the business community.
They will share their expertise in this area while addressing how Sri Lank could also benefit from such a dual training system. Ranjith Pandithage, Chairman of DIMO Lanka, Shivani Hegde, Managing Director, Nestle Lanka PLC and Prof. Kapila Perera, Vice Chancellor of the University of Moratuwa will participate in the panel discussion.

Ice Cricket 2018: Zaheer Khan, Shahid Afridi thrilled with new experience
Cricket is a sport of various formats. Test, One-Day International and Twenty20 cricket. The newest entrant in the world of cricket is Ice Cricket Challenge, which was played in the Swiss alps.
Modern greats faced off for two T20 matches in the resort town of St Moritz in temperatures below zero degrees. The matches were played on a frozen, snow-covered lake. An artificial turf carpet was placed in the center to use as a pitch.
The two teams were captained by Virender Sehwag and Shahid Afridi. And the participants included Mahela Jayawardene, Mike Hussey, Zaheer Khan, Lasith Malinga, Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis, Shoaib Akthar among others.
Afridis Royals defeated Sehwags team in both the matches to complete a 2-0 whitewash.
It was a unique experience for the yesteryear stars and they want to see more of it.
Its a beautiful place and Its a very new experience, former Indian pacer Zaheer told Sports Tak. Its something that we have never seen. All the players are loving the experience.
Its a terrific experience, playing in the snow, said former Australian cricketer Hussey. I loved the experience and would love to comeback.
The tournament was also an opportunity for the former players to share the dressing room with their former rivals and relive the old memories, but the event didnt lack the feel of an international match.
A professional player will always be competitive. The focus is on winning the matches, added Zaheer.
There was a big crowd and they got their moneys worth as the matches were pretty interesting, said former Pakistan fast bowler Akhtar. There were big sixes, fours and wickets. So everything was there.
The cricket we witnessed was very competitive, said former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq.
The tournament was extra special for fans from India and Pakistan, who are starved of international cricket between the two neighbours.
India and Pakistan are not playing enough international cricket, so ice cricket is compensating for it, told former Pakistan captain Afridi.
We can see cricket fans are present here from all over the world and the presence of Indian and Pakistan cricket stars have brought them to ice cricket.
The format is crickets entry into the world of winter sports and players feel it can help popularise cricket in other European nations or help the game become a part of Winter Olympics.
Ice cricket is a terrific idea and I hope ICC will look into it. Hope we will get to see international matches on ice in future, said Razzaq.
It has been a very successful initiative and can be used to popularise cricket in other countries which receive snow.
It will be a great move to include cricket in Olympics, said Hussey. T20 will be a good format. Short and sharp and also very entertaining.
In the first match skipper Sehwag struck a quick-fire 62 to set a target of 165 for Afridis XI to win the match. Former Pakistan all-rounder Abdul Razzaq returned match figures 4/18 from 4 overs.
In reply, Owais Shah hammered an unbeaten 74-run knock to single-handedly win the match for the Royals.
In the second match, Jacques Kallis struck an unbeaten 90 as Royals defeated Sehwags Palace Diamonds by eight wickets. Sehwags XI put up a formidable score of 205/5 in 20 overs that Afridis XI chased down with 20 deliveries to spare.
The Diamonds once again batted first and Andrew Symonds unbeaten 67 and a late attack by Mohammad Kaif (57) helped the Diamonds reach 205. Abdur Razzaq was once again the most successful bowler with three wickets while Daniel Vettori and Grant Elliot chipped in with a wicket each.
Chasing 206, Kallis topped it all with a brilliant 90 off just 37 deliveries. During his big knock, Kallis hit 13 boundaries and four sixes. Along with him, man of the series - Owais Shah stepped up once more with a quick-fire 43. - Indiatoday

Improving productivity way  forward for Sri Lanka
Improving productivity by way of increasing physical capital, human capital, natural capital and technology are key components for economic development.
Therefore, getting necessary and sufficient investment in those areas by local and foreign investors are crucial said N. S. Cooray, Professor of economics and associate dean, International University of Japan.
For Sri Lanka to move to the next level (modern nation state) it needs to have better state-of-the-art technology and sciences from the west. However Sri Lanka should also maintain its culture and identity as an Asian nation.
Creating a stable government with proper rule of law, better governance with very well thought-out stable economic policy package will attract more investors.
Material well-being of Sri Lankans depends on the ability to produce more. This ability depends on the productivity and resource availability.
He said that there are many things we Sri Lankans can learn from Japan.
Sri Lankans very often make policies without looking at full cost and benefits in the long-run, which include, economic, social and environmental. Making decision without consultation with all the stake holders, opposition parties and civil society groups is a must which is not being done. This will result in policy backsliding when opposition comes to power. It is also important to inform policy decisions in advance providing time for firms and consumers to plan their future action.
The decision made hastily is not accepted by the society. Banning polythene recently is a concrete example, even though it is good decision in correct direction. Too much politicizing of economic decision is also nonconductive for the country. Of course we should understand that politician donate short run e decision making while economists dominate in the long-run.
Commenting on the International University of Japan (IUJ) he said that it is Japans oldest English-based graduate school which was founded in 1982, with 100% of its regular courses offered in English.
This is with the goal of preparing leaders who can contribute to the practical resolution of global problems facing the world. Almost all of the faculty members earned their doctoral degrees (Ph.D.) at the best-known schools in the US and Europe.
This university is truly international and unique with about 90% of foreign students who are coming from all over the world.
There are about 70 Sri Lankan students have graduated from IUJ, many of them are government servants.
Many of them have received scholarships from the Japanese Grant Aid for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) programme.
The main objective of the programme is to support human resource development of the Japanese grant aid recipient countries.
In 2016 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by the University Grants Commission and International University of Japan. Under this MOU there are co-sponsoring Scholarships for academics and administrative staff of the universities to complete their postgraduate studies at IUJ.
Five faculty members from the University of Colombo, Open University and University of Rajarata visited IUJ last September to pursue doctoral and master level degrees.
There are two Sri Lankan professors at IUJ, only university in Japan to have two Sri Lankan professors. IUJ has many links with Sri Lankan universities and we look forward to closely working with Sri Lankan academics and academic institutions.

Indian brain drain to Gulf reversing
For decades, millions of Indians emigrated to the Middle East to make money. Now many of them are investing their profits back home, encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's overhaul of the economy.
Several prominent businessmen in the United Arab Emirates -- home to the world's largest Indian diaspora -- have committed billions to India in the past three years. Modi's business-friendly policies are encouraging others.
"We've always been hesitant to invest in India just because the bureaucracy was too much and corruption was too much," said Binay Shetty, CEO of BRS Ventures. "But when the new government came in, they started changing this and we took a view that we wanted to expand," he told CNNMoney.
Shetty's father left India in 1973 for the UAE, where he first worked as a medical supplies salesman. Two years later, he launched a clinic and distribution company in Abu Dhabi, eventually building a network of hospitals across the UAE. The company, NMC Health (NMHLY), listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2012 and is now worth $8.5 billion.
BRS Ventures wants to replicate that success in India. It acquired several hospitals over the past few years with 1,000 beds in total. Shetty's aim is to add at least another 4,000 beds over the next five years.
"The target is to become one of the largest hospital groups in India," he said. The company is also looking towards India for other sectors it operates in, including pharmaceuticals, education and financial services. It plans to invest $300 million over the next two years.
India plans free healthcare for 500 million
Prime Minister Modi is guest of honor at the World Government Summit in Dubai, starting Sunday. Since taking office in 2014, he has pledged to boost India's growth and slash the country's notorious red tape.
He's had mixed results with the former, but recent moves to relax retail restrictions and overhaul the tax system have cheered foreign investors.
India jumped 30 spots in the World Bank's ease of doing business ranking released last November. Some analysts have questioned the reliability of the ranking, but Modi and his government have touted it as a ringing endorsement of their policies.
Sudesh Aggarwal, a Dubai-based Indian businessman who sits on the board of the UAE Business Leaders Forum, said the World Bank's seal of approval has boosted investor sentiment.
The forum says 100 expat Indians have pooled $1 billion to invest in India.
They are open to investing in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, education, solar power and infrastructure, Aggarwal told CNNMoney, adding that the group is looking to "join hands" with state governments to work on specific projects.
"The question is what the state governments want for their states, we work according to that," he said.
Several other companies started by Indians based in the UAE are also expanding their footprint back home.
The affection is mutual, and with good reason. More than 3 million Indians live in the UAE, according to the United Nations. (Only Mexicans in the United States constitute a larger immigrant population between two countries.) The UAE accounts for the largest proportion of remittances sent to India, estimated at almost $13 billion in 2016.
Modi's visit in 2015 was the first by an Indian prime minister to visit the Gulf state in 34 years. The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan, has visited India twice since then. State money is flowing east, too. The UAE government has committed $75 billion towards developing Indian infrastructure, with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Dubai port operator DP World inking deals worth $1 billion and $3 billion respectively in recent months.
And Emirates Airline just announced an agreement with Indian state Andhra Pradeshto help develop its aviation sector.
There's probably a lot more deals to come.
"We've really scratched the surface," said Suri. "This is a very capital rich country, and as returns weaken in Western markets, India -- with its combination of growth, scale and stability -- is a very attractive opportunity."

Law and order maintained due to combined efforts: Police Spokesman
Over 50,000 candidates contested the Local Government elections and of them only around 85 were involved in election related incidents. This is highly commendable, said Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara.
He said if not for their support and cooperation, this election would not have been so peaceful. Maintaining law and order was possible mainly due to the support of the police and the support rendered by the media in taking the message of the police to the people.
Convening a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the Police Media Spokesman said: The LG elections concluded without any major incident or violence, which is a great achievement. When we announced the number of arrests we made regularly and the regulations that were in place for the election, it was the media that most effectively took this message to the people.
On our part, we arrested those who violated election laws immediately and this too sent a message to the candidates and their supporters that the police would not be lenient and candidates would lose their opportunity to vote and even lose their seats if they commit any wrong. Even if candidates or their supporters put up posters, which were banned at this election, we had special teams deployed to take them down immediately the next moment, which eventually sent a message to them that it was a futile effort and a waste of money.
Similarly, if anyone was seen pasting posters, they were immediately arrested and produced in court. These measures and the combined efforts of the police, candidates and the media contributed to making this election violence-free and peaceful.
According to the Police Spokesman, 692 complaints were received during the election period, while the majority of these complaints were related to threatening and verbal abuse, which amounted to 174. Around 138 suspects were arrested in relation to these complaints and among them were 28 candidates.
Meanwhile, on the day of the elections, 126 complaints were received and of them 53 complaints were related to verbal threats and abuse. The number of arrests made based on these complaints was 17 while there were four suspects among them.
The day after the elections (Sunday), 45 complaints were received by the police while 25 of them were related to verbal threats. In connection to these complaints, the police arrested 10 persons and among them were four candidates.
Further, during the period from February 9 to 11, police received 869 complaints and 162 arrests were made in relation to these complaints. Among them were 37 candidates.
In total, around 678 arrests were made during the election period while there were around 85 candidates among those arrested.
However, during this election period, there were no serious incidents reported while most of the complaints were regarding verbal altercations and most of the arrested were released on bail. However, some of them are facing legal measures and in the event they are found guilty of any serious offence, these candidates could lose their seat even if they had won, the Police Spokesman said.

A female lawyer was ambushed and assaulted inside the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court Complex as she arrived to give evidence in a criminal case.
The victim, Attorney-at-Law Hafsa Alif, was seen being physically assaulted by her ex-husband, Dr. Shazli Mawjooth, after he allegedly threatened to assault her if she proceeded to try and give evidence in court.
Alif made a detailed complaint to police post at the Magistrates Court complex describing the incident and naming her attacker and notified the acting magistrate who was presiding in court that day. Shortly after the assault, Alif was thereafter examined by the Judicial Medical Officer who recorded her injuries from the attack. Despite the presence of several witnesses and ample evidence, police did not arrest the attacker according to sources.
Yesterday, attorneys for the victim notified the permanent Magistrate of the incident by way of a motion, and court ordered that the matter be taken up in ten days from now, on February 23rd.
Assault or intimidation of a victim of crime or a witness in connection with their involvement in a judicial matter is a cognizable offence. According to special witness and victim protection legislation passed in 2015, suspects of such crimes are to wherever possible be denied bail until at least the conclusion of the judicial proceedings.
The punishment on conviction for such an assault is up to seven years imprisonment, legal sources said.
The inaction on the part of the authorities has caused particular alarm in legal and civil society. Ms. Hafsa Ali is the granddaughter of senior UPFA Minister A.H.M. Fowzie, and a close relative of mayoral candidate Azath Sally, and an heir to a wealthy business family.

MR calls for General Election
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday urged the government to go for a General Election in order to establish a strong government.
He also said that that the SLPP has no intention of grabbing power in Parliament.
Rajapaksa added that the last Local Government election results however has proved that the government has no mandate as its policies have been rejected by the people.
Therefore, I insist the government hold a general election for the people to elect their government, Rajapaksa said.
He made these observations during a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party head office at Jayanthipura, Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla yesterday.
He also said that the SLPPs victory was historic since so far not a single political party in Opposition, had defeated a governing party at a Local Government election.
He also said that although the his group obtained 96 seats in Parliament at the last General Election, it was not given the Opposition Leaders post nor that of the Chief Opposition Whip in the House.
Rajapaksa added that this is a time for the House to consider those facts as well.
He also said that the SLPP has won more than 232 Local Government institutions and the number of members are very high due the new governments decision to increase the number from 4000 members to 8000 members. Responding to a query made by a journalist as to what the new party would do to allay the corruption allegations being levelled against it, former President Rajapaksa said that their duties would be monitored more than ever before.
He also said that the Good Governance government reversed the momentum of development that the previous government had maintained, and urged for the recommencement of such devlopment activities.
When queried by a media personnel if the 19th Amedment to the Constitution would permit the dissolution of Parliament, Rajapaksa said that his group would lend its support if the government moved to amend the section.
He also pointed out that the governments debt to GDP ratio was 103 percent when he took over the government and he brought it down to 75 percent.
He added that during that period there was tangible economic development in the country. He added that after the Good Governance Government was elected the loans had been taken but no development had taken place.
The price of a barrel of oil in the world market was USD 138 when Good Governance was elected, Rajapaksa said. But it dropped to USD 27 during this regime. What happened to that profit

Newcastle rock Manchester United, Liverpool sink Saints
London, Sunday: Matt Ritchie condemned Manchester United to a shock 1-0 defeat at struggling Newcastle, while Liverpool cemented their top four place with a 2-0 win over Southampton on Sunday.
Uniteds second defeat in their last three Premier League games leaves them 16 points behind leaders Manchester City.
Jose Mourinhos second placed side, beaten by Tottenham in their last away game, were rarely at their best at St James Park and paid the price in the 65th minute.
United defender Chris Smalling was booked for needlessly diving inside his own half and from the resulting Jonjo Shelvey free-kick, Dwight Gayle latched onto a header and played a backheel towards Ritchie.
His run was completely untracked by Uniteds sloppy defence and the Newcastle winger fired low past David De Gea. Mourinho responded by pulling off Paul Pogba after another underwhelming display from the France midfielder.
And United should have equalised soon after, but when Newcastle failed to clear a corner, Anthony Martial saw two shots blocked on the line by Gayle.
Newcastle fought like animals, I hope they take that as a compliment. The gods of football were on their side, Mourinho said.
It wasnt going to happen for us today. Newcastle gave what they have, thats a beautiful thing in football.
We made a defensive mistake and when they are in front they had only one thing in mind and gave their lives to keep a clean sheet.
Newcastle had kicked off in the relegation zone, but a first win in five league games -- their first success against United since 2013 -- lifts them to 13th place.
At St Marys, Liverpool moved above Tottenham into third place as goals from Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah killed off lowly Southampton.
Jurgen Klopps side, who featured former defender Virgil van Dijk on his first return to the club he left in January, took a sixth minute lead when Brazil forward Firmino netted for the 20th time this season.
Saints defender Wesley Hoedt made a hash of dealing with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlains pass, allowing Salah to tee up Firmino for a clinical finish.
Liverpool increased their lead in the 42nd minute when Firmino turned provider for Salah with a fine flicked pass that the Egypt forward slotted home for his 29th club goal of a dream first season with the Reds.
Klopps men are four points clear of fifth placed Chelsea, who face West Bromwich Albion on Monday, as the battle hots up to qualify for the Champions League via a top four finish.
It was not a brilliant performance. It was difficult circumstances with the wind. We did the job. That is very important, Klopp said.
We scored early, got the second goal in the right moment and then controlled the game.
We want to finish the season top four and we need the points.
Southampton are third bottom following their first defeat in five league matches.
Huddersfield climbed out of the relegation zone after a 4-1 win against Bournemouth at the John Smiths Stadium.
David Wagners team took a seventh-minute lead as Alex Pritchard collected Steve Mounies pass and drilled in his first Huddersfield goal since his January move from Norwich. Junior Stanislas equalised for Bournemouth with a cool finish from Ryan Frasers cross seven minutes later.
But Benin striker Mounie restored Huddersfields advantage with a 27th-minute header and Steve Cooks own goal put the hosts in control in the 66th minute.
Rajiv van La Parra converted a stoppage-time penalty to lift Huddersfield out of the drop zone.
Huddersfields first league win in nine matches was marred by an injury to Australia midfielder Aaron Mooy, who was stretchered off with a knee problem 15 minutes from time. AFP

Nitty-gritty of Securities Exchange Act
Continued from February 8
RESPONSIBILITIES OF AUDITORS  MARKET INSTITUTIONS
Another important provision which has been included, is found at section 69 of the proposed Bill, which imposes an obligation on an Auditor of a Market Institution to inform the respective Board of Directors, with a copy to the Commission, in instances where; (a) any matter which, in his opinion, adversely affects or may adversely affect the financial position of the market institution, to a material extent; (b) any matter which, in his opinion, constitutes or may constitute a breach of any provision of this Act, regulations, rules or directives made thereunder or an offence involving fraud or dishonesty affecting the financial stability of the market institution to a material extent; or (c) any irregularity that has or may have a material effect on the accounts of the market institution, including any irregularity that adversely affects or may adversely affect, the funds or property of investors in securities.
ISSUE OF SECURITIES
Part III of the Act pertains to (a) the regulation of the issue of securities; (b) the disclosure of financial information by listed public companies; (c) the requirements for Auditors to disclose financial irregularities; (d) to license market intermediaries and to register their representatives and (e) to protect clients.
TRADE IN SECURITIES
The Chapter on Trade in securities categorically stipulates that a corporate entity listed or unlisted shall not make a public offer of securities either directly or through a third party by way of a prospectus or similar document, unless approved by the Commission, and thereby extends the regulation of the SEC to all public offers of securities to raise funds.
Section 81 provides that where it appears to the Commission that a listed public company has contravened or failed to comply with any provision of the Act, regulations, rules or directives or has furnished the Commission with information that is false, inaccurate or misleading, the Commission may issue a directive to the listed public company (a) to cease and desist from any contravention of this Act, regulations, rules or directives made thereunder; (b) to do or refrain from doing any matter as specified under this Act, regulations, rules or directives made thereunder; or (c) to carry out any other matter that the Commission considers necessary in the exercise of its powers under this Act, regulations, rules or directives made thereunder. It is also a punishable offence for a listed company to submit false information to any market institution.
The Commission will also be empowered to issue Stop Orders or Interim Orders where there is imminent violation of the stipulated requirements.
There is also a requirement that Directors and Chief Executive Officers of listed Public Companies must comply with the fit and proper criteria specified by the Commission or by the Rules of the Exchange.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF AUDITORS  LISTED COMPANIES
There is also important new provision imposing duties upon Auditors of Listed Companies, similar to the provisions identified above in respect of Market Institutions, to report such instances firstly to the Audit Committee, and if no rectification is made within two weeks to the Board with further provision to escalate the same to the Commission / the relevant Exchange where there is non-compliance. The Commission is also empowered to require the Auditor to submit such additional information, enlarge the scope of the Audit etc.
MARKET INTERMEDIARIES
Market Intermediaries have been defined to include any person licensed under the Act as a credit rating agency, derivatives broker, financial planner, investment analyst, investment manager, managing company, margin provider, market maker, placement agent, stock broker, or any other person who undertakes similar activity and described by rules for the purpose of issuing such licence by the Commission, and Chapter 2 of Part III seeks to regulate Market Intermediaries.
As in the case of Market Institutions, the proposed Act details a comprehensive set of governance requirements to be satisfied before being licenced as a Market Intermediary and also contains similar continuing governance requirements.
These governance measures include stringent requirements for directors, the chief executive officer, managers or controller of a Market Intermediary, and include grounds for refusal of a license on the basis that any of the said officers have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty; or the conviction of which involved a finding that he acted fraudulently or dishonestly; has been subjected to any administrative action taken by the Commission; has been convicted or has been compounded of an offence for which he has been charged under the Act or under the laws governing securities outside Sri Lanka; has contravened any provision made by or under any law enacted for protecting members of the public against financial loss due to dishonesty, incompetence or malpractice by persons concerned in the provision of financial services or the management of companies; has engaged in any business practices that may be deceitful or oppressive or otherwise improper or reflect discredit on its method of conducting business; has engaged in or has been associated with any other business practices or conducted itself or himself in such a way as to cast doubt on its or his competence and integrity; is an undischarged bankrupt whether within or outside Sri Lanka; the Commission has reason to believe that the applicant or any of its officers may not be able to act in the best interest of its clients having regard to their reputation, character, financial integrity and reliability; the Commission is not satisfied as to the financial standing of the applicant or the manner in which the applicants business is to be conducted; the Commission is not satisfied as to the record of past performance or expertise of the applicant etc.
The new statutory obligations of Auditors for Market Intermediaries are similar as in the case of Market Institutions, setout above.
There have been instances in the past where those who possibly should not have been issued licences to operate as Market Intermediaries, have been issued such licenses by satisfying the basic eligibility requirements, and it is expected, that moving forward, the regime of licencing would be strengthened by these new provisions.
PROTECTION OF CLIENT ASSETS
The proposed Act in Chapter 3 of Part III also includes copious provision on protection of client assets and prevention of commingling of assets by Market Intermediaries.
Important provisions are also included to bring liability upon Market Intermediaries and Registered Persons to compensate losses of clients on the basis of unreasonable recommendations, and is included as a deterrent to unreasonable / fraudulent / reckless recommendations. In this respect, it is specifically provided as a guideline that a market intermediary or registered person does not have a reasonable basis for making a recommendation to a person unless  (a) he has, for the purposes of ascertaining that the recommendation is appropriate, had regard to the information possessed by him concerning the investment objectives, financial situation and particular needs of the person is accurate and complete; and (b) he has exercised due diligence into the subject matter of the recommendation as is reasonable in all the circumstances and made the recommendations accordingly.
Consequently, it is expected that these new provisions will act as a deterrent to Market Intermediaries and Registered Persons from being truant in advising their Clients.
TRADE IN UNLISTED SECURITIES
The proposed new Act also makes provision under Part IV for formalized trading in unlisted securities, through registered Market Operators, the objectives being (a) to provide a platform through a recognized market operator for sale and purchase of unlisted securities in Sri Lanka to local and overseas investors in a transparent manner; and (b) to facilitate the disclosure of information relating to unlisted securities to local and overseas investors through a recognized market operator in a transparent manner.
MARKET MISCONDUCT
Part V of the proposed Act deals with Market Misconduct, with the stated Objects identified as (a) to prevent false trading, market rigging and market manipulation, and (b) to prevent insider trading with a view to establishing a fair, orderly and transparent securities market.
The scope of application of the relevant provisions is wide, and covers, in respect of securities, acts or omissions occurring within Sri Lanka in relation to securities of any corporate entity which is formed or is carrying on business or is listed within or outside Sri Lanka, and acts or omissions occurring outside Sri Lanka in relation to securities of any corporate entity which is formed or is carrying on business within Sri Lanka; and in respect of derivatives, acts occurring within Sri Lanka in relation to derivatives, whether traded within or outside Sri Lanka; and acts occurring outside Sri Lanka in relation to derivatives traded within Sri Lanka.
PROHIBITED CONDUCT
Sections 124 to 128 of the proposed Act set out the prohibited conduct, the contravention of any one of them would amount to an offence and upon conviction punishable with a fine of not less than Rs. 10 Million or to imprisonment of either description not exceeding ten years or to both such fine and imprisonment.
The prohibited conduct includes, (a) false trading and market rigging transactions (pumping and dumping), (b) market manipulation (transactions which artificially raise, lower or peg, fix, maintain or stabilize the price or volume of securities, for the purpose of inducing other persons to trade), (c) making statements / disseminating information that is false or misleading, (d) fraudulently inducing persons to deal in securities through making false, misleading or deceptive statements or forecasts, concealment of material facts etc, and (e) the use of manipulative or deceptive devices to defraud.
INSIDER DEALING
The new Act proposes an even more comprehensive legal regime for Insider Trading, which is found in Chapter 2 of Part V under Market Misconduct.
The relevant information and the prohibited conduct have been defined.
Section 135 of the proposed new Act provides that an insider shall not whether as principal or agent in respect of any securities to which defined information relates (a) acquire or dispose of or enter into an agreement for or with a view to the acquisition or disposal of such securities; or (b) procure, directly or indirectly, an acquisition or disposal of or the entering into an agreement for or with a view to the acquisition or disposal of such securities. The provision further provides that where trading in the securities to which the defined information relates is permitted on a securities market of an exchange, the insider shall not directly or indirectly communicate the information referred to or cause such information to be communicated to another person, if the insider knows or could reasonably be expected to know that the other person would or would tend to (a) acquire, dispose of or enter into an agreement with a view to the acquisition or disposal of any securities to which the defined relates; or (b) procure a third person to acquire, dispose of or enter into an agreement with a view to the acquisition or disposal of any securities to which the defined information relates.
The offence of insider dealing is triable before the relevant High Court and brings with it a punishment in the form of a fine of not less than Rs. 10 Million or to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding ten years or to both such fine and imprisonment.
There is also provision for parity of Information as a defence, for example in the case of listed securities where information came into the possession of the person communicating the information solely as a result of it being made known in a manner likely to make it generally available or if the other party knew or could reasonably be expected to have known the information before the information was communicated.
There is further specific provision enabling / not curtailing the rights of persons who suffer loss as a result of the prohibited conduct, from instituting civil proceedings to recover losses or damages caused.

Online abuse often comes from peoples social circles  Microsoft study
On Tuesday (6), Safer Internet Day 2018, Microsoft released its second annual Digital Civility Index (DCI) report study based on a survey completed in June 2017 to gauge the attitudes and perceptions of teens (ages 13-17) and adults (ages 18-74) in 23 countries about the state of digital civility today.
The survey asked questions such as, which online risks have you and your close circle experienced, when and how often have the risks occurred, and what consequences and actions were taken  and it measured respondents lifetime exposure to 20 online risks across four areas: reputational, behavioral, sexual and personal/intrusive.
According to the study DCI, targets of online risks often named people they knew as perpetrators. For the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of six in 10 respondents (5361 percent) said they had some familiarity with their online abusers. Less than a third (29 percent) said they knew the perpetrator personally: 15 percent responded that the perpetrator was a friend or a family member, while nearly one in five six (14 percent) said the perpetrator was an acquaintance.
The respondents exposure to online risks among individuals, family or friends was, on average, lower than the rest of world. Millennials (ages 18-34) had the highest lifetime exposure to online risks as measured by DCI the study (65 percent) while Baby Boomers (ages 50-74) reported the highest level of civil behavior or lowest DCI score (4557 percent).
The consequences from online risks (i.e. unwanted contact, hoaxes/fraud/scams, being treated meanly, receiving unwanted sexting messages, trolling, etc.) were higher for females and teens than males and adults.
Similar to the previous Last year, Microsoft is again encouraging challenged people worldwide to embrace digital civility, and to treat each other with respect and dignity online by participating in Microsofts Digital Civility Challenge. The challenge calls on people to commit daily to four common-sense guidelineslive the Golden Rule, respect differences, pause before replying and stand up for yourself and othersfor safer, healthier online interactions.
With the availability of the DCI report, Microsoft hopes policymakers, companies, and consumers will consider the need for a safer, more respectful internet and leverage the evidentiary base for a global push toward digital civility.
Microsoft is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Parliament cannot be dissolved before Four and half years - Jayampathy
Parliament cannot be dissolved before four and half years unless a two thirds majority passes a resolution as per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Constitutional Lawyer and UNP MP Dr. Jayampathy Wickramarathne said.
Speaking on the same lines JVP MP Vijitha Herath said not even President Maithripala Sirisena could dissolve Parliament before February 2020 without a two thirds majority support. They made this observation in response to the call made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to immediately dissolve Parliament and go for a snap election.
What was concluded was an election for Local Government Authorities. Parliament was elected for a term of 5 years.
There is no tradition or precedence to say that Parliament should be dissolved when the incumbent Government suffers a loss at Local Government elections. It is not a valid claim, Wickramaratne pointed out.
He however stressed that the two main parties in the Government must take note of the election results, learn from the mistakes they have made and do a course correction.
It can be done and should be done, he added.
Commenting on the election results, Wickramaratne emphasized that the combined vote of the parties that are opposed to pro-Rajapaksa group still have a clear majority. Former President Rajapaksa has got only 44.65 percent of the national vote. He cannot claim a landslide victory. His vote percentage at the last Presidential Election was 47.58 percent. The combined vote of the parties that are opposed to him is nearly 55 percent, he said.
Speaking on the same lines, MP Herath said the pro-Mahinda group has only bagged 4.9 million votes, whereas the UNP, UPFA, SLFP, TNA, JVP and the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by Mano Ganesan which contested separately, at the LG elections, bagged a total of 6.1 million votes.
They campaigned together against Rajapaksa at the 2015 elections. Therefore, the argument that he has the majority support is not true, he stated.
Asked about former President Rajapaksas call to hand him over the Opposition Leader post, MP Wickramarathne said; There are only six recognised parties in Parliament, namely the UNP, UPFA, JVP, TNA, EPDP and SLMC. The UPFA is a party in the Government. The so called Joint Opposition (JO) is not an official party as far as Parliament is concerned. The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Party (SLPP) is a party outside Parliament. It was recognised as a party for the Local Governemnt elections, but it did not contest at the last Parliamentary elections. Parliament goes by the election results of August 2015. Therefore, the JO cannot rightfully claim the Opposition Leader post, he commented.
MP Herath, buttressing this argument, said the UPFA members now in the Government must switch sides to the Opposition, if the party wants to claim the Opposition Leaders post.
They cannot represent both the sides in Parliament. Even if the JO group withdraws from the UPFA and sits as an independent group, they will not qualify to have the Opposition Leader post as per the Parliament Standing Orders and traditions, he added.

PAYable signs 2000 new merchants  in two months with VISA promotion
PAYable revolutionized cashless mobile payments in 2016, when it first entered the market with a mission to empower Sri Lankas micro, small and medium enterprises with the ability to accept electronic payments at a very low cost. The company recently partnered with VISA Inc. on an island wide promotion, signing on an impressive 2000 merchants over a period of two months.
In just over a year, the company helped the number of merchants accepting card payments in Sri Lanka grow by 30% and directly facilitated transactions in excess of Rs 1.5 Billion. In December 2017 PAYable marked a record month, with transaction volumes doubling to 2000 a day.
The VISA promotion was conducted in three stages, covering Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kandy, Gampaha, Matara, Ratnapura, Kurunegala, Jaffna and Nuwara Eliya. The first two stages saw the PAYable sales team visit a total of 41 towns, while another 21 towns were covered in the Nuwara Eliya stage of the promotion.
The team spoke to merchants, explaining the benefits of accepting cashless payments and how the ability to pay via credit and debit cards benefits customers. The promo was also designed to highlight PAYables low-cost model and easily usable interface which is available in English, Sinhala and Tamil and usable anywhere in Sri Lanka.
The merchants were resoundingly positive in their feedback, noting that both Sri Lankans and tourists now prefer to make their payments via card. For merchants that work seasonally, PAYables lack of monthly charges made it a favourable option. Moreover, the inbuilt automatic reconciliation feature on PAYable eliminates the worry of maintaining hard copies of receipts as all the transactions are recorded on the application.
Our first partnership with VISA was a definite success and we are excited about our plans to empower more merchants around Sri Lanka in the second quarter of 2018, said Yohan Wijesiriwardane, CEO and Co-founder, PAYable. The interest we saw around the country when we ran the promotion was amazing and we are extremely grateful to VISA for making it possible for us to execute a promotion of this calibre and look forward to more joint projects going forward.
Anthony Watson, Visas Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives, noted that the promotions success has set the course for more partnerships in the future. Findings from Visas recent payment attitude survey in Sri Lanka revealed that one out of two Sri Lankans are keen to adopt a form of digital payment solutions. This clearly validates the growing appetite for cashless payments in Sri Lanka.
The high number of new merchants attained by the PAYable team in the first two months further reinforces the potential for digital payments and cards in particular across Sri Lanka in times to come.

President, PM will march forward with unity: Minister Senaratne
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have agreed to march forward in unity after correcting the wrongs and mistakes of the government. They reached this agreement during discussions about the local government election results, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Issuing a special statement yesterday, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne further said the mandate received by the Yahapalana government at the January 8, 2015 Presidential election had been further strengthened by the results of the local Government election. So there was no need to change the Prime Minister or for the resignation of the government, he said.
Dr. Senaratne said according to the results of the local government election, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had received only about 45 percent of the total votes cast. It was much less than the number of votes received by the former President at the last Presidential election. But all in all, a majority of voters had cast their votes against the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna which contested under the 'Pohottuwa' symbol.
Although the former President may have entertained a dream of becoming Prime Minister after winning the local government election or getting a general election, it would not happen. Neither the SLFP nor the UNP had proposed to offer the Prime Minister's post to the former President so far. People gave a mandate to the present government in 2015 to eliminate corruption and fraud. Leaders of the Yahapalana government had taken a firm decision to carry forward this endeavour without interruption.
Referring to an alleged statement made to the media by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma to the effect that Dr Rajitha Senaratne was missing after the defeat in Beruwala, Dr. Senaratne said he had not fled to America like Alahapperuma did, but stayed back at his home. Dr. Senaratne said he would continue to assist in fulfilling the hopes and aspiration of the people in keeping with their mandate. Added to it he would take steps towards getting the President re-elected in 2020 too, he said.

Religion, reconciliation and the future
The title of this weeks article is from a discussion organised in 2013. More recently I found a report which shows anti-faith attacks in 2003-2004. Taken together we know violent religious intolerance raised its head around the period of the report, ten years later erudite panelists spoke about it and four years later the situation was not very different.
I have chosen to illustrate the comments of two of the panelist.
Javed Yusuf in his closing remarks spoke about Islamic history and the first 30 years after Prophet Muhammed and in particular about the second of caliphs visit to Jerusalem and his interaction with Bishop Sophronius, a representative of the Byzantine government, as well as a leader in the Christian Church. Umar ibn al-Khattab left Madinah, was greeted by Sophronius. Umar was given a tour of the city, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
When the time for prayer came, Sophronius invited Umar to pray inside the Church, but Umar refused. He insisted that if he prayed there, later Muslims would use it as an excuse to convert it into a mosque  thereby depriving Christendom of one of its holiest sites. Instead, Umar prayed outside the Church, where a mosque (called Masjid Umar  the Mosque of Umar) was later built. This example poignant in that the Caliph had thought through what could arise in the future on account of where he had prayed. Many such current claims and counter claims mar inter religious harmony and lead to tensions and violent outbursts of intolerance.
Violence against people and cultures
The Mosque of Umar still stands across the street from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre today.
Bishop Chickera another panelists had these comments.
Religion must never be seen as one large entity. Religion is a number of worlds, within a world.
It is vast, varied, controversial, contradictory and complex. Historically, religions have been responsible for both a great deal of harm to human kind as well as healing. During different periods in the history of human kind, religions have up and down, spreading conflict, discrimination, initiating violence against people and cultures and other religions and so on. Running parallel with this, has been the healing trend. Millions of men and women, either as individuals and or in communities, have made a positive transforming impact on life. They have been able rise above that which divides, crushes, and separates and so on. If religion is to impact in the process of reconciliation there are one or two aspects of conflict that religion must try and comprehend. Conflict recurs  whether it is personal or social. Consequently, the responsibility of religion is to respond to conflict in such a way that if there is grievance it is addressed and justice must be done. If there is potential to harm that must be reduced or eliminated, if there are lessons to be learnt, they must be learnt. And there must be growth as far as possible, of the different segments that belong to that particular society.
If any particular religion makes a claim to be a world religion, in other words, if that particular religion has a way of life that is universal, applicable across history, across the globe, relevant to all societies and cultures and people, then it must be prepared to enter the arena of public discourse. At that stage, religion cannot say  No, this is not what we say, categorically, and we will not dialog.
So being part of the public discourse then requires religion to be ready, to be critiqued, to be interpreted again and again and at times, even to be caricatured. And it is the responsibility of different religions to build resilience and spirituality and an integrity that will enable it to remain in the public discourse. And at the same time, allow itself to be subject to interpretation and critique.
Today we are leading with the anti Muslim campaign, but then over the last decades, perhaps from pre independence, post independence, wherever religions co-exist, there have been and there will be tensions. Just now the emphasis seems to be on Muslims, and small Christian groups at the receiving end. And much of the reaction is violence either visible violence or violent words. Now what do we do in circumstances like this The first is, this must be stated again and again, the rule of law must be implemented. This is common sense.
Inter-religious tensions
Parallel with the legal approach, the approach of the authorities, there must be some trust building; not some perhaps a great deal of trust building, amongst the religions. We have reached this stage of inter-religious tensions today, because moderates in all religions have failed. We have failed to simply sustain relationships of trust and friendship. Thats one area. Another area in which we have failed is to have a kind of a restrictive dialog with extremists within our respective religions.
For instance, if there are extremists within the Christian church it becomes the primary responsibility of moderates within the Christian church to address them. And to address them in terms of Christian doctrine and teachings of Christ, and so on. Similarly in Islam, similarly in Buddhism and all other religions, Hinduism included.
Now when this happens you see, you find that the gap of distrust gradually shrinks. And when that happens, something that this country needs very very urgently will then fall into place, and that is cross border solidarity building with other communities. For too long we have had one community only speak and when that community is affected. So we got to cross these borders. Buddhists must speak on behalf of Muslims. Christians must speak on behalf of Hindus. And similar the ethnic border-crossing.
It is then that religions contribute towards becoming a family. And when that strength is displayed in any democratic society, the state, no matter what its intention maybe, has to take note. And the only way that religions can speak with one voice, is if the moderates come to their senses, build trust, stand together, protect each other when the other is subject to harm. And then declare to the nation, that religions speak with one voice.

Ripple inks deal with major Middle East currency giant
A foreign exchange giant owned by Travelex billionaire Bavaguthu Shetty has adoptedcryptocurrency Ripple for its international payments, the latest major financial player to lend its backing to blockchain technology.
UAE Exchange, one of the largest in the Middle East, has signed up to the San Francisco Bitcoin rival's RippleNet networkfor cross-border payments.
Incorporating Ripples blockchain technology into our payments systems will bring customers an enhanced, new payments experience, said Promoth Manghat, CEO of UAE Exchange Group.
The early adoption of this game-changing technology allows us to offer a competitive service, as it will have an impact on the speed and cost of cross-border transactions. We are proud to deliver the future of payments with Ripple. UAE Exchange, whose billionaire owner bought Travelex in 2014, said it hasa 6.75pc share of the $575 billion global remittance market, with ambitions to take on 10pc by 2020. It has 800 branches in more than 30 countries, making itthe largest UAE-based exchange to incorporate blockchain into its daily operations.
Ripple, which has its own unit of payment called XRP, saw its popularity rise at the end of 2017 thanks tobacking from 100 banks including Japanese and Korean credit card companies.
Ripple has increasingly been adopted by payment networks and banks, including UBS and Santander for its settlement technology.
When XRP hit an all-time high of $3.84 (2.80), earlier this year, the net worth of founderChris Larsen  understood to own 5.19 billion XRP and a 17pc stake in the company  jumped to $59.9bn, a fortune larger than Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's. However a dip last week saw him slump back down the Forbes rich list.
The Ripple network, which launched in 2012, acts as a system for verifying and recording transactions of various assets including its own XRP. Rather than being used as a form of payment, Ripple's aim is tWe chose to focus on solving inefficiencies in key corridors where payment flows are significant and growing, saidDilip Rao, Ripple's global head of infrastructure.
Adding a market leader like UAE Exchange to RippleNet will bring instant, certain, low-cost payments to the millions of retail customers in the UAE who send money abroad.

Russian investigators comb jet crash site
RUSSIA: Investigators will examine on Monday numerous possible causes of one of Russias worst ever aviation accidents that saw a passenger plane carrying 71 people crash near Moscow minutes after take off, killing everyone on board.
Russias Investigative Committee said it would consider explanations including human error, technical failure and weather conditions, as the country has experienced record snowfall in recent weeks. But it did not mention the possibility of terrorism.
The Antonov An-148 plane went down in the Ramensky district on the outskirts of Moscow at 2:48 pm on Sunday after taking off from Domodedovo airport in the capital.
Sixty-five passengers and six crew members were on board, and all of them died, Russias office of transport investigations said in a statement. Three children were among the fatalities on a list published by Russian authorities.
The flight was operated by the domestic Saratov Airlines and was headed for Orsk, a city in the Ural mountains.
More than 400 people and 70 vehicles had been deployed to the crash site, the countrys emergency ministry said.
The site was enveloped in heavy snow, making it difficult to access, with emergency workers forced to park their vehicles and reach the wreckage by foot. Others used snowmobiles and drones to survey the scene.
Russian Transport Minister Maksim Sokolov said genetic expertise would be needed to help identify the victims, adding that it could take two or three months.
I felt a shock wave, Maria, a resident of a village near the crash site, told AFP.
The windows shook, she said. The transport investigations office said the plane disappeared from radar screens around four minutes after take-off.
A regional official said the aircrafts black box had been retrieved.
The Russian-made plane was reportedly seven years old and bought by Saratov Airlines from another Russian airline a year ago.
Saratov was founded in the 1930s and flies to 35 Russian cities. Its hub is Saratov Central Airport in southern Russia.
The governor of the Orenburg region, where the plane was heading, told Russian media that more than 60 people on board the plane were from the region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin offered his profound condolences to those who lost their relatives in the crash, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Putin also cancelled plans to travel to Sochi to meet with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas. Instead, the meeting will take place in Moscow.
Local media website Ural56.ru in the Orenburg region showed footage of distressed relatives at Orsk airport, where the plane had been due to land.
Andrei Odintsov, the mayor of Orsk, told Russian state television that six psychologists and four ambulances with medics were working with the families in the small airport.
Orsk is the second biggest city in the Orenburg region, near Russias border with Kazakhstan.
A crisis centre was also set up at Domodedovo, Moscows second-largest airport in terms of passenger numbers.
Russia has suffered numerous plane crashes, with airlines often operating ageing aircraft in dangerous flying conditions.
A light aircraft crashed in November in Russias far east, killing six people on board.
In December 2016 a military plane carrying Russias famed Red Army Choir crashed after taking off from the Black Sea resort of Sochi, killing all 92 people on board.
The choir had been due to give a concert to Russian troops operating in Syria.
Pilot error was blamed for that crash. In March 2016, all 62 passengers died when a FlyDubai jet crashed in bad weather during an aborted landing at Rostov-on-Don airport. - AFP

Russian whistleblower lives in fear in America
New York: Doping guru Grigory Rodchenkov has emerged from hiding, donning a disguise and reiterating that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to silence him for good.
The controversial whistleblower and former head of Moscows anti-doping laboratory says he is risking his life by exposing Russian doping secrets.
In his first televised interview since fleeing his native Russia, Rodchenkov told the American news programme 60 Minutes on Sunday night that he continues to live in fear in the United States.
Kremlin wants me to stop talking, Rodchenkov told interviewer Scott Pelley.
Since fleeing to America in November 2015, he has gone into hiding because he says Putin wants him dead -- a claim he has made several times previously.
The news magazine programme allowed Rodchenkov to wear a disguise and showed him putting on and walking around in a bulletproof vest.
(The disguise) was done for security reasons, says Rodchenkov, who dyed his hair a different colour and shaved his mustache. There is information that my life is in jeopardy and we took all necessary steps.
Rodchenkovs escape to America followed the sudden death of two senior officials from Russias anti-doping agency. There is a warrant out for his arrest back home. AFP

Rusty Serena puts on brave face after comeback defeat
Asheville: Former world number one Serena Williams said she felt on the right track despite a crushing loss in her long-awaited comeback to tennis on Sunday playing alongside big sister Venus in a Fed Cup dead rubber.
The duo, who have combined to win 22 doubles titles, were outgunned by the unheralded Dutch pairing of Lesley Kerkhove and Demi Schuurs who were playing in their first ever outing together.
The Williams lost 6-2, 6-3 with 36-year-old Serena appearing particularly slow on her feet and poor in her shot selection after more than a year away from the sport.
But she was determined to put on a brave face after the loss took some of the shine off the Americans otherwise decisive 3-1 win that booked their place in the next round against France in April.
It felt really good to be back the court. Ive been training and it was just exciting to be out there, she said.
I honestly feel better than I thought I was gonna feel, I feel like I didnt expect to play you know like that for me. So I feel like that Im on the right track.
It was Serenas first competitive match since winning her 23rd major at the 2017 Australian Open. The American star took time away from the sport to give birth to her daughter Alexis Olympia and get married, to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
Both were in attendance over the weekend, seated just behind the players box.
Serena had previously said that her path back had been full of ups and downs, crediting Venus with helping her regain her rhythm.
On Sunday she was happy with the power behind her shots even if her accuracy wasnt quite where it should be.
I didnt expect to have that much power on my serves, she said. Even though they didnt go in, its just the start, I feel like thats a very good step in the right direction.
And she hinted she needed to juggle the demands of motherhood against her career better.
I didnt manage my time well, she said. This is literally my first time travelling with the baby and everything so Im gonna try to do better.
Home crowd support
There had been speculation Serena may drop out of Sundays doubles match, after she did not turn up for practice in the morning with the three other US players. But team captain Kathy Rinaldi confirmed her participation after Venus won her singles match against Richel Hogenkamp to seal overall victory for the US.
Serenas gonna be joining her sister Venus! she announced, to roars of approval before Williams appeared dressed in a white top, dark blue shorts topped off with a red headband.
The Americans had enjoyed enormous support all weekend from the sold-out 5,200-capacity crowd in the mountainous city of Asheville, North Carolina, famous for its historic architecture, breweries and vibrant art scene. The dead-rubber was supposed to be the feel-good, icing on the cake, but the Dutch players had other ideas.
To play the two Williams sisters, its amazing because we won the match, said Kerkhove, 26.
We knew it just 30 minutes before the match. We just both gave it our all and we just had nothing to lose.
The Dutch players ability to soak up the pressure was all the more remarkable given that Schuurs, the younger of the pair, was just six-years-old when Serena won her first major tournament. Venus participation meant there was no room for Lauren Davis, the US fourth player.
The seven-time Grand Slam winner, who enjoyed a renaissance year in 2017, earlier shook off a scratchy start to prevail 7-5, 6-1 in her singles match, ensuring the US could continue their defence of the title.
More Fed Cup
Ahead of the tie, Serena had refused to be drawn on her Grand Slam hopes for the year.
She had initially targeted last months Australian Open and a defence of her 2017 title but struggled during an exhibition match against Jelena Ostapenko in Abu Dhabi in December, forcing her to revise her plans.
But she hinted Sunday she could make herself available for selection for the US next round clash in France in April.
I think ultimately its up to Kathy, she has a plenty of players to chose from, she said, referring to team captain Kathy Rinaldi. So many Americans are doing great, hopefully Ill be able to be an option, Ill be doing better by then, she said. AFP

SAITM issue will be solved soon - GMOA Secretary
The people of Sri Lanka have given an excellent reply to all pro-SAITM politicians and showed them where they belong. The SAITM issue will be solved soon because all parties, especially SAITM students and their parents have already accepted the solution given by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that for the second time the people have told the former Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake that he is not suitable to sit in Parliament. Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva got a black mark in his political career and got defeated after being pro-SAITM.
Dr. Aluthge pointed out that the current Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister got defeated and rejected by the people because of their pro-SAITM stand. They forced medical students to come into the streets and did not pay the Mahapola scholarship to take revenge from them. At least now they have to understand the issue and solve it without hiding it or making it more complicated day by day, just to win their personal agendas.
Now all parties have come to an agreement that all SAITM students should be given an MBBS that is recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). It can be either from KDU or the Nizhni Novgorod University in Russia. The SAITM owner cheated SAITM students stating that they will be sent to this university. They should not be given the SAITM MBBS because it is internationally blacklisted and locally a fraudulent company, he said.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said that the Prime Minister has already been informed through a letter and another letter was to be sent to the President yesterday. The Supreme Court will be informed. A common document is now being prepared. SAITM issue will be able to end with the consent of all parties, especially the SAITM students and their parents.

SIR DON BARON JAYATILLAKA: THE EPOCH MAKER
Men of great distinction and high calibre such as Sir D.B. Jayatillaka are rarely born. Sir D.B. Jayatillaka is no ordinary leader. He was a self made, self educated, self disciplined and self motivated man. He was a thinker, a patriot, a philosopher a statesman and above all an extraordinary man. Emulating the adage that the bounden duty of man is to serve man, he devoted his full time, wealth and energy in the pursuit of an exemplary educational, social, cultural, literary and political career. He was an eminent lawyer, a gentleman politician and above all a lover of humanity.
Sir D.B. Jayatillaka was indeed an epoch maker. Such epoch makers reach certain critical milestones in a short period of thirty to forty years but their impact would last a couple of hundred years. The fruits of labour of such great men are often seen and felt long after their demise. Invariably, such men live in the hearts of people for many generations after their demise. The story that unfolds henceforth is that of Sir D.B. Jayatillaka the epoch maker, a pioneer in many fields including the national and religious revival, resuscitation of Buddhist education, the social reawakening, political reforms, revival of the Sinhala literary tradition and the struggle for self rule in the first half of the 20th century. Coincidentally, he was a great teacher, a forceful writer, an erudite speaker, an eminent scholar, an honest politician, a forthright leader and above all a statesman in the true sense of the word; all in one.
Birth and blossoming of a real star
D.B. Jayatillaka was born on February 13, 1868 in the village of Waragoda in Kelaniya. His father Don Daniel Jayatillaka came from Pattalagedara in Veyangoda while his mother Dona Elisa Perera Weerasinghe was a resident of Waragoda. After marriage the couple settled down at Waragoda; a beautiful hamlet in close proximity to the historic Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya hallowed by the visit of the Buddha.
D.B. Jayatillakas father and mother were deeply religious, well educated and extremely generous. Don Daniel Jayatillaka was a man of substantial means being a P.W.D. Road Works Contractor. He had been entrusted with road construction and maintenance of a long stretch of the main road from Peliyagoda to Ratnapura. For this purpose he maintained a regular labour force of 50-75 labourers.
From childhood D.B. Jayatillaka displayed a flair for linguistic studies. May be as decreed by fate he mastered both oriental and occidental languages namely; Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit, Latin and English early in his life which paved the way for his great scholastic achievements later in life. As was customary at the time, in 1874 at the age of six years he read his first letters at the feet of Venerable Ratmalane Sri Dhammaloka Nayake Thera; founder and first Principal of Vidyalankara Pirivena at Peliyagoda. Thereafter, he was admitted to the Waragoda Baptist School for his primary education in the English medium. However, in his quest for knowledge he continued to learn Buddhism, Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit at Vidyalankara Pirivena in the afternoon.
In 1881, at the age of 13 years he gained admission to Wesley College, Colombo, which was one of the premier educational institutions of that era. He was a brilliant student at Wesley. It is on record that he carried away all the prizes. He was a young man of natural ability and amazing retentive memory, Above all he possessed a charming disposition, a most pleasing manner of address and an all conquering smile. It was a combination of looks and brains.
He passed the Cambridge Junior and Senior examinations with ease and was on the lookout for a government job. He applied for a clerical vacancy in the Land Settlement Department. At the interview, after examining the brilliant record of D.B. Jayatillaka the Head of the Department told him as follows. Young man, you are too good for this job. You have a great future. Strive with endeavour. This was the turning point in young D.B. Jayatillakas life. He put an end to the job hunt and embraced the more challenging higher educational path. Luckily for him he found that his old school Wesley College had commenced preparing students for the Degree Examinations conducted by the Culcutta University. In 1890 at the age of 22 years he was enrolled as a student for the Bachelor of Arts degree course in English and Latin. He passed all examinations leading to the degree in double quick time. In fact his name still adorns the Roll of Excellence at Wesley College.
A Power House in the Religious, Cultural and Educational Resurgence
The last two decades of the 19th century was a period of religious controversy. Heated arguments and endless discussions were the order of the day. Buddhism which had been battered and neglected as the religion of the heathen was struggling for revival while battling for survival. Likewise, the Sinhalese who had been victimized for very nearly 400 years were endeavouring to gain a place and position in their own motherland, in their own society as well as in the alien administration. Education was the sole preserve of the Christian Missionaries. The main purpose of their mission was proselytization and education was a means to that end.
The arrival of Colonel Henry Steel Olcott in the island in 1880 accompanied by Madame Blavatsky to study Buddhism and undertake theosophical work added vigour and vitality to the nascent religious and educational resurgence. From about the same time young D.B. Jayatillaka came to be associated with the new revivalist movement. By this time he had decided to devote his whole life to teaching and the propagation of Buddhism. In the furtherance of this objective the first job that D.B. Jayatillaka undertook was that of the first Principal of the Buddhist High School in Kandy later named Dharmaraja College managed by the Buddhist Theosophical Society. He had to build a school from scratch. As Principal he went from house to house and village to village collecting money for the Dharmaraja College building fund. He worked hard for seven years and established a high class Buddhist School in Kandy replete with all essential amenities and facilities.
The Buddhist Theosophical Society was so impressed with his success at Dharmaraja College that the management wanted D.B. Jayatillaka to perform the same miracle at Ananda College, Colombo. Thus, in 1898 he was appointed as Vice Principal of Ananda. In 1900 when A.E. Buulltjens who was the Principal of Ananda retired, D.B. Jayatillaka was appointed to that covetous position. By then, the whole country knew about the academic achievements, literary acumen, social work and Buddhist activities of D.B. Jayatillaka.
As was customary at the time parents of D.B. Jayatillaka sent a proposal to Pandit Batuwantudawe the well known scholar and philanthropist of Bentota upon learning that his daughter would be an ideal match for their son. The Batuwantudawes after consulting their astrologers agreed to the proposal and in August 1898 D.B. Jayatillaka married Mallika Batuwantudawe in what was called the wedding of the year. She was learned in Sinhala, Pali and English and brought up in the traditional Sinhala-Buddhist atmosphere. Throughout her life she remained a tower of strength and a lovable companion to D.B. Jayatillaka.
The 1890s was a decade of great religious fervour. Debates and discussions with Christian clergymen and missionaries were the order of the day. The Sinhala Buddhists had no proper organisation to meet these challenges. In 1898 D.B. Jyatillaka rented a small house in Maradana and founded the Young Mens Buddhist Association which in course of time spread its tentacles to all parts of the country and embraced diverse Buddhist activities. D.B. Jayatillaka was elected the first President of the YMBA. He continued to be its President for 46 years; being elected continuously every year up to his demise in 1944. Under the auspices of the Colombo YMBA Buddhist activities such as Dhamma sermons and discussions, Dhamma examinations, publications such as The Buddhist and the founding of Dhamma Schools and outstation branches were expanded and continued. He organised the purchase of Mahanil a large mansion in Borella for use as YMBA headquarters. The YMBA movement has flourished and gathered momentum over the last 120 years making it one of the premier Buddhist institutions in Sri Lanka with over 200 affiliated YMBAS spread throughout the country.
In 1902, the Buddhist Theosophical Society appointed D.B. Jayatillaka as the General Manager of Buddhist schools in addition to being the Principal Ananda College. In 1905 he was appointed General Manager of BTS, which by then had emerged as a mass movement for the establishment of Buddhist schools in the country. He also headed the movement for the establishment of an autonomous fully residential university.
He had an innate desire from childhood to engage in historical and literary pursuits. In furtherance of this objective he joined the Sri Lanka branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Pracheena Bhashopakara Samitiya or The Oriental Studies Society. He undertook the task of reviving and improving the Sarasavi Sandaresa newspaper. He was a pioneer in the revival of the Sinhala literary tradition. In 1927 on his initiative the government gave a grant to compile the Sinhala Etymological Dictionary. He had a rare collection of Ola manuscripts. In 1929 he began the monumental task of revising and editing centuries old Classical Sinhala texts such as Budugunalankaraya, Saddharma Ratnavaliya, Dampiya Atuwa Getapadaya, Jataka Pota, Sikha Valandsa Vinisa, Compendium of all Kathikavath (disciplinary codes of the Sangha) down the ages from the Polonnaruwa period and many more rare Sinhala literary works. He rendered yeoman service as Editor of the Sinhala Dictionary.
A pioneer in the Social and Political Reform Movement
In 1910, at the age of 42 years DB Jayatillaka left for England for further education at his own expense. Grateful people, Buddhist organisations and the Maha Sangha offered their blessings and accorded numerous farewells to him. Newspapers, Journals and Magazines carried feature articles in praise of his selfless services to his country, race religion and language. He joined Jesus College, Oxford and pursued a degree course in law leading to the Bachelors Degree in Law. Thereafter, he joined Lincolns Inn London and passed out as a Barrister in 1913. In England he got fully involved in the Temperance Movement as well as in the propagation of Buddhism. D.B. Jayatillaka addressed meetings of the Temperance Movement of England and cleverly arranged with the Temperance Movements of England and Sri Lanka to make joint representations to the Secretary of State for Colonies against the Toddy Ordinance in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lankas maritime past
In Sri Lankan popular culture, the history of Buddhism on the island is basically unassailable.
Many monks, scholars, and Buddhist lay people believe that Sri Lanka is the worlds cradle of Theravada Buddhism, as shown by the Mahavamsa, the text written by Buddhist monks that stretches back two millennia.
But Professor Osmund Bopearachchi, a University of Kelaniya graduate who is now a professor of Central and South Asian Art and Archeology at the University of California Berkeley, argues that the story is actually much more complex.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority Logistics Director Upali de Zoysa.
At a recent lecture at the University of Colombo, Professor Bopearachchi said the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is more influenced by Mahayana forms and ideas, particularly from South India, than people think.
The time has come for Buddhist scholars, archeologists, and art historians to examine closely the diffusion of (Mahayana) Buddhism from India to Sri Lanka and then to Southeast Asia and China, he said.
This cross-fertilization of Buddhist practice was facilitated by ancient maritime trade routes that existed long before the Romans famously began to write of Sri Lankas riches, he argued.
The island of Lanka played a vital role in transmitting merchandise between East and West, and North and South. Because of this, the political, religious and cultural history of Sri Lanka reflect the fluctuations of the markets, changing patterns of trading destinations, and the evolution of Buddhist philosophies, he said.
Put simply, trade in commodities accompanied a trade in culture, ideas, and beliefs.
This recognition has implications that reverberate even today.
Pre-Roman trade routes
Mainstream histories of Sri Lankas importance to maritime trade routes often begin with early Roman descriptions of the island.
The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy, for example, drew a map of Sri Lanka in the 2nd century CE. In it, the island appears about ten times its current size, possibly reflecting its geographical importance to ancient traders.
But in fact, long before the Roman Empire took control of Egypt and its valuable Red Sea trade route in 30 BC, India and Sri Lanka were engaged in a dynamic regional maritime network based on coastal navigation, Bopearachchi said.
The recent discovery of an ancient shipwreck near the village of Godavaya off the islands Southern coast is proof of this fact.
The (wreck), dating from the 2nd or 1st century BC, belongs to a period when Romans were still not engaged with Indian Ocean trade, Bopearachchi said. This find has revolutionized our knowledge of the history of maritime trade in South Asia, he added.
In ancient times, Sri Lanka was trading in precious goods like ivory, tortoise shells, and gems, he said. So when the Romans did begin to navigate the Indian Ocean, they were entering a previously established market.
The Romans took Sri Lankas goods all over the ancient world. A blue sapphire discovered on the site of Alexandria on the Caucasus, in modern-day Afghanistan, dating back to the 1st or 2nd century CE, is just one example of this North-South trade, Bopearachchi said.
The influence of Mahayana
But ivory and gems were not the only things flowing along these ancient trade routes. Traders also passed along their religious practices and beliefs.
During the first three centuries of the common era, South Indian traders played an integral role between Alexandrian traders and Sri Lankans, Bopearachchi said. As a result, they came from Andhra and Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in search of merchandise.
He said that while visiting religious monuments in Sri Lanka, these traders would have brought plaques as offerings to the islands Buddhist establishment.
Professor Osmund Bopearachchi.
This explains why some reliefs in Andhra style, depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, have been found in religious monuments of Sri Lanka, he said.
Cultural interactions between Andhra and Sri Lanka made the Buddhist communities closer, he said. A branch of the Mahavihara in Anuradhapura was established in Andhra Pradesh, he said, and Mahayana Buddhism flourished at the Abhayagiri monastery.
Indeed, in 2010, while undergoing conservation of the Abhayagiri stupa, archeologists discovered a tablet carrying Tantric Mahayana inscriptions dating to the 8th century CE.
Bopearachchi said that discoveries from around the 7th and 8th centuries show that Mahayana Boddhisattva statues actually outnumbered Buddha images on the island. They are scattered along the islands ports, rivers, and overland routes.
Because the Boddhisattva Avalokitesvara was believed to be the protector of sailors and travelers, the presence of Boddhisattva statues shows widespread Mahayana practice in Sri Lanka, he said.
Professor Justin Henry, an American scholar of religious history, takes a more textual approach to the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. But he agrees with many of Bopearachchis positions.
He said that medieval kings are sometimes identified as Boddhisattvas in various texts and inscriptions. The inscriptional, art-historical, and literary record of the 9th and 10th centuries evidences an injection of Mahayana imagery and vocabulary into Sri Lankan Buddhism that would have enduring effects, he said in an interview.
It is in this context of hybridity, the historians argue, that the famed spread of Buddhism east from Sri Lanka to Southeast Asia must be understood.
Buddhism on the move
In the 7th century, trade between Chinese, Arab, Persian, and South Indian merchants exploded, connecting Sri Lanka to Southeast and East Asia in new and profound ways.
It was with the sudden burst of trade activities between China and the Middle East in the 7th century that Sri Lanka began to play a decisive role between East and West, Bopearachchi said.
Sri Lankas increased importance in the context of trade also meant a wider spread of its religious beliefs and practices.
An emblematic story is that of Vajrabodhi, a South Indian Vajrayana Buddhist monk. Vajrabodhi eventually went to serve in the Tang Court of 8th century China.
En route to China, Vajrabodhi stopped in Sri Lanka, to pay homage to the tooth relic at Abhayagiri and to climb Sri Pada and worship the Buddhas footprint, according to a biography written by his disciple.
Leaving Sri Lanka from modern-day Beruwala, he was accompanied by 35 Persian ships trading in precious stones.
This episode is a case study in the diffusion of Buddhist thought and information on maritime trade in the Indian Ocean, Bopearachchi said.
Pre-dating Vajrabodhi even, King Mahanama in the 5th century sent Sinhalese Buddhist nuns to preside over an ordination ceremony in China during the Song Dynasty.
Sri Lanka made contact with Thailand in the same century, Bopearachchi said, and close links between Sri Lanka and Burma certainly paved the way for iconographies based on Pali literature.
He said Pali may have even served as the lingua franca between the two cultures.
The spread of Buddhism from South Asia to Southeast Asia is closely connected to the growth of maritime networks based on trade that facilitated the movement of Buddhist merchants, traveling monks, and traders, he said.
Where is Sri Lanka now
Other scholars and historians think that the lessons of Bopearachchis argument have implications on culture and trade today.
Professor Emeritus Gamini Keerawella, the Executive Director of the Regional Centre for Strategic Studies, said he believed it was important to push back against the very parochial, very narrow modern view of history.
That view is often misused to explain present political developments, he said. Examining current phenomena, like Chinas One Belt One Road development initiative, should not be viewed through a simplified lens.
Instead of the popular notion that the belt and road are indicative of a resurgence of Chinese imperial ambition, it should instead be analyzed as complex and rooted in a variety of internal and external political factors, he argued.
Senior Professor Amal Kumarage, of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, said he was shocked that there were 35 ships anchored at the ancient harbour near Beruwala. Im not sure Hambantota has had that many, he said.
But Sri Lanka Ports Authority Logistics Director Upali de Zoysa pushed back. To attract traffic to a new port it takes time, he said. Aided by a Chinese plan to develop an industrial zone around the port, it will take 10-15 years to get off the ground, he said.
Meanwhile, Hambantota is surrounded in myriad of controversies that sometimes sloppily mix arguments of sovereignty, foreign intrusion, domestic political strife, and debt. The situation, which has trade at its root, is inextricably linked with culture and history. It will be the job of future historians to untangle the threads.
Reflecting on ancient trade routes, its clear that Sri Lanka was the centre of the world, Bopearachchi said at the academic forum.
Still we have a role to play, he said. And it is still central.

Staying true to ones roots
Representing the best of both worlds Raini Charuka Goonatillakes journey of 10 years can be termed a meteoric rise. Melodies features Goonatillake whose good breeding and talent ensures a memorable and impressive career in music.
The daughter of Rookantha and Chandralekha, Goonatillake no doubt owes her success due to their influence and because she is goal oriented.
First and foremost I must say that I am so very and glad that God chose me to be a daughter of Rookantha and Chandralekha. I try to protect their image at all times regardless of whether its related to music or something other. Its something Ive been very conscious of since I was a child. Thats behavior wise. Musically, I try my best, but I dont think I can ever step up to my fathers standard.
I attribute my success to both my parents Rookantha, Chandralekha and now my husband Akila as well. I couldnt imagine a career without them. Becoming a singer happened in a blink of an eye because of successful parents and right now, Artiste management is done by my husband Akila. He truly has made my life so much easier! And the best part is, I dont have to pay him, explained Goonatillake.
The time she spent in America certainly had a positive impact upon her life. Those 15 years opened her up to the culture, behavior, art and music.
I was able to see and hear how freely they created their music and how they loved each creation from deep within. That influence made such a positive impact in my life. I learnt that you cannot do something unless you truly love it. Therefore, when it comes to recording a single, (which are composed by other musicians) if I do not have a liking to the song, I reject it. When I do, I make sure I put out the best product to the best of my ability and America has made me a more easy going artiste, a less tense and a much more grounded person, said Goonatillake.
Goonatillake has had a promising career so far. Her first single Neela Kandu was released October 2009. She was introduced to the industry with that first single.
The song really went places and I was blessed to have two more hits enter the charts here which escalated my artistry. They were Tharumini (2010) & Mathakada Handaawe (2011) from the movie Sinhawalokanaya. And it was a time where people in Sri Lanka wanted to see what I really looked and sounded like in person.
I like to believe it was a pinnacle I hit during those few years and usually, the Artiste is present in the country and is able to promote the single(s) while performing at concerts. For me it was a completely different scenario. I was popular, but I wasnt around to be heard or seen. It was super difficult for me to hold down the fans being all the way in America. Social media really came in handy, added Goonatillake.
Goonatillakes biggest message is that there is no right and wrong in music. Music is notes we put together to express an emotion. Something we feel in our bones and what one feels deep within, may not be for someone else. Music isnt complicated. Its an art we live and breathe universally.
Even though I am fluent in speaking, reading and writing in Sinhala, I do not come up with Sinhala lyrics, I have no idea how to write a song in Sinhala but I do write in English which is yet to be recorded. I just honestly dont think too deep. I close my eyes and start rhyming.
Being a daughter of two different musicians and living in America has definitely put together quite a few flavours in me. I have a bit of my dad whos much more modern in his music and my mom whos more of an oriental singer and then Americas put an accent in my tongue, pointed out Goonatillake.
Among the artistes she admires are MJ, Bruno Mars, Alicia Keys, Beyonc , Norah Jones, The Beatles. Locally she admires her parents, Milton Mallawarachchi, The Gypsies, Daddy, Sujatha Attanayake, Nirosha Virajini, Nelu Adhikari and many more. I admire how individualized they are. I appreciate it, says Goonatillake
She believes in staying true to herself and to her music. Success will happen in your own time and way says Goonatillake.
With the reality shows we have today and social media, its easier to become known, than before but its difficult to keep it up. Even for me, the hard part is to sustain it. Next year, 2019 marks 10 years for me! And I am quite proud of myself for being able to do so. So try hard, be calm, dont hurry yourselves to reach the pinnacle. It will happen in its own way and time.
Be honest with yourself with integrity. Create sharp goals and have that courage which leads to leadership. What makes you a leader is when you reach the top not alone, but by raising your peers to the top with you. Its not a ride you go on by yourself. Leaders lead the way and everyone else helps them reach their goals as well, states Goonatillake
She is currently working on her Debut Album and has released around 10 singles so far, apart from the many Drama/Movie/Jingles and Brand Songs she has done.
I would like to thank all my fans and foes for encouraging me and for the support throughout my career. I couldnt do this without you all. Thanks so much as always, said Goonatillake

Swiss firm Georg Fischer to strengthen presence in China
China will play a critical role in Swiss firm Georg Fischer Ltd's goal for profitable expansion through to 2020, according to its President and CEO Yves Serra.
The industrial conglomerate aims to grow business by 20 percent from 2015 to 2020, with a critical pillar being China's vast market bolstered by urbanization drive and robust economic activity, Serra said.
We must be strong where the markets are, and a balanced presence worldwide reduces the impact of regional crisis, he told China Daily in a recent interview.
China currently represents roughly 20 percent of its 3.74 billion CHF ($3.98 billion) recorded in the fiscal year of 2016. Through three business units, the group supports transport of liquids and gasses, provides lightweight casting components in vehicles and offers high-precision manufacturing technologies.
With China on the cusp of being a world leader for new energy cars and home to around 40 percent of the machine tool business, Serra is confident to reap solid growth in revenue and profit through continued expansion of all three sectors in the country.
From lightweight vehicles to the need for water treatment, this constant call for quality of life is bringing us substantial opportunities here, he said.
To be specific, the company will increase the share of high-end products like sensors, valves, and automation through its piping systems arm. It also intends to invest more in machining to offer ready-to-mount components, and strengthens presence in aerospace, information technology, and laser texturing as well as 3D printing machines.
Today the group has more than 20 companies throughout China including 14 production companies. He also praised Beijing's Made in China 2025 Initiative, which is designed to notch up China's manufacturing quality through innovative endeavors.
It (the plan) would help boost our business here because it demonstrates how quality makes a difference, he said.

UK trade deficit widens in December
A rise in oil prices and higher imports contributed to a widening of the UK's goods trade deficit in December.
The gap between exports and imports rose to 13.6bn, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, which was higher than analysts' forecasts.
Separate ONS data showed industrial output experienced its biggest fall since 2012, largely due to the shutdown of the Forties North Sea pipeline.
Industrial output fell by 1.3% in December from the month before. However, the ONS said UK's manufacturing sector, which is part of overall industrial output, saw output rise by 0.3% on the month, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth in the sector - the longest run in almost 30 years.
Further ONS data showed construction output also rose, by 1.6%, in December.
The total trade deficit, which covers goods and services - widened by 1.2bn to 4.9bn between November and December.
Senior ONS statistician Ole Black said: "The headline trade deficit widened in the fourth quarter with the impact of increased oil imports accentuated by rising crude prices."
"Construction was broadly flat across 2017, thanks to a strong December. However, house building and infrastructure were the only bright spots with all other areas of the industry falling back throughout the year."
Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: "The sharp deterioration in the UK's net trade position in December was disappointing and means that trade is likely to have been a drag on UK growth in the final quarter of the year."
The BCC said people were continuing to buy imports despite the post-Brexit fall in the value of the pound, which has made goods bought in from abroad more expensive.
"While many exporters are benefiting from stronger growth in key trading markets, imports continue to grow at a solid pace, with businesses continuing to report little in the way of import substitution despite their high cost.
"If this trend continues as we expect, the contribution of net trade to UK GDP growth over the near term is likely to be limited at best."
The latest official data is not expected to alter the views expressed by the Bank of England on Thursday that UK growth is improving and may lead to the need for a rise in interest rates relatively soon.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said industrial production for the final quarter of 2017 was slightly lower than the 0.6% rise incorporated in the preliminary estimate of GDP.
However, he added: "Taken alongside December's stronger-than-estimated construction data, today's releases do not imply that that quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in Q4 will be revised down from 0.5%."

Virtusa Corp targets US$1 bn revenue for 2018
Virtusa Corp. is looking at fiscal year 2018 revenue to be in the range of US$1,013.3 to US$ 1,019.3 million, said Virtusas Chairman and CEO, Kris Canekeratne.
Virtusas competitive advantage lies in our deeply grounded and unique ability to deliver large scale digital transformation combined with legacy IT platform rationalization, cost reduction and effort compression. As digital engineers, we understand how to bridge the tasks and deliver end-to-end digital programs that yield tangible results for our clients. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results are proof that our strategy is working and our advantage is real. In consequence, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate the above-industry growth.
The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2018 with $303.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments inclusive of $25 million drawn down from the existing revolving credit facility to fund the Polaris delisting offer. The cash flow from operations was $24.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
In support of the transaction, on February 6, 2018, Virtusa entered into a $450 million credit agreement with a syndicated bank group jointly lead by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, which replaces Virtusas existing $300 million credit agreement.
He said that successful Polaris delisting process too was a success story for the company. He said the move brought them additional clients and Polaris too showed profit from a flat year.
He also said today the high focus on digitalization, Cloud, Robotics, especially in the banking and other ICT related sectors too is giving them new areas of business.
Commenting on the US economic policy changes which were done under the Trump Administration, he said that it is bearing fruit. The lowering of taxes from around 30% to 21% is a very good move which has resulted in US companies reinvesting aggressively.
In accordance with US GAAP, Virtusa will be applying the if-converted method to its convertible preferred shares when reporting its fiscal year 2018 results. The if-converted method is used to calculate the share impact of convertible securities.

Vodafone, Idea may have a new brand name after merger
Vodafone India and IdeaBSE 1.85 % Cellular, Indias second-and thirdranked telcos that are merging, are working on a new name and brand identity for the combined entity, which may come into effect a year after the transaction closes, people familiar with the matter said.
There will be a new brand identity  work has started on it, a senior consultant working on the merged companys new identity said, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements. The UK-based Vodafone and the Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned Idea are chalking out a new positioning that will attract customers and retain the recall value associated with both the parent companies, according to the people.
The two companies didnt respond to ETs emailed queries. The merger will create Indias largest mobile phone operator by subscribers and revenue market share. The companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2018, though experts said it may come through by March-April. The companies are in the final leg of getting regulatory approvals for the merger, which will allow them to better take on Reliance Jio Infocomm and current No. 1 telco Bharti Airtel in an intensely competitive market that has eroded revenue, profit and cash flows.
A new brand will help them start afresh without any baggage, said Jessie Paul, chief executive officer of marketing advisory firm Paul Writer in Bengaluru. With Vodafones strength in its urban circles and Idea Cellulars in rural areas, a new brand from scratch makes more sense. In March 2017, both the companies said that the brand strategy of the combined company will be developed in due course and will leverage customers affinity for the existing brands, built up over the past decade.
Senior executives in the telcos aware of the developments said it will be a while before any new brand is rolled out. Nothing is locked as of now and all options are open. We are veering towards maintaining status quo for at least one year, said a senior executive aware of the developments at one of the telcos. Its very likely that one unified brand will emerge, said a senior executive at an advertising firm that has worked with one of the telcos. The operational chaos that would ensue as as a result of a new brand, however, would be a major issue, naturally.
Idea and Vodafone India have hired Aon to chalk out salary structures, pulled in Bain Consultants to advise on overall strategies and have roped in leadership management company Spencer Stuart to shortlist candidates for major roles in the combined entity.

Wallaby great Shehadie dies aged 92
Sydney, Monday: Former Wallabies captain and administrator Sir Nicholas Shehadie, one of only two Australian rugby players to be knighted, has died aged 92.
Shehadie, who played 30 Tests between 1947 and 1958, a record at the time with three of those as captain, passed away in hospital late Sunday, Rugby Australia said.
He was regarded as one of the all-time great prop forwards and an institution in the Australian team for a decade, playing a total of 114 games for the Wallabies.
Shehadie was inducted into the International Rugby Board (IRB) Hall of Fame in 2011 in recognition of his services to the game and for being a key architect in establishing the World Cup.
His lobbying helped the IRB vote to create a World Cup in 1985 and he was appointed joint chairman on the Rugby World Cup committee.
His post-playing career was just as formidable and he served as Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1973 -- a period marked by the official opening of the Sydney Opera House.
Shehadie was knighted in 1976 for his mayoral service, becoming only the second Wallaby to receive the honour after Sir Edward Weary Dunlop.
He was also appointed a companion of the Order of Australia in 1990.
(He was) a wonderful, wonderful Australian ... a beautiful man, former Wallabies coach and radio broadcaster Alan Jones said.
Its going to leave a hole in the heart of many because people like Nick Shehadie dont come along very often.
Shehadie, husband of former New South Wales state governor Dame Marie Bashir, served as president of Rugby Australia from 1980-86 and was also chairman of the multicultural SBS television network between 1981 and 1999.
Business leaders and politicians honoured him on social media. AFP

Working on a musical
Singer Lana Del Rey is developing a Broadway musical.
The Summertime Sadness hitmaker shared the news in new interview for LOfficiel magazine, in which she fielded questions from a string of celebrity fans, including Kim Kardashian, Stevie Nicks, Courtney Love, and Sean Ono Lennon.
She also answered a number of submissions from the general public, with one devotee, simply identified as Toni, inquiring about the possibility of Lana writing and directing her own feature-length or short film.
I thought about writing a biopic about someone that wasnt real, she explained, before revealing, Actually, I was asked to write a musical, which Ive started. It was for Broadway.
However, the star admits audiences will have to wait a while for the project to come to fruition.
I may finish in two or three years, she mused. Me and Rick (Nowels, her frequent collaborator) have written something, so well see.
As for her own biopic, Lana would pick Moulin Rouge! filmmaker Baz Luhrmann to direct.
Im thinking a big picture here, because I love Baz Luhrmann, she shared. Not sure who would play me though.
Elsewhere in the wide-ranging interview, Lana admits she would be a doula, or maybe working with kids if she didnt have a career in music, while she draws style inspiration from rocker Joan Baez, and late stars Lauren Bacall and Janice Joplin.
She also confesses she is stunned to call Courtney Love a fan, saying, If you had told me that one day Courtney Love would listen to me on repeat, I would just not have believed you. Music News
