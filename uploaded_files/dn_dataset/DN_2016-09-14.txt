Reprimand for new protest by Ethiopian runner
Rio de Janeiro, Monday: The International Paralympic Committee reprimanded a visually impaired Ethiopian runner Monday for crossing his arms above his head at the finish line, a protest against alleged rights abuses by his government.
The protest by Tamiru Demisse, the silver medalist in the mens 1,500 m in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, comes after fellow Ethiopian runner Feyisa Lilesa made headlines during the Olympics last month when he made a similar protest as he claimed silver in the mens marathon.
The gesture -- a sort of X above the head -- is a symbol of defiance against the Ethiopian governments crack-down on anti-government protests that started in the Oromo region in November last year.
Human Rights Watch estimates the Ethiopian security forces have killed more than 400 people involved in the protests.
But the International Paralympic Committee sternly rebuked Demisse, 22, for making a political statement at the Games.
Hes been told very, very clearly that political statements are definitely (forbidden)... in the Paralympics Games, as they are in the Olympic Games. Its been made very, very clear to him that this must not be done again, said IPC president Philip Craven.
Olympic athlete Lilesa made the protest gesture twice -- once while crossing the finish line and again on the medal podium. He said he feared his life would be in peril if he returned home. Ethiopian authorities assured him he would not be punished, but he nevertheless skipped the Olympic teams flight home.
Reports have suggested he may seek political asylum in the United States.
His agent, Federico Rosa, told AFP: I dont think that there is any way that he will (go back to Ethiopia).
Regarded as one of Africas most repressive states, Ethiopia is struggling to contain the rare anti-government unrest unleashed by the protest movement, which has spread from Oromo in the center of the country to Amhara in the north. AFP

England women confirm Sri Lanka ODI tour
LONDON: England women will conclude their busiest-ever year of international cricket by taking on Sri Lanka in the final round of ICC Womens Championship in November.
The three-match ODI series was Tuesday confirmed by the England & Wales Cricket Board, and will take place at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on November 12, 15 and 17.
England are currently third on 19 points in the Championship standings, which serve as the qualification tournament for the 2017 World Cup, with Sri Lanka lying in eighth, having won just twice in their first five rounds of the competition.
Arguably the bigger test of Englands credentials will come when they travel to Jamaica next month to play West Indies in the penultimate round of the ICC WC. Stafanie Taylors team are one point ahead of England in second place on the table, meaning that the result from that series will
have a significant bearing on the final qualification standings.
The tour to Sri Lanka will mark the end of the busiest ever year for the England womens team and the conclusion of the ICC Womens Championship, said Mark Robinson, England Womens Head Coach. It will be another good test to mark how we are progressing as a squad, as we bid to overcome a passionate home team in the heat and humidity of Sri Lanka.
As always, it will be a challenge that we will relish, as we keep building for the future and look ahead to the ICC Womens World Cup on home soil next year.
