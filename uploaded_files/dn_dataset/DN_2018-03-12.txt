Calming rough seas of emotions
This week a Senior Lecturer attached to the Department of Psychiatry of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Dr. Thilini Rajapakse speaks about various traumas and their impact on mental health.
Q - What is the main impact a trauma can cause on mental health
A  A trauma can be described as a deeply disturbing or distressing event or situation. In other words, it is a significant stressor in that persons life. Like it or not, all of us face traumas or significant stressors during the course of our lives. Each of us may have different ways of coping with stressful events, but as a whole, our response to stressors includes an emotional reaction, plus a variety of coping strategies. The emotional reaction is often anxiety, worry or a depressive reaction. These are normal emotional reactions to stressful events.
At the same time, when faced with such stressors, we often try to adopt different coping strategies. Coping strategies could be emotion reducing strategies or problem solving strategies. These are adaptive, or useful, coping strategies. Sometimes however, when faced with stressors, people also may choose maladaptive strategies  these are strategies that may give temporary relief, but increase the problem in the long term, such as increased alcohol intake, or deliberate self-harm.
Q - Can trauma or significant stressors, cause mental illness What are the commonest, most serious mental traumas and disorders related to stress
Dr. Thilini Rajapakse
A - As described earlier, we all have normal responses when faced with stressors. There are situations however, when the trauma or stressful event can cause very significant stress, which we find difficult to cope with and which may predispose to stress related psychiatric disorders. An acute stress reaction is one such disorder, which is very short lasting. It is an immediate, very short lasting stress reaction that can happen when a person is faced with a sudden severe stressor.
The person becomes very distressed within a few hours of facing the stressor, he or she may become very anxious or agitated, or may appear dazed and unable to cope; they may experience extreme anxiety symptoms, panic or become agitated and restless. These features last for a few hours or days at most, and subside completely after about two days. Post-traumatic stress disorders, or PTSD is a much more serious, intense and long lasting disorder that can occur when a person is exposed to an intensely stressful event. Such stressors could include, for example, being a victim of sexual abuse or serious physical abuse, or being exposed to significant natural calamities, such as a tsunami.
A person who develops PTSD will experience very distressing re-experiencing of the stressful event such as having nightmares, or they may remember or relive the event as recurrent intrusive images. They will also try to avoid all events of the traumatic event, and experience distressing symptoms of anxiety and hyper arousal  such as tremors, sweating, and palpitations. These symptoms all together are so distressing that the person has difficulty getting on with their normal day to day lives, and these symptoms may last for months or more. People struggling with PTSD may try to cope in maladaptive ways  such as by increased consumption of alcohol.
Adjustment disorder is another type of stress reaction  this is not so severe as PTSD, but is more gradual and long lasting than an acute stress reaction that was described first. It is a gradual and prolonged response to stressful events in the persons life.
Q - Who is more at risk of developing a stress related psychiatric disorder
A - Anybody can experience a stress related psychiatric disorder. On one hand, whether or not we develop a stress related psychiatric disorder will be influenced partly, by the nature or type of stressor we experience.
A severe stressor, like being a victim of sexual abuse, is much more likely to cause a stress related psychiatric disorder, compared to being exposed to a mild stressor. Intentional acts of interpersonal violence, in particular, have a higher risk of causing such disorders. Evidence also suggests that being exposed to multiple significant stressor or traumas can increase the risk.
When it comes to PTSD, evidence shows that having experienced previous significant traumas, having a past history of anxiety or depression, being female, and having lack of social support can all increase the risk of developing this disorder, in the context of a significant stressor. Genetic vulnerability and certain personality traits may also contribute.
Q - Are there any incurable conditions caused by certain mental trauma
A - This depends on the type of stress related psychiatric disorder that is experienced. As described before, an acute stress reaction is very short lasting, and usually subsides within a few days.
However, particularly PTSD is more long lasting, and can cause greater disability. But with support and treatment, about one-third of people who experience PTSD will recover within about three months. However, a certain percentage of people with PTSD (about 40%) may have a longer course.
Q - What are the medical treatments available
A - Fortunately, there is help and treatment available for those experiencing difficulties related to significant stressor or trauma. For a person who is experiencing an acute stress reaction  the person should be provided with support, a safe environment, and practical help as needed. If very distressed then can be given short-term medication to reduce their anxiety. But such people do not need long-term medication, and the condition usually resolves within a few days. Psychological therapy is the first line treatment for people with PTSD. These include specific therapies, such as trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. There are also specific long-term medications that are useful and prescribed for the treatment of PTSD.
Q - How can we minimize the risk of developing trauma related psychiatric disorders
A - Fortunately, many people who are exposed to trauma or significant stressors do not develop stress related psychiatric disorders! Certain genetic factors and personality factors, such as resilience, often help us face and overcome significant traumas and stressors in our life.
Having social support  for example from close family and friends, is also protective. And as mentioned earlier, it is important to try and use adaptive coping strategies  such as emotional ventilation and/or problem solving strategies, instead of maladaptive coping strategies, such as substance abuse, which in the long term, will make the problem worse.
If you or someone you know has experienced a significant stressor, and is having significant difficulty coping and returning to normal day to day functioning  then it is also important to seek psychiatric treatment and help.

Arbitrary scheme to grant car permits to public servants
Despite all our financial woes, the government is planning to remove the upper ceiling of the value of imported vehicles, and to grant hitherto unheard of tax relief to the public sector officials who hold permits.
This may be the moronic idea of the powers-that-be, to regain the popularity lost in the Provincial Council elections. Dont they realize that the masses cast the deciding vote, and if any wooing is to be done, the government has to placate the masses, by placing a cap on the prices of essential food, repairing and maintaining rural roads and bridges, improving the transport sector, overhauling the education system and providing basic comforts for the long suffering masses
About 6,000 public servants will benefit from this scheme of Value and Tax Cuts. It has been reported that the Treasury, (already in a woeful state) will lose nearly 65 billion rupees per year, when this is implemented. All public servants should be instructed to buy only second-hand vehicles below a stipulated value, they should be ordered to fly ordinary class, allowed to stay only in 3-star hotels and told to keep to a minimum, whatever is spent on them by the Treasury. This should also include house rent, petrol allowance and general expenses incurred for their living. It is time they took a cut in their salaries and perks.
It is apparent to all of us, that after about one year in office, these public servants increase in girth, and their hair turns totally black! Spending public money, they gorge at disgracefully loaded buffet tables, while the masses sometimes are unable to have even one square meal a day.
Yahapalanaya, please realize that all this is contrary to the ideals of the Venerable Madulawe Sobitha Thera. We expected so much from you.

## Title: Communal disharmony solution is within us

Communal disharmony solution is within us
The recent violence in Ampara and in some areas of Kandy are really tragedies. They are tragedies in the sense that even after a long devastating internal war, some groups of people have still not realised that such racial riots could spread and cause mayhem throughout the country.
Many Sri Lankans responded to this violence with disbelieving horror. How could this happen in Sri Lanka, in 2018
This is not who we are, said one retired teacher. And yet, this is exactly who we are.
Amid our modern clashes, researchers in psychology, sociology and neurology have been studying the roots of racial behaviour. Let us draw on that research and try to explain why people feel and act this way toward each other. It will also help us a solution.
Parents role
In some ways, its simple. People learn to be whatever their society and culture teaches them. We often assume that it takes parents actively teaching their kids, for them to be racial-minded. The truth is that unless parents actively teach kids not to be racial-minded, they will be. This is what Jennifer Richeson, highly acclaimed Yale University social psychologist told scientific gathering. She further said, This is not the product of some deep-seated, evil heart that is cultivated. It comes from the environment, the air all around us.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu also agrees with this viewpoint. He once told the UN some years ago: Racial behaviour is a cancer in a community or in a society and it starts with the individual and the family.
Both are right. The parents are the most influential people in our children's lives. They must decide what type of message they wish to pass over to their children. For example, they can lead the children to believe that they count more than others because they belong to a particular race, and in doing this they are sowing the seeds of racial feelings; they are in effect telling the children that some other people are not entitled to the same rights and chances that they have. They give them a licence to validate their own future racist behaviour.
Or, the parents may pick out a particular group of people belonging to a different race for unfavourable comment because of the way they live, their beliefs, the way they become richer or how they keep filtering into other areas, they are fine tuning the minds of the children in racial lines of waves.
Honest evaluation
There cannot be any ambivalence about racial behaviour. In truth, children and youth of different races and religions can study, work and play together without problems. Yet, when racial issues filter into the picture, they create the barriers and the culture of disrespect and inequality.
I believe that its time for all parents to sit back and think of their attitude towards racism. It should be an honest evaluation. Each parent can ask himself (or herself) few questions about where he (or she) stand on racial behaviour.
Do I recognise the need for me to be inclusive of those who come into my community, particularly those of other races or religions Do I make disrespectful comments about people of other races or religions even in jest, or do I tell and/or encourage racist humour and jokes
If I am not inclusive, what are my reasons and are they fair and just If I have fears, am I entitled to act on them, or am I being merely self-seeking and protective in some way of my own pre-conceived ideas of what is normal and safe in my families and communities
Have I at any time, here or abroad, been discriminated against and been the subject of racial attitudes How did I feel about it
Are my attitudes and behaviours in keeping with my religious beliefs Are my behaviours and attitudes help to support unity amongst the people in my community or are they, in effect, promoting disharmony and ill will amongst its members
Would I like my children to be the subjects of racial behaviour and attitudes if they decide to go and work and live abroad
The answers given without pretensions will set parents free to face reality to make the right decisions.
Mentality
The human mind has a tendency to categorize people into social groups. And often these social groups can create an Us vs. Them mentality toward people who may be different than us in some way, whether its race, gender, nationality, culture, religion, or socio-economic status.
During tribal times, it would be beneficial to perceive unfamiliar people as a potential threat and treat them as such for protection and security. But today many of these social categories and stereotypes are propagated by society, tradition, and culture. They arent relevant anymore, but we continue to believe them and, in many ways, they become self-fulfilling beliefs.
Our group
History proves us and there is also a lot of evidence that Sri Lankan people have an ingrained and even evolved tendency toward people who are in our group. But how we define our groups, and the tendency to draw divisions along racial lines, is social, not biological. We can draw those lines in a number of ways that society tells us.
However, the most likely one is the exposure to a kind of ideology. Many of us carry implicit biases and unexamined prejudices and some of us may harbour feelings of fear or resentment that they dont express in public.
But when people come into contact perpetrators with organised ideology that glorifies an intergroup struggle like a race struggle - that scaffolds from peoples everyday prejudices into something altogether more violent.
The most important doctrine that these inciters of communal violence pass onto their followers is that their community is actually the one who is being discriminated against in society and it needs to be restored.
We saw how Wijeweera did it, Prabhakaran did it and now interested parties did it in Ampara and some areas in Kandy.
The way out
We first need to become more aware of our tendency to put people into groups and create an Us vs. Them mentality.
We see it all the time not only race wise, religion wise, caste wise but even politics wise and more. Some may not visible to naked eye but they are ingrained there. But at the end of the day a lot of this thinking creates unnecessary tension and antagonism between everyone.
Group thinking causes us to act irrationally and uncooperative, because we are more concerned about conforming with our group instead of thinking intelligently for ourselves or recognising other peoples interests and values outside of our own social circle.
Instead of seeing people in groups, a better perspective is to see everyone as an individual worthy of respect, equality, and kindness, regardless of what groups they may be categorized in.
We shouldnt necessarily ignore these common differences between us, but we certainly shouldnt use them to judge people as superior or inferior  or see them as a battle between Us vs. Them.
Culture change
Jennifer Richeson has another idea. The only way to change bias is to change culture. You have to change to what is morally acceptable to all in society.
When we talk about change of culture, some intellectuals recommend religiously accepted culture. It provides a check on our outward attitude, which in turn influences how we think about ourselves internally. Everything were exposed to gives us messages about who is good and bad.
Such norms can serve as a check on expression of violent racial activities. But to challenge the deep-seated prejudices that shape our behaviour, to unlearn our implicit biases, we need contact and converse with each other regularly and continuously.
It's absolutely the opposite of what the extremist groups want, which is a segregated society. What we really need is an integrated society, and at the same time need to create as much socioeconomic fairness as we can, so what relationships people have across group lines are egalitarian relationships.
Thats the only way that can create trust between people on each side of an us-them divide, and the only way in the long term to reduce prejudices.

Communalism had no place in Kandy since ancient times
Since ancient times, communalism or racism had no place in the Kandy district or even the central hills for that matter, since the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities had always lived in unity and harmony.
This had been the strongest foundation for unity and peace, as shown in previous election results. The Sinhalese living in Kadugannawa, Galagedara and Akurana electorates had joined hands with their Muslim and Tamil brethren to elect Muslim members as their parliamentary representatives at the general elections. The Sinhalese joined hands with Muslims in this manner as they valued humanism and human values over racism and religionism.
After 1970, the two-member Akurana seat was renamed the Harispattuwa electorate, with a majority of Sinhalese people. A Muslim individual named A. C. Shahul Hameed was elected as the first member of the two-member Harispattuwa electorate at consecutive elections from 1970 to 2000, since a majority of the Sinhalese too, rallied around this renowned leader of the Muslim Community, to repeatedly send him to Parliament.
A. C. S. Hameed was never communal-minded, as he looked at society with humanism. The Buddhist temple was a common place to him as much as the Mosque or the Hindu Kovil was.
He patronised all of them with equal enthusiasm. A. C. S. Hameed was instrumental in building a fully-equipped Seemamalakaya at Waratenna, Haloluwa, near the Mahaweli Ganga and gifting it to the Maha Sangha for the Udarata Amarapura Nikaya to perform its Higher ordination; the (Upasampada) Vinayakarma ceremony.
Sinhalese Buddhists always remember with gratitude, the services rendered by such leaders to forge communal amity.
It was through such services that communal and religious unity could be forged, rather than through legal means. People ought to realise that it was through the path laid by Buddhist, Islam, Hindu and Christian leaders and clergy that we could strive for peace and prosperity.
Everyone should unite and join hands in the spirit of brotherhood for the sake of unity amongst Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher communities. That would be the best tribute we could pay to past leaders such as A. C. Shahul Hameed.

DFCC Bank continued its revolutionary approach in presenting its annual report in a comprehensive yet concise format, in line with global trends and have released their 2017 annual report.
The Banks advances and loan book was up 15% to Rs 213,676 million, non-performing ratio down to 2.77% from 2.97%, deposits up 38% to Rs 193,308 million and profit after tax up 34% to Rs 4,415 million in 2017.
This Integrated Annual Report serves as a disclosure of the Banks strategy, governance, performance and prospects and how they help to create sustainable value within our operating environment giving key financial information while at the same time providing comprehensive compliance-related disclosures.
Continuing with the approach to reporting adopted in the last three years, this Report balances the need to communicate effectively through concise, relevant information (to a large and diverse stakeholder group), while at the same time providing comprehensive compliance-related disclosures.
Going beyond conventional reporting, we have implemented the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards format for reporting, an update to the GRI G4 format used in our previous annual reports. We continue to update our corporate website with a focus on investor relations, supplemented by an investor relations app for smart phones and other devices, the report said.
DFCC Bank Annual Report for 2017 covers the 12-month period from January 1 to December 31, 2017 and it also includes impactful thematic images.
DFCC Bank has continued to grow in 2017. Our results show the dynamic is changing. Profit was up by 34%, expenses carefully managed despite the cost of relocating and upgrading branches and increased investment in building the DFCC brand, Chairman, DFCC Royle Jansz commented to the review.The Bank has set itself a challenging target over the next three years, and our people are geared to bringing this plan to fruition, he further added.
Chief Executive Officer, Lakshman Silva commented that the highlights of DFCCs financial performance speak volumes of its success.
Advances and loan book was up 15% to Rs 213,676 million, non-performing ratio down to 2.77% from 2.97%, deposits up 38% to Rs 193,308 million and profit after tax up 34% to Rs 4,415 million. DFCC was the only commercial bank to have some form of upgrade during the rating period. The upgrades also reflect the fact that looking ahead, DFCCs strategies were acknowledged to provide the foundation for a sustainable progress.
The CEO added that going forward, DFCC has set in place plans to achieve a demanding target within the next three years. In doing so, we expect to be placed as a Systemically Important Bank in the upper quartile of commercial banks in Sri Lanka. A mix of complementary strategies will be employed, which would also include some Blue Ocean initiatives. In this context, DFCC will explore a range of opportunities in consolidation and offshore markets. The Bank will also leverage on its Group relationships particularly in the area of Public Private Partnerships, he added.

A dogs best friend
A heart-warming video shows a caring canine helping another dog to safety after it got its neck stuck in a railing.
Teacher Edith Govea, 33, captured the adorable rescue mission in the central Mexican city of San Luis de Potosi with her smartphone and shared the footage on Facebook.
It begins with a small white dog which has got stuck trying to wriggle through railings on the top of a courtyard wall and is struggling to push his way through.
Suddenly, a much larger German Shepherd appears and decides to literally lend a paw, using it to try to pull the little dog through the gap.
At first the bigger dogs efforts seem to make no difference so she tries with two paws and even her teeth as she gives the other dog a gentle tug by the scruff of his neck.
And, finally, she manages to drag the little dog far enough through the railings for him to squeeze the rest of the way through and jump down to the ground.
Govea shared the video on Facebook with the caption: Bunny: Hurry!!
Hurry!! Before my human comes!!, Shorty: Help me!!, Bunny: Yeah... yeah!!
The teacher later revealed that the heartwarming incident happened in the Pavon neighbourhood of San Luis Potosi.
Govea said the German shepherd really was called Bunny but the white dog was actually called Malik.
She added: I spend lot of time in this area and I saw these two dogs and I found it bizarre how he fought to help his friend.
Bunny lived in the house on the video while Malik lived in the neighbourhood and regularly called to visit his friend.
It is beautiful to see how dogs also show love, she added.
San Luis Potosi, commonly called SLP or simply San Luis, is the capital and most populous city of the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi.Mirror

Economic development, poverty alleviation and higher tax revenue through PPP introductions
In the late fifties the citizens of our country enjoyed very comfortable ways of easy living. The population was below 14 million and the city of Colombo was a merry making city in Asia. We had trolley buses plying in the city of Colombo operated with electricity and with very few cars and commercial vehicles, the streets of Colombo was noise and smoke free with much higher health standards enjoyed by the residents.
The trolley buses had automatic doors for both entrance and exit. The conductor had a ticket machine and was comfortably seated inside for passengers to buy the tickets and move forward. The ticket was a glazed one with high quality printing on it indicating the fair. There were no rushes to get in, or getting down. One had to merely ring one of the bells installed inside the trolley to get down. The getting down was only from the automatically operated front door. There were single and double decker trolley buses for passenger transport especially from Borella junction to Colombo Fort.
However, these trolley buses were discontinued by the Government with the setting up of the CTB (Central Transport Board).Then came the double decker buses which used to ply between all the main streets in Colombo. The Liberty Cinema junction resembled very much like London with red colour double deckers regularly passingby.
Singapore got their independence in 1965 and their first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on a visit to Sri Lanka (Ceylon at that time) echoed his dream of making Singapore another Ceylon. In the Colombo Fort area itself the visitors were able to enjoy the food, beverages and hospitality of four top restaurants, namely, Nanking Hotel, Hotel Metropole, Pagoda Restaurant and the Colombo Caf which had a Juke Box even to entertain the diners. The food and beverages served were quite extraordinary. The only star class tourist hotel at that time in Fort area was the Taprobane Hotel (Now the Grand Oriental Hotel). Hotel Ceylon Intercontinental opened for business in 1973, followed by Galadari and Ramada Rennaissance in 1985 with Colombo Hilton opening in 1987. In the immediate outskirts of Fort we had the Great Colonial Hotel by the name of Galle Face Hotel which still stands tall followed by Holiday Inn and Taj Samudra adding spice to the Galle Face Green. Except Ramada Rennaisance (which later became Colombo Renaissance and Trans Asia and now the Cinnamon Lake) and Intercontinental, almost all other hotel projects were foreign investments. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation were the developers for Ramada Renaissance.
People of Sri Lanka enjoyed a care free life style upto around 1982 before the ethnic turbulences took its toll from 1983. By that time with the support of open economy policies of the new Government in 1977 Sri Lanka developed its basic infrastructure for an economy based on market policies with liberalized trade practices. We are thankful to that Government for giving us a continued period of solid economic growth of five to six years.
We have now come out of ethnic war in the North and East which engulfed the whole country and should look for Public Private Partnerships for the economic upliftment of the country. The privatization of state owned plantation companies in late 1991 was a very good and encouraging example. State owned plantation companies belonged to the two main state entities, namely, Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) and Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) which were making huge losses due to multiple reasons, namely:
* Lower productivity levels and yields
* Trade Union action
* Absence of internal controls
* Poor marketing
* Lack of adequate funds for replanting
* Weak overall administration
* Very weak financial and cost controls
* Higher wages to workers and management irrespective of productivity standards and profits
After the privatizations, the new managements appointed by the new owners achieved the following goals for their respective plantation companies:
* Listing of shares in the Colombo Stock Exchange and rapid enhancing of the market price of shares
* Substantial Lease rentals to the state
* Taxes to the state
* Substantial dividends to the shareholders
* Substantial new capital was raised by way of Primary and rights issues in the Colombo bourse
* Ploughing back billions of rupees for replanting and to purchase fixed assets for the companies
* Substantial forex earnings
* Value addition to respective industries
* Promotion of Sri Lankan brand names for the produce
* Promotion of tourism with tourist visits to tea estates to witness various production processes and also to buy premium high quality tea
All above benefits were achieved by the 30 plus companies due to timely privatizations. It is indeed a success story and a win win situation for the state, the workers, investors, management and the public at large due to saving of losses by the Treasury. I read an article in an English Daily a few years back where a female tea plucker received a monthly pay packet of over Rs. 55,000 inclusive of incentives. This is a remarkable achievement in the quest for Empowering of Women in Sri Lanka. The motto was higher earnings for higher productivity. By now, the investors of plantation companies would have achieved both operating gains and holding gains through the Colombo Bourse. Some tea brands like Watawala are household names among the local consumers in addition to the penetration of export markets.
The Saga continued with the continuation of the privatization process through Air Lanka, Lanka Milk Foods, Gas Company, Insurance Corporation, Distilleries Corporation, Ceylon Hotels Corporation, Sri Lanka Telecom and a few others. However, Insurance Corporation and the Gas Company were taken back by the State since they were making very substantial profits even at the time of divesting of shares. Air Lanka was taken back after the Management Agreement ended with the operator. The taking backs were agreed mutually and fair values were paid by the State to the owners in taking back.
The PPP initiatives need be pursued at Provincial levels to accelerate Rural Economic Growth, Rural Poverty Alleviation, Mitigation of Crime Rates and Higher Tax Collection.
Bulk of the taxes of this country is paid by the Western Province consisting of the districts of Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara. This scenario is not healthy as the other eight Provinces are not contributing much to the economic development of Sri Lanka. Therefore, these eight Provinces should be subjected to a detailed analysis to spur the economic growth rates through PPP projects as there is plenty of unutilized land in these areas. The residents of these eight Provinces come to the Western Province in search of careers and employment overpopulating the Western Province and eventually polluting the Western Province in all angles. Since independence, none of the elected governments made a committed and serious attempt to develop these eight Provinces which even led to ethnic tensions and social unrest. Furthermore, empowerment of women and the youth were much neglected subjects. At present, there are very limited earning avenues for the residents of these eight Provinces and the per capita savings rates are at lower levels. As a result, the residents of these provinces looked to greener horizons abroad, especially in the Middle East. In addition, some people embark on unsafe boat journeys to reach Europe, Australia and other countries. However, the elected Governments may welcome these moves as the state coffers are annually filled up by foreign remittances from Sri Lankan workers, employed abroad. In the process, they face many difficulties in their day to day employment activities. At present, Sri Lanka earns around 7 billion US dollars annually from this source, meeting a great portion of the annual trade loss of the country.
One can understand the plight of the residents of these eight Provinces who are also subjected to regular adverse weather patterns and natural calamities. The newly elected 8,000 members at the recently held Local Government Elections in February 2018 can contribute to the development of their areas by making a concerted effort in identifying the priority projects for their areas and seek funding from the state and through PPP initiatives. The PPP initiatives can make a sizable contribution to ensure social and ethnic integration to meet the aspirations of the international community and the donor countries. This will also improve the human rights record in the eyes of the UN.
The state cannot meet the recurring losses of a large number of state instituitions every year due to debt servicing requirements. The tax payers of this country will be further burdened with direct taxes and the general public are also meeting a sizable burden for indirect taxes. Cost of living rises annually due to after effects of continued losses of state enterprises met by the state coffers. This process cannot go on for a long time as public unrest will surface at an alarming pace and our business community will shift their bases to other countries with lower taxes and progressive trade practices and law.
The general public, the politicians, corporate sector and the donor community of Sri Lanka voice their concerns in the implementation of PPP initiatives due to the absence of transparency in the processes from the beginning of PPP projects and the projects come in for constructive criticism from all quarters.
Given below is a useful guide to improve the transparency aspect in PPP Projects:
* Establishment of an exclusive website for PPP Projects in Sri Lanka
* Updating of the website on a fortnight basis with details of current & upcoming PPP projects
* Details of line ministries floating PPP tenders be included in the website and the requirements for simplified pre- qualifications
* Simplified tender application forms
* Strict adherence to closing dates, tender opening and tender awarding dates
* Avoidance of unsolicited proposals at all times.
* Appointment of unbiased and experienced members for Financial, Legal and Technical Evaluation committees
* Organisation of bidders conferences by Line Ministries
* Establishment of a data room containing all relevant information, documents and core project details open to all bidders. These should contain legal requirements as well.
* Information on contact details such as telephone numbers, fax numbers, email numbers and official addresses with names of contact personnel
The above will instill confidence into all prospective bidders and will draw a large number of bidders from both within and outside Sri Lanka as they will have confidence in all processes of PPP tenders.
Now let us look into the essential contents of a PPP contract. Some of them are listed below:
* Technical parameters
* Rights and obligations of all parties
* Risk-benefit allocations
* Project implementation time table and deadlines
* Liquidated damages payable by both parties for not meeting deadlines
* User fees
* Dealing with force majeure  events
* Rights for substitution
* Monitoring and supervision programmes
* Dispute resolution and termination
Line Ministries are required to attend to the following on a priority basis in a transparent manner with the sole objective of ensuring the successful implementation of PPP projects coming under their purview.
* Identification of PPP projects at rural and urban levels
* Documentation of same with project proposals
* Appointment of a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (CANC)
* Preparation of a PPP Risk Identification Matrix
* Preparation of a feasibility report including legal, technical, environmental and financial feasibilities.
* Technical feasibility should include an environment assessment based on prevailing and proposed Sri Lankan Environment Laws and social impact assessments to avoid future public and Political Implications
* A Market Assessment to assess the needs for the project and the benefits to the people in project - Area and the General Public at large
* Avoidance of conflicting situations for our neighbouring countries such as trade wars and  regional security conflicts
* Ensuring the achievement of Value For Money concept for the projects at all times
* Affordability of the project in line with budgetary allocations of Line Ministries
* PPP design should be in line with the economic policy of the country and should ensure self management and regular supervision as a matter of routine
Going deeper into the PPP initiatives of Sri Lanka, we do not have updated PPP guidelines yet. Most other Asian countries are far ahead of Sri Lanka. Recently, USAID funded Short Term Assistance to improve Public Financial Management Reforms (STAIR) project assisted Department of Public Finance to prepare draft PPP Guidelines. If it is approved by the cabinet it will revise and replace the guidelines of Government tender procedure Part II which is on Private Infrastructure Projects, (BOO/BOT/BOOT PROJECTS - January 1998).
The particular guidelines are applicable for soliciting, evaluation and procuring all projects to be developed on public private partnership basis. It also includes a separate PPP Manual for the benefit of the users, which elaborates detailed processes, procedures, templates and sample case studies. The Manual and PPP Guidelines include a clear transparent mechanism to take forward the unsolicited proposals on more globally accepted norms and standards. The guidelines also include some sections on proposal evaluation and some guiding steps for contract negotiations and risk allocation of PPP proposals. The policies and principles embodied in the Guidelines maybe applied with suitable modifications for the Provincial Councils and Local Authorities for the implementation of projects on PPP BASIS.
The draft PPP guidelines include the roles and responsibilities of Line Ministries and Contracting Authorities, Project Committee (PC), Cabinet Approved Negotiating Committee (CANC), Ministry of Finance and General Treasury, Attorney Generals Department (AGD), Cabinet of Ministers and CCEM Special Committee. It also includes the facilitation role of National Agency for PPP (NAPPP).
The draft PPP Guidelines provide a clear guidance on selection and identification of PPP projects, PPP Project Feasibility Analysis and Preparation, Competitive Bidding and Procurement of PPPs, Unsolicited proposals for PPPs on application of the Swiss challenge Procedure, Preliminary Evaluation of PPP proposals, PPP commercial and Financial Closure and PPP Contract Management and Performance Monitoring.
PPP initiatives will benefit the SME sector immensely as the sector is focused mainly on rural development, empowerment of women, augmentation of rural savings, lowering of unemployment and crime rates, increase in literacy rates and most importantly on higher rural economic growth rates to ensure higher GDP rates for the country over the years.
Some of the priority sectors for PPP projects include Garbage and Waste Disposal, Safe Drinking Water, Rural Power Generation, Public Transport, Rural Industries and Leisure. The regular adverse impacts on agriculture and other crops could be easily managed with well implemented PPP projects.
So let us not waste any further time as a Government alone cannot develop a country. The Private Sector should join hands with the Government especially to ensure economic growth in all nine Provinces as our population keeps growing at all times. Planning methodology is needed for Human Resource Development at all social levels. Senior citizens of this country deserve priority in the selection and implementation of PPP projects as they are conversant in all forward marching progressive ideas.
Foreign Governments have been assisting the PPP promotion during the last few years and should continue to do so until Sri Lanka achieves success and tangible results in their PPP drive. A residential mission to oversee the PPP programmes will be most welcomed by all citizens of this country who wish to see higher standards of living, lower taxes, social integration and safe living in the country.
I wish to sum up by quoting that the PPP Is not a monster but a mode of solid Good Governance.

Egg inside an egg
A hen has laid a small egg inside a much bigger egg.
Stockmans Eggs in Queensland, Australia, posted an image of the enormous egg on Sunday. People were excited.
Owner Scott Stockman told ABC news that the egg weighed 176g. It is similar in size to that of a goose.
The phenomenon of an egg in an egg is called a counter-peristalsis contraction, and happens when an egg that isnt quite ready makes its way towards the vent, but before its laid, goes back up inside a chickens reproductive line.
As the egg returns, a second egg forms around it. It is extremely rare that two fully formed eggs, one small, one large, are incubated together and laid. It does happen occasionally, however. Last year, for example.
The latest occurrence is confusing a lot of people online. Associate Professor Raf Freire, from Charles Sturt Universitys veterinary sciences school, told ABC: Biologically, Im struggling to understand why that smaller egg never dropped out, its very odd.
Still, Prof. Freire added that its not unusual for hens to retain eggs  which they often do when very stressed  but then they usually drop out the next day.
For a second ovum to be released prematurely, it could be that the hen was a bit stressed, but then really rather happy almost straight away afterwards. Who knows. Were not eggsperts...
Normally, a hen ovulates and releases an oocyte, which travels through the birds oviduct and forms the yolk.
Along the way, the oocyte collects layers of membranes and albumen  this is what creates the white part of an egg. In the uterus, a shell emerges.
As mentioned, its very rare for ovulation to happen before an egg is fully formed. Rarer still is an egg being sucked back up to the first area of the oviduct, and another to begin to form and encapsulate the first.
Also fascinating is that chickens have one passageway for everything  reproduction, urine (not liquid), and excrement  but turn their cloaca (scientific term for the hole) inside out when laying so that eggs dont ever come into contact with anything dirty. Mirror

Elegance personified
Mercy Nalini Edussuriya took over the reins of Visakha Vidyalaya as the Principal in the year 1988 and relinquished them ten years later leaving behind a legacy of continued excellence in academia, sports and extra-curricular activities and a school stronger and secure in its position as the leading girls school in the country.
She was the twelfth in a line of illustrious Principals who paved the path to excellence in achievement with a strong commitment to religion and culture. Armed with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Diploma in Education from the University of Peradeniya, and a Masters in Education Planning and Management from the UK, Edussuriya was the perfect person to take over the position of the Principal at the school.
I had no ambition to be the principal but the Ministry of Education recognized me and appointed me the principal. At that time very few people knew me but I was able to get the confidence of the people around me, she said.
Her coming to lead the school was viewed with mixed expectancy. Edussuriya says some even thought she was too simple to take on this onerous post. But as her tenure progressed and the school continued to top other schools in all areas, Edussuriya won the hearts of everyone. It is indeed quite a task for any Principal to have the complete support of the staff, parents and the love and respect of the students. But her impeccable character, honesty and integrity earned her all the respect.
When you are the head of any institution you have to be dedicated, honest and straight forward. Especially in a school you continuously have to deal with people. People from different levels and you have to be fair by everyone. Admission for grade one, for A/L classes and selecting children for positions such as prefects were the most difficult. There was pressure but I always was able to abide by the Ministry Circulars. I never took any admission outside the circulars which got me into clashes with some political leaders. Still when you do things with transparency, fairness and honesty you will have the courage to face such situations, she explained.
Edussuriya, a true mix of a liberal mind with an abiding respect for traditional values prepared the school to face the future with her unruffled calm over the school she heads. Neatly groomed Edussuriya is known as a sensible and caring Principal, conducting herself with quiet dignity, she was able to turn new chapters in school history.
During her tenure Visakha celebrated her 75th anniversary in 1992.At the O/L examination in 1996 Visakha Vidyalaya had 100 per cent passes, a rare achievement for any school at that time.At A/L exams Visakhians have come first in the island in Science, Commerce or Arts, and in special subjects like English as at the 98 Examination. Edussuriya introduced the study of Japanese language into the curriculum and Visakhians who have shown proficiency in this subject have been invited annually to Japan and Edussuriya accompanied the first batch of students to Japan. A new version of the Visakha Geeta Natakaya was staged as part of the 75th anniversary celebrations and Fiddler on the Roof was performed to crowded houses on three consecutive nights in 1998 which was a near-professional performance. This woman perennially in love with the work she does, said at present children are pressurized with studies. When you push children to achieve academic excellence so many other aspects are neglected. Irrespective of what happens to another person children will go their way with selfishness and unnecessary competition. Finally they dont have the ability to face life. As a result we hear incidents of children committing suicide when parents punish, when they dont achieve the expected results or at a failing love affair, she explained.
Book learning alone is not sufficient. Children should be able to face life situations without being defeated. They have to be able to adapt to situations and move forward. What is the purpose of education if the University student decides to take her life when things dont go her way Guidance programmes should be initiated in school for character formation. Teachers play an important role in a childs life. Their failure to create a child with thinking abilities is a reflected in the whole society, Edussuriya added.
After ten years of untiring efforts to inculcate values in Edussuriya did not stop her service at Visakha but took over Leeds International College, Panadura as the pioneering principal. She served there for another 15 years taking the total years of service to 51 in both private and government sectors.
I resigned from Leeds to spend time with my grandchildren and to travel. I also take time to get involved in religious activities. I am working with Jathika Mihiliya Padanama which works against harassment of women and children. In our life we have to think all are equal. When we look at a person we should look in line of religions, races or as male or female. We should see a human being who is able to develop the potential needed for a certain task, she said.
Finally she concluded that children with a solid basis at home will grow up well. Parents have an important role as well. The values parents inculcate in children, they never forget. Foundation has to be laid by parents which the teachers have to take forward, she said with a graceful smile.

Point of view
Sri Lankan equity markets closed largely flat this week, as communal violence clouded sentiment and investors opted to remain on the sidelines.
The main share price Index fell for three consecutive days at the start of the week, falling to a 5-week low of 6503 points on Wednesday as communal riots failed to ease even by midweek.
The Index consequently lost 53 points but gained 47 points on Thursday and Friday as the racial violence dissipated by week end, helping the Index close at 6,551.19 points, just 6 points lower than last weeks close.
Foreign investors who were a major driver of equities in 2017 meanwhile, remained cautious on domestic equities this week, and while this weeks communal tensions didnt trigger a major equity selloff, net foreign inflows fell to a 2018 low of Rs. 193.4Mn by end week.
Although the net inflow position was a reversal from last weeks net outflows of Rs. 489Mn, this weeks net inflow was notably lower than average weekly net foreign inflows recorded over 2018 so far (Rs. 801Mn).
Local institutional and HNI investors also remained relatively subdued this week, with crossings for the week falling to 43% cf. last weeks exceptional participation levels of 74% of market activity.
Institutional and HNI interest was driven mainly by blue-chips such as HNB (57% of total crossings) and JKH (14%) which cumulatively accounted for 70% of the weeks total crossings, while the remainder was driven by interest in mid-caps such as NTB (10%),TJL (9%) SAMP (6%) and LION (5%).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for directional cues from political developments in the upcoming week.
Market earnings rise 15% Y-o-Y over Dec17
Total1 market earnings for the recently concluded earnings season indicated a Quarter-on-Quarter growth in earnings, as earnings 2 for the Dec17 quarter rose 41% Q-o-Q to Rs.84.4Bn.
This compares to the Rs. 75.8Bn recorded by the full market in Mar17 and the Rs. 53.7Bn recorded in Jun17 and Rs. 59.9Bn recorded in Sept17.
Growth over the quarter was driven largely by sectors such as Banks, Finance& Insurance, (+61% Y-o-Y), F&B (+41% Y-o-Y), Teleco (+182% Y-o-Y), Land & Property (+306% Y-o-Y) and Healthcare (+13% Y-o-Y).
While the growth in Q-o-Q earnings is notable, it is also largely reflective of the traditionally stronger Dec quarter; indeed, market earnings over the Dec17 quarter on a Y-o-Y basis was a more restrained 15%, reflecting the general slowdown in overall GDP growth which is estimated to be <4% in 2017 (GDP growth over 9M17 was 3.7% Y-o-Y).
On a cumulative3 9M basis too, corporate earnings over the period fell 3.8% Y-o-Y to Rs. 174Bn relative to Rs. 182Bn reported by the total market in Dec16.
The decline was driven mainly by lower corporate earnings in sectors such as Manufacturing (-22% Y-o-Y), Construction (-135% Y-o-Y), Teleco (-13% Y-o-Y), Hotels & Travels (-99% Y-o-Y), Motors (-23% Y-o-Y) and Power & Energy (-99% Y-o-Y).
Nevertheless, stronger corporate earnings growth in sectors such as Banks (+16% Y-o-Y), Insurance & Other (+43% Y-o-Y), Diversified (+12% Y-o-Y), Land & Property (+65% Y-o-Y), Healthcare (+53% Y-o-Y) and F&B (+3% Y-o-Y) helped prop cumulative market earnings.
On a trailing 12M basis meanwhile, market earnings rose 10% Y-o-Y to Rs.274Bn helping push the PER levels down to 11.63x relative to 11.96x in the comparable period in 2016.

Ex-LTTE activist nabbed in attempt to flee country
A former LTTE activist who was trying to flee to India, was arrested at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) by Immigration and Emigration officers and handed over to Katunayake Police on March 9. The suspect was due to leave for India by a flight scheduled at 2.10 p.m. He was arrested around 12 noon, before he could board the flight.
Investigations revealed that the suspect had been arrested by security forces and detained for six years as an LTTE suspect and released on September 23, 2016 on condition that he reported to police once a month.
Furthermore, he had been forbidden from travelling aboard.
The reason for his visit to India was that he was due to attend a pooja at a kovil, the suspect had said.
He had been a former member of the Jaffna Municipal Council and an active member of the LTTE as well.
Katunayake police are investigating.

Extremism should be wiped out - Malwatte Chief Prelate
Extremism should be totally wiped out from the country. When the Armed Forces and Police are available to protect and safeguard the public there is no need for other auxiliary Balasenas or Balakayas to offer them protection, the Most. Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddharatha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter said.
The Prelate said what the Maha Sangha ought to do was to join hands with devotees to develop the village rather than trying to build the country.
When they build and develop the village, the country as a whole would automatically develop, the Mahanayake Thera said.
The Prelate who said that extremist organisations were spreading extremism and creating communal division in the country by openly maintaining offices emphasised that the government should pay more attention to this.
The Malwatte Prelate expressed these sentiments when a group of Parliamentarians led by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya visiting Kandy, called on him at his temple and received his blessings on March 10.
The Prelate said each and every temple had a devotee village assigned to it. It the Maha Sangha at the temple guided the inhabitants of the village on the correct path, they would be able to uplift the whole nation in keeping with their expectations. The Prelate who said that Sri Lakans usually had a short memory added that the recent incidents too may be completely forgotten within a short passage time.
They should remember that the country suffered immense setbacks in the past due to the 30-year-war and incidents like the Black July, the Malwatte Prelate said
The recent incidents in Kandy not only tainted the countrys image, but could even have an impact on the countrys economy. He said the perpetrators of the recent violence should be identified and brought before the law.
The Most Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter delivering an Anusasana to the team led by the Speaker, said the Sinhala Buddhists are a very sensitive group of people. But, some of them had been induced to violent acts by a few extremist groups.
The Anunayake Thera said he highly appreciated the decision taken by Parliamentarians of all political parties and groups to join lands in working out a programme to help restore peace in the area by forgetting petty differences.
Minister Risarth Bathiutheen said he would request the government to conduct an investigation into the Wilpattu issue and divulge the truth to the country.
He said reports spread about his involvement in clearing the Wilpattu areas for settlement, were all false.
Other members of the Parliamentary team who accompanied the Speaker included Deputy Speaker Tilanga Sumathipala, Ministers Gayantha Karunathilaka, Susil Premajayantha and Mano Ganeshan, Deputy Minister A.H.M.

Recent events in Kandy district
Faizer calls for Presidential Commission
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha condemning the recent incidents that occurred in the Kandy District, called for an an independent Presidential Commission of Inquiry to be appointed immediately to seek out and apprehend those responsible for these events.
In a statement to the media, the Minister also called on the government to actively work on implementing mechanisms to compensate all those affected by the violence.
I am viewing these incidents that occurred, not from the stand point of race, rather as a Sri Lankan, he said.
Our brave men and women of the forces sacrificed their lives to free the island from the grips of terror, so that we, the people could live in peace and harmony under one flag as Sri Lankans. It is unfortunate that some of us have not learnt the lessons of the past and are still acting on the basis of race and religion.
It was evident that there was a hidden political hand, playing an active role in the events that led up to Kandy for narrow political gains. It was clear that these events were used as a political platform to spew religious hate, racism and also to instil fear. I strongly condemn these attempts to shine a negative light upon the country within the international arena, along with the crude ploy to destabilise the country.
I request these individuals to not betray our beloved motherland for petty political gains.

Female reps in LG Councils up by 29 percent: CaFFE
The female representation in many of the Local Government Councils has increased by 29 percent which is an exceptional achievement, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
The figure is based on the additional lists provided by the political parties and independent groups to the Election Commission.
CaFFE observed that the female representation at LG Councils had increased from 1 percent to 29 percent, which was cited by them as being significant and exceptional. In addition, 325 of 340 councils have fulfilled the minimum requirement of 25 percent female representation.
Only 15 Local Government Councils have failed to fulfil the required proportion of 25 percent female representation, CAFFE observed.
Kotagala, Peduruthuduwa, Mannar, Musali, Werugal, Trincomalee Town and Kadawath, Thambalagamuwa, Muttur, Wanathawilluwa, Kateyithiw, Padiyatalawa, Tirukkowil, Manmuneyi Municipal Councils and Trincomalee and Kinniya Urban Councils are among them..
CaFFE noted that 2,526 female representatives have been selected to the LG Councils at the 2018 local government election. 8,721 council members were elected at the LG election 2018. Of the 17, 128 female candidates who competed in the election, 535 have won their electorates.
The additional lists submitted by political parties and independent groups have proposed 1,991 females as council members. The United National Party records the inclusion of the highest number of female representatives.

Fight cancer with magnetotactic bacteria
Cancer means growing cells in particular area of body in an abnormal way as well as in an invasive way. When it spreads to other parts of the body becomes incurable. This process is called metastasis. There are several traditional anti-cancer therapies such as surgical, radio therapy, chemotherapy to cure or stop cancers.
Though they are much advanced, they still have large scale lacunas. One of them is the generation of resistance. This may lead to have alternate therapies. They are gene therapy, Dichloroacetate therapy, complementary therapy, insulin potentiating therapy and bacterial treatments. All of these therapies contain deep rooted potential to cure the cancer and as well as side issues.
Therefore a treatment with more potentiality as well as less number of side effects has to be selected. Recently nano-technology opened many doors in cancer therapy. Magneotatic bacteria (MTB) and their magnetosomes offer great promise in cancer therapy in various ways.
These magnetotactic bacteria are omnipresent, aquatic and motile bacteria that can mineralize magnetosome. That magnetosomes are organelle with nano-sized magnetic magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4) crystals. They are in various arrangements. These crystals are encased by a membrance which can control the crystal size and morphology. It also can generate a matrix for the function and stability of magnetosomes. Therefore magnetosomes play major role as biogenic material with high bio and nano technological potential. Whole living cell of magnetotactic bacteria and magnetosomes can both apply in various areas of cancer therapy in many ways.
There are chemically prepared iron oxide in market. However they cannot compete or match with magnetosomes because of their inherent magnetic features, genetically controlled uniform nanomorphology, narrow sized distributions, having a high bio membrane envelope.
Chemotherapy is one of the effective therapies against active cancer cells. Here anti-cancer drugs are used in single or in combination. But as a side effect these drugs damage the healthy blood cells and hair cells as a result cancer patients experience hair loss in treatments. And these drugs should be below the toxic level and above the level of minimal therapeutic effect. Unluckily the human body does not have the ability to segregate these spatio-targeted profiles. Therefore drugs distribute throughout the body also can affect the healthy organs. In addition body has a special defense mechanism to excrete the foreign or strange materials that enters to body.
To meet these challenges, most of the researchers have investigated the drug delivery system with more biocompatible and biodegradable materials. This will lead to reduce in side effects. The concept used here is to locate drugs at the targeted site at the required concentration for the right period of time. Recently the magnetotactic bacteria and magnetosomes have proved to be smart drug carriers due to their unique features.
Magnetosomes contain amino groups and glycerol in their membrane surface which coupled with ligands. Accordingly they can act as productive drug carriers and with higher drug loading ratio that other artificial magnetic particles. Magnetoliposomes coupled with magnetosomes have been evaluated for drug targeting and controlled release at tumor sites.
The capture volume of the magnetoliposomes was 1.7 times higher than that of artificial magnetic particles. In addition magnetoliposomes release their content over two hours under a rotating magnetic field.
Radiotherapy is the application of the radiations like gamma rays, X rays, electron beam to weaken or stop the cancer cell from further growth and multiplication. Magnetosomes can also be coupled with radioactive isotopes. These offer better internal radiation of solid tumors because of their accurate targeted delivery.
As result of lack of international guidelines to measure the toxicity of nanomaterials, commercialization of magnetotactic bacteria products and process is lagging.
In addition to these, preparations must comply with the industrial and healthcare requirements If these lacunas are overcome magnetotactic bacteria and magnetosomes will play an important role in cancer therapy in near future due to their superior features.

France see off laboured England to hand Ireland title
PARIS, Saturday: A revitalised France beat an uninspired England 22-16 on Saturday to claim a rare victory over their arch-rivals whose defeat handed the Six Nations title to Ireland.
Les Bleus, who had lost nine of their last 11 meetings against England in the Championship, prevailed through penalties by Maxime Machenaud (4) and Lionel Beauxis and a penalty try while their opponents scored two penalties and conversion by Owen Farrell, a penalty by Elliot Daly and a try by Jonny May.
Ireland top the table with 19 points from four games after securing a 28-8 bonus-point victory over Scotland earlier on Saturday, meaning they cannot be caught by England when the two teams meet at Twickenham next weekend.
France, who narrowly lost their first two matches against Ireland and Scotland, defended furiously throughout and it became obvious that England, who needed a bonus-point win to keep their title hopes alive, would not score the four tries they needed. It was Englands second defeat in a row after they lost to Scotland in the previous round of matches and only their third in 27 matches under coach Eddie Jones.
France collapsed the scrum early on and Farrell, captain in the absence of the injured Dylan Hartley, converted the resulting penalty. England enjoyed possession but could not find a way through a solid French defence. The visitors, however, pinched three French lineouts in a row to continue their domination, although the hosts threatened after Remy Grosso ran 40 metres after stealing the ball in his 22 metres. England struggled at the breakdown but Daly landed a 53-metre penalty to double their advantage midway through the first half. Number eight Nathan Hughes was carried off the pitch with a leg injury and was replaced by Sam Simmonds as Machenaud converted his first penalty attempt, only for Farrell to restore a six-point advantage as France were penalised for collapsing a maul.
France piled the pressure in Englands 22 but were only rewarded with a penalty after a dangerous tackle.
Machenaud slotted it home and levelled with a 45-metre kick after England were penalised for offside shortly before halftime. Nine minutes into the second half, the crowd went into raptures when France were handed a penalty try after Benjamin Fall was tackled high by Anthony Watson after collecting a superb kick to the corner by Machenaud. Watson picked up a yellow card for his dangerous tackle and Les Bleus came close to scoring another try but England held them over the line at the end of a lightning-quick counter- attack.
Machenaud converted another penalty as France extended their lead to 10 points but the visitors reduced the arrears six minutes from time when May touched down in the corner after England stole yet another French line-out.
But replacement flyhalf Beauxis converted a routine penalty to give France breathing space with two minutes left and the home side survived a late onslaught to beat England for the first time since 2015. - Agencies

Government must continue peoples mandate: Sampanthan
Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R. Sampanthan said the present coalition government must continue to implement the mandate received from the people in 2015 and that it cannot deviate from this mandate for any reason.
Sampanthan made this observation when he, along with several other TNA members, met the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman on Friday (09), at the Opposition Leader's office in Parliament.
Sampanthan, appraising the present political situation in the country, said that the government cannot fail to proceed with the Constitution-making process. If the government abandons the process, it would only mean that the state is unable to comply with the resolution unanimously adopted by the Sri Lankan Parliament for the enactment of a constitution for Sri Lanka as one single and indivisible country, he added. Sampanthan also urged the international community to play a constructive role in the matter as well.
Speaking on the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution, Sampanthan stated that the resolution must be implemented fully. He requested closer engagement of the international community, to hold the Sri Lankan government accountable for its own commitments. Delays in adhering to the resolution has made people lose confidence in the government and its structures. The international community must ensure that commitments are fulfiled without delay. The International community has an obligation towards the Tamil people in achieving a lasting solution to the national question. Sampanthan added.
The TNA, issuing a press release, stated that the UN Under-Secretary-General has informed the TNA delegation that he has raised concerns with President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to the issues mentioned by the delegation at the meeting. The release also noted that Feltman would be briefing the UNHRC High Commissioner on his return, about the concerns raised by TNA members.

## Title: GramaShakthi comes to the fore
## Supertitle:

GramaShakthi comes to the fore
There are nearly 1.65 million smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka who are toiling on 2.3 million hectare of agricultural land. On an average, these smallholder farms operate on 1.2 hectare of land. For decades, these smallholders have continued with the age old agricultural practices with little innovation. Moreover, consecutive governments, apart from the fertilizer subsidy or ad hoc programmes for the encouragement of agriculture, had done very little to improve the farmers livelihood. Thus, his very existence swung like a pendulum from worry over subsidies to debt. This was until the government proposed the Grama Shakthi programme.
Independent Consultant to the World Bank, UNDP and Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and former Senior Lecturer in Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya, Dr Arumugam Kandiah who recently returned to Sri Lanka from the United States, believes that the Grama Shakthi programme if implemented correctly, could significantly alleviate rural poverty and more importantly, make farming a profitable profession even to the smallholder.
Since 2014, he had been working with rural development and water management projects in the country, especially in the North, to uplift the most significant sector in the area - agriculture.
Why are they poor
The Dry zone covers nearly two thirds of Sri Lankas land area, which is characterized by an annual rainfall ranging between 1200 and 1900mm with a distinct dry season from May to September. The Wet Zone in the meantime, receives a mean annual rainfall of over 2500mm without pronounced dry periods. The Intermediate Zone receives between 1900 and 2500 mm and has a short and less prominent dry season.
A significant proportion of these smallholder farmers are poor, particularly those in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, explained Dr Kandiah, while the reasons for this are many. For starters, the cost of entry into farming is high. He or she would have to purchase seeds, fertilizer, pesticides in addition to spending their money on labour for clearing the land and planting the crop. Most of these costs are met through agricultural loans which more often than not, lead to greater debts rather than profits.
Dr Kandiah further added that a lack of technical know-how, poor management of water, lack of marketing and sales of products in addition to improper storage, had worsened the situation for a smallholder farmer.
The farmer today is a subsistence farmer and we have not been able to get him out of it he said.
More importantly, the agriculture sector is yet to get the average farmer move away from just rice farming to grow more high value crops.
This is the key. They could grow their rice, but they must also be able to grow other higher value cash crops, which would supplement their income.
Despite these challenges however, agriculture; for a people who have always been inclined towards the land, could be a way out of poverty, said Dr Kandiah.
The Department of Census and Statistics had estimated the level of poverty in 2016 to stand at 4.1 percent; which had decreased from 6.7 percent in 2012/13. From 2002 to 2016, the poverty index had shown a downward trend. Thus in 2016, approximately 843,913 individuals were in poverty, compared 1.3 million in 2012, pointed out Dr Kandiah.
Poverty reduction is closely linked to agriculture. There is good news and bad news here. The good news is that, (according to a World Bank study), agriculture had been an important driver of poverty reduction and which accounted for nearly one third of the decline in poverty over the past decade.
Poverty reduction in Sri Lankas rural areas was driven by higher agricultural wages which grew annually by an average of 5.7 percent during 2006 to 2013 and caused rural poverty to fall rapidly than in other sectors, he said.
The bad news, however is that, there is a risk that these gains in the agriculture sector may not be sustainable if agriculture productivity does not improve and the sector does not start to modernize through diversification, commercialization and value addition.
Grama Shakthi
It was to overcome such challenges that, Grama Shakthi was introduced; a flagship development programme launched by the President for a Sustainable Sri Lanka, with a robust economy free of all forms of poverty by the year 2030.
According to Dr Kandiah, Grama Shakthi granted top priority to agriculture with emphasis to small farmers. It also recognized that rural development and agricultural development go hand in hand and that the farmer must be at the center of any poverty alleviation and rural development drive.
It aims to build capacity, enhance farmers access to credit, improve marketing facilities and tax and duty concessions on essential agricultural equipment that are imported into the country.
In addition to this programme, the President has also launched the National Food Production Drive, aimed at reviving agriculture and ensuring food security. The programme aims to bring about an agricultural rejuvenation and to sustainably continue agricultural production in the face of weather and climate related changes and challenges.
The Ministry of Agriculture, as a part of the National Food Production Drive, has launched a three-year programme called the National Food Production Programme, 2016-2018. This programme would focus on making the country self-sufficient in locally cultivated food crops such as Chilli, Onion, Potato, Maize, Cowpea, Kurakkan, etc. By this programme, the Government will help the farming community by providing scientific knowledge, infrastructure facilities and other agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizer required for food crop cultivation.
More importantly, the Grama Shakthi programme had decided to work within the existing government structures, such as the Grama Niladhari and District Secretariats, rather than create new institutions.
We are happy that there is interest in agriculture and endorsement from the top, said Dr Kandiah.
Agriculture is not just rice
Today, approximately 60 percent cultivate both paddy and upland crops and another 40 percent predominantly cultivate upland crops.
Paddy cultivation ensures food security, but paddy is not a cash crop, said Dr Kandiah, as he added that it also required relatively large quantities of water, compared to upland crops. In the dry zone where water is a scarce commodity; paddy cultivation as seen in the recent past, was becoming difficult and uneconomic, even in irrigation schemes due to unprecedented and prolonged droughts.
Paddy remains the major crop to cultivate during the Maha (wet) season in the lowlands of the dry zone (except in the Jaffna Peninsula), but it is not the best crop to cultivate during the Yala (dry) season.
Dr Kandhiah thus was of the opinion that it was time to focus on diversifying the production structure, Out of the relatively low value food crops and move towards high-value agriculture and promote agriculture exports.
This is critical to sustaining income growths going into the future, accelerating poverty reduction and reversing the trend in increasing inequality, he added.
This would also mean that small farmers should be engaged growing more cash crops, namely, fruits and vegetables, which generate a higher income as compared to rice. This in turn, would need, more intensive crop production, higher levels of technology, better crop management and investments in post-harvest management, marketing and better organized value chains overall.
This will thus trigger employment growth and more productive jobs in rural areas. This shift would also imply a move towards a more high-value production structure, agro-processing and value addition activities and increased competitiveness, he explained.
Need for modernization
In many of the dry zone districts, nearly 40 percent are full-time, profit motivated farmers. However, despite cultivating potentially high value cash crops, many do not make sufficient profits, The main reason being farmers continue to use traditional farming practices which are technologically outdated and unsustainable, Dr Kandiah said.
Further, traditional farming practices waste water, overuse mineral fertilizer, produce sub-optimal yields and adversely has an impact on the environment. It is here that one of the projects of Grama Shakthi turns very useful - it is to introduce drip irrigation systems for small holder farmers. Dr Kandiah evaluated that this could potentially increase the crop yield by more than two-fold, save more than 50 percent of water required under traditional irrigation and increase cropping intensity to 300 percent, while greatly reducing adverse environmental impacts and vulnerability to climate change risks.
The programmes National Drip Irrigation Project (NDIP), which aims at introducing drip irrigation technology and associated agronomic practices to small holder farmers nationwide, would benefit 9,000 small holder farmers from the five dry zone provinces, namely, Northern, North Central, Eastern, Uva, and the Southern Provinces.
In drip irrigation, water is applied precisely to the crop very near to its root system, minimizing any wastage. Each drop of water is used by the plant. The efficiency of water use is 95 percent compared to 45 percent under traditional surface irrigation. The degree of water saving varies with the design, type of the drip system, crops grown and management practices. On average, 50 percent of water could be saved. It is possible to achieve 70-80 percent water saving in perennial crops.
Drip irrigation also avoids heavy pumping of wells during dry months, thus, mitigating against serious risks of saltwater intrusion and related health hazards.
Additionally, the fertigation system that is used with this irrigation system, applies a measured amount of fertilizer close to the roots of each plant. As a result, the applied fertilizer is fully absorbed by the crop; ground water pollution is prevented with significant savings to the fertilizer cost of production.
Commercialization of small holder agriculture
Having taken out various loans to grow the crop, many smallholder farmers in this country find that they have limited opportunities to sell them. This results more often than selling the crop at a lesser rate than expected to the first buyer that comes along, thus perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
Many of small holder farmers sell their commodities in markets that are less demanding, but also less rewarding, such as village markets or the Pola and road-side stands. Others sell through intermediaries, due to the small scale of their production, the high transaction costs involved in reaching more distant markets and their inability to comply with the requirements relating to volume, quality and timely delivery demanded by modern agricultural value chains. The multiple challenges faced by smallholders pose major obstacles that prevent them from integrating into rapidly evolving national and international markets, said Dr Kandiah.
To overcome this problem, he proposed that alliances between farmers (farmer organizations) and private agribusinesses be promoted. Hence, turning him into an agribusinessman rather than simply a farmer, with the provision of technical assistance and business development training.
Farmers should be assisted to shift from purely production oriented farming to market-based farming, he said.
As a stepping stone in this direction, Dr Kandiah through the Grama Shakthi programme had asked that preliminary value addition centers be established. When it comes to the North, a dedicated economic centre in Jaffna to bring the farmer to market has been proposed. The preliminary value addition center he explained, would help the farmer sort out his goods and prepare them in the best possible way to fetch a good price. He is also working with the Industrial Technical Institute to introduce ways in which produce could be kept for longer period with minimum refrigeration.
Many small holders are excluded from formal value chains, because formal value chains usually demand better or more uniform quality produce. Thus, formal value chains are traditionally linked to larger farms or more organized groups of small farmers to more commercial wholesalers and from there to supermarkets or exporters. This quality has been accentuated by the explosive growth of supermarkets in Sri Lanka. Many small producers are thus limited to markets characterized by low-quality products and low prices and low returns - hence a frequent concern is to find ways to integrate small producers into more modern value chains, both domestic and export-oriented.
In addition, Dr Kandiah has also proposed a farm input supply centre be set up in every district- a one stop shop for all farming needs; from fertilizer to seeds, so that the farmers could concentrate more of their time on the field.
Working together with the Department of Agriculture, Dr Kandiah and his team have been conducting farmer awareness and training programmes in the North. These programmes also look to tailor make the training to suit the farmers needs,
There is no blanket approach. You have some farmers who are doing very well for themselves, whilst others are struggling. So the formers needs would be different to others, while they would just need a slight push. So we must take this into account, he said.
Climate Smart Agriculture
Finally, as climate changes becomes the biggest challenge to agriculture around the world, focus had now shifted to Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA).
CSA aims to tackle three main objectives: Namely sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and income; adapting and building resilience to climate change and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible.
According to climatic predictions, Sri Lankas wet areas are turning wetter, while dry areas are turning drier, directly affecting the agricultural activities in the wet and dry zones. Annual rainfall is expected to increase by a minimum of 121 mm in the wet zone, droughts would be magnified, particularly in the intermediate and dry zones. Sri Lankan agriculture had already felt the effect of extreme weather events and climate changes, including, a slow but steady rise of temperature (0.010.03 C per year); high-intensity rainfall resulting in landslides and soil and coastal erosion; salinity intrusion into soil and aquifers and increasingly extreme droughts. CSA technologies and practices thus present opportunities for addressing climate change challenges, as well as for promoting economic growth and development of the agriculture sector for small-holder farmers.
Micro irrigation in general and drip irrigation in particular is CSA with regard to water management practices of small holding farmers engaged in the production of high cash value crops in the uplands. Adoption of CSA technologies such as drip irrigation, fertigation, mulching, use of organic manures, etc. would also require well-articulated knowledge management systems and improving small-holding farmers access to financial instruments, resources and markets. Capacity building, supporting the sharing of knowledge and experience, creating incentives through social, legal, institutional, or economic and market mechanisms, long-term strategic investments in infrastructure, productive capacity, improved products and services and public-private partnerships are essential to ensure that sustainable agriculture and CSA objectives are achieved and longer-term benefits delivered, said Dr Kandiah.

Harnessing Suns power
The ongoing summit of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in India marks a watershed moment for solar power in the Asia Pacific region. President Maithripala Sirisena is participating in the summit, highlighting Sri Lankas commitment to solar power.
Sri Lanka has a head start over many other countries in this sector, having successfully waged a solar power battle (Surya Bala Sangramaya) to bring the power of the sun to the masses. The Government also provides many incentives and concessions for those converting to solar power and one can even sell any excess energy to the National Grid. The Government is also going ahead with several new solar power projects, including a 10 MW project in Vavunathiv, Batticaloa.
On its part, the ISA wants to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than US $ 1000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy, and the global deployment of over 1,000 gigawatt (GW) of solar capacity. India, where the ISA is meeting now, has set an ambitious target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy, including 100 GW from solar by 2020 as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the ISA have also signed a cooperation arrangement to promote solar energy deployment in Asia and the Pacific. The cooperation envisages solar power generation, solar based mini-grids, and transmission systems for integrating solar energy into grids. The ISA and the ADB would also cooperate on knowledge sharing and developing technology roadmaps for the promotion of solar energy.
We have barely realized the potential of solar power. The energy that the Sun gives every second is actually enough to provide all of the planets energy needs for several years, but technology has not yet progressed to that level. However, the efficiency of solar panels is increasing by the day and costs of panels and inverters are falling. Indeed, according to Indias The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) Chief Ajay Mathur, solar power will cost less than thermal power in just six to seven years. At the moment, the cost factor has become a deterrent for the widespread adaptation of solar power, though many countries provide incentives to go solar.
Solar power has developed rapidly over the last 25 years, a period sometimes called the sunrush. There was just 100 MW capacity worldwide in 1992, which has grown to 300 GW by 2017. Costs have gone down by an astounding 86 per cent from 2009 to 2017. But this is an industry that cannot afford to rest on its laurels. Researchers around the world are racing to explore new materials which can eke out more energy from the suns photons and be used more flexibly than todays panels. Todays silicon (Photovoltaic panels) could be complemented or replaced by those made from a new material called Perovskite that could enable the manufacture of cheap, highly efficient solar coatings that could be unspooled from a printer much as a newspaper is printed. Perovskite captures energy from a different part of sunlights wavelength than silicon, so scientists plan to layer it atop silicon, to maximise electricity generation.
Solar power is not just for residential or commercial purposes. It was reported recently that a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka had patented a solar-powered car. The chief incumbent of the International Meditation Centre at Rathmalkanda Aranyaya (hermitage) in Kitthalella, Bandarawela Ven. Madawala Upali Thera has received this patent for his invention. Worldwide, such efforts are underway to build solar powered vehicles most of which are featured at a solar car race held in Australia.
Sri Lanka which gets year-round sunshine is a prime candidate for solar power and the other leading source of renewable energy, wind power. Being a net oil importer (at a cost of US$ 6 billion a year), it is important to move away from our dependence on fossil fuels and thermal power. Besides, oil is running out and may be gone in less than 100 years. In this context, the Governments recent decision to phase out diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040 is highly commendable. In the meantime, there should be a gradual shift to electric vehicles and renewable energy.
The good news is that scientists are close to cracking the holy grail of renewable energy  nuclear fusion, which is the same process powering the Sun. A fusion reactor works by forcing two hydrogen atoms to become a single helium atom, a process that releases subatomic particles that generate intense heat. A commercial fusion reactor would use the same power source to boil water into steam and turn electrical generators.
Now the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a new company founded by the schools scientists (Commonwealth Fusion Systems) believe they are less than two decades away from turning nuclear fusion into a practical energy source thanks to new technologies that have just become available. This means that the world could finally move away from fossil fuels by around 2050 and fully embrace renewable energy.

International recognition for SLs reconciliation efforts affected - Sajith
The international recognition received by Sri Lanka for the progress it has made in reconciliation efforts was severely affected by the recent racial and religious conflicts fabricated by power-hungry politicians, Minister Sajith Premadasa said yesterday. These power-hungry elements trigger and exploit such racial and religious conflicts in order to open up a shortcut to get back into Temple Trees or Presidents House, he said.
The Housing and Construction Minister made these observations at a ceremony to hand over the Helasihagama model village to the public. This model village was established at a cost of Rs. 15.6 million as a part of the governments Uda Gammana Model Village Programme.
Minister Premadasa said that some groups who call themselves patriots are burning down houses for their personal political gain instead of building houses. They fabricate racial and religious conflicts. They burn down shops and religious places. The international and nongovernmental organizations are not attacking our war heroes thanks to our governments policies. We did not achieve such recognition with a hostile approach; instead, we relied on our well-thought out foreign policies. Our achievement is jeopardized by these conflicts forged by some groups who attempt to fulfill their political needs. They are trying to turn this country into a burning hellhole. Do you remember Black July in 1983 How much did we lose from that afterwards he asked. Minister Premadasa pointed out that Sri Lanka lost an agreement signed with a donor organisation from the Middle East which was willing to assist 2.5 million homeless families. The agreement was to provide housing loan facilities and aid to these people. However, following the tense situation recently in Kandy, the organisation called off the agreement.
We not only lost human lives and property, we also lost potential donors and investors who are willing to work with us. Why are these groups doing this They dont do this to protect their race or religion, but to succeed in their personal agendas, Minister Premadasa stated.
He said that there definitely is an invisible hand behind the deaths, acts of violence, and burglaries reported in the country. Referring to this movement to forge ethnic and religious tension among communities to be a national conspiracy, Minister Premadasa further said, These persons have expert knowledge in starting brawls.
If they are Buddhists, they should not destroy, but build temples and Dhamma schools in villages. But they cannot get votes by doing so.
I have personal experience from Hambantota with regard to that. They build up their vote base by triggering ethnic and religious conflicts.
The Minister urged all communities to carry the country forward leaving all animosities behind.

Land to resettle families identified
Land to accommodate farmer families displaced by the building of the lower Malwathu Oya reservoir has been identified.
According to the Irrigation Department, 13 ancient tanks will be submerged when the building of the reservoir is completed. The farmer families cultivating under these tanks are being resettled on 947 acres between Kaluwila and Narawila junction and on 1,260 acres in Gatamuna, Nalanda, Randeniya, Handapangoda, Sooriyathanna, Rathgama and Aluthgama, in the south canal bank. The 13 small- and medium-scale tanks that will be submerged by the Malwathu Oya reservoir are Madawachchiya Eliyakudawewa, Eliyamahawewa, Weliwawa, Puliyankulama, Ruwanmaduwa, Upathissagama, Sinnorukandawewa, Diyamathurawa, Kimbulwewa, Moragaswewa, Kukpitiyawa, Sarambakulamawewa and Rassinhawewa tanks.
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed irrigation authorities to complete the resettlement programme before taking on the reservoir construction work so as to avoid a repetition of the Yan Oya reservoir project's resettlement project.
The water capacity of the proposed lower Malwathu Oya reservoir is 169,440 acre feet, making it the largest water source in the Anuradhapura District. The Yan Oya reservoir in the Horawpothana Wahalkada area, consisting of 149,000 acre feet, would be the second-largest reservoir. At present, out of the existing 13 major reservoirs, the historic Kalawewa Tank, containing 100,000 acre feet is the largest in the district.
Under the proposed reservoir, 2,000 acres in Thanthirimale area will get irrigational water.
The main dam of the reservoir would be 3.6 km long and the height of the dam would be 23 metres. The government will spend Rs. 15,000 million for the completion of the reservoir project. In addition to the reservoir, a new township will be created adjoining Thanthirimale.

Lankan economy stabilizing - IMF
The international Monetary Fund (IMF) says that following a series of weather related shocks in 2017, the economy is gradually normalizing.
After concluding a study the IMF stats that Real GDP growth is projected to rise to 4.4% in 2018, supported by a recovery in agriculture and industry and robust growth in services, reaching 5% over the medium term.
Inflation is projected to revert to around 5% by end-2018, as food prices are expected to stabilize.
An IMF staff team led by Manuela Goretti visited Colombo from February 27  March 9 to hold discussions for the 2018 Article IV consultation and advance the technical work on the fourth review of Sri Lankan authorities economic reform program under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
The IMF mission had constructive discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities on the 2018 Article IV Consultation and made progress towards a staff-level agreement on the fourth review of the EFF-supported program. Program discussions will continue in April in Washington D.C. during the Spring Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, the IMF said.
he IMF says despite weather-related shocks and some delays in implementation, program performance remains broadly on track.
The new Inland Revenue Act (IRA) and the Central Bank of Sri Lankas (CBSL) Roadmap towards inflation targeting represent landmark reforms and their successful implementation is critical going forward. Fiscal consolidation is advancing, with preliminary data showing a primary surplus in 2017.
The CBSL has been effective in curbing credit growth and stabilizing inflation despite recent pressures, while stepping up its pace of reserve accumulation.
Nevertheless, the economy remains vulnerable to adverse shocks given the still sizable public debt and low external buffers.
Looking ahead, to secure these hard-won gains and support inclusive, sustained growth, the reform momentum needs to continue and policy frameworks and institutions further strengthened.

Load up on fibre to curb diabetes
High fiber diets could control diabetics blood sugar better than we ever realized, new research suggests. For decades, nutritionists have urged everyone - diabetes diagnosis or not - to have more leafy greens, whole grains, and bananas since their fiber content keeps digestion stable and smooth.
But new research by Rutgers University has found fiber plays a far more active role than ever recorded in nurturing the gut bacteria that control blood sugars and fats. The findings could pave the way to personalized high-fiber diets as a first-line treatment for the disease.
The researchers say it could also help to curb the rapidly climbing rates of diabetes diagnoses - driven by the obesity crisis - if more non-diabetics take up a high-fiber diet as well.
Our study lays the foundation and opens the possibility that fibers targeting this group of gut bacteria could eventually become a major part of your diet and your treatment, said Professor Liping Zhao, a microbiologist at Rutgers University-New Brunswick in New Jersey.
Type 2 diabetes can lead to a range of devastating problems from heart attacks and strokes to kidney failure, blindness and losing a limb. It develops when the pancreas makes too little of glucose controlling insulin, or when the body doesnt use the hormone well. Gut bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that nourish intestine lining cells, reducing inflammation and helping to control appetite. Foods high in fiber boost gut bacteria that control blood sugar by breaking down carbohydrates.
Last year, a study showed losing weight by following an 800-calorie-a-day eating plan for eight to 12 weeks can send the disease into remission. The more weight participants lost, the more likely patients were to see an end to the condition.
But while previous research has found increasing dietary fiber consumption may relieve type 2 diabetes, Professor Zhao and colleagues say they have finally unlocked the mechanism to explain why and how.
Professor Zhaos pioneering high-fiber diet, which included whole grains and Chinese medicinal foods, followed participants for six years and found it re-balanced their gut bacteria. The study found dramatic improvements in those who followed the eating plan - in less than three months.

Manchester United sink Liverpool, unsavoury scenes at West Ham
LONDON, Saturday: Marcus Rashford scored twice as Manchester United beat their arch-rivals Liverpool 2-1 in a highly-charged derby on Saturday to consolidate second place in the Premier League table.
With runaway leaders Manchester City on course for a third Premier League title, second place is the best the chasing pack can hope for and United moved five points ahead of Liverpool.
United stifled Liverpools exhilarating attack early on at Old Trafford and raced into a two-goal lead with 24 minutes on the clock after a double from Rashford.
Eric Baillys bizarre own goal gave Liverpool hope in the second half, but United held on for a first victory over their North West rivals since January, 2016.
Perfect result. I wouldnt go so far as saying it was a perfect performance. In the first half, the game gave us the opportunity to be direct, fast and score goals, more than we did. We were worth the win, United manager Jose Mourinho said.
Fifth-placed Chelsea moved to within four points of Liverpool, two behind Tottenham Hotspur - who play Bournemouth on Sunday - in fourth, after a nervy 2-1 win over Crystal Palace in the late kickoff.
A deflected strike from Willian and a Martin Kelly own goal put Chelsea in control at the break, but they took their foot off the gas in the second half.
Patrick van Aanholt got his side back in the match in stoppage time, but it was too little too late for Palace as Chelsea held out for a first win in four in all competitions.
It was an important afternoon at the bottom of the table too, with West Ham United slipping to a damaging 3-0 home defeat by Burnley to leave them three points above the relegation zone.
There were unsavoury scenes at London Stadium where pitch invasions and mass protests in the stands forced owners David Sullivan and David Gold to leave the directors box, with police brought in to restore order.
We want the supporters behind us, since Ive been here theyve been really good. But you cant cross the line and come on the pitch, West Ham manager David Moyes said. Matters on the pitch added to the vitriolic mood, with Ashley Barnes and a Chris Wood double steering Burnley to a second win in a week, closing the gap on sixth-placed Arsenal, who host Watford on Sunday, to two points.
RASHFORD DOUBLE
Much of the pre-match talk centred around how United were going to cope with Liverpools in-form front three of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and the leagues joint-top scorer Mohamed Salah.
However, even without the injured Paul Pogba, it was United who started on the front foot, adopting a more direct style with Romelu Lukaku the target and the Belgium striker was influential in both Rashford goals.
Rashfords double - on his first Premier League start since Boxing Day - proved decisive, as Liverpool couldnt add to the Bailly own goal as they slipped to a first defeat in eight games in all competitions.
It didnt go our way because of the two goals we conceded, Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said.
We have to defend these situations better. You can always lose a header or tackle with (Romelu) Lukaku but you need to close the gap in behind.
In the North East, Newcastle United secured a 3-0 victory over Southampton to move five points clear of the bottom three, piling the pressure on Saints boss Mauricio Pellegrino.
Two goals from Kenedy, on loan from Chelsea, and a Matt Ritchie strike were enough for a second successive Premier League home win for Rafael Benitezs side.
West Bromwich Albions woes continued as they slipped to a 4-1 home defeat by Leicester City. Salomon Rondon gave West Brom the lead at The Hawthorns, but four Leicester goals without reply ensured West Brom stayed bottom, eight points from safety.
Swansea City, who had Jordan Ayew sent off in the 11th minute, held Huddersfield Town to a 0-0 draw at the John Smiths Stadium while Wayne Rooneys penalty miss mattered little as Everton beat Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0 at Goodison Park. - Agencies

Kandy district UNP MP Ananda Aluthgamage started a protest lying on the main road in front of the Nawalapitiya Police Station on Saturday demanding immediate transfer of the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the Police Station.
Aluthgamage arrived at Nawalapitiya early morning and began his protest and continued his protest until 2 pm.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, who was in Kandy, had phoned Aluthgamage and requested him to end the protest promising to find a viable solution to the issue. However, Aluthgamage continued the protest even after the ministers call.
Aluthgamage said he had visited the Nawalapitiya town on Saturday morning at around 5.00 a.m. and he had not seen any additional security measures in the town despite the violent incidents in nearby Kandy. Aluthgamage said the Nawalapitiya OIC has failed in his duties.

New Laws will be introduced to control social media: Law and Order Minister
New laws will be introduced soon to ensure that the social media is used for the country's benefit rather than its detriment, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Central Province Governor's Office Auditorium on March 10, Minister Madduma Bandara said false information was being given through the social media networks today to create communal and religious divisions and clashes.
He said he expected to bring in new legislation to control the social media sector after studying the procedures adopted by developed countries to use social media for their national benefit.
He said false information churned out by certain sections of the social media over the years had led to the clashes in Kandy district, compelling the government to promulgate emergency laws after a lapse of three years.

Organised group behind unrest - PM
An organised group had been behind the recent unfortunate incidents which occurred in the Kandy area, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Police have already received vital information about it. I have directed the Law and Order Minister and the IGP to conduct an urgent investigation into the matter and take necessary action about it, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a special discussion convened at the Kandy Kachcheri on March 10, regarding the unrest which occurred in Kandy recently.
The Prime Minister said he convened the meeting to discuss measures to pay compensation to people for the properties damaged during the clashes.
Several factors should be taken into consideration at the discussions, including assessment of compensation payments, payment of compensation for lives lost and the programme of work to rehabilitate damaged business places, the Prime Minister said.
According to latest statistics, 465 places of worship, houses, vehicles, business places and other institutions had suffered damage during these incidents. Of them, 87 had suffered total damage and 196 partially damaged, while another 182 suffered minor damage.
The Prime Minister said the police had already investigated the recent unrest in Ampara and Kandy.
What ought to be done was to prevent a repetition of such ugly incidents in the future, the Preimer said.
He said investigations would not be confined to the appointment of a Commission only. The Government would go ahead with its duties and responsibilities without waiting until the Commission announced its decisions.
The Prime Minister said investigations were also underway about certain social websites which instigated the Kandy incidents. Two students of two leading Colombo schools have also been identified during Police interrogations.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said incidents of this nature would not recur only if punishments were meted out to the wrongdoers. If this was not done there world be a repetition of such incidents. As such the law should be strictly implemented against the wrongdoers, irrespective of their status of position.
The Prime Minister who said that these ugly incidents had tarnished the countrys image internationally added that it would take another two to three years to minimise the damage caused.
The Prime Minister said this had badly impacted on the tourism industry too. A majority of tourists visited Colombo while an equal number visited Kandy too. Although they hoped for an increase in the influx of tourists, there was doubt as to whether they could achieve that target.
The Government had already held talks on moves to increase tourists visiting Kandy and the surrounding areas, the Premier said.
There would be problems if our march forward together as Sri Lankans was harmed. We should act in a manner that would not jeopardise that collective march forward. The Maha Sangha and other religious dignitaries should visit the trouble spots and educate the people. The Maha Sangha and clerics of other religions had already joined forces to assist this endeavour, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister who said that these clashes also dealt a major blow to the sacrifices made by our War Heroes who helped end the 30-year terrorist war and unite the nation, said the declaration of a timely curfew for the entire Kandy district enabled them to restrict the incidents to only four Divisional Secretariat areas without allowing it to spread to other areas in the district.
The Prime Minister said that even though there had been shortcomings on the part of certain Police officers in enforcing Law and Order, the Police service as a whole had performed a commendable job in bringing the situation under control and he wished to thank them for it.
The Armed Forces too had done a commendable service in this connection. Similarly, the public servants, Provincial service employees, Local Government employees, members of Civil Society, religious organisations and the Maha Sangha, as well as dignitaries of other religious too had rallied round to bring the situation back to normalcy.The government wished to thank every one of them for the assistance rendered, the Prime Minister added.
Ministers Ranjith Maddumabandara, Lakshman Kiriella, Rauf Hakeem, M.H.A. Haleem, State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, Parliamentarian Lucky Jayawardana, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, Service Chiefs and several other state officials attended the discussion.

Sri Lanka takes on India today
Our bowling was below par - Chandimal
You win some, you lose some is a famous idiom that is used by sports teams to indicate that its not possible to win all the time.
That would aptly apply to Sri Lanka when Bangladesh pulled off a stunning five-wicket win chasing down what looked like a match winning total of 215 on Saturday to throw wide open the Hero Nidahas Tri-nation T20I series.
Sri Lanka looked to be well in the drivers seat when they racked up an imposing score of 214-6 ala brilliant half-centuries from the two Kusals - Mendis and Perera. But Bangladesh who put up a rather below par performance against India in their opening match of the series, suddenly switched gears to make the impossible possible and chase down Sri Lankas total with a well planned counter attack that exposed the home teams deficiencies bowling on a flat wicket.
Bangladesh were given the ideal start by openers Tamim Iqbal and Liton Das who posted 74 off just 35 balls. It was the impetus they needed to challenge such a huge score. The experience of former skipper Mushfiqur Rahim who smacked a career best 72 not out off 35 balls carried Bangladesh to a famous victory with two balls to spare.
Although Sri Lanka will be disappointed to be on the losing side after posting such a big score the fans certainly got their moneys worth of entertainment as the 40 overs in the match produced a handsome 429 runs.
What that win has done to the tri-series is that after the first round robin matches all three teams have a one win-one loss record going into todays second round where Sri Lanka meets India at the R Premadasa Stadium.
It was a good game of cricket. We put up a very good total, but it was actually too good a wicket for the batters. As a bowling unit I think we were below par and we didnt execute our plans well, said Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal reflecting on his teams loss.
We cant win every day. As a team were just thinking about how to play the best we can at all times. And when we do that we will win more often than not. Todays (Saturday) loss, I think we played well, but Bangladesh just played that little bit better. We had some things up our sleeves. But they fought very hard, and we didnt execute our plans to our liking. That is what cost us the match, he said.
Commenting on his own teams performance and on Mushfiqurs match-winning knock, Chandimal said, It was a really good total, but these things happen in cricket. Even if you score 200 plus you cant just assume that youre going to win. Any team with any total, you need to get early wickets when defending. Thats what we were hoping to do, but were unable to pull it off. As a bowling unit we didnt get that breakthrough early on.
Cricket is a funny game and things can change. Credit goes to them they played some great cricket and handled the situation really well. We all know that Bangladesh have played some outstanding cricket in the recent past. This was one of the best Mushfiqur innings I have seen, he said.
Chandimal stated that in a series of this nature every game was crucial. We have some game plans against India, but we need to execute those in the middle.
As for Bangladesh their experienced opener Tamim Iqbal said the win would definitely give them a lot of confidence. It is one of our best wins but I am a big believer in the fact that we havent conquered everything by just one win. It has given us confidence of chasing 215 runs. It is not the end, but just the start. We really needed this as a team.
Where Bangladesh surprised Sri Lanka was when they promoted Liton Das to open the batting with Tamim and he obliged by smashing 43 off only 19 balls to set the tone for the rest of the innings.
We knew that they would start off with off-spin. That was one of the reasons we promoted Liton to the top of the order. That plan worked for us and it didnt work for them, said Tamim. Akila Dananjayas three overs cost 36 runs without a wicket.
We might not have big power hitters but we can plan and play a Bangladeshi brand of T20 cricket, said Tamim. We cant follow England or West Indies because we have different kind of players. We dont have someone like MS Dhoni to come at No 7. We dont have a Chris Gayle to take on the bowlers from the first ball. I think we have smart cricketers, who are different. It is not about hitting sixes and fours all the time. In the middle overs we saw that by taking a lot of singles. Boundaries will come.

Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) Chairman P.B. Dissanayake told the Daily News in Kurunegala that the Treasury has allocated Rs. 500 million to purchase paddy from farmers countrywide during the Maha season.
Dissanayake said that storage space has been arranged for the paddy to be purchased from farmers countrywide. However, as large-scale private rice mill owners are offering higher rates to farmers, the PMB is not able to purchase as much as it could. The PMB has made arrangements to buy nadu at Rs. 38 per kilo and samba at Rs. 41 per kilo. Private rice mill owners buy nadu at Rs. 45 per kilo and samba at Rs. 60 per kilo.
Minister P. Harrison was instrumental in obtaining funds from the Treasury for the PMB to purchase paddy this year.

ICC World Cup qualifier
Powell hundred sees Windies past Ireland and into Super Six
HARARE, Saturday: West Indies batsman Rovman Powell said his side are focused on winning all their World Cup qualifying games, after his century led them to victory over Ireland on Saturday.
Powells maiden one-day international ton dragged the Windies from a difficult position to beat Ireland in Harare and reach the Super Six stage of qualifying.
We didnt come here for four wins out of four, we came here to win every single game and were still on course to do that, said the 24-year-old, who brought up his hundred with a massive six that smashed a window.
Qualifying for the World Cup means a lot for the 16 million Caribbean people and thats our aim.
Hosts Zimbabwe also booked their spot in the next round by making it three wins from three in Group B with a comfortable victory over Hong Kong, while Afghanistan saw off Nepal to keep their slim hopes alive.
Powell helped the West Indies reach 257-8 off their 50 overs, before the two-time World Cup winners took regular wickets to secure a 52-run victory, with Kemar Roach claiming 4-27.
The Caribbean outfit can seal the maximum four points to carry into the Super Six round when they play the Netherlands in their final Group A game on Monday, when Ireland will have to beat the United Arab Emirates to be sure of progression.
Only two teams from the qualifiers will join the worlds top eight ODI nations at next years World Cup in England and Wales.
After losing the toss and being put in to bat, the Windies slipped to 83-5 as veteran seamer Tim Murtagh took the crucial early wickets of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels.
But captain Jason Holder, who hit a match-winning 99 not out in Thursdays win over Papua New Guinea, combined with Powell in a sixth-wicket stand of 86 before falling to Murtagh for 54.
The 24-year-old Powell took his time to get in as he reached nine off only 34 balls, but exploded into life late in his innings, muscling seven fours and as many maximums before being caught behind off Murtagh for a run-a-ball 101. Roach impressed with the ball in Irelands reply as William Porterfields men struggled to 32-3, but a well-compiled 63 from Ed Joyce gave the Irish hope.
The former England opener holed out to Roach, though, and medium-pacer Kesrick Williams ran through the tail to finish with figures of 4-43, as Ireland fell short in their attempt to replicate their win over the West Indies in the 2015 World Cup.
ZIMBABWE CONTINUE GOOD FORM
Zimbabwe were seen as outsiders to reach the World Cup before qualifying got underway, but Hamilton Masakadza struck 84 as they thrashed Hong Kong by 89 runs for a third straight triumph. Hong Kong, who will reach the Super Six with victory over Nepal on Monday after stunning Afghanistan, bowled well to restrict Zimbabwe to 263-9 in Bulawayo.
But all-rounder Sikandar Raza continued his excellent form by taking 3-30 with his off-spin as Hong Kong fell well short.
Afghanistan need Nepal to beat Hong Kong to reach the Super Sixes, after finishing their Group B campaign with a six-wicket win over the Nepalese.
Stand-in skipper Rashid Khan took 3-45 and Mohammad Nabi 4-33 as Nepal were bowled out for just 194, and an unbeaten 52 from Najibullah Zadran finally got Afghanistan their first points at the fourth time of asking.
In Hong Kong v Nepal, anything can happen, thats cricket, said Khan.
We just tried to do our best to do what we could and chase it within 40 overs (to reach positive net run rate), which we did.
The other game saw the Netherlands beat Papua New Guinea by 57 runs, but the Dutch need to beat the Windies and hope Ireland lose to the UAE to have any chance of going through. - AFP

Indian Prime Minister said he was greatly honoured by President Sirisena's participation at the Solar Energy Summit and requested President Sirisena to join him in taking the message of the International Solar Energy Summit to the entire world.
The Indian Prime Minister, who noted that mutual relations between Sri Lanka and India had been immensely strengthened during the past few years, emphasised the need to strengthen these bonds and relationship in the economic front too. A press release by the President Media Unit said discussions also delved on measures to further strengthen and cement relations between Sri Lanka and India,
Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka's Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Indian and Sri Lankan High Commissioners were also associated at the talks.
After the meeting with the Indian Prime Minister, President Maithripala Sirisena had a meeting with the Executive Director of the UN Environmental Programme Eric Solheim.
Discussions between them centred on Environmental Conservation, Climate change and marine pollution.
President Sirisena explained the Environmental Protection Plan formulated by Sri Lanka during the discussions.

The Air Force submitted an observation report on the programme to him every fortnight.
He explained the steps taken to minimise the use of plastics in a background where marine pollution had become a major problem.
Delving in environmental problems caused due to sand and earth mining for construction purposes, he requested Eric Solheim to introduce technological alternatives and proposals to instigate this problem.
The long-standing mutual friendship and co-operation between Norway and Sri Lanka was also highlighted at the meeting.

Rabada restores SAn ascendancy
PORT ELIZABETH, Sunday: Kagiso Rabada struck shortly before the close to restore South Africas ascendancy on the third day of the second Test against Australia at St Georges Park on Sunday.
Australia were 180 for five in their second innings at the close, a slender lead of 41 runs with five wickets remaining.
A magnificent century by AB de Villiers enabled South Africa to take a first innings lead of 139 and Australia lost four wickets before they wiped out the deficit.
But Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Marsh shared a fighting fifth wicket partnership of 87 and almost succeeded in taking their team through to the fourth day with at least a glimmer of hope.
Then Rabada struck for the third time in the innings. Bowling around the wicket he trapped Khawaja in front of his stumps with a full delivery after the left-hander made 75 off 136 balls.
Khawaja and Marsh (39 not out) came together when Australia were 86 for four but batted for more than two hours on a pitch which was largely placid. In contrast to the first innings, there was no pronounced reverse swing for the bowlers. De Villiers made a magnificent 126 not out and had good support from the tail as South Africa scored freely before they were all out for 382 shortly before the scheduled lunch break.  AFP

Raise a toast in appreciating of women's world celebration!
On Thursday March 8, we celebrated a global event lauding a segment of society who gave birth to us, nurtured us and who looked out for us even when we had reached adulthood. I am talking about a very special day for all women in the whole wide world, regardless of race, religion, nationality, or socioeconomic status.
All this excitement should get everyone, including every Man-Jack out there thinking: Why aren't women celebrated in this manner every day Let's make International Women's Day, IWD, an everyday event. Surely, women deserve to be celebrated every day. I personally believe its time to shrug off the mantle of gender and give the women of the world hope that they are not alone in their battle for equality.
The day brings together global governments, women's organisations, businesses and charities together under its banner and will be marked with talks, performances, rallies, networking events, fashion parades, theatrical performances and more. Even Google usually does its bit by doing a Google Doodle.
The theme of this year's International Women's Day is Press for Progress. Indeed, a strong call to motivate and unite friends, colleagues and whole communities to think, act and offer support.
In 1975, March 8 was announced as the official date for IWD by the United Nations. It first started as a political and socialist movement in 1909 in four European countries. It soon spread with a determined screech and began reaching out to be celebrated in other parts of the globe in different ways.
It is a day to commemorate the achievements of women and to raise awareness for the social and political equality of women around the world. It aims to highlight the importance of creating conditions for the elimination of discrimination against women and for their full and equal participation in social development.
The day is also a time to reflect on progress made, to call for further change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities.
Surely, it is right and just that the world recognises the achievements of women regardless of national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political divisions. Its objectives must include promoting gender relations, gender equality, celebrating and encouraging positive female role models which in turn will inspire the younger feminist generation.
South Asia comprises eight nations  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka  and is bursting with various aspects of culture. However it is worth noting that almost half of the female population, experiences rampant gender based violence and discrimination in the areas of education, nutrition, health and employment, curtailing their human rights, disrupting gender equality and their general well being.
This year, IWD comes on the heels of unprecedented global movement for womens rights, equality and justice. Sexual harassment, violence and discrimination against women have captured headlines and public discourse, propelled by a rising determination for change.
Yet, all over the world the turnaround in some cases of womens success stories is causing turned heads, raised eyebrows, and some rifts in what is still seen as a male dominated society. But, thanks to the precedents set by courageous and resourceful women front-runners who have wielded remarkable influence, others of their gender have and are being encouraged to step up and take leadership roles as businesswomen, heads of financial firms, teachers, scholars and writers.
The remarkable aspect to all this is that the relatively new-found inspiration seems contagious. It is not at all surprising that the trend has caught on in many parts of Asia. And who can forget Sri Lanka, the little nation that gave the world its first woman prime minister. Look around you and there is no gainsaying the fact that local women are starting businesses at a record pace, rising to key leadership positions, and helping communities flourish across the nation.
Today, they continue to inspire women in every strata of society to reach their fullest potential. In essence, they have challenged the way men and women think about business, education, politics and life in general. In Sri Lanka both through traditional roles as mothers and wives and as professionals, businesswomen, financial leaders, media personnel and teachers, women have made great strides to hold their own in a male-dominated world.
There was a time, not too long ago, when it would have seemed unimaginable for a woman to have broken through the highest, hardest glass ceiling. The connotation refers to occupying the corner office or the executive suite. At present, thanks to the achievements of several trail-blazing icons to inspire them many women have blended into the professional and personal sphere with less conflict than they ever encountered before.
Things certainly seem to be looking up for women in corporate Sri Lanka. Yes, and times certainly appear to be changing in our conservative little world of business enterprise. One of the more significant among them is the empowerment of women in all spheres of trade, finance and industry.
In corporate Sri Lanka a good many women professionals have shattered the gender stereotype and climbed to the highest rung of the hierarchal or rather matriarchal ladder. Indeed, a handful of remarkable personalities have created history by heading some of the countrys most elite institutions.
In the present day world relationships have become very important as the level of insecurity is just augmenting every day. The woman, in your life, plays a very important supportive and encouraging role. She is the sole inspiration factor for you. So, it is essentially important to have the best wife, girlfriend gift ideas to help you reiterate the fact that you love her the most.
In truth, it has been their fortitude, vision and pluck that have carried them to the very zenith of their careers. They have done so with admirable determination displaying those rare attributes of courage, resilience and endurance. And all the more credit to them because they have achieved their ambitions despite the entrenched gender bias that pervades our culture.
Many global corporations have also started to more actively support IWD by running their own internal events through supporting external ones. Year on year IWD is certainly increasing in status. Certainly it is an opportunity to transform this momentum into action, to empower women in all settings, rural and urban, and celebrate the activists who are working relentlessly to claim womens rights and realise their full potential. So lets all make a difference, think globally and act locally! Make everyday International Women's Day. Do your bit to ensure that the future for the fair sex is bright, equal, safe and rewarding.

Biyagama Inter Religious Committee established
Recent unrest under control, no need for outside pressure: Muslim Leaders
The Government authorities and the civil society jointly established the Biyagama electorate Inter Religiousthnic Committee recently for easing tensions among multi-ethnic and multi-religious communities, building bridges, and coming together to solve common social issues.
Al-Haj M.M.A. Ismail, the President of the Gampaha Muslim Association and Treasurer of Muslim Education Forum, key member who mooted the concept speaking during its inaugural meeting said the Government had been able to bring the situation under control within a short period and there was no need for any international intervention to solve the issue.
A section of the participants.
While stating that the recent violent incidents should be fully investigated, he stressed that no foreign bodies should be allowed to get involved in the process.
Ismail said the new committee focuses on strengthening community networks mentored by religious leaders to help communities evolve a pluralistic national identity.
He said the organisation would strengthen inter religious people-to-people community engagement for reconciliation and social cohesion.
Ismail said Muslims and Muslim organisations in Sri Lanka will always extend their fullest support to the Government to establish peace and reconciliation.
He said Muslims have always being living in peace and harmony with Sinhalese and other communities for centuries. He appreciated the President and Prime Ministers assurance that compensation will be provided to the affected and buildings which were destroyed will be fully restored soon.
Several Muslim leaders and Moulavis speaking at the event endorsed Ismails position and noted that the issue should be solved through discussions among communities without seeking any outside help.
Chief Incumbent of the Kanduboda Vivekaramaya Ven.Parakaduwe Saranankara Thera speaking at the event said that creating communal and religious disharmony in the country is similar to promoting terrorism and added that no room should be allowed for communal and religious differences to divide the country again.
He said those who spread religious hatred are not protecting the religion but promoting division. The Thera praised the establishment of the committee and added that it was a timely initiative to protect ethnic and religious harmony. Members of the Biyagama Buddhist Organisation and its Secretary Ven.Beligala Amarasiri Thera, Chief Incumbent of Walgama Sri Sudarshanaramaya Makuluduwe Nandarathana Thera, Moulavi M.A.Hassen, Moulavi M.H.Lafeer, former Chairman of the Biyagama PS Ananda Genepola, Officer-in-Charge of the Biyagama Police Inspector D.H.Karunaratne, politicians, religious leaders and the general public participated.

Return of mindlessness
Having survived and escaped by a whisker the option of being burnt alive by mobs in 1983 I am fully conversant with the manner in which hate is built up, myths generated before finally unlashing violence systematically against groups of citizens.
The lead up to the infamous 1983 riots began on or around 1978.There has been a similar build against Muslims of this country in recent years. The foot soldiers who stone and burn apart, there is a middle layer which has shared reports, exchanged notes about Muslims on social media.
In the recent past we have witnessed violent outbursts in 2014 in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. In 2017 we had another spate of violence. A response of the present Government was the setting up of District Level Reconciliation Committees
District Level Reconciliation Committees
Based on the Cabinet Memorandum submitted by President Maithiripala Sirisena in his capacity as Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to establish District Level Reconciliation Committees to address the incidence of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tensions and to promote national integration and reconciliation in all 25 districts. The District Level Reconciliation Committee to be convened by the District Secretary of the relevant District with representation of inter-religious leaders, the Superintendent of Police, retired judges, school principals and other relevant officials as observers, Secretary of National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry, V. Sivagnanasothy said.
The function of the District Level Reconciliation Committee is to undertake study on the background and causes of religious and ethnic tensions in the locality; formulate suitable strategy and approach to mediate the problems; provide rapid response to resolve conflicts and tensions; invite the perpetrators and victims and mediate conflict resolution; maintain a database on incidents of tensions and attacks on religious places; mediate, negotiate and resolve conflicts and prevent hate speeches.
The District Level Reconciliation Committees should resolve problems amicably and where necessary submit recommendations on unresolved matters to the National Reconciliation Committee through the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation.
The Cabinet Memorandum also recommends that this mechanism should not in any way disturb the law and order arrangements and rights in the country. The District Level Reconciliation Committee and the proposed institutional mechanism should help address the isolated pockets of incidence of religious and ethnic extremism and help to sustain a durable peace in the country. The Committee should meet on a regular quarterly basis where necessary based on reported incidence, he added.
The past two weeks saw further ugliness. Kumar Sangakkara has in a tweet noted that no one in Sri Lanka can be marginalized or threatened or harmed due to their ethnicity or religion. We are One Country and One people. Love, trust and acceptance should be our common mantra. No place for racism and violence. STOP. Stand together and stand strong.
Lawless order
I do not pretend to be an expert on policing, intelligence or crowd control. However I ask, the Police backed by the STF have had sufficient expertise dealing with internal strife since the late 80s.
In the past two years they have dealt with innumerable crowds staging all manner of protest marches in congested areas. I imagine Police gathers intelligence. For reasons known to them at least on four separate occasions mobs have had free reign to cause damage and blacken the image of the country before semblance of law and order was restored. When the Army is called in, clam descends. How come No different recently. None have fired a bullet in anger to control mobs.
Intelligence-led Policing (ILP)
Intelligence-led policing has a 3-part model as follows:
(1) Analysts interpret the crime trends and patterns;
(2) Information, or intelligence, allows decision makers to form strategies to impact specific crimes and serious offenders;
(3) The plans and resources flow down to based level officers to disrupt the crimes and offenders.
Intelligence-led policing (ILP) is a policing model built around the assessment and management of risk. Intelligence officers serve as guides to operations, rather than operations guiding intelligence.
Calls for intelligence-led policing originated in the 1990s, both in Britain and in the United States. Although intelligence-led policing builds on earlier paradigms, such as community policing, problem-oriented policing, and the partnership model of policing, it originated as a rejection of the reactive focus on crime of community policing, with calls for police to spend more time employing informants and surveillance to combat recidivist offenders.
As intelligence-led policing represents a move towards surveillance, it focuses on information collection and analyzing data. However, the way that this data is collected is a concern for privacy advocates. [The U.S. Supreme Court has given a two part test to determine a search in Katz v. United States (1967). The first is an expectation of privacy, and the second is that the expectation of privacy should be reasonable.
In the world of policing, it means something totally different. Intelligence-led policing can be defined as a policing philosophy that follows a business or managerial model of operating an organisation. Intelligence-led policing allows police departments to utilize data and information in order to better evaluate crime trends and issues, thus allowing top decision makers to efficiently and effectively allocate resources and develop crime fighting strategies.
In other words, police departments can incorporate a decision-making system where information about crimes, crime trends, and specific groups of offenders is analyzed and then paired with executive strategies to properly direct ground level officers actions and resources in a specific, targeted effort for the sole purpose of reducing, eliminating and preventing specific crime issues and offenders.
The legal, administrative and institutional framework for the implementation of ILP requires, First, ILP must be based on clear and precise legal and administrative provisions, which set out the conditions in which it is to be implemented and provide for adequate safeguards to ensure that it does not compromise human rights. Second, legality, necessity and proportionality of limitations of human rights and thirdly, effective remedies, oversight and accountability: International human rights standards provide for the right of everyone whose rights or freedoms are violated to an effective remedy and to have a claim for such a remedy determined by a competent judicial, administrative or legislative authority.
Since ILP may lead to potentially far-reaching interferences in a broad range of human rights, effective and accessible remedies for human rights violations that may result from ILP are essential. Furthermore, solid internal and external oversight mechanisms need to be in place in order to ensure accountability of institutions and individual law enforcement officers involved in ILP.
We cannot overstate the mess we are in at present. It follows on the horrendous shenanigans seen in post local government elections. None of which this country can afford. Ministers, implementers of Policies, the Police Department, political and other leaders have all a duty to perform. At present what we see is collective failure.

Searching for menarche in postcolonial literature
I teach a course on world literature from a two-thousand-page anthology, and in it there is not one mention of menstruation, much less menarche. To supplement the anthologys dearth of female narratives, I teach Marjane Satrapis Persepolis.
But even in this graphic novel, though there is a significant discussion of her body changing as she comes of age, the text makes no mention of her menarche or her menstruation. In a full-page panel starting The Vegetable chapter, Satrapi draws the protagonists transformation from a prepubescent girl into a woman. Somewhere in the midst of this growth of breasts, butt, and body overall must have come Marjis menarche, but that moment often considered by cultures to be the onset of womanhood is omitted from Marjis coming of age.
Postcolonial canon
With 2015 being deemed the year of the period in the United States, I began to notice the numbers of absent menarches in narratives of girls coming of age in world texts, Why did these bildungsromans from the postcolonial canon not include the moment where many cultures believe a girl transitions to a woman physically
The most obvious marker of coming of age is absent from the majority of postcolonial texts with female protagonists. I began to pull books off the shelf that I thought must have menarcheor at least menstruationscenes that I had just forgotten about. I could find fourNervous Conditions, by Tsitsi Dangarembga; The Bride Price, by Buchi Emecheta; Breath, Eyes, Memory, by Edwidge Danticat; and The Bathhouse, by Farnoosh Moshiri.
The authors of The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation note the dearth of menstruation stories in their chapter Absent Literature: The Menarche. They find the earliest mentions of menarche in French novels from 1884: Edmond de Goncourts Chrie and Emile Zolas La Joie de Vivre.
When outlining the history of menarche in Western canonical texts, they do not mention any non-Western texts in which menarche seems to be investigated even more rarely.
This article calls for a reconsideration of the importance of Buchi Emechetas 1976 novel The Bride Priceone of the few postcolonial literary texts that features menarche as a significant themeand argues that the moment of menarche in it is a turning point that brings an onslaught of pain and distress for Aku-nna, who is coming of age.
In The Bride Price, Aku-nna must leave her more cosmopolitan life in Lagos after her father dies. She returns to her original tribe with her mother and her brother. Though the mother is bucking tradition, she fights to ensure that her daughter will continue her education. Frail in frame, Aku-nna is seen by many members of the tribe as someone who needs protection, and her teacher and soon-to-be lover Chike feels the same way. Her mother foreshadows the novels end when she states, I am not allowing you out of my sight until you are seventeen, or you are bound to die in childbirth. You are so thin and not very developed. All you have are eyes and legs.
Her psyche
There is much talk about the fact that Aku-nna has not had her first periodto the point where fellow women question her sex and genderas there is great celebration in the tribe when a girl becomes a woman. On that night suitors may begin to come to the father (or stepfather, in her case) to begin to court the girl and offer a bride price.
At the novels midpoint, Aku-nna reaches menarche during school. Before she realizes she will bleed, her teacher Chike admonishes her and she flees to be alone.
Chike seeks her out and tells her that he wants her to be happy, that she should return to class. As she walks ahead of him, he cries out You are bleeding. . . there is blood on your dress. Immediately, she is afraid: first for her body and then for her psyche: She swirled round quickly, looked and saw that there was blood smeared on a part of the hem of her dress. At first she was frightened, thinking that she had hurt herself.
Then common sense took over, and she knew what was happening to her. She had heard about it from her friends so many times, she had seen it happen to many women, she had been told about it often by her mother and she knew the responsibility that went with it. She was now fully grown. She could be married away, she could be kidnapped, a lock of her hair could be cut by any man to make her his wife forever. This it of the paragraph is the unspeakable: menarche. For Aku-nna, her menarche is not something to be celebrated, as she knows that her entire life is going to change. She realizes She was now fully grown.
Though she really isnther body is so tiny that it will not be able to sustain a pregnancy at the age of sixteenshe is marriageable now, so she is grown. She is afraid of having her period and all that comes with the new burden of being perceived culturally as a woman. She wants to run, run as far as possible, but instead she stays, and she and Chike plot to hide her period until she has passed her exams.

Seminar on International Taxation on March 15
KPMG will be conducting a half a day seminar on March 15, 2018 at Movenpick Hotel, Colombo for the purpose of dissemination of essential knowledge on Treaties for Prevention of Double Taxation and as to the manner a person may derive benefits from the treaties.
The presentation will be delivered by Suresh R. I. Perera, Principal Tax & Regulatory of KPMG.
He is a multidisciplinary professional specializing in taxation with an accounting cum legal, qualifications.
The term International Tax is a misnomer as there is no distinct body of law to that effect. It is the study of domestic tax laws of other jurisdictions and the network of treaties for prevention of double taxation that would essentially encompass the phrase International Taxation.
Currently there are over 3,000 treaties in force globally for prevention of double taxation on income and capital arising in one country and paid to a resident in another country.
Sri Lanka too, has entered into treaties with 44 countries to provide relief from double taxation. The countries that Sri Lanka has entered into treaties include UK, USA, Australia, China, Japan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia.
Under these treaties not only streams of income such as business profits, royalties, interests, dividends generating from trading and investment transactions are granted relief, even salaries and fees earned by individuals, artistes, sports personnel and students may also obtain relief from double taxation.

Silenced and bullied: black women in the US
Some years ago I attended a play about the race riots in Los Angeles in 1992. The event, sponsored by the Institute for Arts and Civic Dialogue, was followed by an open discussion among actors, producers and a broader than usual audience.
What I remember most is an older black woman volunteering that a white man sitting next to her had just asked for her view on a particular matter. Most importantly, he had asked in a way that made her feel that he honestly wanted to know. In my entire life, she said, I have never had a white man ask what I was thinking about anything at all. Her pleased surprise resonated with many other women of colour in the audience who recognized themselves in her experience: age, gender and racial dynamics combined in a peculiarly potent vector of social anxiety.
Debate rages
The topic of women being silenced, sexualized, bullied, or ignored has been in the news a great deal recently. There has been an unprecedented outpouring of testimonials from women describing their own experiences at home, in the boardroom, on television and in government. Further pockets of debate are concerned with whether white women speak over black women, whether black men talk over black women, or whether minorities have any voice at all.
Lack of civility is underwritten by broad habits of courtesy that dictate whose voices count; which bodies are or are not capable of speech, witnessing, forming an opinion. Who speaks to whom Who is spoken of Whom do we horrify into silence In the US, such questions are intimately tied to the longue dure of race, slavery, practices of colonial disregard, and the struggle for Civil Rights. And among the voices most insistently suppressed, written off, and written out are those of black women and girls.
Long portrayed as a masculine endeavor, the African American struggle for progress often found expression through an unlikely literary figure: the black girl. So runs the premiss of Nazera Sadiq Wrights Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century. It is arresting in its pithiness: the unlikeliness of black girls in political struggle, in literary figuration, in the geography of childhood or adolescence. That purported lack is suggestive  being unlikely is also about being unliked, and so generally hidden or ignored. Assertion by such a one may be seen as unsettling, wrong, or at best surprising.
Shatema Threadcrafts Intimate Justice: The black female body and the body politic takes up a similar theme, exploring the ways in which the black female body . . . [has] been constrained and diminished within the American body politic. If forced breeding was the norm for black women in slavery, she says, forced sterilization and eugenics programmes to reduce the black birth rate became prominent features of public policy in the century that followed. If the white feminist movement was largely about leaving the cloister of the domestic sphere for employment in an erstwhile mans world, black feminisms goal has been more about access to private spheres of shelter from public exploitation.
Under-attended literature
The tension between intimate feelings and imposed stereotypes is foremost in both Wrights and Threadcrafts books. Together, their research draws on nearly 200 years of mostly under-attended literature to help us make sense of enduring polarities in aesthetic, moral and legal judgements. A study by Georgetown Universitys Center on Poverty and Inequality, too recent to have been addressed in either book, is a case in point. Researchers found that African American girls are viewed as generally less innocent than their white peers  a bias that begins when they are as young as five years old. (Black boys face similar prejudices but not until they are nine or ten.) Compared to girls of other races, black girls are perceived to warrant less patience, protection and support; they are also thought to be prematurely knowledgeable about a range of adult topics, particularly sex. This leads to their being less mentored, more harshly disciplined, and more frequently criminalized. The authors refer to adultification, a process by which children are not accorded the realities of inexperience and impressionability. If the Negro has been relentlessly figured as childish, not so actual black children.
Black Girlhood unpacks the historical assumptions behind such figuration, cultivated during slavery, and considers the sometimes reactionary efforts to reverse established tropes in the years after Emancipation. Conduct manuals, designed to redeem wayward black girls, proliferated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One such handbook was entitled Floyds Flowers: Or, Duty and Beauty for Colored Children, written in 1905 by Silas Floyd, a black minister whose ambition was to instruct young ladies in the arts of refinement. The types into which he divided his flowers described labels by which black girls are, Wright argues, judged to this day: the obedient Christian, the prematurely knowing girl, the self-respecting working girl, the educated girl, the uplifter of the race, the dont-care girl, the loud girl. Anxious instruction took place against the backdrop of a larger society that degraded black femininity and deemed it incorrigible.
Deborah Gray Whites classic study, Arnt I a Woman: Female slaves in the plantation South (1999), describes the most powerful antebellum typologies as the Jezebel, the Mammy and the sassy ball-buster (who later morphed into Sapphire, the gold-digging, emasculating angry black woman of a wife in the black-faced radio comedy, Amos n Andy).
Shot dead
One might add to this list the lying girl  a figuration that crops up repeatedly in forensic scenarios. Consider the case of Rachel Jeantel. During the trial of George Zimmerman, the Florida vigilante who shot dead Trayvon Martin, the prosecution called to the stand the nineteen-year-old Jeantel, who had been on the phone with Martin until moments before he was shot. As Eric Deggins wrote in the Tampa Bay Times:
[Jeantels] difficulty in carrying herself the way mainstream pundits and legal experts expected was painfully apparent. She mumbled. She spoke in a jumble of words and phrases that other attorneys and even the mostly-white jury couldnt understand. She had to admit dictating a letter she once claimed she wrote, which was sent to Martins mother describing what she heard during the night of his death. That admission came in the most painful way: Jeantel confessed she couldnt read cursive writing.

SLN Hydrographic Service first nautical chart handed over to Navy Commander
The first nautical chart prepared by the SLN Hydrographic Service (SLNHS) covering the Kachchaitivu Island was officially handed over to the Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe, by the Chief Hydrographer, Rear Admiral Sisira Jayakody, at the Naval Headquarters recently.
As Sri Lanka endeavours to become an important maritime hub in the region, development in the discipline of Hydrography is indeed an essential element for the country to prosper. Hydrography underpins almost every other activity associated with the sea, including safety of navigation, protection of the marine environment, national infrastructure development, coastal zone management, marine exploration, marine resource exploitation, maritime boundary delimitation, maritime defence and security and coastal disaster management, a spokesman for the navy said.
The mission of SLNHS is to meet defence, national and other stakeholder requirements providing navigational, hydrographic and geo-spatial information, products and services efficiently. its objectives are carefully set in to achieve the stipulated vision and specifically ensure that international obligations under SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) convention are met, he added.

Sonia Gandhi tears into Modi government
Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi recently castigated the BJP-led NDA government, accusing the present dispensation of muzzling the voices of the Opposition. Our freedom is under assault. Today we are embracing a regressive vision, Gandhi said while delivering her keynote address at the India Today Conclave 2018.
Targeting the BJP government over growing intolerance, the Congress leader said, Fear and intimidation are order of the day; alternate voices are being silenced, religious tensions are being fuelled, vigilante armies are being let loose with state patronage, society is being polarised with a view to win election.
Stating that the country is in the midst of great upheaval, Sonia claimed that the Narendra Modi-led BJP government is using its brute majority in Parliament to stifle the voice of the Opposition. If we are not allowed to speak in parliament, why not shut down Parliament so we can all go home. Unlike Vajpayee, this BJP govt doesnt respect parliament procedures, she observed.
Corruption charges
Sonia posed several questions to the ruling government while countering BJPs claims that the economy witnessed great strides under its rule. Was India really a giant black hole before 26th May 2014 Did India march to progress, prosperity and greatness just 4 years ago Is this claim not an insult to the intelligence of our people, she asked.
She also criticised the BJPs way of governance.
Our judiciary is in turmoil. RTI was brought to bring transperancy, but today that law is in cold storage. Aadhaar is being turned into intrusive instrument of control: Sonia Gandhi, she charged.
Reflecting on the Congress dismal performance in 2014 general elections, Gandhi said, We were out-marketed by Narendra Modi and the BJP in 2014, the corruption charges against us were highly exaggerated; how come person who gave the 2G scam report was given a cushy job, she said.
She also believes that the Congress needs to develop a new style of connecting with people in order to bounce back to power at the Centre. We have to look how we project our programmes and policies, Gandhi said.
Newly-appointed Congress president
Commenting on Rahul Gandhi, Sonia observed the newly-appointed Congress president needs to strike the right balance among general public. Gandhi who was Congress president for 19 years was replaced by her son Rahul last year after internal party elections.
Speaking about her own role in leadership after Congress came to power in 2004, she said that she knew Manmohan Singh would be better a prime minister than her, and that she was aware of her limitations. Public speaking does not come naturally to me, that is why I was called a reader than a leader, the Congress leader said.
When asked whether she will contest in the 2019 general election, she said, Whatever decision my party takes, I will abide by it.
She also expressed hope that the Congress party will be able to wrest power the BJP in the forthcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Sri Lanka takes lead in prison reform in Asia
Sri Lanka this year will host the Asian Conference of Correctional Facilities, Architects and Planners (ACCFA) at which officials and planners of correctional facilities in 16 countries will come together to discuss how best to design a prison. Prisons Commissioner and Prison media spokesperson Thushara Upuldeniya spoke to the Daily News of the plans for restructuring Sri Lankas prisons and of our journey towards reform, which has made us a shining example in Asian correctional facilities.
Excerpts follow:
Q: What is this conference about
A. The Asian Conference of Correctional Facilities, Architects and Planners is hosted each year by one of the countries in the region. This is the seventh conference. Last year it was held in Indonesia. We are hosting it this year. Here we will discuss how best prisons can be designed and planned to offer a suitable and conducive environment for prisoners. We will exchange ideas and knowledge on this subject with other countries.
When constructing a prison, you have to bear in mind that this is not just a building. This is where prisoners are rehabilitated and released into society. For this we need to have a conducive environment for such activities. At the moment, the services and facilities available in Sri Lankan prisons are not sufficient to carry out a complete rehabilitation programme for prisoners.
Like us, most Asian countries have problems with their prisons, especially when prison populations keep steadily increasing. This means there are fewer resources and officers to go around. We will discuss how we can overcome the issues faced within prisons.
Further, we will look into ways in which a prison can be designed according to international standards. In this venture, it is important to take into account security and how we carry out a successful rehabilitation programme and provide quality of life for prisoners (eg: accommodation, sanitation, etc). There are international standards prescribed for this called the Mandela rules which set down the minimum guidelines for prison construction. In addition, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has set guidelines for designing prisons.
Sixteen countries will take part in this conference; four international organizations and government agencies such as the State Engineering Corporation (SEC), Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) will join us.
We also have 85 international dignitaries attending the conference, along with prison commissioners and ICRC representatives.
Q: Why is this conference important for us
A. Since 2009, the government has taken special interest in restructuring and reforming the prisons. A separate ministry was created because the government gave importance to prison reforms.
There are several areas identified in the reform process. First, to improve prison infrastructure and move out of the old prisons. At present, all our old prisons are located in very economically lucrative plots of land within the city. So in keeping with the governments economic plan, we discussed with the government the handing over of these lands to the government and designing of new prisons under international guidelines. We planned eight such prisons, of which three are complete. They are Bogambara, Angunakolapelessa and Jaffna. Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Welikada have also been planned.
Similarly, in the recent past, we have looked into alternatives to imprisonment.
Any country which wishes to improve the criminal justice system looks into this. Not everyone who commits a crime needs imprisonment. Crimes have degrees of severity. We heard of a child who was sent to prison because she stole some coconuts; that should not be the case. We need to look at how serious the crime is and then implement the law. So we took the positive step to establish community-based rehabilitation programmes and we managed to reduce the prison population by 9,000. Here criminals with minor offences are kept within the community and rehabilitated.
At the same time, for drug addicts, we established a Drug Rehabilitation Centre in 2014 at Kandakadu. Now the courts direct these addicts to the centre without sending them to prison. This is under the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation. The concept here was to not treat them as criminals, but as addicts. And that they need treatment, not imprisonment.
Also, we have open prisons for short-term prisoners and have programmes in which the government gets revenue through them. This open prison concept was something that won us praise the world over. In addition, the Ministry intervened and appointed a committee to look into relief measures that can be provided to long-term prisoners. The Committee sends recommendations to the President, and prisoners on life sentence or death sentence have got some relief through that.
These measures won recognition for Sri Lanka in the region and they asked that the ACCFA be held in Sri Lanka this year so that they too can learn from us. Once they showed interest, our Minister, D.M. Swaminathan approved of it and we officially requested that it be held here and that is how we happen to be hosting it this year.
Our strategic partner in this project is the ICRC and they have also provided us some funds for the conference.
This restructuring process has got us many positive benefits and if we look at our prison population, ours is systematically dropping compared to other countries in Asia, where prison populations are on the rise. And this has happened in the last five years.
And the percentage of returnees has also decreased. The percentage of overcrowding has also reduced systematically in the last five years.
When you take direct admissions, in 2013 we had 30,000 prisoners, but by 2016 we had decreased to 24,000. Overcrowding (with 100 percent taken to be ideal) in 2007 was 226%, but in 2016 was 148%. This change was due to both legal amendments and creating more physical space through new prisons.
Q: For how long is this conference
A. The conference will be held from March 12-16. The opening ceremony will be under the patronage of Minister Swaminathan and Ministry Secretary P. Suresh, at the Hilton. Thereafter, the conference will continue up to March 15. We hope to take the delegates on an inspection tour of our new prison in Angunakolapelessa.
A prisoner is someone who has not been able to fit into a certain framework in his school, community or family. He has strayed from the right path and in order to bring him back to the right path, the officers in charge of such prisoners have to lead by example. So, the officers talents, professionalism and qualifications have to be developed and they need to be given the facilities to undertake rehabilitation of the prisoners.
At our new prisons, we have taken that side into account. Prison officers have to be residential; they cannot go home. They too in a sense are imprisoned within these four walls and have to be able to be summoned at any time. So they need to have good quarters and a good environment. In Angunakolapelessa, we have also constructed sports grounds and swimming pools for prison officials.
Q: Have you taken into account capacity issues in these new prisons Otherwise, would you not have the same problem as you have now, in the future
A. Yes we have assessed all that when designing the new prisons. For example, when we shifted the Tangalle prison, only 400 prisoners were there. But the new prison can now accommodate up to 1,200. We design prisons taking the future into account. And though we say today that our prison population is decreasing, that could change in future. If there are riots or tension in the country, the population could double and increase all of a sudden.
Q: What do we expect to gain from this conference
A. This conference will have the participation of prison designers and architects. They will talk with our engineers and discuss how they have designed prisons in their country according to the security level.
Here, with the assistance of the ICRC, we were able to get an assessment of the needs of our prisons.
Prisons cost several millions to build. Angunakolapelessa cost Rs. 5,000 million. So we need to first identify our requirements. Costs increase as the level of security needed increases. So if we build a high security prison and send people who have just a six-month term, there is no point. Thus,we send those short-term offenders to open prisons. In many countries, governments simply build high security prisons without really needing it; thus costs are high and are incurred unnecessarily.
High security prisons need more staff, more technical knowledge and are more stressful.
In a prison with less security, there is a risk of prisoners escaping, but that risk, compared to the management costs and construction of high security prisons, is less.
Q: What is the theme of the conference
A. We will be addressing five themes: current situation and issues of correctional facilities; developing in-house maintenance and waste management systems to reduce prison running costs; implementation of international recommendations and standards to design correctional facilities with effective, efficient and safe correctional services through adapted technology; building prions and correction facilities according to security levels to reduce the cost of management and facilitate effective treatment and rehabilitation programmes; and cooperation and collaboration among architects, planners and stakeholders in designing new correctional facilities.
Q: Do you think we can provide our prisoners with everything mandated internationally
A. No we dont have to do that. These international standards are only guidelines and at times what we have implemented in our open prisons is far ahead of the guidelines. No country in the world has a perfect prison. In every country, they adopt what is indigenous. The guidelines say that these are the minimum standards; you can adapt them according to your own needs.
For women prisoners, we have Bangkok rules and there is such a model prison built in Bangkok. We sent a team to look at that. Accordingly, we built a womens section in Angunakolapelessa.
In future, we will design four prisons and we have received international expertise for that.
Q: Prisoners usually get a negative impression from society. Do you think it will be easy to get government or public support to improve prison conditions
A. Yes, society has a wrong impression about prisoners. People think we are building luxury prisons here. But there is a saying that if you are to judge a country and its people, look at its prisons. It basically asks that we look at how we treat the most vulnerable in our society - those who do not have any power to ask for better. And if we do not treat them well, then as a society we have failed.
This is not about giving luxuries to prisoners. This is about providing the most basic of environments to prisoners to live as human beings in captivity. Societys responsibility is not to have them live in stressful and depraved environments. What is important here is not the length of a mans sentence, but whether he has been rehabilitated or not during that time period. We should not be happy that a man has been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. What we need is a man who changes his ways, even after a year behind bars. If he comes out in 10 years and kills again, he is more dangerous to society. So we need a good environment for rehabilitation to take place. If they are in an environment which is stressful, without toilets, is overcrowded and has no facilities, those prisons are of no use. That concept is of no use now.
What we must strive for is to change a mans mind. Even in Buddhism there is a saying that one must feed a man before you give him a sermon.
Thus, however much a prison officer advises a prisoner, it would be of no use if he is living in a stressful environment. Society also has a responsibility to ensure that prison officers look after the prisoners well and not be happy that an officer is beating them up. But many are happy if prisoners are ill-treated. What society has to be interested in is whether the rehabilitation programme is being done well.

Thisara Perera to lead, Chandimal suspended
Dinesh Chandimal has been suspended from Sri Lankas upcoming two Twenty20 Internationals in the three-nation series after being found guilty of a serious over-rate offence in Saturdays match against Bangladesh at the R Premadasa Stadium.
Sri Lanka Cricket said yesterday that all-rounder Thisara Perera would lead the team in Chandimals absence for the next two matches against India today and Bangladesh on Friday.
Chris Broad of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fine after Chandimals side was ruled to be four overs short of their target when time allowances were taken into consideration.
In accordance with Article 2.5.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Players Support Personnel, which relates to serious over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for the first two overs and 20 per cent per additional over their side failed to bowl in the allotted time, while the captain receives two suspension points.
As two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whatever comes first for the player, Chandimal has been suspended from his sides 12 and 16 March fixtures against India and Bangladesh respectively, while each of his players have received a fine of 60 per cent.
Chandimal pleaded not guilty to the offence, and, as such, Broad announced his decision following a hearing that took place on Sunday afternoon. The hearing was attended by the match officials and the Sri Lanka cricket team management.
If Sri Lanka commit another serious over-rate breach in a T20I within 12 months of this offence with Chandimal as captain, it will be deemed as a second offence by Chandimal and he will receive between two and eight suspension points.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah has also received a 20 per cent fine of his match fee, while each of his players have received 10 per cent fines after their side was ruled to be one over short.

Treading life mindfully
Some need Mindfulness to further improve our lives, to grow spiritually, to raise our standards of living and develop the mind. Then there are those who need Mindfulness to help us overcome depression, anxiety and many more mental ailments. Director of the Mindfulness Initiative UK Jamie Bristow was in Sri Lanka to attend and speak at the Global Mindfulness Summit held in Colombo recently. Bristow spoke to the Daily News on the Minds capacity to overcome these distresses and evolve spiritually.
Global Mindfulness Summit is a conference with international speakers. And I think it is important for us to share our experiences on mindfulness with the rest of the world. We are from different parts of the world so we can definitely learn from each other. So I am here to learn and share some of the success that we have had in the UK, said Bristow.
Bristow is the Director of the Mindfulness Initiative, a policy institute that works with politicians around the world who practice mindfulness. The Mindfulness Initiative grew out of a mindfulness training program in the UK Parliament, which has seen over 140 politicians take an eight-week training course, and provides the secretariat to the Mindfulness All-Party Parliamentary Group.
I am proud to be the Director of perhaps the worlds first think tank about mindfulness, thinking how mindfulness can be helpful in different areas of public life. I work in that role with the politicians in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the British Parliament, said Bristow.
Bristows life has been transformed by Mindfulness. This movement is generating much interest globally. Bristow and others like him have experienced this life changing science.
The reason I advocate Mindfulness, is because it has helped me so much, like so many people who are in this area teaching mindfulness. Our lives have been transformed and we think that other people should know about this. And we want to find some way of sharing this. I was lucky enough to train in mindfulness when I was in university. And then when I was working in a corporate environment I was really stressed and I practiced it a lot more as I was convinced that it was very helpful and then I spent the next 10 years trying to find a way to share it with other people, pointed out Bristow.
An anxiety disorder is one of the most distressing forms of mental ailments because the mind and the brain is basically acting against itself. Depression is another distressing ailment that many people suffer from.
In terms of society there is really strong evidence that mindfulness in a hospital or clinical environment is very helpful for different types of mental health issues particularly recurrent depression and anxiety. There is also evidence that it helps in different physical health problems, as well as helping people to be their very best and to flourish, explained Bristow.
Politicians and Business leaders, and any body for that matter can have benefits from learning how to be in control of their lives and becoming aware of themselves and the world around them.
The mind is like an ocean. Swim in it as deeply as you would want to. Unlock the power of the mind. Train it and develop it.
Mindfulness is probably best understood as a capacity of mind. It is a little like language acquisition, the capacity to learn languages. Some people have developed that capacity more than others. Those who are more mindful tend to be better decision makers. They tend to be more resilient to psychological problems to psychological distress. They tend to have more satisfying relationships. We have this natural level of mindfulness that we can cultivate more of, through practice and training and essentially through meditation. So these mindfulness training programs help us develop more of that capacity, added Bristow.
There are a variety of mental ailments such as Schizophrenia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Depression etc. There is a very special form of Mindfulness training developed specifically for those with such health problems.
The main one is M-B-C-T (Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy). It is a combination of very ancient techniques that were proposed by the Buddha 2,500 years ago. And this is combined with very modern cognitive science theories. And in an eight week course, you learn how to meditate in very ancient ways. And you also learn about the mind in very new ways. And that course, has been proved to be helpful with the above mentioned disorders, elucidated Bristow.
When it comes to poverty all the initiative can do is to help politicians make better decisions. Help them to develop empathy, understanding and feelings the emotions of others.
We hope those politicians who practice mindfulness feel what it is like to be in other peoples shoes and they will be better able to address the needs of those who struggle the most with poverty. There is also evidence or signs that Mindfulness is changing what people want in life. Our priorities are shifted from making money and instead are focused on a world with better values. This will hopefully address the problem of poverty, explained Bristow.
Bristow feels that there are a lot of people who need these programs but it is not widely available. So he pointed out the need for more governing bodies to get together and make these programs available to everyone. They work with the National Health Service in the UK, they work with police, politicians and public services and prison services.
So in some cases the governing bodies acting on these recommendations have put in a lot of more money into mindfulness training for depression for instance. In the UK we are seeing a lot of developments in prisons and our programs are supported by the department of education in schools, said Bristow.
Bristow pointed out that the wonderful thing was that the politicians themselves have recognized the need for mindfulness. This is a huge step in the fight against poverty or mental illness. The people at the top are interested in it and the people at the top have felt the need for change and they have heard the cries of the victimized. Politicians are talking to other politicians about the change they want to see in the society.
There are many religious traditions now that have adopted mindfulness practice such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. They all have elements of mindfulness practice - training the mind to be more aware and present. Mindfulness is mushrooming all around the world. These practices can be found in a lot of ancient traditions. I really believe that mindfulness can help us tackle societys most difficult problems, said Bristow.
Mindfulness is able to make us aware of our thoughts without necessarily believing those thoughts are facts. So for instance when treating depression, we have the thought that says you are a worthless person to that you say  oh that is just a thought. It is in my mind but I dont have to believe that is true. And hence you dont get depressed. Similarly with Schizophrenia, they have thoughts and voices telling them to do certain things that could be violent for instance. But by learning they are just thoughts and not facts, we learn to overcome those thoughts.

Trinity-Antonians at rugby today
The postponed inter-school rugby game between Trinity College and St. Anthonys College which was to be played on Sunday will now take place at Nittawela grounds today. The under 16 game will kick off at 3 pm and the senior game at 4 pm.
This will be the 55th encounter between the two schools. In comparison both sides appear to have the same characteristics and will rely heavily on fitness.
Trinity are likely to find most of their problems coming from up front where Antonians have shown tremendous fire in the two practice games. They have a superb set of forwards who could control the vital area.
For the Antoninas back division, its going to be a hard evenings work as the Trinitians scoring strength lies in their back division. The Antonians will undoubtedly try their best to hold them. As long as the ball is kept on the ground in straight forward rucks Trinity forwards can successfully initiate second phase attacks.
A good game of run and pass rugby is expected from these two enterprising teams, in the scrum down today. H.P. Veranga will referee.

US job growth surges in February
US job growth surges in February 9 March 2018 Share this with Facebook Share this with Twitter Share this with Messenger Share this with Email Share Image copyright Getty Images Image caption February saw the biggest rise in construction jobs since 2007.
Job creation in the US economy surged last month, but the annual rate of wage growth slowed.
The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, official figures show, far in excess of analysts' expectations.
However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.1%, while the annual earnings growth rate slowed to 2.6% last month.
January's annual wage growth rate - which had triggered fears over inflationary pressures - was also revised down from 2.9% to 2.8%.
The strong wage growth figure for January prompted sharp volatility on the stock market, as investors worried the US Federal Reserve would quicken the pace at which it increased interest rates.
Despite a lower-than-expected wage increase in February, many economists said longer term trends still point to higher wages.
The US economy is in its ninth year of economic expansion, with an upswing in global growth and tax cuts passed last year helping to boost growth.
Friday's report from the US Labor Department showed the biggest increase in jobs since July 2016, sending major stock indexes higher.
The three major US stock indexes climbed almost 2% by the close of trading and the Nasdaq closed at a record high.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 440 points, or 1.77%, to end at 25,335, the S&P 500 gained 47 points, or 1.74%, to 2,786 and the Nasdaq ended up 132 points, or 1.79%, to 7,560.
"We have an economy that is firing on all cylinders and the job market is a reflection of that," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Bank.
February's gains included an increase of 61,000 construction jobs - the biggest rise since 2007. The manufacturing sector also added 31,000 jobs, while retail employment rebounded from declines last year.
The number of people working or looking for work also jumped by more than 800,000 last month. That was the biggest monthly rise in the labour force in more than two decades and boosted the labour force participation rate to 63%.
Despite the rise, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, where it has hovered since October.
Those figures provided fodder for analysts who say wage growth could be moderated by a large number of potential workers sitting on the sidelines.
"The huge gain in payrolls belies the notion that the [labour] market has truly reached full employment," said Sophia Koropeckyj of Moody's Analytics.
Increasing participation by men of prime working age - between 25 and 54 years - has helped drive the labour force participation rate higher in recent months, reflecting a resurgence in sectors such as manufacturing.
But Koropeckyj said she does not expect the labour force to continue growing at last month's pace, pointing to challenges such as skill gaps and opioid addiction.
Americans are also moving less, fuelling a geographic mismatch between jobs and job seekers and hardening regional disparities.
"There's only so much of a boost you can get because a lot of people are structurally unemployed," she said. "Certainly there is slack, but how much of it will be practically absorbed is questionable."
Koropeckyj said a tighter labour market makes slow acceleration in wage growth "inevitable" this year.
The average hourly wage for private sector workers was $26.75 last month, up 68 cents from February 2017 and 4 cents from January.
Markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times in 2018. But with the inflation rate lagging its target 2% rate, it has been waiting for signs - like strong wage growth - of pricing pressure.
Analysts said strong hiring in February all but guarantees the Fed will raise rates at its meeting later this month, even if the figures were boosted by mild weather. But the relatively weak wage growth did little to resolve debates about whether policymakers will eventually move faster. BBC News

Vampire facials are for real!
As the name suggests, the facial is considered to be a diabolical beauty ritual, where the person is injected with their own blood for wonderful skin.
The procedure essentially involves extracting blood from the person undergoing the facial, processing it to the plasma consisting of platelets and growth factors and then re-injecting it to the persons face.
Vampire facial, or PRP (Platelet-rich Plasma), is believed to initiate a healing response in the skin with the help of platelets and growth factors, hence rejuvenating the skin.
While some people swear by the wonderous effects, some people consider it to be taking the beauty too far.
Believed to be quite painful, the facial gained a huge of prominence after it was featured on the reality show Kim and Kourtney Take Miami.

Villa beat Wolves to boost promotion hopes
LONDON, Saturday: Championship leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers promotion charge was halted as Midlands rivals Aston Villa handed out a 4-1 thrashing at a spirited Villa Park on Saturday.
Albert Adomah put Villa in front after seven minutes after a goalmouth scramble but the lead lasted only 12 minutes as Diogo Jota levelled for Wolves from Matt Dohertys cross.
James Chester restored Villas lead when he prodded in a Robert Snodgrass free kick and Lewis Grabban made it 3-1 five minutes later with another close-range effort.
When Icelandic midfielder Birkir Bjarnason toe-poked a shot past Wolves keeper John Ruddy in the 84th minute, the Villa fans could celebrate a victory that pushes them closer to the automatic promotion places.
They are now four points behind Cardiff City, who beat struggling Birmingham City 3-2 and seven behind Wolves.
Fourth-placed Fulhams fine run of form continued as they beat Preston North End 2-1 away thanks to a stoppage time winner from Aleksandar Mitrovic. Fulham are now unbeaten in 15 games.
Derby County and Middlesbrough make up the playoff spots in fifth and sixth respectively.
Middlesbrough beat Barnsley 3-1 while Derby, who also have 61 points, face Nottingham Forest on Sunday.
Bottom club Sunderland lost 1-0 at Queens Park Rangers and are four points behind fourth-from-bottom Barnsley. Hull City eased their relegation fears as they hit back from 3-1 down to beat Norwich City 4-3 Abel Hernandez netting two penalties before Harry Wilsons winner.

We have forgiven our fathers killers: Rahul Gandhi
Rahul Gandhi, son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who was assassinated by the LTTE, said that he and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had completely forgiven their fathers killers. For many years, we were quite upset and hurt, but somehow... (we have) completely (forgiven them), Gandhi said to a loud applause by an audience during a programme in Singapore on Friday.
Gandhi also spoke about the assassination of his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father Rajiv, stressing that it was a price that the family knew they had to pay for taking a stand. In politics, if you oppose the wrong forces and stand for something, you will die, he said.
We knew that my father was going to die. We knew that my grandmother was going to die, he said.
My grandmother told me she was going to die and my father... I told him he was going to die, Gandhi said. The Congress put out a video of the hour-long question-and-answer session on its Twitter handle.
Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 by security guards with whom he used to play badminton.
Rajiv Gandhi was attacked by a female Sri Lankan Tamil suicide bomber at an election rally near Chennai in 1991. It was an assassination that LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham, according to a 2016 book, had conceded was the outfits biggest mistake.
Gandhi, 47, has spoken about his fathers assassination in the past, but so far, declined to talk about his fathers assassins. Similar to when J. Jayalalithaa had proposed to release the seven persons serving a life-term in 2016, Congress had strongly objected, but Gandhi had underlined that this was a decision the government had to take. I will not give my personal opinion on this, he had said.
Gandhi opened up to talking about how he and his sister looked at the assassination and the assassins during the interaction with IIM alumni in Singapore.
The session had started with a question on the privileges that Gandhi, who is often derided for his political career as a member of the Congress first family, the Gandhi-Nehrus, had enjoyed.
Yes, there were a number of privileges where I sit, but I wouldnt say I havent been through a rough ride, he said as he began to talk about the assassination of his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father, Rajiv Gandhi.
So you live in a particular environment, surrounded by 15 people, morning, noon and night. I dont think thats a privilege, he said.
But these tragedies, he said, had conditioned him to see the human face behind the killings and not bear any hatred on anyone.
Gandhi recalled that when he saw Prabhakaran lying dead on the television in 2009, two thoughts had crossed his mind. I had two feelings; the first was why they are humiliating this man in this way... and second was, I felt uneasy...his family and kids. I understood deeply what it meant to be on the other side, he said, going on to speak about the phone call he made to his sister.
He killed papa, Gandhi told her,I should be happy that he is dead. Why am I not happy
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra told him she felt the same. (NDTV)

We still work to a mans timetable and a mans agenda
When Hilary Mantel was in law school in England, she started suffering terrible internal pains. No one took a young womans agony particularly seriously, especially if it was situated uterus-adjacent. She went to visit a psychiatrist, who diagnosed the source of her anguish: It was stress, he said, caused by overambition. He wondered if law school was too taxing. Mightnt a dress shop be a better outlet for her talents
What none of the doctors knew, but Mantel suspected because she was consulting surgical textbooks, was that she was suffering from a severe and undiagnosed case of endometriosis. The drugs prescribed for her psychological and physical misery led her to a mental-health clinic. There, she began to write a short story about a changeling that is, about a woman in rural Wales whose baby is snatched and switched for another. When she outlined the story to her psychiatristthe one who prophesied a dress-shop careerhe said I dont want you writing.
Spiky memoir
I dont want you writing! And you, Picasso, put down that stupid paintbrush. There are tomatoes to be packed. When I came across that anecdote in Mantels wonderful, spiky memoir Giving Up the Ghost, I almost shrieked. What if she had given up writing A tragedy for the world of literature. A tragedy for me, personally: She is my favorite living author.
Im firmly of the opinion that a journalist should never meet her heroes. They will invariably disappoint, not because of their own failings, but because they have been constructed out of some bright-sky material in the journalists brain and will necessarily be duller in real life. But, in a few cases, they do not disappoint, but leave an indelible, electric impression instead. Such was the case when I took the train one day to meet the woman whose latest novels had made her, against all expectations, a smash success.
Hilary Mantels little town on the Devon coast was ridiculously pretty, as pretty as a village from a BBC detective series in which the killer is the vicar or the lady who puts up the best pickles. It was prettier than it had a right to be. It actually had a caf called the Cosy Teapot.
And here lived a woman with a singular gift for inhabiting dark and sinister worlds, past and present, and finding the humanity and humor in them. Most of her novels were contemporary, though it was the most recent pair, set in Tudor England, that had made her a star. They were all novels born of her bodys pain, written in spite of that pain, or perhaps because of ithow better to transcend the body than imagining a world that is different, distant, peopled with intriguing strangers
There was no darkness in the cheery flat overlooking the sea, or the woman who answered its door. Mantel had the round, bright blue eyes of a china doll, even though her smile suggested a doll possessed by a mischievous demon.
The phone was ringing when I entered and hardly stopped (it was answered by her husband Gerald McEwan, a man she had divorced once and married twice).
The phone rang because, after a life of critical acclaim but popular obscurity, she had achieved a whacking great success with her novels about the life of Thomas Cromwell, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies (a final novel in the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, is in the works).
Everything that has happened since the publication of Wolf Hall has astonished me, she said, leading me slowly over to an overstuffed sofa. I should be shockproof, but Im not. Its not a world I thought Id be in. That world, for a woman sometimes confined by illness to an area close to her writing desk, was a huge and liberating one: two Booker Prizes for the first two novels of the trilogy, smash success stage and television adaptations, millions of copies sold. Even stranger, this popularity hadnt arrived on the wings of vampires or wizards or S&Mloving billionaires, but through highly literary, dense novels narrated in an archaic tense called the historic present. The books are not for all readers, and some complain that theyre too complex, too allusive.
Compelling consigliere
Yet, there they remain, the unicorn of the publishing world: thorny masterpieces that sell like iPhones. You cant go wrong with Henry VIII, Mantel said with her sly smile. We both knew that the real star of the books was Thomas Cromwell, the kings reserved and compelling consigliere, who began a pauper and ended with his head at the mercy of an incompetent executioner. The entire narrative arrived in one swoop, she said, when she heard a voice in her head say the words So now get up. They are the first lines in the first novel; they will likely reappear at Cromwells ignominious end.

What holds working women back
Womens marches, protests and the #MeToo campaign may paint a picture of women smashing through centuries of sexual inequality, but in many, very measurable ways, the push for progress is far from over. Especially when it comes to that old-yet-not-outdated foe, the workplace glass ceiling.
Women are still paid less, female bosses are still in the minority and motherhood still carries the risk of total career derailment and all this despite record numbers of women joining the workforce over the past decade.
So, whats going on If almost half of all the worlds women are now in employment, according to the latest edition of the Global Gender Gap Report, why are only 31 per cent leading their field To mark International Womens Day, we explore some of the most persistent forces working against womens rise to the top, whether its the household chores that drag them out of the race for top jobs, the employer who sidelines them for taking time off, or the spiraling pensions deficit that leaves many near penniless in old age.
Here are a few perspectives
1. Women are still paid less.
This may continue to be for another two centuries, according to Gender Gap data. British women who earn nearly a fifth less than their male colleagues effectively work for free for the first 67 days of the year, according to the TUC.
2. There is no refuge in retirement, either.
With women routinely earning less and for less time than men, many are entering retirement with rattling pension pots.
Its a disturbing prospect for many women, who require more money for healthcare and can reasonably expect to outlive men by a number of years.
3. #MeToo has left some working women out in the cold
The campaign has helped thousands of women stand up to sexual harassment, but it has had some unexpected consequences too.
Many powerful men feel reluctant to sponsor female colleagues for fear of rumours.
4. Domestic duties are slowing womens progress
Studies have shown that women shoulder most of the burden of housework and family care, even if they work as many employed hours as their partner.
The constant round of wiping and worrying can have a corrosive effect, leaving them too weary to take on high-profile projects or compete for the top jobs.
5. No one will hire a stay-at-home mum  it is official
It turns out your reluctant-housewife friend was right: employers really do discriminate against women who take time out of work to look after children. Recent research has found that stay-at-home mothers are half as likely to be asked in for an interview, than a woman who was employed but made redundant.
But its not all bad. Despite this gathering of gloomy perspectives, more broadly the outlook is actually brightening for women in the working world.
According to a recent PwC survey, women have become more ambitious than ever: 82 per cent are confident theyll reach their career goals and 77 per cent think they make a good leader.
Theres more: it turns out that when women negotiate for pay rises and promotions, they often succeed. www.weforum.org

Bigamous lawyer in police net
Narahenpita Police Chief Inspector Gayan Prasanne and his officers arrested a lawyer who had allegedly committed bigamy and allegedly duped other women with the promise of marriage.
The lawyer had mostly selected widows for this purpose. While already married, he had married two other women - an accountant in a Colombo firm and another woman from Negombo. His first wife lives in Moratuwa.
The lawyer was arrested and questioned by police following a complaint made to the Narahenpita Police by his first wife, last week. Police investigations revealed that this lawyer published matrimonial advertisements in the weekend newspapers that he is willing to marry a wealthy young woman. When he received replies, he was in the habit of directly contacting the party and agreeing to marry her. Once he won her confidence, he obtained money from her and then vanished.
He had married the third woman from Negombo and was living in a house in Narahenpita when he fell into the police net. The owner of this house is living abroad.
The lawyer had prepared a fraudulent document confirming that the house has been given to him and had leased the second storey to a businessman and obtained Rs. 7 million.
He had obtained a luxury car on lease from a company in Colombo, handing over a dud cheque for Rs. 2 million.
All information was collected by the Police team when they investigated into the complaint made by the first wife.
The suspect was produced before court and remanded pending further investigations, police said.

Citizen scientists track radiation 7 years after Fukushima
JAPAN: Beneath the elegant curves of the roof on the Seirinji Buddhist temple in Japans Fukushima region hangs an unlikely adornment: a Geiger counter collecting real-time radiation readings.
The machine is sending data to Safecast, an NGO born after the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster that says it has now built the worlds largest radiation dataset, thanks to the efforts of citizen scientists like Seirinjis priest Sadamaru Okano.
Like many Japanese, Okano lost faith in the government after the nuclear meltdown seven years ago.
The government didnt tell us the truth, they didnt tell us the true measures, he told AFP, seated inside the 150-year-old temple.
Okano was in a better position than most to doubt the government line, having developed an amateur interest in nuclear technology two decades earlier after learning about the Chernobyl disaster.
To the bemusement of friends and family, he started measuring local radiation levels in 2007, so when the disaster happened, he had baseline data.
The readings were so high... 50 times higher than natural radiation, he said of the post-disaster data.
I was amazed... the news was telling us there was nothing, the administration was telling us there was nothing to worry about. That dearth of trustworthy information was the genesis of Safecast, said co-founder Pieter Franken, who was in Tokyo with his family when the disaster hit.
Franken and several friends had the idea of gathering data by attaching Geiger counters to cars and driving around.
Like how Google does Street View, we could do something for radiation in the same way, he said.
The only problem was that the system to do that didnt exist and the only way to solve that problem was to go and build it ourselves. So thats what we did.
Within a week, the group had a prototype and began getting readings that suggested the 20 kilometre (12 mile) exclusion zone declared around the Fukushima plant had no basis in the data, Franken said.
Evacuees were sent from areas with lower radiation to areas with higher radiation in some cases, he said.
The zone was eventually redrawn, but for many local residents it was too late to restore trust in the government.
Okano evacuated his mother, wife and son while he stayed with his flock.
But a year later, based on his own readings and after decontamination efforts, he brought them back.
He learned about Safecasts efforts and in 2013 installed one of their static counters on his temple, in part to help reassure worshippers.
I told them: we are measuring the radiation on a daily basis... so if you access the (Safecast) website you can choose (if you think) its safe or not. Forty kilometres away, in the town of Koriyama, Norio Watanabe was supervising patiently as his giggling teenage pupils attempted to build basic versions of Safecasts Geiger counter. Dressed in blazers and tartan skirts, the girls pored over instructions on where to place diodes and wires.
Watanabe has been a Safecast volunteer since 2011, and has a mobile Geiger counter in his car.
In the days after the disaster evacuees flocked to Koriyama, which was outside the evacuation zone, and he assumed his town was safe.
But after I started to do the measurements, I realised there was a high level of risk here as well, he said.
He sent his children away, but stayed behind to look after his mother, a decision he believes may have contributed to his 2015 diagnosis with thyroid cancer.
As a scientist, I think the chance that it was caused by the Fukushima accident might be 50-50, but in my heart, I think it was likely the cause, he said.
His thyroid was removed and he is now healthy, but Watanabe worries about his students, who he fears will carry risk with them for the rest of their lives. If there are no people like me who continue to monitor the levels, it will be forgotten. Safecast now has around 3,000 devices worldwide and data from 90 countries. Its counters come as a kit that volunteers can buy through third parties and assemble at home.
Because volunteers choose where they want to measure at random and often overlap, they validate unknowingly each others measurements, said Franken, and anomalies or exceptions are checked by Safecast staff.
The NGO is now expanding into measuring air pollution, initially mostly in the US city of Los Angeles during a test phase.
Its radiation data is all open source, and has been used to study everything from the effects of fallout on wildlife to how people move around cities, said Franken.
He says Safecasts data mostly corroborates official measurements, but provides readings that are more relevant to peoples lives.
Our volunteers decide to measure where their schools are, where their workplaces are, where their houses are. And he believes Safecast has helped push Japans government to realise that transparency and being open are very important to create trust.- AFP

The Facebook should come under a certain amount of control. This becomes evident when one looks at the recent unrest stoked in the Kandy district by certain social media websites, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amarawerera said.
The Minister said this in response to a question raised by a group of journalists as to why the government had still not decided on a date to lift the ban on social media websites on March 10.
Minister Amaraweera said developed countries like China had totally banned Facebook. We in Sri Lanka should introduce some sort of control on Facebook after consulting public opinions, the Minister said.
If Facebook was harmless, there was no problem. If it was harmful, we should make some decision about it. I felt they must be controlled. It was better than fully banning it, he said.

The minister said that with the local government elections results, it was the media that enjoyed the victory most. Some voters were under the impression that a Pohottuwa victory would ensure former President Mahinda Rajapaksa becoming the next Prime Minister.
He added that the media focused more on the shortcomings of their regime, rather than highlighting the benefits the government bestowed upon the citizens of the country.
Minister Amarawera said that the country regained its international reputation that was lost during the previous regime due to the efforts of the current government and added that they also re-established GSP Plus and banned fish exports.

More ships could be attracted for servicing
Although nearly 200 ships pass through Sri Lankan territorial waters daily, the country has done little to attract them to offer services, said Chairperson Institute of Charted Shipbrokers (ICS) Anoma Ranasinghe.
Speaking at convocation held in Colombo, organized by the Institute of Charted Shipbrokers Sri Lanka branch, she said that local maritime and logistics services need to be developed broadly and expansion of port services was also important.
Therefore we must look at public, private partnerships and allow the private sector to be the driver with the government involved as a facilitator to develop the industry.
Due to the rapidly changing technology, we need to look at comprehensive range of maritime services such as ship management, ship financing, bunkering and bunker broking, marine insurance, ship broking, maritime legal services such as arbitration, litigation, ship arrest, maritime security, salvage & towage, off shore engineering need to be competitive with other maritime centers in the region. Chirperson Ranasinghe said the Ministry of Defense should give some advises to our shipping industry on matters related to human trafficking, migration, bribery and corruption, money laundering and also the most important Maritime Security.
Our members of the institute are internationally recognized shipping professionals who work towards high professional ethical standards of trust. She also focused attention towards the development of a cruise terminal and the East container terminal expansion and the installation of gantry cranes.
The need of introducing maritime and logistics in school and university curricula as well as at the tertiary and vocational level education was also highlighted.
Ranasinghe, said it is important to have quality human capital to achieve the goal of developing our maritime industry and therefore we need to focus on training and skills development from the grassroots level.
She highlighted that the formulation of a new National Maritime and Logistics Policy is currently underway and the maritime security should be expanded to the maximum to protect our countrys vast area of coastline and territorial waters. The Chairperson also said that 2017 was significant to the Sri Lanka branch since during the thirty years of its existence the local Maritime Industry was able to groom shipping professionals.

No community should persecute another
We are all Sri Lankans and we must love our country. No one community should persecute another to demonstrate their supremacy. If any community intends to do so, it would be disastrous. Therefore, one should learn to live with other communities cordially, in order to avoid conflict, Senior DIG Kapila Jayasekera said.
He was addressing a meeting attended by religious dignitaries, trustees of mosques and temples, civil society members, business community and social service movement representatives, which was held at the Akkatipattu Divisional Secretariat Office Auditorium.
The event was also participated by Ampara DIG Nuwan Weddhasinghe, Akkaraippattu Divisional Secretary Latheef, Akkaraipattu and Ampara ASPs and other police officers.
DIG Jayasekara thanked religious dignitaries for their efforts to curb the recent incidents of racial violence. He recalled how people suffered and lived in fear during the 30-year conflict and added that he regretted the series of unfortunate incidents that took place in Ampara and neighboring villages.

Our apparel earnings historic, but sector lacks hitech - Rishad
Sri Lanka Department of Commerce has created history as it jointly launched the first ever Policymakers Session on Digitalisation of Trade and Industries series by UNCTAD for UNCTAD member countries on March 8 in Colombo.
Our apparels, a major manufacturing export, is world class and this sector has reported biggest export earnings in history last year. This sector needs digitalization support, said the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on March 8, 2018.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the UNCTAD backed first Senior Policymakers Workshop on Digital Trade and Industrialisation on March 8 at Cinnamon Lake, Colombo. Joining the launch of the high level two-day session were DG Commerce, Sonali Wijeratne, UNCTAD Senior Researcher, Dr. Rashmi Banga, Centre for WTO Studies, Dr Abhijit Das and top policy makers and Commerce Secretaries from South Asia, ASEAN countries and even Europe.
Sri Lanka faces a number of challenges on digitalisation. These include slower growth of digital skills, and the need to successfully digitalize the export sectors including apparel. Our understanding is that industrialisation and manufacturing are drivers of growth in Sri Lankas international trade. Our apparels, a major manufacturing export, is world class and this sector has reported biggest export earnings in history last year at US$ 4.8 Bn, a 3% increase from 2016. This sector needs digitalization support for its advancement, said Minister Bathiudeen.
This UNCTAD initiative acknowledges E-Commerce as a tool to drive growth, narrow the digital divide and generate digital solutions for Developing and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The multilateral trading system has recognized that digitalization has its positive impact on trade and has included it in their agendas. Along with nine other countries Sri Lanka has signed up as a member of the group on 'Friends of E-Commerce for Development. UNCTAD believes that the value of global e-commerce is huge -which was $ 25 trillion in 2015 and continuing to grow."
"UNCTAD also says that e-commerce has great impacts on the world economy. What is important here is that Sri Lanka should not miss this global e-commerce opportunity. In this background todays session holds special significance for the Asian developing countries including Sri Lanka. I praise the Department of Commerce for joining UNCTAD in this global initiative.
UNCTADs first ever policy session on Digitalisation of Trade and Industrials Policy is unveiled in Colombo today, said UNCTAD Senior Researcher, Dr. Rashmi Banga.
"This is a first in a series of such session aiming to build country capacities. The second session in this ongoing series will be held in South Africa. This is not a series of negotiations with any country but rather is about building policy capacity of the countries, specially forging South  South cooperation. At present UNCTAD has already been requested by several countries to come and support in formulating their digitalisation of trade and industrialisation policies. A completed Digitalisation of Trade and Industrials Policy helps a country especially when that country enters any trade agreements.
Sri Lanka DG Commerce Sonali Wijeratne said that this is an important event for DoC in its partnership with UNCTAD.
Colombos two day sessions, concluded on March 9 was included working sessions on e-commerce data inclusion, e-commerce in WTO framework, digital infrastructure development in South Asia, Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) and digitalisation of South, WTOs Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) and Digitalisation, regional digital cooperation in South, and country perspectives on digital trade and the WTO.

Both a woman and a newborn infant whom she had allegedly abducted from the Vavuniya Hospital, were discovered by police at the Anuradhapura Hospital on Saturday (10).
The Vavuniya Police said the woman who is alleged to have stolen the two-day old infant had been arrested.
A 37-year-old woman from Bogaswewa had given birth to a male child at the Vavuniya Hospital on March 7. The Child had gone missing from the hospital on March 9. The child had been allegedly taken by the arrested woman when the mother had gone to use the washroom. Vavuniya Police had initiated investigations after the mother lodged a complaint that her child had been abducted.
Meanwhile, on March 8, a female resident of Kebithigollewa had arrived at the Anuradhapura Hospital with an infant who had a skin disease.
The woman had claimed that the child was her own and had produced a hospital admission card to prove her point.
However, doctors who felt suspicious had subjected her to a medical examination and had realised that she had not given birth to a child recently.
Subsequently, doctors had informed Anuradhapura Police and they had contacted Vavuniya Police after coming to know about the infants disappearance.
Police were also awaiting the results of a DNA test to prove the identity of the child.

Asia-Pacific trade deal signed by 11 nations
Eleven Asia-Pacific countries have just signed the trade pact formerly known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Although the US pulled out last year, the deal was salvaged by the remaining members, who signed it at a ceremony in the Chilean city of Santiago.
Chilean foreign minister Heraldo Munoz said the agreement was a strong signal "against protectionist pressures, in favour of a world open to trade".
The deal covers a market of nearly 500 million people, despite the US pullout.
In the absence of the US, it has been renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
Extraneous adjectives aside, its supporters say it's hugely significant, and could be a model for future trade deals.
Its main purpose is to slash trade tariffs between member countries.
But it also seeks to reduce so-called non-tariff measures, which create obstacles to trade through regulations.
There are chapters which aim to harmonise these regulations, or at least make them transparent and fair.
There are also commitments to enforce minimum labour and environmental standards.
It also includes a controversial Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism, which allows companies to sue governments when they believe a change in law has affected their profits. In alphabetical order: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The US is conspicuously absent.
President Donald Trump fulfilled an election promise by pulling out in January last year, labelling the deal a disaster for American workers.
In short, the biggest winners are expected to be in Asia, while the wealthier countries, on balance, are not expected to receive as much of a boost.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics says Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Vietnam will each receive a bump of more than 2% to their economy by 2030.
New Zealand, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Australia will all grow by an additional 1% or less.
The same study says the US could be a big loser, foregoing a boost to its Gross Domestic Product of 0.5% (worth $131bn).
What's more, it could lose an additional $2bn because firms in member countries have an incentive to trade with each other instead of with American companies.
Donald Trump isn't the only one who has failed to be convinced of its value, though.
Unions (particularly in wealthier member countries such as Australia and Canada) say the deal could be a job killer or push down wages.
Some economists have also suggested that free trade agreements are rigged by special interests, which makes their economic value far more dubious.
Yes, but there's no question the deal is diminished without the involvement of the world's largest economy.
The remaining nations' economies account for more than 13% of the global economy - a total of $10 trillion dollars. BBC News

Barbie unveils dolls based on inspiring women
Barbie dolls have been introducing girls to beauty and fashion trends for 58 years, but recently the company decided to switch things up. To better understand what the current society needs, Barbie surveyed 8,000 mothers. It found out that 86 percent of them are worried about what kind of role models their daughters are exposed to, so the company created 17 dolls of real and inspiring women.
Girls have always been able to play out different roles and careers with Barbie and we are thrilled to shine a light on real-life role models to remind them that they can be anything, senior vice president and general manager of Barbie, Lisa McKnight, said in a news release.
Each Inspiring Women doll comes with educational information about the way each woman shaped society. The lineup consists of both historical and modern-day figures. Amelia Earhart, the first female to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and Frida Kahlo, the acclaimed Mexican artist and activist, are among them. Although the series has only three dolls so far, the lineup is set to grow with the release of new ones, a spokeswoman for Mattel said.
Barbie also made new additions to its Shero program, which began in 2015. The initiative has already honored such history-making women like Ibtihaj Muhammad, Misty Copeland, Ava DuVernay, Eva Chen, and Ashley Graham. Now, its celebrating even more modern-day figures: gold-winning Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim, world-renowned chef Hlne Darroze, and others.

Boost your health, take up gardening
Indulging in gardening may not only keep older adults active but also boost their health and mental well-being, finds a study. The findings showed that older women who spend more than three hours on household chores a day and got less or more than seven hours of sleep a night, were less likely to be in good health.
However, the researchers found that the similar criteria had no effect on the health of elderly men. It is because older women spent more time doing repetitive housework like cleaning and cooking, while men spent time in gardening and maintenance work, which is mentally very stimulating, the Daily Mail reported.
"The difference in the sexes' health is probably to do with the type of housework women tend to do, which is a lot more repetitive and routine work, like cleaning and cooking. While this probably has some limited health benefits, it is not very physically active, is not really exercise and is not very stimulating mentally, which relates to physical health," researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology in Germany, Nicholas Adjei.
"Men did much more active household chores, such as gardening and maintenance. The physical exertion is good for the health, with gardening involving digging, mowing and carrying soil. We think gardening and fixing things may also be more enjoyable than cleaning," Adjei added.
For the study, researchers looked at more than 36,000 pensioners, who reported about their daily activities and general health. Healthiness was calculated based on participants' answers to a questionnaire, in which they rated their health on a five-point scale from "poor" to "very good".
The results showed that even taking away sleep, which can impact people's health, men appear healthier when doing jobs around the house.

Brutal Attack on private bus driver: SPC member, wife remanded
The Kaduwela Magistrate remanded the Southern Provincial Council member M.K. Kasun and his wife Tharaka Perera till March 13, for assaulting a private bus driver at Koswatte on Friday.
Southern Provincial Council member M.K Kasun is the son of former Southern PC member Damulle Ranjith (AKA Chandi Malli), who was killed in broad daylight within the High Security Zone at the Colombo Fort. Damulle Ranjith and his family are close supporters of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Here is a picture of Kasun, his wife and family taken with Rajapaksa, sometime ago.
They were produced before the Magistrate by the Thalangama Police after being arrested for the brutal assault of the bus driver plying on bus route no.177 from Kaduwela to Kollupitiya, following an argument.
The Provincial Councillors wife too had joined her husband in assaulting the driver while brandishing a pistol.
The Police had seized a pistol and several live bullets from their possession.
A person in the bus had captured the incident in his camera. The bus driver had been assaulted following a heated argument.
The bus driver who was assaulted had been admitted to the Mulleriyawa Hospital.
Further investigations into the incident are being carried out by Thalangama Police
Southern Provincial Councilor member M.K Kasun, a pohottuwa supporter is the son of notorious former Southern Provincial Councilor M.K.Ranjith alias Chandi Malli.
Chandi Malli was a close associate of former President, Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was shot dead in front of the Bank of Ceylons York Street branch on May 25, 2003 allegedly due to an underworld clash.
Public can get a taste of what Pohottuwa palanaya would be like
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera had sharp words not only for Kasun and his wife, but also for their political leaders who have been slow to condemn them.
Now the public can get a taste of what Pohottuwa Palanaya would be like, Minister Samaraweera said.
In the middle of a state of Emergency, trotting around with illegal firearms, brandishing them in public, assaulting innocent civilians over trivial disputes in broad daylight, that is how they want to run the country, Samaraweera charged.
How many more Pohottuwa politicians are out on the streets today brandishing illegal firearms, intimidating innocent people and inciting public unrest, he asked.
Will Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family come out and condemn this behavior How can they, after turning a blind eye to such brutality by their supporters in the past, he alleged.
Sajith condemns this type of brutish lawlessness
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa vehemently condemned the assailants, saying this type of brutish lawlessness is a true representation of the thuggery that the country could expect if politicians of this ilk are allowed to hijack control of the government.
The Minister further recalled that this is not the first time in recent memory that supporters of Mahinda Rajapaksa have threatened and assaulted innocent people.
He was referring to the 2014 incident when a mob led by gun-toting Hambantota Mayor Eraj Ravindra Fernando sprung upon several UNP Parliamentarians who were on a fact finding mission to the Hambantota port and harbour.
In 2014, they got off scot-free. Today, they will have to answer to an independent criminal justice system, Minister Premadasa added.
Pohottuwa supporters trying to take law into their own hands
Highways Minister and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim denounced Southern Provincial Councillor M.K.Kasun and his wife Tharaka Perera for their brutal assault of a bus driver in Koswatte.
This woman can clearly be seen brandishing a loaded firearm at the crowd and using the weapon to assault an innocent bus driver. This man should be ashamed. Provincial Councillors swear an oath to the Constitution, but their allegiance is clearly devoted to returning Sri Lanka to the ways that their political leaders used to govern, Minister Hashim said.
To them, the rule of law means that any Pohottuwa supporter can take the law into his own hands, and all who cross them must cow down and take public beatings or wait silently for their white van to arrive, Hashim added with disgust.
