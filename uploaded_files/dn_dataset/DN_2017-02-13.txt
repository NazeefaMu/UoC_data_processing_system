Alleged misuse of 40 state vehicles: Wimal, another remanded
Two suspects including National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa arrested for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government were yesterday ordered to be remanded till January 24 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
Weerawansa and SEC former Deputy General Manager Samantha Lokuhennage were arrested by the FCID under Public Property Act charges.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions. However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister. Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID added.
The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015. Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing for Weerawansa told Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents.
My client did not receive any financial benefit from this. There is no iota of evidence to prove that my client misappropriated public funds, the defence counsel argued.
Meanwhile, the defence counsel moved court that Weerawansa be released on bail taking into consideration his 15-year-old daughter health condition as exceptional circumstance.
The defence counsel informed Court his clients daughter was suffering from mental distress following a social media campaign against his family following the death of a youth at his residence recently.
Presidents Counsel Shavendra Fernando appearing on behalf of the second suspect informed Court that the FCID has taken measures to leave out certain individuals including the former SEC chairman from the inquiry.
The magistrate observed that she would announce her bail order regarding the suspects on the next hearing date and ordered them to be remanded until January 24.
The magistrate also ordered the FCID to take legal action against the other persons responsible for the alleged offences.
The FCID had filed a B report in Court against Weerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the state.

Centre Against Private Medical Colleges files against Medical Council

The Centre Against Private Medical Colleges (CPMC) has filed a case against the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) at the Human Rights Commission for registering private medical degree holders, CPMC Convener Dr. Jayantha Bandara told the Daily News.
Dr. Bandara said if unqualified, inexperienced and unsuitable persons who hold medical degrees obtained from private medical collages come into the Sri Lankan health service, the people's right to life will be violated because people can die due to wrong medical treatment and advise.
There is a possibility that the SLMC may register private medical degree holders as doctors enabling them to practice in Sri Lanka which will be a pure violation of Sri Lankan people's basic right to safe health service and the right for life.
That is why we filled a case, he said. There are many poor students who got through G.C.E Advanced Level with flying colours but failed to enter into state medical faculties.
They do not have money to obtain private education. But unqualified students who failed G.C.E Advanced Level Examination obtain private education and try to become `doctors, he charged.

China tells India to stay off its Indian ocean 'colony,' Sri Lanka

After claiming South China Sea to be its own sea, telling America to stay off its islands, China is reaching for the Indian Ocean,tellingIndia to stay off its own colony, Sri Lanka.
Thats something investors in Southeast Asian markets should keep a wary eyeon, as it opens yet another front between the two Asian giants, raising the geopolitical risk of investing in the region.
Markets, for the time being,seem tobe ignoringthese risks.
Chinas And Indias Equities
Sri Lankas colonization began back in 2007, when China suppliedPresident Rajapaksaboth military and diplomatic support to crush the Tamil Tigers.Then came high profile construction projects and high interest loans that eventuallywereswapped for equity, transforming China into an owner of Sri Lankas major portanda key outpost in the Indian Oceanfor Beijing.
Thats bad news for India, whichis becomingencircled by China.
Chinas growing involvement in sensitive ports so close to Indias shores fed New Delhis long-standing concerns about Chinese encirclement, writes Jeff M. Smith inForeign Affairs.
Forits part, China has repeatedly asserted that it doesnt plan to use the port for military purposes, thisassertion coming as recently as last week.
But history proves otherwise. In the past three years,Chinese submarines have begunsuddenly and repeatedly showing up in the Chinese-operated South Container Terminal in theport ofColombo.
And thats in spite of Indias high profile protests.
For India, the sudden appearance of a Chinese submarine in Sri Lanka was too much to bear, continues Smith.Seventy percent of Colombos transshipment traffic comes from India, and New Delhi has long been concerned over Chinas efforts to expand its presence in the island nation.
When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Rajapaksa a few weeks later, he reminded him that Colombo was obliged to inform its neighbors about such port calls under a maritime pact. But the same submarine surfaced again in November 2014, catching New Delhi by surprise once more.
Apparently, what China says it plans to do with its colony and whatit actuallyintends to do are two different things. And India must either devise a plan to contain China orbeprepared to put up with it.

Court calls for medical experts report on Duminda Silva

A Magisterial order was issued to Colombo National Hospital Director, Dr. Anil Jasinghe today (13) to submit a medical record of Former MP Duminda Silva on February 28.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala ordered the medical report to be recommended by a board of medical experts.
The Colombo Additional Magistrate also ordered the Superintendent of Welikada Prison to produce the former Parliamentarian before the panel of medical experts to be examined.
The Welikada Prison Superintendent was previously ordered to produce former MP Duminda Silva before a neurologist attached to the Colombo National Hospital to obtain a medical report.
However, Colombo Chief Medical Officer Ajith Thennakoon had consistently ordered the reports to be obtained from a panel of medical experts representing neurology, physical health and psychiatric.
The prison authorities failed to present the former Parliamentarian, alleged for three corruption cases filed by the Bribery Commission before Courts today.
Previously, the Prison officials informed courts that Duminda Silva was not fit enough be brought before courts even by wheelchair.
However Former MP Duminda Silva was brought to the Colombo Chief Magistrates Courts in an ambulance on January 5, by prison authorities.
The Bribery Commission alleged former Parliamentarian for failing to declare his assets and liabilities in accordance with the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975, for a period of three years since 2011 to 2013.
Former MP Duminda Silva was sentenced to death on September 8, 2016 by the Colombo High Court for murdering four people including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra On October 8, 2011 and is now serving a sentence of imprisonment in the Welikada Prison.
When observing this case, the defence counsel appearing on behalf of former MP informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala that his client was willing to plead guilty if the court would impose only a fine.
The Bribery Commission officials told Court that according to Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs.1000 with a years jail term for an individual condemned guilty of charges.
Subsequently, defence counsel informed the Court that his client will not pledge guilty to the charges against him, instead will move for a trial.
Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission, Thushari Dayaratne appeared on behalf of the prosecution.
Defence counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared on behalf of Former MP Duminda Silva.
The Bribery Commission named the Deputy Secretary General of Parliament P.M.Neil Parakrama and several others as witnesses for these cases.

The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Parents' Association yesterday called on the government to intervene and provide a permanent solution to the issues faced by their children studying at the private medical college.
SAITM Parents' Association Head Gemunu Wijeratne told the media in Colombo that parents of several students have died and many others have fallen ill due to the plight of their children.
He noted that both parents and children have undergone severe mental stress as the issue concerning the private medical college has been dragging on without any permanent solution.
Wijeratne said is high time that all stakeholders get involved and find a lasting solution to the SAITM issue without heaping further burden on both parents and students.
The parents also criticised the stand taken by the Sri Lanka Medical Council and the Government Medical Officers Association over the SAITM issue. They urged both the President and the Prime Minister to get involved and provide a permanent solution.

North Korea says ballistic missile test was a 'success'

North Korea has confirmed that it "successfully" fired a ballistic missile on Sunday in a test supervised by leader Kim Jong-un.
The device was described as a "surface-to-surface medium-to-long-range ballistic missile", the Korean state news agency KCNA reported.
South Korea's defence ministry called it an armed provocation to test the response of US President Donald Trump.
North Korea's latest ballistic missile test has been widely condemned.
The US, Japan and South Korea have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident.
KCNA reported that the test of the Pukguksong-2 missile, a new type of strategic weapon said to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un.
It added that the missile was fired at a high angle in consideration of neighbouring countries.
The rocket used a solid-fuel engine, the report said, which gives ballistic rockets greater power and range.
South Korea military experts said the rocket had been launched by a "cold-eject" system, which uses compressed gas for its initial thrust, a system employed for submarine-launched missiles.
The report also said that Kim Jong-un "expressed great satisfaction" over the test launch, which it said "adds to the tremendous might of the country".
South Korea and US officials said the missile flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km (300 miles).
The missile reached an altitude of about 550km (350 miles), the South Korean military said.
Experts suggest the tests are programmed for shorter distances to avoid a missile landing on Japan.
This was the latest in a series of tests in the past year, including North Korea's fifth of a nuclear device.
The launch took place at 07:55 local time (22:55 GMT Saturday) from the Panghyon air base in North Pyongan province on the west side of the Korean peninsula.
United Nations resolutions forbid North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile tests - part of wider efforts to prevent it becoming a fully nuclear-armed power.
South Korea's foreign ministry said that "North Korea's repeated provocations show the Kim Jong-un regime's nature of irrationality, maniacally obsessed in its nuclear and missile development".
'Hostility'
Nato also condemned the missile test, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urging North Korea "not to raise tensions further and to re-engage in a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community".
The European Union joined the criticism, declaring in a statement that North Korea's "repeated disregard of its international obligations is provocative and unacceptable".
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, standing next to Trump on a visit to the United States, said the test was "absolutely intolerable".
As for the US, Trump said on Saturday: "America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%."
China, North Korea's closest ally, has yet to comment. Beijing has joined in international efforts to press Kim Jong-un to rein in his nuclear ambitions.
In January, Kim Jong-un warnedthat his military was close to testing long-range missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the United States mainland, but experts doubt the technology has progressed that far.
At the time, Trump derided the claim in a tweet, saying: "It won't happen."
On a visit to South Korea last week, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said that any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with an "effective and overwhelming" response.
He also reconfirmed plans to deploy a US missile defence system in South Korea later this year.

Environmentalists assert that tens of thousands of animals and birds die every year from plastic bag litter. Plastic bags, once ingested, cannot be digested or passed by an animal so it stays in the gut. Plastic in an animals gut can prevent food digestion and can lead to a very slow and painful death. Recently, the Giritale Wildlife Department nursed to health an elephant that was found to have consumed vast amounts of polythene. The elephant found lying in a swamp at Manampitiya later discharged 40 kilogrammes of polythene, after being given 40 litres of water and three litres of coconut oil. Picture by Saman Sri Wedage

Tiger Woods: Back spasms put comeback on hold

His comeback was derailed by back spasms and now Tiger Woods has pulled out of a further two tournaments.
Woods has withdrawn from next week's Genesis Open -- a tournament that benefits his foundation -- and the Honda Classic in Florida.
The former world No. 1 blamed a recurrence of the back spasms that forced him to retire from last week's Dubai Desert Classic.
"My doctors have advised me not to play the next two weeks, to continue my treatment and to let my back calm down," Woods, now ranked 674th, said in a statement on his website.
"This is not what I was hoping for or expecting. I am extremely disappointed to miss the Genesis Open and the Honda Classic."
Woods is still expected to travel to Los Angeles to support the Genesis Open and his foundation, while a decision on his playing schedule will be determined after further injury assessments.
It is 20 years since Woods won his breakthrough major at the Masters, but his presence at Augusta in April now looks in doubt.
"Never feel great again"
The Dubai tournament was Woods' second full-field event since returning from a 15-month injury layoff following multiple back surgeries.
Before the event he admitted that a catalogue of injuries during his career had taken their toll on his body.
"I feel good, not great. I don't think I will ever feel great because it's three back surgeries, four knee operations," Woods told former R&A chief executive Peter Dawson in a video interview for Dubai's Vision Magazine at the Burj Al Arab hotel.
"I'm always going to be a little bit sore. As long as I can function, I'm fine with that."
"Dark times"
Woods said he experienced "dark times" during his lengthy layoff and doubted whether he would ever play the game again.
"It was a tough, tough road," he told CNN's Living Golf show. "There was a lot of dark times where I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't move, the pain was too great.
"Anyone who's ever had nerve pain in their back, they certainly understand what that feels like. I honestly didn't know this time last year, I didn't know if I'd ever play golf again. Just because of the fact that it's nerve pain."
Woods made his comeback in a limited field event in the Bahamas in December and showed promise by leading the field in birdies, although a number of costly errors meant he finished 15th of the 17-man field.
He missed the cut in his next event, the PGA Tour's Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in California last month and slumped to a five-over 77 on day one in Dubai before retiring.
Woods looked to be moving gingerly around the Emirates Golf Club course, but told reporters afterwards he "wasn't in pain at all," adding: "I was just trying to hit shots, and I wasn't doing a very good job."
Woods hasn't won a tournament since 2013 and clinched the last of his 14 majors in 2008.
The Masters starts on April 6 in Augusta, Georgia.
