Cargills Bank records Rs 18.3 mn PAT
Cargills Bank recorded a post tax profit of Rs. 18.3 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decline of 57% compared with the corresponding period in the previous year.
The post-tax profit was adversely impacted by higher operational expenses and increase in impairment provision.
However, the interest income growth of 51% to Rs 876 million during Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 reflects the robust business performance. There was also satisfactory growth in the Net Interest Income (NII) by 41% to Rs. 462 million backed by improved Net Interest Margin (NIM), from 5.53 to 5.74%.
The Banks focus on improving non fund based income witnessed satisfactory returns. Net fees and commission income of Rs 33 million recorded a growth of 15% for the period under review benefiting from the higher trade volumes in core banking activities. The total other income of the bank grew by 31% for the period amounting to Rs 44 million reflecting the growth in gains generated from investments in government securities.
The Banks operating expenses of Rs. 376 million increased by 30% compared to the first quarter of the previous year. The bank also invested in Kiosks which are now being promoted under the concept Bank in a Box.
The Bank successfully launched Sri Lankas first contactless Mastercard branded Debit card with EMV Compliant Chip and PIN Technology in July 2017 replacing the previously issued proprietary ATM cards.

Chamara Lakshan laid to rest
The funeral of Chamara Lakshan Kumara, the versatile young Editor-in-Chief of Resa and Silumina newspapers, was held in his native Matugama yesterday afternoon amidst a large gathering.
A large number ANCL media personnel and employees were present at the funeral, along with the members of ANCL top management headed by Chairman Krishantha Prasad Cooray. Hundreds of print and electronic media journalists from other media institutions were present, including those from Rivira and Lakbima where he worked prior to joining the ANCL. There was also a large crowd from Matugama, where he lived and schooled and the vicinity.
Among those who visited his residence to pay their last respects were members of the clergy from all religions, ministers, politicians, artistes, academics and professionals. Earlier, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera had sent their condolences. They described his demise as a massive loss to local journalism, where Chamara shone with his innate journalistic brilliance.
At 39, Chamara was the youngest-ever editor of the Silumina newspaper, which he edited concurrently with the nascent daily publication Resa, launched a few months previously by ANCL. Chamara quickly adapted to the high-pressure environment of a seven-day working week and managed to make a discernible difference in the Silumina after just a few weeks at the helm.
He brought his unique style of journalism over to the Silumina, which had stagnated for quite some time for want of fresh ideas. He edited the Silumina for only a few weeks before his life was tragically cut short, but they proved to be a new beginning for the newspaper. The reading public responded enthusiastically to the new ideas and insights he introduced for the first time to a Sunday Sinhala newspaper. Surveys revealed that he had managed to attract young new readers to the Silumina for the first time in many years.
Chamara who was well known for his political analysis and remarkable memory of places, people and events, wanted bring a huge change among the community through the Resa which was aimed at the grassroots reading public. The Resa was synonymous with Chamara. His aim was to bring Silumina and Resa to a good position and win the trust of the people. His aim was to be objective and truthful as far as possible. The Resa under Chamara was widely praised for its balanced coverage of the Digana incidents a few months ago and several media watchdog organisations have decided to recognize this effort with a formal award.
Resa carved a new niche in the local journalism arena, having given the other morning newspapers a run for their money with 16 pages of informative and entraining reading material. Chamara had a way with words which permeated to the two newspapers and he encouraged the young journalists working under him to explore new frontiers and go boldly in search of the truth. He was a perfectionist who demanded  and got  the best out of his young teams at Resa and Silumina.
Chamara knew that the secret of a young newspapers success would be an equally young staff. Chamara identified himself with the ideas and aspirations of his young staff, which came out with excellent copies under his able guidance. They will miss Chamaras warm personality and brilliant mentorship. But it was also no secret that many older journalists turned to Chamara for facts and insights.
With his new ideas and positive thinking, Chamara threw archaic conventions out of the window and infused a fresh perspective to news stories and features in both newspapers. He could enliven even the most jaded story with his unique brand of reportage and writing style. Be it politics, social commentary or the occasional foray to sport, Chamara managed to shed light on relevant issues and enlighten the reader with the complete, no-holds barred picture.
Chamara leaves a rich legacy that is hard to beat in the sphere of Sinhala journalism. A young child will miss his father and a young woman her husband, but in the bigger scheme of things, an entire fraternity of journalists will miss a remarkable journalist whose incisive reporting, writing and above all, mentoring shaped and defined local journalism for many years.
There was not a dry eye left in the crowd as Chamara was laid to rest. His name will live on eternally in the sphere of local journalism and inspire a younger generation of journalists to go in search of the truth.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Chamara Lakshan left us too soon - MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa
Chamara Lakshan was an independent media personality who believed in democracy, JVP Parliamentarian Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said.
Resa and Silumina Editor-in-Chief Chamara Lakshman allowed space for articles and columns carrying dissenting views, Dr.Jayatissa said while satating that his demise was a rude shock.
You left us too soon he said addressing the gathering at Chamara Lakshans funeral.
JVP Western Provincial Councilor Sunil Watagala said Lakshan was an exceptional character who stood out from the rest.
As philosophers have rightly said, there is no point in weeping at an unexpected demise like this. If he was expecting to reach a certain goal, we must continue to pursue it and accomplish it for him. We have to strive to build the society he wished to see he added.
Western Provincial Councilor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe rekindling his memories of Chamara Lakshan said the interviews Lakshan conducted helped shape their political career.
He rendered a great social service through his contributions to Lakbima, Rivira, Irudina, Resa and Silumina. He made a radical change at Lake House. His demise is an unbearable loss to us, he said.

CHASING DREAMS!
People always say that dreams do come true, and this is my dream coming true, said Yashenka de Zoysa, the 18 year-old Chairman of the Western Music Society at Royal College, Colombo. He is one of 40 members of the Royal College choir selected to compete in the World Choir Games, which is popularly known as the Choir Olympics. For the first time this year, Sri Lanka is sending two choirs to participate: Royal College and Soul Sounds Academy. 
The World Choir Games, held biennially (every even year), is purportedly the largest choir competition in the world. In 2016, at the Games in Sochi, Russia, some 12,000 singers in 283 choirs from 36 countries participated. This year, the Games held in Tshwane, South Africa from July 4 to 14 will have at least 9,000 participants.
Being selected to represent Sri Lanka at the World Choir Games has come about after the boys won the Gold medal under the Youth choir category at the Asia Pacific Choir Games last year. Boys from grade six to 13 have been selected to take part in this event. A band too will accompany them in providing music for the songs. 
Speaking to the boys of Royal College, their passion for singing rings true.
[Music] is filled with soul. When you sing you can express your feelings to the audience It gets me out of my sad mood. It gets me out of my troubles and feelings. Every time when I sing, all my troubles go away. It feels like home again, anywhere, said Pavan Abeysinghe, a bass in the choir.
The choir represents brotherhood. We all know everyone inside out. We know that we are there for each other, so that gives us all strength to perform at our best, Pavan Abeysinghe expressed.
He has been involved in the choir since 2012. Singing has been his passion and he has joined the primary choir in grade one.
But passion is only the first element necessary for the Royal Choirs success this year. Priyanthi Sudusinghe, the teacher in charge of the choir, and Sureka Amerasinghe, the choir directress, described the almost fourteen-year-long effort it took to bring the Royal College choir to this point.
I have trained choirs before and we have had the most amazing team from Royal College. We initially started off trying to be the best choir in Colombo. They won provincial competitions and this motivated them to aim higher but I did not know that my boys had dreams of wanting to become the best choir in the world, Amersinghe said with a smile.
The hallmark of Royal College is in its originality. Amerasinghe firmly endorses the idea that when she gives to Royal College, she gives back to Sri Lanka. Most of the choristers are also part of the Royal College Western Orchestra.
A boys choir is more complete. We do not get Tenor or Bass in a girls choir. You get less voice singing in a mixed choir. However this kind of setup unites and binds them together, she explained.
Sudusinghe added that the growing interest towards being members of the choir resulted in the annual Festival of Choirs, a choral festival which encourages fellowship among school children. The event is organized by the schools Western Music Society.
The instructors were inspired by the boys enthusiasm and hard work, which was the only way to push through their grueling practice schedules-from two to four hours a day, three to five times a week. On top of that, the choir received support from Royal Colleges Principal, B A Abeyrathna, who described how, they preformed well from the beginning, and he knew that it was important for Royal College to invest in the choir.
The Royal College choir prepared several songs for the event, some of them integrating choreography with the music. In the Youth Category, the college is performing Sri Lankan Coral Fantasy, choreographed by Dinesha Senayake, a Hungarian song, an African song, and When You Believe from Prince of Egypt. A collage of Sinhalese folk songs has been included for the Folklore Category with Accompaniments. In the Pop Category they are performing I want you back and ABC by Michael Jackson, a Stevie Wonder medley, Uptown funk by Bruno Mars, and a Queen medley.
Choir Leader Nisal Pathiraja said that says that his duty is to see that things run smoothly and take care of the other members.
There are no special powers because we all consider ourselves as equals, he said.
Nipun Kannangara is the Assistant Choir Leader. He said that he is looking forward to taking part in the World Choir Games.
It has been a dream some years back but we were the ones who got the opportunity to turn it into a reality, he enthused.
When You Believe is Nipunas favourite song out of the collection. He says that the song sounds amazing when the boys sing it on stage. This was one of the reasons why they managed to win the Gold medal at the Asia Pacific Choir Games.
Being able to pitch properly and the quality of a persons voice matters a lot when you are a member of a choir. Meth Hettihewa notes that they faced a couple of auditions before being included in the final 40. He says that it is an honour to represent his school and the country at the event.
The Asia Pacific Choir Games was a new experience for us. All the judges were foreigners and competing with foreign choirs and actually winning a medal boosted our confidence. Singing is only part of the choir. We have a lot of fun in the process. That is one of the keys to our success, he said.
The Hungarian gypsy song is the toughest song in the collection. Uptown Funk is one of our favourites. There is a lot of chorography involved in the songs, Amiru Gamage said adding that more than winning the competition they would like to show the world that the Royal College choristers enjoy music.

CIABOC chief in quest to rout culture around corruption
When Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, the country inherited a host of British criminal laws, and their legacy lives on today. Years later, some of the laws, including those that pertain to bribery and corruption, have not been updated for the 21st century. According to Sarath Jayamanne, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), he and his team have received Cabinet approval to move forward with amending outdated laws as a part of a full-fledged effort to rout the culture around corruption in Sri Lanka.
In an impassioned speech at the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka, Jayamanne called for deeper, comprehensive and systematic reforms to fight bribery and corruption, Of course, you have to catch, investigate, and prosecute, he said to a crowded auditorium of public servants and citizens, but you cant solve the problem of bribery and corruption by merely doing that.
Jayamannes remarks come on the heels of Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dassanayakes decision to reject bail for Presidents former chief-of-staff, I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation former chairman, P. Dissanayaka, who were arrested in May while accepting Rs. 20 million in bribes from an Indian investor.
Moving beyond prosecution
Despite these developments, Jayamanne noted that Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index has Sri Lanka ranked at a dismal 91 out of 180 countries - an improvement of only four spots from Sri Lankas 95th place position in 2016.
Jayamanne said he is looking outside of the country for models of clean government to emulate. In the British legal system, their main focus is conducting investigations, he said. That was followed by other countries like Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. In Sri Lanka, investigation has been less central in efforts to eliminate corruption. Historically, police officers have been responsible for carrying out investigations, rather than experts with a focus in the area of the crime.
Specifically when it comes to financial crimes, corruption, and asset cases, you need to have a forensic eye, said Jayamanne, who has a background in science and is known for introducing DNA evidence to Sri Lankas legal process. You need to have accountants, bond experts, and banking experts, he added. They will go beyond what is apparent in the bank statement. Unfortunately, up to now, we have never had any graduate, we never had a single accountant, and no one really speaks on the public floor about these things.
Jayamanne also asked what policy and cultural differences allowed Sri Lanka to wind up plagued by corruption, while countries with a similar colonial past like Singapore and Hong Kong have not.
He praised Singapore, ranked sixth on the Corruption Perceptions Index, for making the honesty of civil servants their most prized resource and for not hesitating to fire public servants who do not live up to their high expectations. Jayamanne also mentioned Hong Kongs strong corruption policies, which apply just as much to police officers as they do to high-profile politicians. Just last year, former chief executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang, was tried for receiving bribes in the form of apartment renovations.
Better legislation
On a government visit to Bhutan, Jayamanne was impressed by the nations strict gift-giving rules, which made it very difficult for the Bhutans prime minister to accept a gift from the Sri Lankan officials. We were shocked, Jayamanne remembered, because we are a country, where for the New Year, Ramazan and Christmas, we send hampers to everyone.
In order to hold public servants accountable in Sri Lanka, Jayamanne proposed a number of policy initiatives from strict gift-giving rules to conflict of interest laws, which will not allow public servants to favour friends and/or family members in their practices.
According to Jayamanne, direction has been given to the legal department to amend the bribery law and the declaration of assets law. The latter has not been updated in 30 years, and currently, the fine for failing to submit a declaration of assets form is a startlingly low Rs. 1,000.
Jayamanne noted that this is not the only law stuck in the 20th century. Over the last 23 years, not a single word of the Bribery Act has been changed either.
If Sri Lanka is to become a hub for international business, Jayamanne believes it is crucial that the government also hold the private sector to similar standards. If a member in the private sector accepts a bribe, you cant say it only affects the private sector, said Jayamanne. It affects the integrity of the entire country. That is why we need to introduce a private sector bylaw.
For Jayamanne, policy initiatives are a key element of change, but in order to fully realise a clean government, he believes Sri Lankans must dig deep, beyond the policies, arrests, and prosecutions, to the very values that define their everyday lives. In places like Singapore and Hong Kong, Jayamanne says people are not as predisposed to compare their financial situation with others. They dont compete with each other to buy a new house, buy a new car. All people travel in common transport, he said. In Sri Lanka, we are always comparing ourselves to our neighbours.
Jayamanne believes a culture of materialism and a fixation on money are the underpinnings of corruption, and in order to have sweeping changes, new values must be instilled early on in life. When a child becomes a public servant, the seeds that were sown 25 years back are still in his mind, says Jayamanne. If we want to have a clean country, we must start with the children.
While Jayamanne is looking to other countries as models for fighting corruption, his vision has not strayed too far from home. As the Navy adds final touches to the corruption court in downtown Colombo and the court trial of Mahamana and Dissayanka continues, he is also reaching out to the provinces, travelling everywhere from Jaffna to Kandy for consultations with citizens about how to end corruption in Sri Lanka, once and for all.

CID to probe into New York Times report - PM
The Criminal Investigations Department will conduct an investigation on the recent allegations made by the New York Times report, based on Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayakes complaint.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday told Parliament that Deputy Minister Ramanayake initially lodged the complaint at the police and the case was later transferred to the CID.
If someone is speaking of democracy, stop threatening the journalists first, PM Wickremesinghe urged.
He pointed out that New York Times International Editor in a statement has observed that the two local journalists who have assisted them in the investigation report were threatened.
The Premier said such threatening has tarnished the image of the country.
These people do this out of habit. When these fellows were in power, Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed. Ekneligoda was killed. Keith Noyahr and Upali Thennakoon were attacked.
This habit is so much, they threaten New York Times while they are in the Opposition, the PM in reply to a question raised by UNP MP Marikkar pointed out.
The Prime Minister also requested the JO to withdraw the threat made by them at a recent press conference against the media personnel.

Why write off microfinance loans
Over the weekend, there was a front-page news article indicating that the Govt. is to rescue hundreds of families from microfinance debt trap. According to the news item, the Government is to use taxpayers money to provide debt relief to families in the North, Eastern and North Central Provinces who have been affected. It also indicated the beneficiaries include women-headed households in 8 drought affected districts of the three provinces.
The non-performing microfinance loans in the North and East is not a recent phenomenon. During the three-decade conflict in the North and East since the formal financial institutions were unable to access them, this was fertile ground for international and local NGOs. This situation was further aggravated by the Tsunami in 2004. There were numerous grant programmes initiated by the international NGOs and donors and the North and East people got used to the generous grant schemes. After the cessation of hostilities, the government and the donors funded livelihood programmes to help them restart their economic activities. In the meantime, the informal and commercial microfinance companies entered the arena and started providing funds.
However, writing off loans closer to provincial and presidential elections and the selection of the provinces do not bode well for the microfinance industry. I recollect Dr. W. A. Wijewardane long years back mentioning that its not the funds allocated for writing off loans that are more damaging but the adverse impact on the credit culture created by such action.
We need to bear in mind the poor are not the rustic poor who lived a few decades ago. These people who live in rural areas are well connected with the rest of the world via mobile technology and have been corrupted by the system. Most of the young rural poor are dependent on their parents or the elderly population. Therefore, the practice of writing off loans by incumbent governments which were abandoned with the dawn of the 21st Century should not be introduced once again. Its obvious these policy measures are geared towards obtaining political mileage and if it is inevitable need to be done with less or no fanfare to minimize the damage on the credit culture.
Its also ironical that international financial institutions who have the leverage with the government do not caution them of these unsavoury practices. It is rather distressing to find that country is still using the financial sector in a primitive way to alleviate their own deficiencies.
Actually what the government is doing is bailing out the unscrupulous microfinance institutions with taxpayers money. It would be good to know what action would be taken against the institutions who have been engaging in reckless lending rather than cleaning their loan books. Rural poor will anyway bear the cost indirectly since this is funded by the budget, but they are not rational enough to understand it.

ComBank in Worlds  Top 1,000 Banks again
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has been ranked among the Top 1000 Banks of the World in 2018, and remains the only Bank in the country to be on this prestigious ranking for eight consecutive years.

Managing Director,CEO Jegan Durairatnam said, A ranking in the Top 1,000 could be approximated to being among the top 6% of the banks of the world, which is extremely respectable. Holding ones position within that elite group for eight years means that we are maintaining growth rates that are keeping pacewith or are exceeding those of other leading international banks, despite the challenges we face.
The top four positions in the 2018 global ranking are held by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank,Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China.

Cook with kids
Some mornings, making breakfast is the last thing you want to do. With holidays around the corner, if your children know their way around the kitchen, let them make their own morning food with these breakfast ideas. If you start your children off early in the kitchen, they'll learn the basic kitchen and safety skills they need to start making meals.
Toast and Fruit
A couple of bread slices complete with her favourite nut butter and a sliced up banana are a hearty way to start the morning. If your child has nut allergies  or just isn't a fan of nut butters  strawberry jam, or some butter and a little sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar paired with a piece of fruit are a few other easy options.
Cereal
Cold cereal with milk is a snap for your child to prepare. Just make sure to keep the milk in an easy-to-reach spot in the fridge, and practice pouring together to help avoid any major spills.
Hard-Boiled Eggs
Hard-boiled eggs are a simple make-ahead item that keep well in the fridge for up to one week. Your child can grab and peel one himself, and when paired with a piece of fruit or toast, eggs are a great protein-filled way to start the day.
Frozen Waffles
Whole grain frozen waffles are convenient for busy weekday mornings. Your child can simply pop one or two in the toaster, top it with cut up fruit and syrup, and enjoy!
Homemade waffles and pancakes can also be made over the weekend and frozen for a quick weekday warm-up.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on opposition politicians in Sri Lanka to stop intimidating foreign journalists in the aftermath of the New York Times article that accused former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of receiving 7.6 million USD in campaign contributions from the Chinese government.
CPJs Asia Program Coordinator, Steven Butler, expressed concern regarding politicians singling out
Dharisha Bastians and Arthur Wamanan, the New York Times correspondents who assisted with reporting from Sri Lanka.
Butler said that politicians have the right to dispute the findings of a news report, but called the public
accusations leveled against Bastions and Wamanan, a worrisome development in a country noted for attacks on journalists and unsolved journalist murders. Butler asked that all political parties in Sri Lanka publicly affirm support for press freedom and journalists safety.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Correspondents Association (FCA) of Sri Lanka released a statement
condemning Members of Parliament for publicly vilifying the writers of the report. The FCA urged politicians who have issues with the report to follow the norm of expressing their dissent through editors as opposed to intimidating journalists.
The statements come after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa accused the New York Times journalists of being tools of the current government and after a Member of Parliament reportedly showed a photo of one of the journalists at a press conference.

David Richardson to step down after 2019 Cricket World Cup
The International Cricket Council confirmed that David Richardson will step down as ICC Chief Executive when his contract expires post next summers ICC Cricket World Cup.
In 2002, Richardson became the first person to hold the position of ICC General Manager  Cricket, and was promoted as the Chief Executive in 2012.
ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar said: On behalf of the ICC Board, I would like to thank David for his service and commitment to cricket over the past 16 years and, particularly, over the last six years as CEO.
His achievements speak for themselves, but in recent history the commercial success of the sport, his leadership of the ICC team and establishing greater context for international cricket are of particular note.
David will be missed by everyone in the game, but this is an opportunity for the ICC to drive forward our new global growth strategy, which David has played an integral part in developing, under new leadership. A global recruitment process will now get underway to identify the right person to lead the ICC.
Richardson added: The hardest thing as a cricketer is knowing when the time is right to retire. But for me, the end of the ICC Cricket World Cup next year is about right. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the ICC and I am particularly pleased with what we have achieved in recent times in creating greater context for all formats of the game and securing increased opportunities and clear pathways for all Members to play at the highest level.
I will certainly do all I can over the next 12 months to ensure that we complete our work on the new global strategy for cricket aimed at growing the game both in our traditional and new markets, and, in particular put on a World Cup that does the game proud.
Id like to thank the ICC Chairman and the current board of directors and Member Chief Executives for their support and of course to my senior team and all of the ICC staff who are so dedicated to our great sport.

Dhamma education important- President
President Maithripala Sirisena says an appropriate programme should be implemented to prevent the conducting of private tuition classes on Poya days and Sundays.This should be done with the aim of building a better future generation by providing them with a Dhamma education.
The President further said that to achieve this goal what is more important is that everyone fulfills their respective duties with an understanding of creating a disciplined society rather than constitutional efforts.
President Sirisena made these remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat on Tuesday about the steps that should be taken to encourage school children to attend Sunday Dhamma school instead of private tuition classes.
President Sirisena said the Maha Sangha, other religious leaders and intellectuals made representations to him regarding this matter for quite some time.
The President said that eventhough many programmes have been implemented at Provincial Council level regarding conducting private tuition classes on Sundays, there is a need for an island wide common programme in this regard.
President Sirisena said that he would talks with the teachers who conduct tuition classes on Sundays, and expects to make a strong request to them in this regard.
Thereafter, the President stated that he would look into the possibility of imposing statutory rules in relation to making Dhamma education compulsory.
Meanwhile, the President Sirisena who pointed out the importance of implementing different programmes which motivate the children in gaining knowledge on religion, guided the officers about the programmes to be conducted to develop the quality of religious education and improve the facilities provided to Daham Pasal. During this meeting, discussions were held on the programmes to be conducted to motivate Daham Pasal teachers.
President Sirisena said it is religious education that nurtures a person with knowledge and discipline.
The President said it is due to the lack of religious knowledge by the young generation that creates a malefic society filled with violence and negligence of parents and elders.
The Mahasangha, who made their representations said that eventhough this topic was discussed with government officials for more than four or five decades, nobody intervened on this matter. The Mahasangha appreciated the effort and concern of President Sirisena as a leader who wants to build a disciplined society with morals and ethics.
Prof. Ven. Nabiriththankadawala Gnanarathana Thera and other members of the Mahasangha, other religious leaders, Ministers Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, John Amaratunga, D.M.

District wise approach urged to upscale per capita income
Chairman, MD of Vallibel One Dhammika Perera yesterday expressed hope that per capita income of the Colombo city will reach USD 12,650 mark in three years and be on par with several developed countries.
Noting that Colombo city is home to 5% percent of the total population of the country, Perera stressed the need to initiate district wise approaches to increase per capita income of all other districts which account for 95% of the total population in the country.
We have to reach those targets while adopting a district wise approach. Otherwise, people wont be happy, he said after the bell ringing ceremony at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) last morning.

Speaking on future plans of his group of companies, Perera said his companies will take the advantage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and Business Intelligence (BI) tools to enhance real-time, smart decision making at boardroom meetings.
Perera, expressed hope that his companies are starting to benefit from this technology and it will soon make its way into the boardroom plans. Speaking further, Perera said he hoped to hold the first ever boardroom meeting, using the AI technology and BI tools most likely in another six months time and intends to implement the same technology throughout all subsidiary companies in the near future.
Commenting on the estimated budget for this initiative, Perera said that the budget will not be that huge.
Perera said that his group of companies has implemented multiple cost cutting initiatives, particularly to improve the groups financial performance and to face any foreseeable challenges of the Sri Lankan economy in the next five years. Commenting on growth prospects of local tourism industry, Perera said, Sri Lanka needs to focus on attracting not only niche market travelers, also budget travelers to be on par with regional competitors such as Malaysia and Thailand. He said Sri Lanka has 90,000 hotel rooms, including 15,000 star-class rooms and 75,000 non-star budget rooms.

England end penalty pain to beat Colombia in World Cup shootout
MOSCOW, Tuesday - England held their nerve against Colombia to win their first ever penalty shootout in a World Cup and reach the quarter-finals in dramatic fashion on Tuesday.
Eric Dier scored the decisive spot-kick to win the shootout 4-3 and send Gareth Southgates young team through to a meeting with Sweden, who earlier beat Switzerland.
A bad-tempered match at Moscows Spartak Stadium that featured eight yellow cards -- six for Colombian players -- ended 1-1 after 30 tense minutes of extra-time, meaning the game had to be decided by penalties.
The South American side, without injured forward James Rodriguez, appeared on the edge of reaching their second consecutive World Cup quarter-final when Jordan Hendersons effort was saved by Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina, keeping the score at 3-2. But Mateus Uribe then rattled the crossbar and after Kieran Trippier levelled at 3-3, England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved from Carlos Bacca, extending his left arm to stop the ball as he dived to his right.
That gave England match point and Eric Dier made no mistake, beating the despairing dive of Ospina before he was mobbed by his teammates.
It is the first time England have won a shootout at a World Cup -- and comes after six failures in seven attempts at major tournaments before Russia. Southgates team were minutes away from victory during normal time but Yerry Mina rose to head home an equaliser from a corner and cancel out captain Harry Kanes 57th-minute penalty.
The late, late goal deflated England and the momentum shifted visibly towards the South Americans, who started extra-time with a spring in their step.
To get knocked down at the end like we did with that goal in added time, you know, its difficult to come back from that, said Dier.
But we did. We were ready for that. We knew what we had to do, we stayed calm, we stuck to our plan, we never panicked all the way through extra time. We knew that if it has to go to penalties, it has to go to penalties. We were ready for that.
GIVES US BELIEF
England, for so long under-achievers on the international stage, are the only former winners left in the bottom half of the draw and, with Sweden up next, will fancy their chances of reaching the semi-finals for just the third time in their history. Pickford is the first England goalkeeper to save a penalty in a shootout at a major tournament since David Seaman at the 1998 World Cup against Argentina.
Its a great night to win a penalty shootout, he said. Ideally we dont want to be going to a penalty shootout but we are delighted for the fans and the whole country.
It gives us belief to go into the Sweden game.
Kanes penalty in the first half made him the tournaments top scorer with six goals, two clear of Belgiums Romelu Lukaku. With Spain already ejected, England face Sweden in Samara on Saturday, with Russia and Croatia potential semi-final opponents. Brazil and France lurk in the top half of the draw but Lionel Messis Argentina and Cristiano Ronaldos Portugal are out.
Even Prince William got caught up in the emotion, tweeting: I couldnt be prouder of @England - a victory in a penalty shootout! You have well and truly earned your place in the final eight of the #worldcup.  AFP

England World Cup penalty hero Pickford says he did the homework
MOSCOW, Tuesday - Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford said he had done his research on Colombia and that his power and agility helped save Carlos Baccas penalty in a nail-biting shootout victory that saw England reach the World Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday.
The Everton player was criticised after conceding Adnan Januzajs winner in a group-stage 1-0 loss to Belgium, including by his Belgian counterpart Thibaut Courtois, who said he was too small.
But Pickford hit back after his save allowed Eric Dier to slot in the winning spot-kick and give England their first-ever shootout win at a World Cup finals after failures in 1990, 1998 and 2006.
I did a lot of research on them, Ive got power and agility, Pickford told ITV.
I dont care if Im not the biggest keeper because its about being there in the moment and making the save and I was.
Substitute Dier was relieved to see his penalty squirm past David Ospina, after missing a great chance to seal a last-eight spot in extra time.
It was a nervous one, Ive never really been in a situation like that, but I felt like I had to score after the header I missed at the end there, so Im just thankful I scored, said the Tottenham midfielder.  AFP

Fitch upgrades Amna Banks rating
Fitch Ratings Lanka has upgraded Amna Banks rating outlook to Positive from Stable whilst affirming its National Long Term Rating at BB (lka) its latest rating review concluded in June 2018.
According to the communiqu issued by Fitch Ratings The outlook revision on Amna takes into account our expectation that the bank will continue to improve its financial profile on better profitability metrics and enhanced capital position arising from future capital raising.
The Banks profitability has consistently improved since breaking even in August 2014 and topped Rs 500 million in PAT for 2017, whilst recording a bottom line of Rs 162.8 million for Q1 2018. In this positive backdrop, the Bank recently announced an interim dividend of 7 cents per share for the year 2018. Fitch Ratings also commented on the Banks financing margin stating that it is the highest among its peer group as the Bank maintains a high share of low-cost current account saving accounts (46% of deposits), which has been sustained despite rising deposit rates.
Commenting on its capital ratio, Fitch Ratings expects the Banks Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio to moderate to 15%-16% in the medium term, from 21% at end-Q1 2018, owing to balance sheet growth, but to still remain higher than that of most peers.
Banks Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said With a healthier Core Capital ratio, we believe that the Bank is on a strong footing to further expand on our financial success in line with our 5 year Strategic Plan, which we expect to reflect positively on future ratings.
Amna Bank PLC is a stand-alone institution licensed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange with Jeddah based IDB Group being the principal shareholder having a 29.97% stake of the Bank.

Govt to take strict action after inquiries: Minister
The government will take strict action against State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran once inquiries have been concluded, said Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne, yesterday.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Parliament Complex, the minister stressed that both the Prime Minister and President would ensure that action is taken.
No matter the issues, she cannot be excused for making such a statement. If there are problems in her electorate, she can discuss them at the Parliamentary group meetings and not make such statements promoting terrorism, he said.
It is true that there were fewer crimes committed by the ordinary people during the time of the LTTE, but that was because the LTTE made for it by committing horrendous crimes and the people were too afraid to do anything, added the minister.
Minister Senaratne stressed that both statements of asking for a Hitler styled regime as well as asking to bring back the LTTE were equally bad.
The Attorney General is to advise the government on possible legal action which could be taken against the State Minister, said Minister Senaratne.
Co-Cabinet Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, meanwhile said all MPs when entering Parliament have to take an oath to not promote terrorism and in that context, the State Minister had committed a serious crime. He also pointed out that it was the government MP, S.M. Marikar who had brought it up in Parliament and not the opposition. Minister Karunathilake pointed out that the party had distanced itself from the State Ministers comments and did not approve her actions.

Heat-wave death toll in Quebec rises to at least 17

Montreal endured its sixth straight day of furnace-like temperatures as heat-related deaths across Quebec climbed to at least 17 and wilting humidity was expected to deliver weather that feels like the mid-40 C range on Thursday.
Authorities attributed 12 deaths in Montreal to the double blow of intense heat and humidity. The remaining deaths were reported in regions across the province.
All the deaths struck those most vulnerable during heat waves: People with underlying conditions such as mental illness or heart and lung disease. All of the victims were in apartments without air conditioning, and most lived alone.
Heat waves have also swept Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada, and places such as Ottawa, where the humidex was at 39 C, and Toronto have bathed in sweltering heat for days - yet those jurisdictions have had no reported deaths.
Ontarios Office of the Chief Coroner has received no reports of heat-related deaths as of Wednesday, a spokesperson said.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted about the heat waves hitting parts of Canada: My thoughts are with the loved ones of those who have died in Quebec during this heat wave. The record temperatures are expected to continue in central & eastern Canada, so make sure you know how to protect yourself & your family.
One thing that distinguishes Montreal from other jurisdictions is an established system that requires front-line health providers to systematically report health-related deaths. Montreal became, in 2002, one of the first cities in North America to adopt a heat-response plan, and a 2010 heat wave that caused more than 100 deaths led officials to fine-tune their preparedness, said David Kaiser, a specialist with Montreals public-health department.

URUGUAY v FRANCE (FRIDAY 7.30 PM SLT, NIZHNY NOVGOROD)
URUGUAY
One of only two teams to win all four games so far, Uruguay boast one of the meanest defences in Russia marshalled by talismanic captain Diego Godin, and a lethal strikeforce in Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez.
Cavanis fitness is the big concern ahead of Fridays meeting. The Paris Saint-Germain striker limped off with a calf injury after scoring twice to end Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugals World Cup dreams in the last 16.
FRANCE
After cruising through the group stage in underwhelming fashion, France kicked through the gears thanks to Kylian Mbappes blistering pace to blow Argentina away in a 4-3 World Cup classic in the last 16.
A very different task awaits in breaking through Uruguays brick wall of a defence that will not allow Mbappe the same space to exploit. But as legs start to tire in the latter stages, Frances strength in depth could start to make the difference.
BRAZIL v BELGIUM (FRIDAY 11.30 PM SLT, KAZAN)
BRAZIL
Along with Uruguay, Brazil share the best defensive record, having conceded just once in four games so far and are slowly starting to hit their stride at the other end of the field too as Neymar struck his second goal of the tournament in the last 16.
After a disappointing 1-1 draw against Switzerland, 2-0 wins over Costa Rica, Serbia and Mexico have taken Brazil into a seventh straight quarter-final and they remain the favourites to erase the scars of a humiliating 7-1 semi-final thrashing at the hands of Germany four years ago.
BELGIUM
Belgium will be the true test of how good the Brazilian back line is in Kazan on Friday, but coach Roberto Martinez has some big decisions to make after a stunning comeback from 2-0 down in the final 21 minutes avoided a shock exit to Japan in the last 16.
Japan picked the holes in Martinezs attack-minded 3-4-2-1 system and the Red Devils had to rely on their superior physical power in the latter stages with Jan Vertonghen and Marouane Fellaini heading home before Nacer Chadli completing the comeback at the end of a stunning counter-attack.
Martinez must now find the right balance to harness the best from Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku without leaving Belgium exposed.
SWEDEN v ENGLAND (SATURDAY 7.30 PM SLT, SAMARA)
SWEDEN
They are not the prettiest side, but Sweden are extremely effective and happy to play the role of underdog, having seen off the Netherlands and Italy in qualifying and Germany in the group stages.
Their run to the last eight for the first time since 1994 has been built on three clean sheets in four games, but while hard to break down, they lack a potent force up front.
ENGLAND
Freed from the curse of the penalty shootout after they beat Colombia from the spot, England will be favourites to reach a first World Cup semi-final since 1990.
For 92 minutes in Moscow, the Three Lions kept their cool as Colombia lost theirs and played with a patience in possession rarely seen by England sides in recent years.
Yerry Minas stoppage-time header threatened to change all that, but a first World Cup win on penalties in four attempts gives Gareth Southgates men reason to believe this time really will be different.
RUSSIA v CROATIA (SATURDAY 11.30 PM SLT, SOCHI)
RUSSIA
The hosts have delighted their public by surpassing all expectations to make it to the last eight thanks to a stunning penalty shootout elimination of 2010 winners Spain.
Russian players were on their knees in exhaustion after defending for 120 minutes in Moscow with just 26 percent possession and they must now summon another huge physical effort, with Croatia expected to dominate the ball once more.
CROATIA
Arguably the outstanding performers of the group stage, Croatia were made to suffer to make it past Denmark on penalties.
Luck often has not accompanied Croatia in the knockout stages after bright tournament starts, but having bounced back from the blow of Luka Modrics missed penalty four minutes before the end of extra-time in the last 16, the time for a highly talented generation may have come.

Installing a higher seat of visionary education
The episode of Aluth Parlimentuwa broadcast on June 20 on Derana TV included a discussion of the issues facing Sri Lankas university education. Those on the discussion panel included the higher education and cultural affairs ministers, higher education former minister, University Grants Commission former chairman, Sri Jayewardenepura University Vice Chancellor and JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa. The panel brought out various issues facing universities in the country including poor quality, student indiscipline, inadequate infrastructure, ragging and violence, world rankings, and the competition from the international education providers. The discussion was aimed at identifying what is needed to resurrect and reform university education for the benefit of students and broader society taking into account current national and global trends in higher education including internationalisation (It was pointed out that about 20,000 students follow international courses as fee-paying, private students). There was no point scoring based on political affiliations of the discussants which were salutary.
As we know well, the composition and nature of the student population in Sri Lankas universities have changed since independence, in particular with the introduction of teaching in mother languages in the 60s. Higher education has also expanded to provinces with the establishment of regional universities starting with Ruhuna University during the J R Jayewardene government under the guidance of former Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel. Expansion in physical facilities, Mahapola scholarship scheme, course offerings in Swabhasa medium is noteworthy. The opening of opportunities for students from rural, lower socio-economic background and different ethnicities is referred to as massification of higher education. With massification, student activism has increased. Activism has taken a somewhat radical form in the sense of continuous boycott of classes or strikes, protest rallies march on main roads, severe forms of ragging and so on. Students found to be at fault for various offences are meted out punishments by the university authorities and law enforcement agencies. Such acts, in turn, feed into more activism and agitation making the whole process a vicious cycle.
In this context, it is important to investigate whether the university governance and administration/management have changed from their elitist forms to a more democratic and representative form in the decades following independence in order to provide a voice for students In this article, I briefly look at this issue taking a cue from the panel discussion held in Aluth Parlimentuwa. Is there a serious gap between the attitudes of those who govern or manage and those who are governed Do we still maintain elitist structures and processes in universities without democratising them These are legitimate questions that we need to ask as higher education in state-run universities has become a topic of contention among parents, students, academics, politicians and policymakers.
Student voices
One participant in the panel discussion pointed out that students are the most important asset for a university. Without students, learning cannot occur. This is absolutely true. If some students, for whatever the reason, do not want to learn what is offered in the name of a degree course, we have a problem  perhaps many problems in the teaching-learning process and even in the administration/management of university education. In trying to comprehend the complexity of this phenomena, we need to move beyond binary arguments where one side is portrayed as right and the other as wrong. This is because there can be structural and cultural problems underneath what we witness on a day-to-day basis. If students are the most important asset, are their voices heard in the classrooms and important decision-making forums within universities
In this regard, we need to look at the way Universities are governed and whether there are formally allocated spaces for students to express their views, opinions, attitudes, experiences etc. in the principal decision-making bodies In other parts of the world, such spaces exist in universities and they facilitate close communication between those who govern i.e. University Council, Senate, Faculty Boards, and those who are governed e.g., students.
A cursory look at the composition of University Councils (governing bodies) in the country shows that there are no student representatives in such bodies. Instead, the Vice Chancellor, Deputy Vice Chancellor, Deans and members nominated by the University Grants Commission (UGC) occupy the seats in Governing Councils. Often the nominated members by the UGC are either retired Professors of the university or those from the corporate or professional sectors and a few from the industry. If we analyse the age categories of these members, interesting facts can be discerned, i.e. significant age difference between those who govern and those who are governed e.g., students. A significant number of Council members, at least those nominated by the UGC, belong to the previous generation who studied at a time when education was conducted in a quite different way compared to today when the availability of internet and information have made learning a quite different process. While retired members from the academic staff can add value to governance through their accumulated wisdom to some extent, it is far more important to bring in those who are active in the professions, industry, Government, NGO sector, community etc. as they can provide perspectives useful for Council deliberations and problem-solving.
Next, I looked at the composition of University Senates with my desire to find any space allocated to students or their representatives. I couldnt find any. University Senates deliberate, monitor and determine matters to do with the academic side of university management/administration. As students are the learners, how can University Senates deliberate on academic matters without the participation of learners What does such exclusion indicate in the 21st-Century decision making in publicly funded bodies Does it indicate an elitism in the academia where the role of students as learners is not recognised in favour of the professors
If my observation about the lack of student representation in the highest decision-making bodies in universities is applicable to recently established universities in the provinces also, it is an indication of the way that what we inherited from the colonial era is continuing as the norm without basic questions being raised even by those who are in the know(In the Faculty Boards, however, there are one or two student representatives e.g. at Peradeniya University. This needs to be commended).
What does this lack of student representation in the highest decision-making bodies in our universities tell us Does this hold the key to student unrest, violence, indiscipline, feeling of alienation and mass agitation Are our students marginalised by the university administration/management and governance processes contributing to their feelings of alienation
Under the current model, students have to rely on the VC, a particular Dean or professor to make representations on their behalf. Even if some Vice Chancellors are able to interact with student bodies within their universities on an ad hoc basis, there is no guarantee that they will bring the matters of such discussion to the governing council without bias toward management and represent student views impartially where it matters. It is highly unlikely that a Dean will make representations on a matter of contention between the university management and students against the wishes of his/her VC in the University Council. Thus, the lack of formal space for students to express their voices in University Councils and Senates directly appears to be a fundamental structural problem in terms of University management/administration requiring the attention of highest authorities.
Student perspective in discussions
In the Aluth Parlimentuwa episode on University education in Sri Lanka, ample opportunity was given to current and former authority figures dealing with universities to express their opinions supported by statistics, documents etc. However, absent from the discussion was the student voice other than two questions allowed by the moderator to students present in the audience. Actually, the audience was students. Why is it that the panel did not include any students or their representatives Is it because we still treat university students as schoolchildren Would it have been useful to invite a president of a student union or two to the discussion in order to have a balanced discussion Is this symptomatic of the exclusion of students from not only such discussions but also formal decision-making processes in the universities Can we resolve issues in universities purely by punitive measures
The panellists referred to university students as Daruwo(children) showing some kind of dayava (love) or karunava (compassion) and ladikama (favourable attitude or disposition) indicating a willingness of those in authority to listen to them, guide them, educate them, and so on. But what this also implies is that the authorities are treating university students as schoolchildren who need to be nurtured in the way they prefer and desire according to their concept of a student and associated mindset. This is where the problem lies. Authorities need to treat university students as young adults who possess unique opinions based on their own experiences within and outside the university. Often, they can be critical opinions about the way their life is controlled (managed or administered in the terminology of those who are governing) in and outside the universities. They also have a collective voice through their student organisations though some would argue they are politicised to some extent. The problem lies not necessarily in the fact of politicisation per se but in the manifest non-conformity of students during protracted agitations with the rules established by the institution.
Student violence, protests and ragging
When it comes to student indiscipline, violence, ragging and protests, blame is squarely put by the university and political authorities on students who engage in such activities. The tenor of the discussion in Aluth Parlimentuwa also tended to be this way. If a minute section of students is engaging in anti-social activities such as severe forms of ragging or other disruptive acts inside the universities, university administrators need to find out the reasons for such behaviour through systematic micro research in the first place. The Vice Chancellor taking part in the discussion stated that his door is always open for students to come and discuss their issues.
Is this the case in all Universities Do all VCs allow such space Even if discussions are held, what are the outcomes Do such discussions resolve the matters amicably or the agitations by students continue irrespective of such discussions If follow up the action by the authorities do not result in resolving issues to the satisfaction of students, such discussions are worthless. It is important to explore this aspect more deeply against the nature of University management/administration model operating in Sri Lankas universities in order to detect what formal spaces have been made available by authorities for students to express their voices regarding the problems they encounter in the learning and living context inside the universities
In universities in the developed world, university students function as tutors in residential colleges. I am not sure how far this is the case in Sri Lankas residential halls. My understanding is that they have wardens and sub-wardens appointed from the academic staff only. In established universities in the US, Europe and elsewhere promising students are appointed as tutors or teaching assistants in undergraduate and graduate courses. Such opportunities provide students with an avenue to channel their intellectual energies in a more productive manner. How far do such opportunities exist in Sri Lankas universities While we pride ourselves about the fact that our university model, at least the Peradeniya model, followed Oxford-Cambridge structure and process, have our university authorities given any consideration to opening the teaching process to skilled students as teaching assistants so that they gain an entry to the teaching profession
Gurukula mentality in teaching and exams
University teaching process is also open to criticism for its hierarchical, teacher-centred nature rather than student centred teaching. This is not a criticism applicable to all universities and all courses. I am sure in some faculties and programmes the academic staff must be using new pedagogies, modern technology, multiple perspectives and up to date resources.
However, at least in the case of teaching social sciences and humanities, there tends to be a practice of using old gurukula mentality and teaching is heavily exam-oriented leaving students to spend an enormous amount of time in rort learning. Students are also under heavy stress prior to exam periods. While some form of examinations is important, the trend today is for continuous assessment by using multiple assessment methods such as student seminars, group work, projects, and open book exams. How far university teaching encourages through the teaching-learning process-critical reflection of what they learn is also a matter that needs careful attention. Teaching pedagogy needs to be updated to incorporate this element.
However, such change requires extra commitments by the academic staff.
Important aspects of a university are the availability of qualified and inspiring teachers, course content and pedagogy suitable for the 21st Century, administrators such as Vice Chancellors, Deans, Heads of Department who can provide a congenial environment for learning including infrastructure (e.g. hostels), library facilities, communication in a language that can be understood by students (without jargon), customer friendly internal bureaucracy, internet and lab facilities.
The product of teaching and learning which is, in this case, the degree should also have contemporary relevance in the national and international contexts (To ensure this, universities in developed countries utilise a set of graduate attributes for each degree. Aims of courses, assessment methods and expected outcomes from teaching tally with these graduate attributes).
Funding for Individual Research vs. Team Research
What about the research enterprise in universities Do students get an opportunity to function as research assistants while studying Does the current funding method of university research encourage the team to research, for example through the establishment of research networks or centres of excellence- so that the students get more opportunities for working as assistants or is the funding individually based My understanding is that a research allowance is provided to each academic staff member along with the salary rather than providing competitive research grants to teams of researchers on a competitive basis. There is no harm in introducing some competition in this sphere with the aim of generating innovation and more opportunities for postgraduate students to work as paid research assistants or associates. In countries such as Australia, Canada, and the US when senior academics apply for team-based research grants, they can include several post-doctoral positions. Competitive research grants are assessed annually by panels drawn from academia and industry operating within a National Research Council. This way, the government can be assured that the important research funds are spent on worthy projects with national relevance and a potential for innovation.
The point here is that if high performing students are absorbed into various formal roles in the teaching and research processes within universities, it can reduce the feelings of alienation generated by their generalised exclusion from the formal structures.
Significant innovations in research cannot be generated under the existing method of granting a research allowance to academic staff individually with no adequate monitoring mechanism in place. It is a highly inefficient method unless their research output is measured objectively annually. Instead, a method of funding team research in identified areas of national priority has to be devised.
University education has to be a transformative, empowering process for the students. Academics and students should collectively construct knowledge both from the books, journals and experiential knowledge. Students (and their parents) should have confidence in the value of the product they acquire at the end of a university education if they are to place trust in the education process, who administers it, and the very process of learning as it is presented today with enormous public expenditure. Instead, what we witness is the lack of trust and lack of perceived value in the process as well as the product i.e. degree, as far as some disciplines are concerned.

'Jumanji 3 ' IS ON THE WAY
The shooting for the sequel to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is expected to begin early next year, director Jake Kasdan said.
The filmmaker, who also helmed the last project in the franchise, said the entertainment company will be creating a third installment of the popular movie format which they hope to begin filming in 2019.
The idea is to make the movie in the beginning of the year if we can get it all worked out. Part of the challenge of figuring out how (the emotional centre of the film) continues is to keep that alive in ways that feel earned. Like a true kind of continuation in this story, Kasdan told in a report. It featured Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas and SerDarius Blain, released last Christmas.
The original 1995 film was directed by Joe Johnston and starred the late Robin Williams as Alan Parrish, a man who had been trapped inside the titular board game for decades and is freed by two siblings when they decide to take on the magical jungle-themed game for themselves.Besides Kasdan, Welcome to the Jungle screenwriters Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner are also on board to pen the screenplay for the third movie.The film is eyeing a winter release next year.

KumbukRiver opens tribal village  for backpackers
Sri Lankas internationally most-acclaimed resort KumbukRiver has added an expansion to welcome backpackers, too.
The new backpackers lodge adjacent to the Koh-pi Ka-deh or the Jungle Coffee Shop is a response to numerous demands to make KumbukRivers uniquely authentic experience available to more people, especially, backpackers who throng the near-by tourist town of Ella and Yala National park.
The centerpiece of the little village is KumbukRivers own Jungle Coffee Shop inspired by the tea kiosk where villagers converge, almost as a ritual, for tea and camaraderie. KumbukRiver, famous around the world as one of the worlds most unusual hotels and best eco resorts, sees travelers from all corners who now enters the new tribal village first before being ushered to their own unique accommodation.
KumbukRiver attracts visitors from other countries thanks to the media coverage it gets.
But that didnt allow the globe-trotting backpackers a chance to experience one of the worlds most unique hideouts and we finally responded by creating not just two tribal-styled lodges but a Koh-pi Ka-deh and a Kolam Maduwa (village performance circle) to go with it, said KumbukRivers Creator, Dinesh Watawana.
A conservation catalyst KumbukRiver offers a host of unique experiences which allows a rare glimpse into rural life, forgotten archaeological splendours and breathtaking wildlife in a locality on the northern-edge of Yala National Park.
KumbukRiver shot to fame with its huge Elephant-shaped villa and received the only Travel Oscar for Sri Lanka at the World Travel Awards in a worlds best category being named as the worlds leading eco-lodge in 2008. KumbukRiver is also among the worlds top 10 most unusual hotels and Asias most amazing hotels.

Lakmini, First Lankan Entrepreneur Panelist at Ernst and Young Conference
Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of IronOne Technologies and BoardPAC, Lakmini Wijesundera brought prestige to the nation as the first local entrepreneur to be a panelist at the EY Entrepreneurial Winning Women (EWW) 2018 event held in Tokyo recently.
The EY Entrepreneurial Winning Women Asian-Pacific programme is an exciting leadership platform for selected dynamic female entrepreneurs who are founders of the regions leading high-growth companies helping them to sustain and accelerate their potential.
In recognition of her status as a leading regional woman entrepreneur, and contributing architect in tech disruption, Lakmini had also created history previously as the first Sri Lankan to attend the Ernst Young Top Women Entrepreneur 2017 Programme and Conference.
This year Lakmini attended the EY EWW 2018 conference as a panelist and once again earned the mantle of being the first local entrepreneur to represent the nation at such a panel.
Participating in a vibrant session titled Business Transformation through the Power of Digital, three outstanding business leaders including Lakmini share their insights on creating a digital strategy today to be effective tomorrow.
Participating at the panel were Sakie Akiyama, CEO and founder of Saki Corporation, Phyllis W. Newhouse Founder CEO of Xtreme Solutions, Inc., and Annette Kimmitt, Asia-Pacific Program Executive, Global Growth Markets Leader, EY who served as the moderator.
Contributing her view point, Lakmini spoke on how organizations embrace digital transformation and its success in relation to human adoption. Lakmini pointed out that the success of any digital transformation comes down to human adoption, human interface and how humans interact with technology, while senior executives need to be educated on the importance of embracing technology paying attention to the requirements of stakeholders.
As the first Sri Lankan entrepreneur to participate in this prestigious event and showcase Sri Lanka has been a true honour. I firmly believe this will open doors for many other local women entrepreneurs to become a driving force in national development, Lakmini said.
As a pioneering digital entrepreneur having built unique and high impact businesses, Lakmini successfully drives both BoardPAC and IronOne Technologies. To-date, these companies operate across 20 countries across the globe.
BoardPAC is a globally commended multinational providing board meeting automation solutions to over 20,000 users across the globe. The company is recognised as the preferred choice for Board meeting automation among a multitude of fortune 500 companies.
Lakminis other accolades include winning the national award for Woman Entrepreneur of the Year, and recognition for her contribution to exports in Sri Lanka.

Lankan migrant worker gets lifetime trip to watch 2018 World Cup football
A Sri Lankan migrant worker helping to build the 2022 World Cup had the trip of a lifetime when he was taken to the opening match of the current tournament in Russia.
Najeem Inamul Hasan, 27, was among eight workers invited to accompany the former Barcelona star, Xavi Hernandez, on a five-day visit to Moscow.
Xavi is global ambassador for the tournament Qatar will host in four years time and head of the Generation Amazing programme, tasked with helping build football at grassroots level as part of its World Cup legacy.
During the trip the group attended the opening ceremony and first match of the tournament at Moscows Luzhniki Stadium which saw the hosts beat Saudi Arabia 5-0.
Najeem, from Mutur in Eastern Sri Lanka: The most exciting part of the trip was watching the opening match of the World Cup, which was a tremendous experience and an incredible atmosphere in the stadium. The hospitality of the Russian people was wonderful.
Among the party were also workers from Ghana, India, and Bangladesh, who were all hand-picked because of their work as Generation Amazing coaches who could go back to Doha and inspire others. Xavi, who won the World Cup with Spain in 2010, met up with Russian youth footballers.
He said: We have workers here from Qatar, but the programme also helps people in their home countries. As the word says, I think this programme is spectacular, so I am proud to have shared this experience with this group.
To be at the World Cup is a once in a lifetime experience, and I too am learning a lot every day from all those taking part in the fantastic project.
As a young boy Najeems life was thrown into turmoil when his home was caught up in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami and the family moved to Pottuvil. By the time he was 18 he had lived in four different places and been in five different schools.
He started played in a local football team, Liverpool FC, named after the legendary English side, and was able to do this regularly when he moved to Qatar in 2016 and joined Generation Amazing while working on the construction of World Cup stadiums.
All the workers love to play football in their free time, and Generation Amazing has been a wonderful tool for them to change their lives, he said. It was a fabulous experience in Russia. I learned a lot more about Generation Amazing and leadership with Xavi Hernandez, and we did a wonderful session with Russian youth from the Best Buddies organisation.
Programmes like Generation Amazing are making a difference to people and the World Cup in Qatar will bring cultures together like no other tournament. In future I would like to use my experience in Russia to create more leaders and ambassadors in Qatar and my community, and I already have a plan to start Generation Amazing in my home country soon.
We also had a chance to meet the English legend Stan Collymore, it was a great day and everyone enjoyed it.
Generation Amazing, which was set up by Qatars Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, hopes to benefit a million people around the world by 2022 by promoting football at grassroots level, often in poorest communities.
Qatar will also be taking sixteen youth ambassadors from Qatar, India, The Philippines, Nepal and Pakistan to the Russian tournament.

Mangala decries personal attacks on journalists
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera while condemning the virulent personal attacks against two Sri Lankan journalists who contributed to the New York Times report on massive financial misappropriation linked to the former regime in Sri Lanka, yesterday stressed that these allegations must be immediately investigated by the relevant authorities.
Releasing a statement, Minister Samaraweera said he was alarmed by recent attacks because the government came into power with the promise of media freedom and to break away from the violent tendencies of the previous government.
The dark years of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Presidency witnessed the highest number of journalists killed, disappeared, attacked and threatened and media houses attacked. We will not return to those dark years where individuals were targeted for divulging the truth and reporting facts
The full statement:I was alarmed by recent attacks on two Sri Lankan journalists who contributed to the New York Times report on massive financial misappropriation linked to the former regime in Sri Lanka.
These allegations must be immediately investigated by the relevant authorities and action taken against the perpetrators without fear or favour. But, I am also disturbed with the virulent personal attacks by individuals linked to the JO and the SLPP in a bid to intimidate journalists who worked on the NYT report, attacking them for doing their job in reporting
hugely questionable transactions amounting to billions of rupees that occurred under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
As Media Minister, I vehemently condemn such practices where journalists are attacked for doing their job. There must be an immediate halt to these practices. Further, the SLPP leadership must take full responsibility for these attacks and ensure that there is no repetition of this behaviour.
This government came into power with the promise of media freedom and to break away from the violent tendencies of the previous government. The dark years of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Presidency witnessed the highest number of journalists killed, disappeared, attacked and threatened and media houses attacked. We will not return to those dark years where individuals were targeted for unveiling the truth and reporting facts.
We now have a government that respects fundamental freedoms and civil liberties and upholds media freedom. This government reiterates its commitment to ensure that all journalists are safe to do their work, even when that means brooking scathing criticism against this administration by the media. Those who threaten our rights and freedoms must be condemned and held accountable for their actions.

Message in a bottle
Its amazing how one great writer can lead you to another great writer. I first met Neil Gaiman on the back cover of E. Nesbits Five Children and It. The publisher of Nesbits book had quoted Gaiman saying he loves her books and that she is one of the many women writers who had inspired him. Curious to know more about this other writer who thinks as highly of Nesbit as I do, I went in search of him and found out he is not just any writer but a writer after my own heart.
The most appealing thing about him, other than his enchanting books is his revelation that plays a central role in my career as a writer too. For, the universe has kicked me just as often as it seems to have kicked Gaiman. He confesses whenever he writes for money the book never becomes a success. My first book, he says a piece of journalism I had done for the money, and which had already bought me an electric typewriter from the advance  should have been a bestseller. It should have paid me a lot of money. If the publisher hadnt gone into involuntary liquidation between the first print run selling out and the second printing, and before any royalties could be paid. I shrugged...I still had my electric typewriter and enough money to pay the rent for a couple of months, and I decided that I would do my best in future not to write books just for the money. If you didnt get the money, then you didnt have anything. If I did work I was proud of, and I didnt get the money, at least Id have the work.
Every now and again, I forget that rule, and whenever I do, the universe kicks me hard and reminds me. Its true that nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience. Usually, I didnt wind up getting the money, either. The things I did because I was excited, and wanted to see them exist in reality have never let me down, and Ive never regretted the time I spent on any of them.
What he has to say about being a freelancer too resonates with this freelancer you are reading right now. Gaiman acknowledges that People keep working, in a freelance world, and more and more of todays world is freelance, because their work is good, and because they are easy to get along with, and because they deliver the work on time. (smile, smile, smile).
But there are hitches too. As Gaiman points out, A freelance life, a life in the arts, is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love. And you have to accept that you may put out a hundred things for every bottle that winds up coming back. (This so succinctly sums up the lives of all of us who work from home and have no idea when or how we will get our next assignment or what it will be about or whether we will be paid once the work is done.)
Gaiman, who turns fifty-eight this November, (he was born in Portchester, in Hampshire County and as a child,was bookish and broody) according to the New Yorker, has a pale face and a wild, corkscrewed mop of black-and-gray hair, and is always seen dressed in black: black socks, black jeans, black T-shirts, black boots, and black jackets whose pockets are loaded with small black notebooks and pots of fountain-pen ink in shades like raven. Having first started to write as a journalist today he is an unusually prolific writer of fantasy, fairy tales, science fiction, novels, comics, picture books, short stories, poems, and screenplays. Now and then, he also writes a song.
Critics say Gaimans books are genre pieces that refuse to remain true to their genres. Gaiman himself defines his readership as bipeds. According to the comic-book writer Alan Moore, His best effects come out of people or characters or situations in the real world being starkly juxtaposed with this misty fantasy world.
The model for Gaimans masterpieces is G. K. Chesterton; his work, Gaiman says, left me with an idea of London as this wonderful, mythical, magical place, which became the way I saw the world. Chestertons career also serves as a warning. He would have been a better writer if hed written less, Gaiman says. Theres always that fear of writing too much if you are a reasonably facile writer and I am a reasonably facile writer.
As Dana Goodyear writes in the New Yorker, In Gaiman, the horror is domesticated and made hygienic for contemporary tastes. This is clearly visible in Coraline where an inquisitive girl with distracted parents, tests a bricked-up door in her house and finds that it opens onto a passageway. As with Alices rabbit hole at the other end is an alternate world: in this case, a house that is an idealized replica of Coralines own presided over by the other mother, who, Gaiman writes, resembles her real one Only her skin was as white as paper. Only she was taller and thinner. Only her fingers were too long, and they never stopped moving, and her dark red fingernails were curved and sharp. In place of eyes, she has two black buttons...The story, thankfully, ends comfortingly: the heroine outsmarts the other mother and escapes; back at home, the last night of summer vacation, Coraline drifts into a peaceful sleep, realizing there was nothing left about school that could scare her anymore.
Even with this happy ending, when Gaiman showed an early draft to an editor in 1991, he was told it was unpublishable: far too frightening for kids. (Gaiman maintains that adults are more afraid of Coraline than children are.) The novel finally came out in 2002 and was an instant success.
Two other novels, Anansi Boys (2005) and The Graveyard Book (2008)a retelling of Rudyard Kiplings The Jungle Book, set in a graveyarddbuted at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list
in their respective categories, adult and childrens literature. Gaimans bestselling contemporary fantasy novel, American Gods, took the Hugo, Nebula, Bram Stoker, and Locus awards while The Graveyard Book, remains the only work to win both the Newbery (US) and Carnegie (UK) Medals awarded by librarians for the most prestigious contribution to childrens literature.
Yet Gaiman remains a marginal writer. The New York Times waited to review The Graveyard Book for several months after its publication, by which time it had won the 2009 Newbery Medal, one of the highest honors in childrens fiction, and been on the best-seller list for eighteen weeks. The Times of London referred to him as the most famous writer youve never heard of.
Gaiman, however, is perfectly happy about living in the shadows. Looking back he feels he has had a remarkable ride - especially now as he reaches sixty and spends his days in a rural outpost in Wisconsin in a house that dates back to the eighteen-eighties. Inside, the house is divided into Dog and Cat, the latter the domain of five cats, including a blind one that lives in the attic. Dog belongs to an eighty-pound white German shepherd that Gaiman picked up on the side of the road and named Cabal, after King Arthurs hound.
Ever ready to help creative youngsters, in the keynote address he made at the University of the Arts a few years ago Gaiman said, The urge, starting out, is to copy. And thats not a bad thing. Most of us only find our own voices after weve sounded like a lot of other people. But the one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can. The moment that you feel that, just possibly, youre walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself... Thats the moment you may be starting to get it right.

Mihin plane had to be pushed onto tarmac  Witness
The bizarre occurrence of Mihin Lanka employees pushing a Mihin Lanka plane from the Airport Terminal to the runway was disclosed yesterday.
Former Mihin Lanka Ground Handling Manager Ingrid Kathline Guruge made this disclosure at the Presidential Commission investigating into alleged fraud corruption and misuse of public assets in SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
This happened because SriLankan Airlines had withheld the release of ground handling equipment to Mihin Lanka due to overdue payments.
Cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe, Guruge said a group of employees attached to Mihin Lanka Engineering Division had to physically push the plane on to the runway due to unavailability of ground handling equipment.
Although other flights were cancelled due to non availability of ground handling equipment, this plane could not be cancelled as it was a pre-booked flight.
She said Sajin Vaas Gunawardena functioned as Chief Executive Officer of Mihin Lanka during this period. She said eventhough a set of computer operated ground handling equipment made in Germany were imported for Mihin Lanka, they were operated by SriLankan Airlines employees and not Mihin Lanka employees.

Mobitel partners THURUs digital  reforestation innovation startup
Glimpsing joint synergies and strong potential for collaboration, Mobitel is poised to work together with THURU, one of the 10 finalists of the Season 2 of Kotiyak Vatina Adahasak, Sri Lankas first-ever innovation and entrepreneurship based tech reality TV show powered by Mobitel.
Mobitel conceptualized this programme, which was produced and aired on Sirasa TV. Mobitel and Thuru will work in collaboration with each other to take THURU to the next level through co-creation and co-innovation. THURU is a digital inclusion reforestation drive initiated from Sri Lanka with a mission to plant 2 million trees by end 2020. As the technology partner for THURU, Mobitel will provide technical consultation to the THURU team, mainly in the domains of NBIoT (Narrow Band Internet-of-Things), Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence to make the system futuristic and intelligent.
Through this collaboration, Mobitel plans to conduct a reforestation drive targeting the entire country and will reveal the details in the near future.
THURU holds the potential to be introduced as a gamified platform for planting trees, where the process is driven through a mobile app, which is called facebook for trees. People can plant trees and upload images, details and the app will automatically generate points, and the person can climb up in the leaderboard as a true nature hero.
The app will automatically count the oxygen output based on the type of plant and number of months/years of the tree. The longer the person takes care of the tree and uploads images, the more points he gets. It will be a guide to tree planting and will help users link up with like-minded nature lovers and tree huggers across the globe. THURU also carries out a reforestation/planting project around the country.
Mobitel, under its credo, We Care. Always, is focused on environmental and social responsibility initiatives and this collaboration provides an ideal balance of both technology and greening.
Mobitel is continuously supporting and encouraging tech entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, through many initiatives, to offer encouragement for innovators.

Alleged default of Rs. 142 mn owed to SLTB:
MR, four others granted further time for answers
The Colombo Commercial High Court yesterday granted further time on five defendants, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, to file their answers regarding a lawsuit filed in connection with the alleged default of Rs. 142 million owed to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) by utilising SLTB buses to transport people to election rallies of the former President during the 2015 Presidential Election campaign.
Accordingly, Colombo Commercial High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe granted further time until October 10 on the defendants.
The Commercial High Court had decided to accept the amended petition filed by the plaintiff party, the SLTB, regarding the incident.
On a previous occasion, the SLTB had decided to exclude former Minister Susil Premajayantha and former Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa from the defendant list.
According to the amended plaint, the SLTB had named five United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Presidential Election Committee members (2015), including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) election committee members Gamini Senarath and Amal Senadhilankara as respondents.
The SLTB had earlier named seven parties, including SLFP former General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha as defendants.
The plaintiff said the UPFA had hired buses from the SLTB for the January 8, 2015 Presidential Election rallies, but had failed to settle the payments after obtaining the services.
Counsel Athula de Silva appeared on behalf of the defendants.

Multi Finance PLC will launch Phase II of their national level reforestation campaign Each One Plant One (EOPO) on 6th July 2018 at the chosen 7-acre land area at Ilukpathakanda.
Affected by continuous and heavy deforestation, pinus tree plantation as well as various other human activities, Ilukpathakanda is a land area classified as degraded, located adjoining the Sinharaja World Heritage Rain Forest in the Ratnapura District, under the Kalawana Divisional Secretariat. In 2003, the site experienced the largest landslide ever to occur in the district, and has since been declared a landslide prone area.
With a pledge to plant 10 trees for every single transaction, Multi Finance PLC (MFPLC) launched their mega eco-sustainability campaign EOPO in March 2018 by planting 1000 saplings along the Southern Expressway from Kottawa towards Matara. Phase II of the project at Ilukpathakanda will be launched by MFPLC in collaboration with the Rainforest Protectors of Sri Lanka, a year-long initiative that will be complemented by awareness programs on the importance of ecosystem rehabilitation for communities in the area.
The main objective of the project is to enhance the stability of the mountain slopes by restoring the affected area back to its natural habitat.
Ilukpathakanda is also located in close vicinity to the proposed Hapugoda Forest Reserve, and this reforestation aims at creating a new biolink between the two areas to further strengthen and stabilize the biodiversity of the region.
We are eager to launch the Ilukpathakanda project in July, since the area was already affected by heavy rains during the recent few weeks, stated Multi Finance PLC Executive Director/CEO - Pushpike Jayasundera.

Najib charged with corruption
MALAYSIA: Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was charged with corruption on Wednesday for allegedly accepting millions of dollars in bribe money, in a stunning fall from grace just months after his shock election defeat.
Najib, the first ex-premier in Malaysia to appear in front of a judge, is accused of pocketing 42 million ringgit ($10.4 million), and three counts of criminal breach of trust.
Each charge -- all of which he denied -- could see him jailed for up to 20 years.
The unprecedented court appearance came the day after the 64-year-old was arrested at his luxury home by officers probing how billions of dollars of state funds disappeared on his watch.
Allegations of massive corruption were a major factor behind the shock election loss in May of Najibs long-ruling coalition to a reformist alliance headed by his 92-year-old former mentor Mahathir Mohamad.
Wednesdays court hearing was the latest step in a quick-moving investigation into alleged wrongdoing by Najib, his family and many of his close political and business allies.
Najib is the first (former) prime minister ever to be charged in court in the history of Malaysia, said Tian Chua, vice president of Parti Keadilan Rakyat, a key political party in the current ruling coalition.
It signals a new era where no one in public office will be immune from punitive action if they abuse power, he added.
Attorney General Tommy Thomas, who leads a 12-member prosecution team, asked the court to set bail at four million ringgit in cash and asked the court to remove Najibs passport.
Najibs lawyer Muhammad Shafee insisted his client was not a flight risk.
The judge was expected to rule later.
According to an investigation by the Wall Street Journal, $10.6 million originating from SRC International Sdn Bhd, an energy company that was originally a subsidiary of 1MDB, was transferred to Najibs personal bank accounts, a fraction of hundreds of millions of dollars from 1MDB that was allegedly funnelled to him.
Najib and the fund deny any wrongdoing. Since the election loss Najib has been banned from leaving the country. We pray Datuk Seri Najib gets a fair trial. It is a test from Allah, the former leaders daughter-in-law Nur Sharmila Shaheen told AFP, using an honorific title, adding her father-in-law was calm.
A press statement issued by Najibs camp late Tuesday said the impending charges and other investigations are politically motivated and the result of political vengeance under Mahathir.
It vowed that Najib will contest these charges and clear his name in court.
Najib and his allies are accused of plundering billions of dollars from the 1MDB to buy everything from US real estate to artworks.
Shortly after his downfall, a treasure trove of valuables was seized in raids on properties linked to Najib and his family -- including cash, jewellery and luxury handbags -- worth up to $273 million. He and his luxury-loving wife Rosmah Mansor were questioned by investigators, as were his stepson Riza Aziz, whose firm produced the hit 2013 movie The Wolf of Wall Street, and his former deputy Zahid Hamidi. - AFP

No rift between Rajapaksa brothers, says MR
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday while refuting media reports that there is a rift between his brothers, yesterday said that they are on the same page with the aim of defeating this government.

Rajapaksa urged the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) to get ready to play the second innings which he says will be the winning innings. We are preparing for the second innings, he said. Several SLFP Provincial Council members obtained SLPP membership yesterdays ceremony.
Rajapaksa expressed pleasure for inviting Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his acceptance of the invitation. if not the Government will say that the brothers are fighting. Then they will say that Nelum Mawatha and Viyath Maga are poles apart.
He also expressed that the campaign to sling mud at him has begun and that even foreign countries are now being used to tarnish his reputation.
They are targeting me for everything, MP Rajapaksa said, adding that a Parliamentarian had even claimed that he was behind State Minister Vijayakala Maheswarans statement.
Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, speaking to reporters after the event Said that Viyath Maga should be considered a place to pool our resources for any Government that comes to power in the future.
He said that what they are doing at Viyath Maga is gathering scholars and members of the academia to help a future government.

NO sweat
Summer is here with its scorching heat. This causes excessive sweating which leads to the nightmarish issue of body odour. While excessive sweating causes embarrassment, it also adds to the challenge of self-hygiene. So if you are someone who is struggling with this problem, here are some expert tips that might help you keep it at bay.
Deodorant and antiperspirant facts
* Deodorant controls odour but isnt very effective at controlling sweat.
* Antiperspirant blocks sweat glands, reducing the amount of perspiration your body produces.
*Using a combination of deodorant and antiperspirant gives you the best solutions of both worlds.
* Neither deodorant nor antiperspirant cause cancer.
* Deodorant and antiperspirant together contribute more to sweat stains than sweat.
* Deodorant works by killing the bacteria on your skin. This way when you sweat, there isnt enough bacteria sitting on your skin to create an odour. Your armpit area has thousands of hairs, these hairs hold on to bacteria and sweat, which is why when it comes to body odour, these are the most problematic areas of your body.
* Antiperspirants use aluminum salts to dissolve the moisture on the surface of your skin. As it dissolves, it forms a gel that temporarily sits on tops of your sweat glands to help prevent additional sweating. This reduces that amount of sweat your body produces.

The odour of sweat
Sweat itself is virtually odourless to humans. It is the rapid multiplication of bacteria in the presence of sweat and their breaking down of sweat into acids that eventually causes the unpleasant smell.
Causes of body odour
Body odour is caused by bacteria breaking down sweat and is largely linked to the apocrine glands. Most body odour comes from these. These glands are found in the breasts, genital area, eyelids, armpits, and ear. In the breasts, they secrete fat droplets into breast milk. In the ear, they help form earwax. Apocrine glands in the skin and the eyelids are sweat glands.
Most of the apocrine glands in the skin are located in the groin, armpits, and around the nipples. They are mainly responsible for body odour because the sweat they produce is high in protein, which bacteria can break down easily.
Reducing body odour
A large concentration of apocrine glands is present in the armpits, making that area susceptible to the rapid development of body odour.
The following steps may help control armpit odour:
1) Keep the armpits clean: Wash them regularly using anti-bacterial soap, and the number of bacteria will be kept low, resulting in less body odour.
2) Hair: When armpits have hair, it slows down the evaporation of sweat, giving the bacteria more time to break it down into smelly substances. Shaving the armpits regularly has been found to help body odour control in that area. Reusable razors are available to purchase online.
3) Deodorant or antiperspirant: Deodorants make the skin more acidic, making it more difficult for bacteria to thrive. An antiperspirant blocks the sweating action of the glands, resulting in less sweating.
Food that increases body odour
Avoid spicy food: Curry, garlic, and other spicy foods have the potential to make some peoples sweat more pungent. Some experts believe a diet high in red meat may also raise the risk of developing more rapid body odour.
Alcohol: (and its smell) is absorbed and metabolized into acetic acid and then released through your pores. You can thank that acetic acid for the stench. And the smell only increases with the more you gulp down, so exercise some will power and pair your brew(s) with a healthy, high-protein meal.
Cruciferous vegetables: Though high in potassium and packed with antioxidants, vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower contain sulfur, which is a chemical that naturally has a bad stench, and will intensify your odor when released through sweating, breathing.
Inhibiting perspiration by using products
The thermoregulation of the body is not affected by the use of antiperspirants. The underarm areas add up to 200 cm2, which is only about 1 percent of the whole body surface. Therefore this area is much too small to interfere with thermoregulation. The safety of antiperspirants has been proven in many surveys and their use in cosmetic products is approved.
Armpit stains
Armpit stains on shirts are caused by the reaction between antiperspirant ingredients and the salts in your sweat. Most antiperspirants contain aluminum compounds to reduce wetness. It is the aluminum that causes the build-up and yellowing on fabrics. The stains dont appear overnight, but if you do not wash the shirts properly, the stains will start to leave a yellow stain on white shirts.
Underarm deodorant stains are very evident on white shirts because the fabric turns yellow. While they may not be as apparent on dark coloured shirts, they are there. The underarm stains from deodorant and body soil trap bacteria, cause odour, stiffness, and discoloration of the fabric.
Removing armpit stains
To remove the build-up and freshen a washable shirt, fill a washing machine or large bucket with cool water and add one cup white distilled vinegar. Allow shirts to soak for at least 30 minutes. Drain vinegar water and wash as usual in cool water. If the build-up is really heavy, mix a one to one solution of white distilled vinegar and water and use an old toothbrush to scrub the area before soaking.

NOT EXACTLY LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
They feature among the legendary screen couples of Bollywood, who weaved a love spell on cine buffs with their chemistry in film after film. And it all began with the cult film like Baazigar.
In a video that celebrates Shah Rukh Khans 26 years in Bollywood, he makes a mention of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge as the film that transformed him into a romantic hero. Its a film that is incomplete without the mention of his heroine, Kajol. However, unlike their onscreen persona, it was not exactly love at first sight for the lead pair of many blockbusters.
According to an article in a leading newspaper, SRK recalled, When I was working with her in Baazigar, Aamir (Khan) asked me about her as he wanted to work with her. I left him a message saying, She is very bad, no focus, you will not be able to work with her. And then I saw the rushes in the evening. I kept calling Aamir to clarify. I told him, I dont know what it is, but she is magical on the screen.
Kajol, too, didnt think highly of her co-star.
I remember Shah Rukh and other actors had a huge hangover when they came on the sets and I was jabbering away in Marathi to his make-up guy. They were like what is that voice. It is going to split open our heads. He was very grumpy but I kept chatting and finally he said, Will you please shut up chup ho jao. I think thats how we became friends, she added.
Their friendship has survived many hits, flops and misunderstanding. Its often been reported that theres a tension between SRK and Kajols husband, Ajay Devgn, which worsened when their films, Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Son of Sardaar clashed at the box office. They reportedly sorted that when they met on set of Devgns Shivaay in Bulgaria.
Kajol, in an interview in the past, has said that the two are not friends, but they are not enemies either.
Shah Rukh is my friend and I have been very clear that my friends are mine and I have never imposed my friendships on Ajay and he has never done it either. We are both very clear about it. You need to give people that space, she is quoted to have said. TNN

Pakistan knocks hosts Zimbabwe out of T20I series
HARARE, Zimbabwe, Wednesday: Pakistan knocked Zimbabwe out of the Twenty20 tri-series in Harare in a closely-fought encounter on Wednesday, beating the hosts by seven wickets with five deliveries to spare.
Opener Fakhar Zaman top-scored for Pakistan with 47 before captain Sarfraz Ahmed overcame a spirited Zimbabwean fightback and saw his side home with an unbeaten 38.
Their efforts meant that Zimbabwean allrounder Solomon Mires bellicose earlier innings earlier went in vain.
Mire struck 94, the highest score by a Zimbabwean in Twenty20 internationals, but Zimbabwes 162 for 4 was not enough to overcome the worlds top-ranked T20 side.
Zaman said Pakistan was always confident they could pull off a successful chase.
We have a very deep batting line-up, so we were confident we could chase it, he said.
Pakistan given a rapid start by Zaman and fellow opener Haris Sohail, who took 56 from the Powerplay.
Sohail holed out soon afterwards, but Zaman continued to show the sort of touch that made him vital to Pakistans successful Champions Trophy run last year.
Mixing aggression with an ability to manoeuvre the ball around the field, he cracked four fours and a six.
The tactic spoke volumes about his development as a limited overs batsman.
In the start in T20 I was hitting every ball in my striking zone, but after playing eight to 10 games I sat with some senior players like Shoaib Malik and Sarfraz Ahmed, and spoke about my gameplans with them, Zaman explained.
I realised that I could play proper cricket shots and be successful (in T20), and thats what Ive been doing recently.
He may have learnt even more from Ahmeds innings of calm precision that kept Pakistan up with an asking rate that hovered around eight for much of the match.
Executing his attacking strokes perfectly, Ahmed found the gaps and the boundaries whenever they were needed.
He displayed a particularly deft touch with his late cut, taking boundaries off left-arm spinners Tendai Chisoro and Wellington Masakadza with the stroke.
With four runs needed from the final over, it was also the shot he used to end the game, gliding seamer Chris Mpofu to the third man boundary.
Where Ahmeds innings was one of finesse, Mires 63-ball 94 for Zimbabwe showcased big-hitting ability.
Mire started slowly, but hit his first six into the stands beyond long leg to move into the 20s and was soon smashing Pakistans attack to all corners of the ground.
Mires fourth six took him to a 32-ball half century, his first in this format, and he wasnt done there.
He collected a fifth six with a huge strike down the ground off Mohammad Nawaz left-arm spin, and then lifted fast bowler Mohammad Amir for the biggest hit of the day, over the roof of the three storey stand beyond midwicket.
He eventually fell for 94 attempting another big hit, but his 64-run third wicket stand with Tarisai Musakanda boosted Zimbabwe to a respectable total after two poor outings in this tournament.
We were expecting 130 to 140 on this pitch, but Mire played a very good innings, said Zaman.
It was not enough to beat Pakistan, however, who are now assured a place in Sundays final against Australia. - AFP

Speaker tells Ranaweera: Stopcreating trouble in Parliament
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya repremanded Joint Opposition (JO) MP Prasanna Ranaweera in Parliament yesterday (04), warning him to avoid creating another scene in Parliament as he did on Tuesday, with regard to the controversial statement of State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran in relation to the LTTEs return, which disrupted Parliamentary activities.
The Speaker made the request when Ranaweera raised a Point of Order in response to a matter of privilege made by State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera.
Minister Perera referring to the behaviour of Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera on Tuesday, said it was a disgrace to the entire Parliament.
Referring to the parliamentary code of conduct governing the behaviour of parliamentarians within the Chamber, he said, It clearly outlines the manner in which members need to behave in a civil manner and the decent language that should be used during political discourse, especially during debates. No Member shall assault, harass or intimidate any person and every Member shall act in a respectful manner with regard to his fellow Members, the Parliamentary Staff and people of the country. They should behave with dignity and courtesy, without tarnishing the dignity of Parliament.
On Tuesday during a heated situation in parliament, MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera insulted the Speaker on a personal level and threatened him. Their behaviour brought disgrace upon the entire Parliament. It was a violation of MP privileges. Therefore, action should be taken against them by the Committee on Privileges, Perera noted, adding that these MPs behave in this manner without fear of consequence, because the committee on privileges follow a very lenient stance when dealing with such behaviour.
In response to Pereras allegation, the Speaker told him to submit a proposal to the Committee on Privileges.
Reacting to Pereras reference to his behaviour the previous day, Ranaweera, raising a point of order, said he needed to respond to him as his name was mentioned. However, the Speaker prevented him from responding and disallowed his point of order.
When an agitated Ranaweera tried to protest against the Speaker, a clearly annoyed Speaker retorted, Im kindly asking you to sit down. You interrupted yesterdays sitting and I cant allow you to do the same today. So please sit down.
UPF, MSTF did not incur losses: PM
The University Provident Fund and Mahapola Scholarship Trust Fund (MSTF) did not incur losses, but suffered a deprivation of revenue from investing in the questioned Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday ensured.
Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero also rose to confirm that neither of these funds under went losses, but deprivation of revenue.
The UGC had already sought instructions from the Attorney General and had taken legal action to recover this loss of revenue, Grero added.
PM Wickremesinghe explaining the transaction relating to UGC on February 27, 2015, said that the National Savings Bank had invested UPF in Treasury bonds worth Rs. 880 Million and accordingly, received its investment profits. The NSB acted as a Primary Dealer in the bond market.
The problem arose when the Treasury Bond Commission revealed that Perpetual Treasuries Limited had made unconscionable profits from the questioned bond transaction amounting to Rs. 141 MN. Accordingly, the UPF had lost revenue due to it from investing in those bonds.
This is not a problem with the parties who invested in the bonds and the PTL, but an issue between the PTL and CBSL. This money belongs to the government, not to anybody else, PM Wickremesinghe explained.
The Premier pointed out that PTL accounts are suspended and steps have been taken to recover the revenue losses suffered by these funds. He also said that the Finance Minister had been instructed to look into possible legal measures to make sure that such a situation may not arise in the future.
The UPF worths Rs. 37 BN as at January 01, 2016.
Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out that UPF and Mahapola Trust Fund were invested in Treasury bonds even before 2015. These investments have been done via State institutions such as the NSB, BOC, Peoples Bank and Primary Dealers Wealth Trust Securities, First Capital Treasury and Commercial Bank. He pointed out that there was no report suggesting that these two funds incurring losses due to investing in Treasury bonds.
Govt. will not delayholding PC elections
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government had no desire to unnecessarily delay the Provincial Council elections.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma.
Despite a court order, the government took technical measures to delay the elections in three provincial councils. Accordingly, the North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Council elections was postponed which had been nine months. In September last year, the Prime Minister assured Parliament during the debate that Provincial Council elections would be held by March this year. But, the government had failed to even take the Delimitation National Committee report for debate in Parliament. Within the next three months, the North, Wayamba and Central Provincial council terms would come to an end, but the Prime Minister and the subject minister had failed to say when the elections would be held, Alahapperuma said.
In response, the Prime Minister said that Provincial Council elections need to be held. He said the issue that had arisen and which is currently in discussion, is on whether following the same electoral system as in the LG elections which would create administrative issues. Various parties have differing views, while some are of the view that we should hold elections under the former electoral system and decide on the new system at a later election. However, there are still some parties who have not expressed their views on their preferences. Hence, we hope that these parties too would take a decision soon, so that we could amend the laws if needed and hold the elections without further delay.
He said the government had intended to hold the Provincial and Urban Council elections by November or December last year, and if that had been done, then by March, a decision could have been taken. In order to move forward, we need to know what the party leaders stand is in this regard, the PM said, adding that if the party leaders are agreeable, then he had no issue in holding elections.
Adding to the debate, Speaker Jayasuriya said he too had a comment to make in this regard. At the last Party Leaders meeting, we could not come to an agreement on the electoral system that the election should be held under. There were two opinions and we hope that with Fridays debate, we could come to some agreement.
Wimals, Prasannas conduct harmful to dignity and decorum of Parliament, country: Speaker
The unparliamentary conduct of MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera during a protest against Deputy Minister Vijayakala Maheshwarans controversial statement, was harmful to the dignity and decorum of Parliament and the country, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
In a special statement at the commencement of sittings yesterday, Speaker Jayasuriya said that everyone in Parliament should be ashamed and regretted of what happened on Tuesday.
We should be ashamed of disrupting the sittings of the House by attempting to grab the Mace to prevent the passing of Regulations under the National Medicine Regulatory Authority, which were of national importance. As soon as we came to know of the seriousness of the statement made by Deputy Minister Vijayakala Masheswaran, I took the initiative to hold an inquiry. I ordered for the acquiring of a copy of the video tape which showed Minister Maheshwarans speech and a translation of it. In my capacity as Speaker, I did everything possible, including contacting her party leader and to the Attorney General for legal instructions, Speaker Jayasuriya said.
He observed that the conduct of the two MPs was a disgrace and unbecoming of a parliamentarian.
At a time our Parliament has been recognized as a model parliament in the world, by the Inter Parliamentary Union, the conduct and behavior of some opposition MPs had caused a very embarrassing situation. It is a great harm done to the good name of the country and its Parliament, he further said.
Speaker Jayasuriya pointed out that he had instructed the Attorney General to take legal action after an investigation into the statement by the Deputy Minister. That is the highest action possible for a Speaker under the powers of the Constitution, he said.
Meanwhile, State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera, said that a Code of Conduct for MPs was in force and action should be taken against MPs Weerawansa and Ranaweera.
They used filthy words when addressing the Speaker. They led another group of MPs to disrupt sittings. We too condemn Deputy Minister Maheshwarans statement. We also demand an inquiry and action against her statement. But that does not mean we should resort to unparliamentary behavior and use of vulgar words in the House. Actions by some opposition MPs including MPs Weerawansa and Ranaweera, amounted to a breach of privileges of some other MPs including myself. Action should be taken against them under the provisions of the Code of Conduct, State Minister Perera said.

SLs current exchange balance ofRs 9.9 billion highest in history: Eran
The countrys current foreign exchange balance is the highest in history being $9.9 million (around Rs. 9.9 billion). The government has managed the economy in a positive manner. By the end of 2017, exports had increased dramatically to $11.4 billion. Fish exports had increased by 42%, tea exports had increased by 20.5%, spice exports had increased by 28% and rubber exports had increased by 9% and mineral exports had increased by 51% in 2017. FDI had increased to 1.913 billion by 2017, said the State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne in Parliament yesterday.
He said the government was focussing on a long term economic progress path and expressed confidence that the government would continue for the next five years as well.
I heard some saying that we had devalued the rupee. If a country is to progress, its exports should exceed its imports. Over the past 25 years, the countrys exports had been reducing gradually. When the previous government was defeated, the countrys GDP had reduced from around 30% in 1994 to around 14%. When we came into power, we initiated a mechanism to rebuild the countrys GDP. We did not wish to keep the rupee at an artificial level, but wanted to keep it on par with the market value, he said.
Responding to a comment made by JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage that the rupee had depreciated by 20% under the current government, Minister Wickramaratne said during the first six months of this year, the rupee had depreciated by 3.35%.
However, in comparison, the Indian rupee during the same period had depreciated by 8.06%. The Pakistani rupee had depreciated by 10.48%, the Thai Bath had depreciated by 5.43%, Indonesian rupiah had depreciated by 5.2%. The Singapore dollar had depreciated more than the SL rupee against the dollar by 4.6%. The American dollar had strengthened due to the economic policies of the new American President. Further, during this same period when comparing the Euro against the US dollar, the Euro had depreciated by 6.87% against the dollar. The Sterling pound had also depreciated by 8.21%. Sri Lanka has the lowest depreciation due to the strong macro economy, he said.
Distribution of financial rewards to Customs officers: New amendments soon: Mangala
New amendments would be brought in to change the currently followed method of distributing financial rewards to Customs officials for detections made, in a manner that would enable the distribution of these rewards to all officials in an equal manner which would be fair to all, said Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
The Minister said the existing method of financial rewards to Customs officials favour only a very small segment of officials in the Customs Department which was not fair by all. He said so, moving several resolutions under the Customs Ordinance for the Second Reading Debate in Parliament yesterday.
As per the existing provisions of the Customs Ordinance, only some Customs officials earn large sums as rewards from the detection they make. It is customary for them to receive 50 per cent of the fines so imposed. The chance to earn rewards is not broad-based. There was one officer who earned almost 100 million rupees within a 12 month period as rewards. We should not envy them, but we need a more fair system that was fair to all. It is only a small group, roughly around 1% of the Customs workforce who receive rewards of over 10 million per year, the minister said.
However, Minister Samaraweera said amendments into the Customs Ordinance would take time and until then, he proposed that 50 percent of the fines should be distributed equally among all employees of the Department from the General Manager to the cook. Ten per cent of the fine could be given to the detectors and the balance 40 per cent should be equally distributed. This system would come in to effect from this week, the Minister said.
The Minister noted that these proposed amendments to the Customs and Excise Ordinance, would be brought in through the Budget debate this year.
JVP demands policy on asbestos imports
The JVP yesterday, demanded to know the Governments exact policy towards importing asbestos and urged that action be taken to prevent the collapse of the local tile industry.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath pointed out that the country had benefitted only once by cutting off import taxes in importing asbestos. Soon after the Tsunami disaster and when the rebuilding process began, the then government cut off taxes on asbestos roofing sheets. That was a good move, as there was an urgency in building houses for those who lost their houses in the disaster, he said.
Herath made these observations, participating in the Second Reading stage debate on Resolutions under the Customs Ordinance.
MP Herath also said that the government made contradictory statements on asbestos and its practice is contrary to what it promises.
Now there is a recent announcement by the Housing Ministry that it would not use asbestos roofing sheets for the houses it would build. But the tax reduction on asbestos is still on. Then there was an earlier statement which said that the government would ban asbestos. I saw on TV the other day the President declaring open a housing scheme in Polonnaruwa. All the houses in the scheme had been covered by asbestos roofing sheets. Have the government changed its position Herath questioned.
When the Presidential statement on the banning of asbestos came, local tile industries obtained bank loans and increased their production. They did not even harm the environment by increasing their production. They followed environmental protection guidelines when extracting clay for the industry. They only use the clay dug up from the tanks. So they received SLS Standard Certificates. Their tiles are much safer than the asbestos being dumped here from other countries. But today they are at a loss. Their industry had collapsed and they are helpless. How could they run their industries profitably when the government keeps tax concessions it had granted to importing asbestos in 2004 aftermath the Tsunami he pointed out.
Herath also pointed out that the government policies in permitting re-exporting spices including pepper, arecanut and tamarind have resulted in the collapse of local industries. He urged the government to amend these policies to protect local industrialists.
Wanted Commission to probe alleged funding by China Harbour Company to MR
Minister Kabir Hashim yesterday urged for a Presidential Commission to investigate into a US$ 7.6 funding done by China Harbour Company to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Minister Hashim further demanded that a debate be held in Parliament on the same subject.
Minister Hashim questioned whether this funding was done as a part of an agreement where 50 acres of land belonging to the Hambantota Port being sold for just one dollar.
Minister Hashim said a Presidential Commission should be appointed immediately to investigate into the incident.
Three months before the last Presidential Election, Mahinda Rajapaksa instructed the General Treasury to enter into an agreement with the China Harbour Company. What is this agreement That is, a promise given to sell 50 acres of land for a dollar. All these were done three months before the Presidential Election. So the question is, did the company pay Rajapaksa US$ 7.5 for signing the agreement These are major robberies. A Presidential Commission should probe into this matter immediately and a Parliament debate should also be held, Minister Hashim pointed out.
It was the same case scenario concerning the 50 acres of land in a high security zone which was also given to China. We changed it. In 2013, Rajapaksa gave tax concessions to selected branded products. They reduced taxation even on dog food. The tax concessions were also given to certain brands used by people such as Wimal Weerawansa and their family members. That is how they reduced taxes. They didnt give tax concessions for food items used by the general public, Minister Hashim also pointed out.
Due to wrong decisions by govt. 22 mnpeople have to suffer: Mahindananda
The rupee had devalued by 20 percent in comparison to 2014 and due to this devaluation, the government has to bear an additional Rs. 800 billion in foreign debt value.
During the former regime only Rs. 500 billion was spent on development activities, including the Southern Expressway, the planning of the Kandy Expressway, the Katunayake Expressway, the Hambantota Port and Airport and the Norochcholai Power Plant etc. But with the devaluation the value of the debt had increased by 800 billion, which clearly indicates the inefficiency of the government. Due this, your wrong economic policies are clearly visible, Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said in Parliament yesterday, adding that the losses to the country by the Treasury bond scam was Rs. One trillion.
Mahindananda noted that when they handed over the government, the tax income was one trillion rupees and under the current Good Governance regime, it had increased to two trillion rupees. This government increased taxes in order to cover up the damage done by the Treasury bond scam. One person was responsible for the bond scam and wrong decision, but 22 million people in the country are paying the price for it, he said.

LNG plant at Kerawalapitiya:
Procurement procedure transparent, says ministry
The procurement procedure of the proposed 300 megawatt Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant at Kerawalapitiya has been accomplished in a fully transparent manner, the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry stated yesterday.
The statement said the procurement process started for the Kerawalapitiya 300 megawatt LNG plant to be implemented with private sector investment under the ministry policy of introducing LNG plants to the country.
The procurement process had now reached its last stage and a Cabinet paper has been submitted to award the tender to the selected bidder.
However, various parties had been trying to publish false allegations through the electronic and print media in the recent past. In any procurement process, the procurement committee had to take the recommendations of the technical evaluation committee into account before making a decision.
The release said, thereafter, unsuccessful bidders could submit appeals to the procurement appeals committee set up at the Presidential Secretariat. This is the procedure adopted in respect of the 300 megawatt LNG project as well. Unsuccessful bidders had also been notified to submit their appeals to this committee. The procurement appeals committee had accepted the appeal submitted by the institution concerned and reported this matter to the Cabinet on June 12.
The Cabinet paper submitted by the ministry had accepted the recommendations of the procurement appeals committee.
This is the normal procedure adopted in any procurement process and it had been done in a fully transparent manner.

Public transport information on Google Maps
Information on public transport in Sri Lanka will be added to Google Maps for the convenience of local and foreign tourists.
National Transport Commission (NTC) Chairman M. A. P. Hemachandra, addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, said the data included departure times, ticket fare and routes for long distance inter-provincial private buses operated by NTC, SLTB buses, trains and buses operated by Road Passenger Transport Authorities in Western and Southern Provinces in the initial stage.
Data of all public transport modes will be included in Google Maps in the future.
Users will know the travel fare for each distance, real-time departures and routes and it will also reveal the number of interchanges.
For each journey, the app compares all available routes via different transport modes to see which is the quickest or easiest.
Alternatively, users can pick their preferred mode of transport and select the minimum number of changes.
Once a route is selected, Google will tell them which stop they need to get off and show the stop on a map.
This is the best way for passengers, especially foreign travelers, to look up timetables and ticket fares of each public transport mode, he added.The chairman added that a new bus fare policy will be formulated to regulate normal bus, air-conditioned bus and super luxury bus operations soon. Meanwhile, a new card system, which is an electronic pre-paid travel card, will be introduced, allowing passengers to make bus ticket payments without the hassle of carrying cash.

Rajapaksa presidential stakes in deep waters
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa- though unable to run for President in 2020- found himself at the centre of an evolving controversy last week as the respected American newspaper the New York Times implied in an article that China has inveigled Sri Lanka into a debt trap during Rajapaksas Presidency.
The article in question was titled How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port and was written by Maria Abi-Habib, the newspapers South Asia correspondent based in New Delhi. The article appeared in the New York Times on June 25 and acknowledges contributions from journalists from Beijing as well as two senior journalists in Sri Lanka.
While the New York Times has an established reputation as a newspaper of integrity, Abi-Habib also has impressive credentials. Among other achievements, in 2012 she investigated atrocities in a military hospital in Kabul in Afghanistan that led to the resignation of an American General.
The article paints a picture of Sri Lanka as a small country hungry for financing. It claims that China offered loans to Sri Lanka that could not be sustained to build the port in Hambantota and that, as a result, under heavy pressure and after months of negotiations with the Chinese the government handed over the port and 15,000 acres of land around it for 99 years in December.
The article claims that the port gave China control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival, India, and a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway and observes that the case is one of the most vivid examples of Chinas ambitious use of loans and aid to gain influence around the world.
More damaging for Rajapaksa is the claim that engagement with the Chinese was linked to his election campaign. The article claims that during the 2015 Sri Lankan elections, large payments from the Chinese port construction fund flowed directly to campaign aides and activities for Mr. Rajapaksa, who had agreed to Chinese terms at every turn and was seen as an important ally in Chinas efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia.
Hambantota Port
The newspaper states that the payments were confirmed by documents and cash checks detailed in a government investigation seen by The New York Times. It also notes that Rajapaksa and his aides did not respond to multiple requests for comment, made over several months, for this article. Officials for China Harbor (the company engaged in the construction of the port) also would not comment.
The decision of the Rajapaksa government to build a port in Hambantota could be criticised as bad judgment, because the port- like the airport in Mattala- has not been a commercial success. However, of more concern to Rajapaksa, the Joint Opposition (JO) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is the insinuation that this decision was quid pro quo for funding provided to Rajapaksa for his 2015 presidential election campaign.
The article does provide details about this, which, if accurate, would be of concern. At least US$7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbors account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksas campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times the article claims.
With 10 days to go before polls opened, around US$3.7 million was distributed in checks: US$678,000 to print campaign T-shirts and other promotional material and US$297,000 to buy supporters gifts, including womens saris. Another US$38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Mr. Rajapaksas electoral bid, while two checks totalling US$1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees, his official residence, the article claims.
This is hardly the kind of publicity that the Rajapaksa camp would wish for, with presidential elections due in eighteen months, even if Mahinda Rajapaksa is himself not a candidate. Predictably, the government- or at least, its United National Party (UNP) faction- has gone on the offensive.
Social Empowerment Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has lodged a complaint with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) regarding the allegations made in the New York Times article and State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ajith Perera has challenged Rajapaksa to sue the newspaper if the article was defamatory.
Initially, Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa, eldest son of the former President pooh-poohed the accusations in the article stating that the New York Times was simply recycling old allegations. However, it was clear that the controversy was gathering momentum and Mahinda Rajapaksa did respond.
Rajapaksa denied the allegations and stated that he was in the process of sending a Letter of Demand to the New York Times. He also said that his party would also be doing the same as the article stated that his partys campaign was funded by China. However, Rajapaksa did not specify which political party that was because he ran as a candidate of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) which he is no longer in control of.
Rajapaksa also issued a detailed statement. No contribution was made by China Harbour Co to my 2015 presidential election campaign. While claiming that my affiliates and campaign aides had got the money and that volunteers had delivered the cheques to Temple Trees, the writer of the New York Times article has been intentionally vague about who had given this money and who had received it. This seems to be a way of carrying out a smear campaign without incurring any liability, Rajapaksa said in his statement.
Denial
Rajapaksa also takes issue with the New York Times for the sources of its information. The NYT writer has stated that they had obtained some of the details in that article from a Sri Lankan government investigation. Every Sri Lankan knows that the main preoccupation of this government since it came into power has been to sling mud at the opposition he says.
Despite this rebuttal, the controversy continues, in part due to the tactics adopted by the Rajapaksa camp. This was after JO parliamentarians held a news conference and claimed that the two senior Sri Lankan journalists who have been acknowledged in the article made their contributions at the behest of the government. A photograph of one of the journalists was also displayed at the briefing.
This was to draw a sharp retort from the New York Times. Michael Slackman, the international editor for The Times, called those claims false. In a statement, he said The Times article was rigorously reported and accurate and criticized the JOs tactics. It is unacceptable for journalists to be intimidated in this way, Slackman said. This action appears intended to silence critics and curb press freedoms, and ultimately deprive Sri Lankans of information in the public interest.
Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Colombo has also now weighed in with its own statement on the issue. The statement from the embassy however does little to clear up the controversy. The embassy has noticed the New York Times article published on June 25, as well as the clarifications and responses by various parties from Sri Lanka, criticizing it full of political prejudice and completely inconsistent with the facts the statement said. The embassy statement notes that despite any interference from a third party, China would like to work together with Sri Lanka to actively implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries but is silent on the specific allegations levelled in the article.
It is very likely that, fuelled by political pressures, this issue will linger on for some time. Whether the Rajapaksa camp has the nous to take on the New York Times on this matter is a moot point. That is because, publicity of this kind is something that the Rajapaksa, the JO and the SLPP could best do without with national elections on the horizon. At present however, strategists in that camp dont seem to view this controversy in that light.

The real price of luxury
Ruwan Gunaratne* has worked behind the bars of luxury hotels for nearly three decades. He started learning his trade in five-star hotels in Colombo, and then spent a few years in the Maldives before moving back home to his family.
Now, he is a shift captain at a seaside hotel just outside Colombo, mixing tropical cocktails and managing a small bar staff.
In all those years of work, Gunaratne has mastered English, and the recipes for hundreds of cocktails. But he doesnt have much money to show for it.
When he started his recent job five years ago, he said he made about Rs. 10,500 a month as his base salary. But now, despite years of service and increases in the cost of living, he makes just over Rs. 18,000.
I have three children and a wife to support, Gunaratne said in a recent interview. How is that enough
He said it can often feel like he lives two lives. On some nights, tourists run up bar tabs way over the amount he makes in a month.
Of course, Gunaratne and other hotel employees dont only earn a basic salary. Each month they get a cut of the service charge the hotel collects.
And although the service charges can be good, sometimes as much as Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 30,000 in the peak months, they fluctuate with the season.
The steady money, and the amount from which the EPF and ETF retirement funds are calculated, is barely enough to live on, he said.
Tourism is the number one industry in Sri Lanka, Gunaratne said. But theres a dark side.
Even as hotel owners and tourism promoters laud Sri Lankas growing hotel industry as a job creator, workers say that on the ground, the situation actually looks very different.
Luxury hotels, poor wages
Colombo and Sri Lankas tourist hubs are changing. The new five-star Shangri-La Hotel rises above Galle Face Green, its workers in their neatly pressed uniforms greeting foreign guests
Everything from small guesthouses to international chains like the Marriott dot the coasts, accommodating the growing hoard of tourists flying into Sri Lanka.
Last year, that number climbed to over 2 million, according to the Tourism Development Authority, up from about 650,000 in 2010.
The industry supporting those guests employs over 150,000 people directly, and another 200,000 indirectly, government statistics show.
But the work conditions of the staff at these glamorous vacation spots can be deceiving, workers and advocates say.
This is our problem, not just my problem, Gunaratne said.
Inter Company Employees Union General Secretary Janaka Adikari, whose union represents workers in private hotels, agreed.
These hotels and new chains are coming, but the situation of the employee in the hotel industry is a sad one, he said.
Even in the five-star hotels, the employees situation is very poor, they are suffering, he added. The only benefit there is that they are working in an air-conditioned environment.
Adikari said the fundamental problem is the division between basic salaries and service charges. Under the current wages ordinance, hotels have to pay their employees above a minimum of Rs. 6,900 a month  a number so low that most hotels dont even pay it anymore, he said.
A pretty standard starting wage, according to interviews with hotel workers, activists, and industry representatives, is Rs. 12,000.
Service charge varies by the season, peaking from November to February.
But the major issue with this situation is that EPF and ETF are calculated only from the basic salary. So even if someone makes Rs. 37,000 in a good month, only the basic salary of Rs. 12,000 is used to calculate the retirement contribution.
Because of this, employees often get caught in a service charge trap, said Shafeek Wahab, a long-time hotel industry consultant. They manage their salaries over their career, he explained, but when they retire, they find that they have basically nothing to live on.
Another issue is that banks only consider the basic salary when people apply for loans.
Employees often report having trouble applying for home and vehicle loans, as banks usually wont account for service charge as a part of their income.
Wahab said most employers are very aware of the problems this payment structure creates. The hoteliers are taking advantage of the employees, Wahab said.
According to him, the owners dont want to change the system because it comes out of their bottom line.
A different problem for the owners
Some hotel owners say they are open to the idea of using the service charges to raise base salaries.
To incorporate the service charge into the salary is an important task, said The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Sanath Ukwatte.
Ukwatte, who is also the Chairman of the Mount Lavinia Hotel Group, said that the association had also discussed a different mechanism to improve retirement benefits.
He said they are considering paying a quarter months salary as retirement benefits for each year of continuous service of permanent staff, from the 10th year onwards.
Yet even as workers protest their low wages, the hotel owners say they are facing another problem, and one thats affecting the health of the whole industry: they cant find enough workers to fill vacancies.
This is the biggest challenge we face at present in hotel operations, Ukwatte said.
He said that even though the Sri Lanka Hotel School and other private training schools were graduating people every year, the amount of new trained workers is just not sufficient for the industry, even today.
A compounding problem is that many of the young people who train in hotels in Sri Lanka immediately move to the Gulf states, where they can earn better salaries.
Gunaratne, the bar manager, said that as a shift captain, he trains between 20-26 people a year. According to him, most of them immediately move to the Middle East to work in the hotel sector there.
This is an absolute pity, Ukwatte said. There are many jobs available here in Sri Lanka in the hospitality and the tourism sector, with opportunities to rise to senior management positions.
But people still go out to the MiddleEastern countries and seem happy to do the same job for years without any growth in their career, he added.
Wahab said he believed the two realities  low wages and high vacancies  were related. People dont find the salary attractive, he said. In places like Qatar and Dubai, the base pay is just better.
Wahab said raising the base pay in Sri Lanka could keep people back home. But he said the industry also needed to better market itself as providing long-term, stable careers with upward mobility.
I think the industry is not making an effort to demonstrate to the public that its an industry that has a lot of opportunities, he said.
Raising the base wage
As far as the government is involved, the Labour Departments Wages Board recently made a move to raise the minimum wage for the hotel and catering trades.
The new base wage of Grade I employee, meaning jobs like dishwashers, bar labourers, and cloak room attendants, would be Rs. 10,000 for the first year. The Wages Board also allots a Rs. 2,500-a-month budgetary relief allowance.
Asked how they had determined the new minimum wage in an interview, Labour Commissioner for the Labour Standards Division, Janaka Paranamana said the Wages Board had consulted employers and employees unions. In the past it was too low, he said. Now the minimum wage is a living wage.
But Janaka Adikari, the union secretary, disagreed. Its not sufficient, its not good, he said. At least a percentage of the service charge needs to be considered as a part of the salary.
Until that happens, he said he believed the situation for hotel employees would not change. He said his union would continue picketing and emphasising this issue to society and the government.
For Gunaratne, back behind the bar, these political manoeuvres are not felt.
Its now July, which means its the low season, and money is tight again. He said that on a recent afternoon, he only made Rs. 120 at the bar in tips.
Gunaratne said he notices the country changing, especially the influx of luxury hotels in Colombo.
There are all these hotels, he said. But who would want to work there I have two sons and one daughter, he added. I tell them not to work in hotels.
(*Gunaratne requested a pseudonym for this article.)

Rock-solid Brazil living up to billing as World Cup favourites
SOCHI, Tuesday - While some of their biggest rivals have already fallen by the wayside in Russia, Brazil have been making serene progress towards the latter stages of the World Cup.
After watching holders Germany, Spain and Argentina all exit the competition in the last week in various states of disarray, the Selecao eased into the quarter-finals with a 2-0 victory against Mexico on Monday.
As they aim to lift the World Cup for a record sixth time in Moscow on July 15, their next opponents are Belgium in Kazan on Friday, in what will be something of a clash of styles -- the best defence up against the best attack.
This Brazil team is not just about Neymar, even if his theatrics and intermittent magic, like his opener against Mexico, are what immediately catch the eye and dominate the headlines.
Look a little more closely and it becomes clear what is really making them tick -- coach Tite has instilled an admirable collective discipline and his team are built on solid foundations.
They have conceded just one goal so far at this World Cup, and Steven Zubers effort for Switzerland in a 1-1 draw in Rostov-on-Don could have been disallowed for a foul on Joao Miranda.
Since then, goalkeeper Alisson Becker has kept three straight clean sheets, with Brazil winning 2-0 against Costa Rica, Serbia and Mexico. They have conceded just four shots on target in four matches.
ITALIAN-INSPIRED
It is the kind of record that the Italians, the old defensive masters who are conspicuous by their absence in Russia, would have been proud of. Brazil are looking to Italy for inspiration.
Juventus have been champions for the last seven years, and only once without having the best defence, said Tites assistant Sylvinho, the former Arsenal and Barcelona left-back, after the Mexico game.
In such a short tournament, we want balance to be what characterises us, and that does not make us a defensive team.
History shows that the team with the best defence tends to win the trophy. And while Brazil have always possessed brilliant individuals, they have also long since been pragmatists above all else.
There will be moments of magic from Neymar, who is gradually coming to the boil following foot surgery in March -- as long as they go with defensive discipline.
On Monday in Samara, Tite switched to a 4-4-2 formation after Mexico caused Brazil early problems, and they had a foundation to go on and win the game in the second half.
Fagner might be a weak link at right-back, but there is strength in depth throughout the squad -- Casemiro, Paulinho and Philippe Coutinho provide different qualities in midfield, while Willian came up with his best performance of the tournament against Mexico.
Gabriel Jesus has yet to find the net, but Roberto Firmino came off the bench to score on Monday and is pushing for a start.
Brazil defend from the front, with captain Thiago Silva admitting the aim is to concede no more goals.
That is our objective, he said. But always emphasising that the defensive part begins with the attackers. When the ball does come into our area, it is much easier to cut it out. Our attackers play a big part in that.
CHINK IN THE ARMOUR
And so to Friday when Brazil, who have the joint-best defence at the tournament along with Uruguay, face a Belgium outfit who have been the most prolific with 12 goals scored.
For now they are living up to their billing, although it remains to be seen how they will cope in the absence of Casemiro, the Real Madrid powerhouse who screens the defence from deep in midfield.
He is suspended, meaning Fernandinho is likely to come in.
The 33-year-old does not offer the same degree of protection, although his inside knowledge of Manchester City club colleague Kevin De Bruyne could be invaluable as Brazil look to keep their challenge for a sixth title going.  AFP

SIMPLE all natural beauty tips
Banana and Egg Hair Treatment
Looking for a little more shine in your hair Simply mix one egg and a mashed up banana. Apply it as a thick paste to your hair and leave it on for 10  30 minutes. Wash it our doing your usual hair washing ritual (if you usually use a store-bought conditioner youll probably only need to condition the ends). And voila! Super simple, and all natural, beauty tip.

Moisturizing Nail Treatment
Soak your nails in olive oil for five minutes. And then sit back and admire your pretty hands.

Simple Honey Face Mask
Raw honey is naturally anti-bacterial and a super quick way to get soft, beautiful skin. Once a week use a tablespoon or so of raw honey (not the processed stuff parading as honey) and gently warm it by rubbing your fingertips together.
Spread on your face. Leave on for 5  10 minutes and then use warm water to gently rinse it off and pat dry. Then bask in the glow of your honey-awesomeness. This raw honey is awesome, by the way.
Elbow and Knee Exfoliate and Skin Brightener
Cut an orange in half and rub it on your elbows and knees. Helps soften those rough patches. And it smells good. (Rinse off the sticky mess when you are done.)

Gentle Body Scrub
Mix a 2 to 1 ratio of olive oil and sea salt to make a quick and effective body scrub. This helps get rid of dead skin cells creating softer, more glowing skin. And this natural beauty tip is much cheaper that expensive store bought body scrubs.
Easy Deep Conditioning Hair Treatment
Use melted coconut oil as a deep conditioning hair and scalp treatment. Massage coconut oil into your scalp and then work it through your hair. Leave it on for a couple of hours and then wash it out using shampoo (no need to condition unless you have really long hair and then maybe just the ends.

Simple Toxic-Free Shaving Cream
Use coconut oil on your legs as a natural replacement for your shaving cream.

Natural Black Head Removal
Place 4 or 5 drops of raw honey on an open lemon wedge. Then rub the lemon on your face for a minute, emphasizing any trouble areas. Leave the mixture on for 5 minutes and rinse with cold water. (Keep in mind that citrus can make your skin photosensitive so its best to
do this before bed rather than before going outside)

Dry Brushing for Better Skin
Dry brushing is a simple detoxification process for your body. It stimulates a number of organs through a gently massage. It also helps the lymphatic system, eliminates dead skin coatings, strengthens the immune system, can eliminate cellulite, stimulates the hormones, and can help tighten skin through better circulation. Best of all, its cheap and easy.

185 athletes to take part in 28 sports:
SL to send record number of athletes to Asian Games
Sri Lanka will send its largest ever contingent to the 18th Asian Games with 185 athletes participating in 28 sports for the multi-sport extravaganza in Jakarta and Palembang from August 18-September 2.
We want to give everyone the opportunity to showcase their talent. In the past there have been many instances where athletes, or sports, have tried to use influence to go to an international event. Im giving everyone the chance to show us what they are capable of, said an upbeat Suresh Subramaniam, president of the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka.
It is a record number of athletes we are sending to the Asian Games. But the size of the squad has been inflated due to the fact that a number of team sports will be participating. We are doing this because we want to promote team sports, apart from supporting individual athletes too, Subramaniam added.
The 28 sports are: Aquatics (swimming), Archery, Athletics, Badminton, Baseball, Basketball, Boxing, Canoeing, Golf, Gymnastics, Hockey, Judo, Kabaddi, Karate, Rowing, Rugby (sevens), Sailing, Roller Sport, Squash, Table Tennis, Taekwondo, Tennis, Triathlon, Volleyball (Indoor and Beach), Weightlifting, Wrestling and Wushu.
There are 138 men and 47 women among the total of 185 athletes who will be taking part. This will include a 12-member womens team in Kabaddi for the first time. It is expected that more than 60 officials  managers, coaches, doctors, physiotherapists, trainers, masseurs etc. will also accompany the team taking the Sri Lankan contingent number to more than 250.
We have submitted the entire list to the Ministry of Sports and it is subject to their approval, revealed Maxwell de Silva, NOC secretary general.
De Silva believed the size of the Asian Games squad would serve as a clarion call to all local stakeholders that the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka was keen to promote sports and provide opportunities for international participation.
We want to send the right message to all the Federations  to let them know that if you are serious, then we are serious too. We will then give them the opportunities to represent Sri Lanka at major international events like the Asian Games, De Silva said.
Four years ago, at the Incheon Asian Games, Sri Lanka sent a 126-strong contingent - 80 athletes and 46 officials. Sri Lanka returned home with two medals both won in cricket. The mens team won the gold medal defeating Afghanistan in the final while the women won the bronze. Cricket is not a medal sport this time.
The Asian Games is the second-biggest multi-sport event next to the Olympic Games. A total of 45 countries will take part in 40 sports in Jakarta and Palembang, making it the second-largest sports program in Asian Games history.
Sri Lanka will mainly pin its medal hopes on athletics, kabaddi, judo, karate, wushu and rugby (mens sevens) while there will also be a strong chance in boxing, weightlifting, golf and swimming.
We have a number of realistic chances for medals, especially in the martial art events. In athletics, our mens relay team is a good prospect while rugby also has a chance in sevens, outlined De Silva.
Boxing and weightlifting, which earned the majority of medals at the Commonwealth Games will find the going harder with the opposition expected to be better than at the Gold Coast. In golf, hopes will be pinned on the shoulders of professionals Mithun Perera and Anura Rohana while all eyes in the swimming pool will be on Matthew Abeysinghe in the individual freestyle events as well as in the mens relay event.

Social Safety Nets Project welfare programme underway
The Finance and Media Ministry's Welfare Benefit Board will implement a new social welfare programme - Social Safety Nets Project (SSNP) - with a view to streamlining all social safety programmes.
The project will be implemented next year, Welfare Benefits Board Chairman Sugath Ranugge said.
With the implementation of the SSNP, all welfare programmes including financial aid programmes such as Samurdhi (Divineguma Aid), allowance for the elderly as well as low-income citizens over the age of 70, monthly public assistance allowances, assistance for persons with chronic illnesses in low-income households and financial assistance for communities presently carried out by various ministries and state bodies, would come under the SSNP, Ranugge added.
He was addressing a media briefing on issues in the current welfare system and its implementation at the Finance Ministry auditorium, yesterday.
SSNP Project Director T.M.K.B. Tennekoon, addressing the media, pointed out the need to implement more systematic and scientific social safety programmes that cater to modern-day requirements. Moreover, the selection process for receiving benefits should also be scientific so as to prevent unqualified individuals from applying. Information Technology would be utilised for the proposed programme, he said.
Each year, around Rs. 60 billion is allocated annually from budget for social welfare programmes, including Samurdhi benefits, fertiliser subsidies and welfare for war heroes, Tennekoon said.
Chairman Ranugge added that people have to apply to qualify as recipients of social welfare benefits with the SSNP, once it has been implemented. All Samurdhi beneficiaries should reapply. They could hand over their applications either to their respective Grama Niladari or Divisional Secretary. Online applications are also available, he said.
Application details will be entered to a database and the selection process will be carried out through a scientific method by the Welfare Benefits Board alone in order to avoid irregularities he added.
Speaking further on the Samurdhi programme, the main social protection programme of the country, Ranugge added that there were 1,407,235 Samurdhi beneficiaries at present and that 941,169 of them are on the waiting list. According to him, of the 941,169 Samurdhi beneficiaries, some had been receiving benefits since 1995. The situation indicates that there was no proper mechanism to monitor whether or not certain beneficiaries were overcoming poverty.
The main focus of social welfare programmes is to assist and empower people to reach higher economic positions. It is equal important to introduce an exit or graduation mechanism for Samurdhi beneficiaries to voluntarily quit the programme once they reach the targetted position, he added.

Sonic  the Hedgehog is a  juvenile  delinquent
Paramount CEO Jim Gianopulos says Sonic the Hedgehog will be a juvenile delinquent in the upcoming film. Such a move would be a major departure from most depictions of the popular video game character.
In 2016, Sony Pictures announced that they were developing a Sonic the Hedgehog movie.
However, those plans changed, and in 2017 it was revealed that Paramount Pictures had acquired the rights to the character. A fall 2019 release date was eventually set, with Jeff Fowler directing the film. It will also be executive produced by Deadpool director Tim Miller. Sonic the Hedgehog is expected to begin filming in the summer. The movie will be a mix of CGI animation and live action. Thats all that was known about the upcoming adaptation - until now.
During a Q&A at the 10th Annual Produced By Conference, Gianopulos addressed the fact that film adaptations of video games arent usually very successful and explained what sold him on the idea of a Sonic the Hedgehog movie (via Deadline). Fast and Furious franchise producer Neal H. Moritz had pitched the idea to Gianopulos, and he showed the studio executive a short clip to demonstrate the tone of the movie. Apparently, Gianopulos was impressed by what he saw.
Based on Gianopulos comments, audiences can infer that he is indeed talking about the plans for the film and not just his interpretation of the character, since he mentions the local policeman character, who will be played by Westworld and X-Men actor James Marsden. The idea of Sonic the Hedgehog being a juvenile delinquent suggests that the film is taking the character in a totally different direction than most portrayals of the blue hedgehog thats appeared in various video games and cartoons.

Sri islanders rugby and the happy beyond
Happy are those who instinctively know....
It is a brave rugby heart that would give Sri Lankan hopes that ultimate step up to world cup status and rank us among the rugby elite...
This globally fascinating discipline has little time or quarter for amateurs and hesitant islanders, who are unable to clear their lines.
Sri Lanka Rugby ...formally the Ceylon Rugby Football Union, then the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union....history, pride, respect, courage and a potent recurring dream to be counted and considered among the greatest rugby nations.
Grand ideals that still remain outside the hallowed committee chambers of the IRB gentlemans club in sunny Dublin...and observer status for Asian rugby still reaching and hoping.
Japans remarkable journey to world recognition...certainly stayed resilient through several world cups, to shine brighter in the last hosted by England.
Was Asian rugby finally on the map ...would our mania be marked and rewarded with elevated status to the top 30 list
But before we embrace and embark ...should we not consider, since its necessary to upgrade our ranking thoughts.
Can you conceivably envisage Hong Kong or South Korea stepping up behind Japan as the next Asian super rugby union
Hold that bold grey matter utterance...South Korea did dispatch the defending football world champions Germany ...on an early shuttle back home....remarkable, mesmerizing and true.
But alas the comparisons end at the tunnel entrance to the stadium ....Hong Kong v England or Korea v Australia, is still a loaded dream and possibly after Japan hosting the Rugby World Cup next year ...some food for impact thoughts
On that inspired thought how about Ireland v Sri Lanka ....our dream continues for XVs ...but is very much reality for 7s.
On that perfect pass, our 7s team, led by the hardworking Muthuthanthri ...are currently in Paris for an extended experience tour.
The Sri Union finally able to get on board and some practical game time for the squad to absorb pressure and mature under different conditions.
This is very much the tip of the iceberg...and positive impact for our Asian series ambitions.
Lets hope its not anywhere close to the iceberg that re-wrote the Titanic trip from Southampton...
Fiji the 7s islanders super force play more than 10 tournaments as the national squad before they land in Hong Kong for the 7s .....some wisdom and generous servings of traditional kava certainly make them invincible, and very much the mighty islanders that pretty much own the Hong Kong stadium.
Over the last 5 years, Fijian 7s magic and running style has ignited the former British colony beyond conventional imagination and added new dimension to the games global charm.
Lets wish our national 7s team the strength and skill to outplay and push past, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea on the circuit ...then step up physically to own the Asian series 2018..
Grand thoughts indeed.
At home in our city by the sea....it was all Milo Knockouts final under lights at the impressive Racecourse rugby arena.
Traditional rivals St Peters v St Josephs was the cracking duel to decide the Presidents trophy championship.
Joes the defending champions under the careful eye of coach Nilufer Ibrahim, and very much the favorite to retain the title, given their blackrock defence with 14players for 50 minutes of their league encounter.
Gemunu Chetiya and company looking for some pure icing on that seasons cake ....and more celebrations for an absorbing season.
St Peters and the mistakes from their 10/5 league loss ...more pressure on coach Martis and staff to sort ...can they match Joes forward power and dictate terms on the day or maybe Peters threes break free...all..in the middle
Will history repeat itself and a resounding win for the Maradana marauders Or will the Bamba brigade finally live to expectations
All answers ...in the middle after 70 minutes.
What a relentless final and a match to wax lyrical about.
Joes hearts...On fire and 15 points lead with 20 mins remaining.
Its just as they planned...all in order and controlled...just the last bits ....
Peters for their worth and pride had not given up hope ....and despite mighty pressure, they clawed back the 15 points by stepping up the pace and mind on the scoreboard.
There was the slightest chance and only adrenaline, skill and sheer belief that carved the blue white and gold name on that Milo trophy 24/21 final score magical impossible.
It was a classic as finals go ...and the nature of deciders...that one team should triumph 21-all might have been a fitting result
History will gleefully record that it was an epic final that was all the way down to the wire and easily either contender for the impressive Racecourse podium.
Most importantly, the game climbed beyond expectations and reinforced the pleasing standards of schools rugby in paradise...in spite of its governing structure that definitely require a healthy spring clean at best.
The skill and talent far too rich to take for granted.
Lets hope sanity and wisdom prevail and we can all hail our divisions of this remarkable union code.
Sri Lanka Rugby will need to harness new solar power in the months ahead post AGM and administrative requisites.
The games stakeholders need to consciously cooperate and create our new generation...high performance union sooner rather than later.
Blessings Sri rugby hearts ...the future is upon us ....lets step up and back our islanders abilities.
Cheers indeed!

Sri Lanka Tourism to probe fatal Southern Expressway accident
Sri Lanka Tourism said that they will speak to Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort regarding the accident where Australian woman Louise Collins, 37 and her daughter Poppy 4, were killed in a car crash close to Kurundugahahetepma access on Southern Expressway in a Hi Ace van.
The family from Brisbane, regular visitors to Sri Lanka was booked to stay at Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort and was traveling from the Katunayaka airport to Tangalle at dawn after arriving from Australia.
An Australian woman and her daughter died from the accident while the father and son are receiving treatment along with driver of the van and parked truck driver.
Police suspect that the driver of the van may have dozed off due to fatigue from travelling from Tangalle to airport and back without a rest and this accident has happened as a result. It has also been observed at investigations that the van had been travelling at a rapid pace, exceeding the limits and the tyres of the van too were worn out, an official from Elpitiya Police said.
Investigations are being conducted in connection with the issue of the truck changing tyres on the expressway without due permission. We are aware that the ill-fated van was not owned or operated by Anantara Hotel. However Sri Lanka Tourism is keen find out more details of the person or company which provided this van, the Sri Lanka Tourism official said.
Asked to comment Anantara Peace Haven Tangalle Resort, Cluster Director of Public Relations, Norman Zweyer, said that the management and team members of Anantara in Sri Lanka were very saddened to learn of the road accident which happened on the Southern Expressway which tragically resulted in the death of two passengers in the vehicle.
Ananta confirms that no team members or resort vehicles were involved in any traffic accidents that occurred during the last 14 days or in any vehicle arranged via the hotel. Our guests welfare is our priority and we have strict safety standards in place to ensure that this is maintained at all times.
Asked specifically if the Louise Collins family paid for transport as part of the package for their hotel stay he said, Anantara places great emphasis on the privacy of all guests and hence we are unable to comment or divulge information relating to any guests of our resort.

SriLankan, Shangri-La Htota in joint effort  on Global Wellness Day 2018
SriLankan Cares, the CSR arm of SriLankan Airlines, partnered with Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa to conduct a medical camp for needy communities in the Hambantota area for the second consecutive year on Global Wellness Day.
The medical campaign was a tremendous success, with approximately 300 people receiving medical consultation. The medical screening, which was held at Seetharama Temple, Hambantota, received positive comments from both the community and those who came in numbers to contribute and be a part of the project.
Voicing his thoughts on the importance of organizing an event of this scale, Head of Human Resources of SriLankan Airlines, Pradeepa Kekulawala, noted: As the National Carrier, we have always made an effort to extend our assistance to communities in need. We strongly believe that medical facilities and expertise should be made accessible to people in all parts of the country. Therefore it is an exemplary initiative which invites other responsible organizations, governing bodies and entities to reach out and contribute towards elevating healthcare.
Since its inception, the Shangri-La network has been continuously making efforts to drive social change through CSR initiatives.

The status of sports in Kandy
Sports in Kandy plays a significant role in the lives of the folks living here, representing all races in the island Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers Malays and also by foreigners. At one time all sports were popular, but not today. In the early days football, volleyball and cricket were very popular. In the last six months, lets take a look at how sports have fared in Kandy. Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most sportsmen/sportswomen in rugby, cricket, football, hockey, athletics, table tennis, iron sports, boxing, swimming, basketball, cue game, golf, volleyball, carom, chess and baseball.
Rugby - Today the oval ball sport is top of the pops in the country and undoubtedly the most popular sport in Kandy, in the school tournament Presidents trophy Kingswood College came up to the semifinals of the knockouts, Trinity College and St. Anthonys College came to the quarters. Then in the Premier trophy Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College were finalists. Kandy SC won the first leg of the inter club sevens, a team packed with hired players.
Football - Overall Kandy football is dead and virtually buried. It has been tagged the common mans game, and one time the sport in Kandy saw huge crowds witnessing and had stake holders. It is not so today. Sad to say in the last couple of years football has gone off side and most of the players are losing interest as there is no recognition nor any support or encouragement to take this game forward. At club level it is dead, the 2017 and 2018 AGM are still to be held.
Cricket - At school level the sport continues to take pride of place at junior and senior level, once again the newly elected KDCA committee headed by Thilina Tennakoon are going all-out to bring back cricket to its former position at club level, and end of the month will start the six a side tournament. Here again the contributing factor has been the lack of resources and facilities and poor organizing by the governing body.
Hockey - At school level hockey is quite healthy and successful with most of the schools, especially girls schools dominating the game. Kandy District Hockey Association affairs will be brought back to normal after the AGM. A herculean effort is urgently required if club hockey in Kandy is to see its former glory days. It is sad sponsors are not helping hockey
Cue sport - Billiards and snooker has taken a nosedive with hardly any activity. It was a sport which was once dominated by Kandy clubs. Only Mahanuwara YMBA keeps the sport going, other clubs like Kandy Club, Kandy Garden Club, and Kandy YMMA have forgotten to switch on the table lights.
Basketball - Has got back to its former glory and recently Kandy conducted a very successful inter-district tournament. The schools are giving a big boost to restart the game in a better fashion. It was in 1964 that basketball was introduced to Kandy. The first ever tournament in Kandy was held in 1965 for men and women.
Table Tennis - This game was very popular. There is some hope as there are many schools and clubs who are capable of doing well. The late D.H de Silva when he was Municipal Commissioner gave good support. Once again some schools are promoting the game.
Badminton - There is somewhat a lack of interest in this sport. Something must be done to uplift the game. There are not many coaches and should the schools take to the sport the game can pick up.
Lawn Tennis - One-time it was a very popular sport in Kandy. It was Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club, University of Peradeniya and Kandy Police who took to the sport during the late DIG Bodi Liyanages time. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way. A big hand should go to former Municipal Commissioner and All Ceylon cricketer the late D.H. de Silva who was a live wire and produced some top players using the Garden Club courts for a payment for the use of the courts. But sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity.
Swimming - Schools are doing well. They have proved it by winning many meets. Trinity, Mahamaya and Hillwood have excelled in the water sport.
Boxing - This sport remains popular among the schools. One time king makers of the sport were Trinity College later St. Sylvesters College followed by Peradeniya MMV and Sarasavi Uyana. Of late schools like Vidyartha, Kingswood and Dharmaraja, have taken to the sport and are doing well.
Wrestling - This sport was at its best at club level especially Kandy YMCA that promoted it. It is good to see Walala A Ratnayake Central doing well.
Iron Sport - Kandy YMCA gave a big hand for iron sport (body building and weightlifting) and helped several iron sportsmen to do well and bring honor to the country, so was Mahanuwara YMBA, Today some of the schools are also involved in the sport.
Baseball - This sport is catching up fast, and some of the schools are keen to promote it thanks to the efforts of the promoters.
Golf - A sport which is popular mainly due to the promotion given by the Golf Club in Digana. They have tournaments very often and are well supported with sponsorship.
Volleyball - The sport is 100 years old in the country and 76 years old in Kandy. It is the national sport, and at a certain time volleyball was a popular game. Today the much needed support is not there for the game. If the proper backing is given this game too, should be in the news.
Netball - Schools in Kandy are doing well in this sport and have taken part in most of the tournaments organized by the governing body. It was Kandy Girls High School who started the sport first followed by Hillwood College. All girls school take the sport seriously.
Athletics - All schools in Kandy have athletics in their curriculum and are doing very well in this field. At present all schools, boys and girls are performing well. Sylvestrians produced a top athlete who represented the country in hurdles. Walala A. Ratnayake Central won several meets.
Cycling - This sport has been popular in Kandy and there have been races on many occasions. For it to be competitive there has to be sponsorship which is lacking.
Chess has been popular at schools for quite a long period. Schools are doing extremely well. .
Carrom - A popular sport in Kandy, mostly played by the government departments. This is a re-creation sport. Kandys Carrom Association gives a big hand to promote the sport.
Softball Cricket - It is very popular in Kandy; every Sunday and on Poya days tournaments for various trophies are being played. On these days most of the grounds where soft ball cricket can be played are reserved.
The biggest problem over here for cricket and rugby is most of the schools are without grounds and they have to spend a lot of money for grounds. Rugby players get injured due to the hardness of the ground. Bogambara is like a concrete slab and Nittawela the fees are sky high.

Power Rangers actor Naomi Scott has been roped in to star as one of the leading ladies in the reboot of Charlies Angels.
Kristen Stewart is also confirmed and Lupita Nyongo is in negotiations to star in the project. According to That Hashtag Show, Scott has been confirmed to star in one of the trios roles.
Sony is rebooting the famous franchise with actor-director Elizabeth Banks on board to direct the new version. Banks will also star in the movie as the gender-flipped Bosley. She will also produce the project under her Universal-based Brownstone production company. Launched in 1976 on ABC, TV series Charlies Angels continued for five seasons with Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith playing private detectives working for Charlie.
Sony Pictures produced a film of the same name, starring Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu as the angels.
The movie became a huge hit and went on to earn $264 million worldwide. It was followed by a bloated and not well-received sequel, 2003s Charlies Angels: Full Throttle.
An attempt to revive it as a TV series in 2011 only lasted four episodes. The new Charlies Angels movie is expected to hit theatres in 2019. PTI

Vijayakalas remark linked to political tug-o-war
Much brouhaha is being created by a remark attributed to State Minister of Childs Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran. Addressing a function in Jaffna, Vijayakala, the wife of slain ex-MP, T. Maheswaran, had reportedly spoken in favour of a resurgence of the LTTE under whom the Tamils, according to her, lived with dignity, it was reported. When all hell broke loose, Ms. Maheswaran insisted that she was quoted out of context. Pressed for an answer, by State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, who, in a telephone conversation with Vijayakala, stated that the State Ministers remark had placed the UNP in a difficult position, the latter replied that if ever she made such a statement it was intended as a vote buying exercise.
That just about sums up the position in the North. Although the LTTE militarily is defeated, the Tamil youth still harbour nostalgic feelings about the outfit. This, the Tamil politicians are well aware of and play on these sentiments of the youth to become popular. The fact that Chief Minister Wigneswaran, who is not shy of defending the LTTE, has a huge following among the Tamil youth voters in the North compared to the likes of the Sambanthans and Sumanthirans amply demonstrates this reality. Vijayakala too has no alternative but to follow a similar line, if she ever hopes to enter parliament again as an elected representative of the Tamils.
The whole scenario bears resemblance to the JVP. Like Prabhakaran, Rohana Wijeweera too was a mass murderer and the difference lay only in the numbers killed. However, the late JVP leader is still deified in certain quarters and the rathu sahodharayas religiously commemorate their leader, each year, on the day of his demise, like they do Prabhakaran. It is irrelevant here whether Prabhakaran was the greater monster, for wanting to divide the country, while Wijeweera, on the other hand, waged a class struggle. Militant sentiments tend to stay ingrained even though the movements may have been destroyed.
Both, the Joint Opposition and UNP have taken exception to this remark on the grounds that the utterance was against the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, to which an MP swears by to renounce separatism. The Speaker gave an undertaking that he would go through the speech and action taken, if warranted, when the JO MPs raised a ruckus in parliament.
The JO has clearly seized on the situation to draw a red herring to shift public attention away from the New York Times story detailing how Mahinda Rajapaksa received US $ 7.6 million from China for his election campaign. There is no other reason to overreact the way JO did in parliament when its MPs invaded the Well of the House and cast ugly remarks at the Speaker, even when latter assured them he would deal with the matter in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Attorney General. Such conduct also was not without racist overtones that is sure to push the Northern Tamils towards further estrangement, and deal a blow to the current reconciliation efforts.
What was, after all, made was a statement, given the political context in the North, like what is happening in the South, where politicians play to the sentiments of the majority community to harvest votes. A noted lady film star MP in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, during the last presidential election campaign, held a media conference displaying a so called Eelam map to indicate that the country would be divided if MR lost the poll. That is the name of the game, be it in the North or the South. Communal politics is being resorted to by both sides, for better effect. Vijayakalas remark too should be treated in that vein. Hairsplitting on the constitutionality of the remark wont alter the fact.
Be that as it may, the Joint Opposition, especially Mahinda Rajapaksa, is least qualified to raise issue against Ms.Vijayakalas stand. The State Ministers remark was just that, a remark made in the heat of the moment. If this remark did cause such a stir, had the UNP did what Mahinda Rajapaksa did, there certainly would have been an upheaval of cataclysmic proportions.
JO MPs now making a big song and dance about a statement made by a female politician from the North should not blind themselves to the fact that it was their leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who, not only made Karuna Amman, one time LTTE Eastern Commander, a government minister, but also an office bearer of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
This, with the fully knowledge that he (Karuna) ordered the slaughter of 600 policemen in cold blood, the bombing of the citadel of Buddhism, the Sri Dalada Maligawa, in Kandy, and machine gunning of dozens of novice monks in Arantalawa.
Besides, it has been the proud boast of Mahinda Rajapaksa that he totally eliminated the LTTE, leaving no room for its resurgence. This was the constant refrain during the last Presidential Election campaign. Why then has the JO got so worked up about Ms.Vijayakalas remark Was Rajapaksa not entirely truthful when he declared he had completely wiped out the LTTE

State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheshwaran decided to temporarily resign from her post until investigations on the statement she made in support to the terrorist organization, LTTE are closed.
She said this at a special statement which was broadcasted on national television, this morning.
A huge outcry was raised in Parliament this week on the statement Vijayakala Maheshwaran made regarding re-establishing the LTTE at a gathering held in Jaffna.
Furthermore, she said that she accepts that it was unlawful of her to make such a statement since its against the terms of her appointment as the State Minister of Child Affairs.
She also mentioned that discussions are still underway with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to determine a way to resolve this matter.

From crisis to sustenance
well-planned and effective  product positioning strategy  can beat out competition
Your product positioning strategy is one of the most important marketing initiatives you will grapple with when introducing or re-branding goods and services. What exactly is product positioning
Positioning a companys product or service is simply defining who you are in the customers mind. Marketers attempt to create an image or identity for a product, brand or company and usually express positioning relative to other competitors in the market. For example, the position of a low-price paper towel is expressed relative to the higher-priced brands.
When positioning a product or service, the key is to decide what the sustainable competitive advantage of the product is against its chief competition. If a product has a sustainable advantage, meaning that the product has some unique offering competitors do not have and that it can hold long term, the product will have a better chance of success.
For example, a glass cleaner made of environmentally friendly and patented ingredients might have a sustainable advantage over competitors providing those competitors do not develop their own eco-friendly products.
Decay
However, as painful and challenging as it can be for a business to build a competitive advantage - that advantage is often fleeting. External change such as competition, markets, business models, environment, customer preferences and technology deprecate your competitive advantage with time. In business, what works today wont work tomorrow.
Another reason that competitive advantage decays is that firms tend to copy each other. If you develop a successful product, it will quickly be mimicked. If you develop a effective marketing technique it will be copied.
Sustainable competitive advantage is something you do better than any other firm thats not likely to decay.Sustainable competitive advantage is a lasting ability to outperform all competition in a particular area or industry.
Your assets
As elusive as sustainable competitive advantage is, its easy to think of examples.
1. People
The knowledge and abilities of your people is the source of most competitive advantage.This applies to organizations big and small. Your people are typically your greatest competitive asset. Products come and go - a team that can repeatedly design products that wow your customers is sustainable.
2. Culture
Sustainable competitive advantage is all about your ability to innovate and change. You may have a highly talented team. However, if they dont work together towards a common mission thats unlikely to translate to a sustainable competitive advantage. Your culture is the way your team works together to focus their energies towards common goals.
3. Processes
If you can manufacture shiny-blue-widgets faster and cheaper than anyone else  this may represent a sustainable competitive advantage. Superior processes can be difficult for your competitors to emulate.
Some firms have good relationships with customers that continue decade after decade. Other firms have combative relationships with customer that continue until the firm goes bankrupt.
4. Technology
Firms weave together technologies to support innovation, production, processes and customer relationships. In large firms, these technologies stacks become extremely complex.
Firms that effectively architect and govern technology may enjoy a significant competitive advantage over firms that struggle to develop technology capabilities and efficiencies.
5. Capital
Capital investments can represent a sustainable competitive if you own unique capital that no one else can buy.
On a less grand scale, retail or hotel locations can represent sustainable competitive advantages. If you buy land next to the most popular beach on an island - you may be able to consistently outperform hotels located near less attractive beaches
Business change isnt always predictable. However, once in a while a giant trend comes along that makes or breaks everyone. If you have sustainability competitive advantage, you can put on a fight.
Positioning characteristics
To be successful, product positioning must achieve three objectives:
1. Differentiate your product from the competitions;
2. Address important customer buying criteria;
3. Articulate key product (or company) characteristics
During the process of generating product positioning strategies, marketers review each one against the certain characteristics.
Does it convey one primary message at a time Will it connect with the target audience Does it contrast your strengths against the competition Is it pertinent and significant to the target audience Will it resonate with the target audience well into the future Will it ring true with the target audience Can you clearly substantiate your claims
The process of product positioning will be based on the results of the answers the marketer gets.
Strategies
Let us now discuss a few of the established product positioning strategies.
 Against a Competitor: Positioning your product directly against a competitor typically requires a specific product superiority claim. Avis tried unsuccessfully for years to wincustomers, pretending that the number one Hertz did not exist. Finally, it began using the line, Avis in only No. 2 in rent-a-car agency; so why go with us We try harder After launching the campaign, Avis quickly became profitable. Consumers finally were able to relate Avis to Hertz, which was number one in their minds.
 Away from a Competitor: Positioning yourself as the opposite of your competitor can help you get attention in a market dominated by some other product. Coca-Cola historically focused on nostalgia for childhood and characterized as family-friendly, and often relies on cute characters (e.g. Polar bear mascot and Santa Claus). Pepsi adverts often focused on celebrities choosing Pepsi over Coca-Cola, supporting Pepsis positioning as The Choice of a New Generation.
 Benefits: This strategy focuses on a benefit your product provides to your target audience. In the toothpaste trade, Close-up emphasis on breath ability to give long-lasting fresh breath and Sensodyne targeted at cavity ability to prevent tooth decay.
 Product Attributes: Highlighting a specific attribute of your product can also be compelling. For example, Singapore Airlines focus on luxury; Mihin Air focuses on economy.
 Product Categories: Comparing your product to a product in a different category can be an effective way to differentiate yourself. In a soap-compares-itself-to-lotion example, Lux liquid soap claims that it moisturizes and softens your skin hands while you use it.
 Usage Occasions: This kind of positioning stresses when or how your product is used by your target audience. Mitsubishi Monteros focus on off-road driving is an excellent example.
Approaches
Marketers follow two main approaches to positioning a new product in the market;
Physical Positioning
Physical positioning focuses on physical properties of a product. Some cellphone manufacturers market their products based on the phones thin and water-proof design. The physical properties of the product are used to create a message and appeal to a target market, as well as keep the product fresh in the consumers mind.
PerceptualPositioning
Perceptual positioning focuses more on ideas and concepts of a product. A company might list the features of a new computer or provide examples of how the new computer can improve your life while positioning the product. Similarly, companies that do not offer a tangible product, such as a law firm, might use perceptual positioning to market their services to people in need of lawyers. They might offer low fees or the best success rate in the area and use those messages to position their firm.
The major difference between physical and perceptual positioning is the strategy behind the messages used to market a product. Some people are more attracted to a products physical appeal, while others are more attracted to features and concepts. Other differences include how the message is designed. Physical positioning typically includes more graphical advertisements to show off physical attributes, while perceptual positioning might include more text or voice-over dialog explaining how a product can improve a consumers life.Some products can use both approaches. Technology products, such as new phones or computers, can appeal to consumers both in their appearance and technical capabilities.
Positioning is makingchoices
Establishing a position is a process of both inclusion and exclusion. Mont Blanc serves as an easy example. Its positioning includes people for whom a pen is a fashion and a status symbol, probably more than it is a writing instrument. It excludes people, even affluent people, who dont want to pay Rs.100, 000or more for a pen.
Positioning, in other words, is sacrificing some portion of the marketplace so that you can focus on the marketplaces of most value to you - and bring clarity of message to those markets.
Sacrifice is difficult. Its financially difficult and emotionally difficult, especially for those whose baby the product is. The notion of leaving money on the table is terrifying. The notion of telling someone, This product that I love isnt for you is even more so. But it has to be done.
Market size
A conceptlike positioning typically arise in the large rather than in the small business context. The underlying concepts apply to both, but access to the mass market requires substantially more preparation. The preparation of major product introductions and related packaging design, promotional and advertising campaigns, incentives for the supply channel, etc. can be very costly. Money can be wasted unless careful planning comes quite early.
Market segmentation, an early step in the positioning of products, is intended both to limit the costs of sales and marketing and also to channel the money to the most cost-effective points in the communications network. Related market research, distinct from segmentation, is often used to set price points, identify competitive aspects of the product, etc.
Probably the biggest difference between mass marketers and small businesses is that in most small businesses the positioning of products is based on the opinions of the business owner, and selected managers and customers.

West Indies dismiss Bangladesh for record low of 43
Antigua and Barbuda, Wednesday: Kemar Roach took five wickets as West Indies demolished Bangladesh for 43, their lowest Test total, on the opening morning of the first Test in Antigua on Wednesday.
At lunch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, West Indies had reached nine without loss.
Bangladeshs pitiful performance was also the second shortest first innings in the 141-year history ot Test cricket. At 18.4 overs, it was just one ball longer than Australias dismissal for 60 off 18.3 overs by England at Nottingham in 2015.
Put in to bat on the greenest surface seen in the ten years of Test cricket at the venue, the Bangladeshis were no match for the quality of the West Indies fast bowling.
Roach set the rout in motion by claiming the first five wickets for eight runs in just five overs despite appearing to be troubled by a muscular strain behind his right knee.
However, it was the visiting batsmen who felt the greatest discomfort with only opener Liton Das reaching double-figures in a performance that once again exposed the vulnerability of their players in conditions away from what they are generally familiar with on the Indian sub-continent.
Das was sixth out for 25, an ugly heave offering a simple catch to Roston Chase at backward point off Miguel Cummins to end any prospect of Roach claiming all ten wickets in the innings. Cummins, whose place in the final eleven was in question after a lack of success in the preceding three-Test series against Sri Lanka, took two more wickets.
West Indies captain Jason Holder, fresh from a nine-wicket haul in defeat in the final Test against the Sri Lankans in Barbados, polished off the innings with the wickets of Kamrul Islam and debutant Abu Jayed.
Jayed was always in line for his maiden Test cap given the pitch conditions and the absence through injury from the tour of Bangladeshs most effective seamer Mustafizur Rahman.
In his very first session of Test cricket, he came to the crease as the last man in the batting line-up and had first to use the new ball in the West Indies reply.
If they were relying on their most senior players to lead them through what was expected to be a tough opening session, Bangladesh were poorly served by the experienced quartet as captain Shakib al Hassan, former skipper Musfiqur Rahim and all-rounder Mahmudullah all failed to score while opener Tamim Iqbal contributed four runs before becoming the first wicket to fall, caught at the wicket, to trigger the swift tumbling of wickets.

World Cup big guns primed for last-eight battles
MOSCOW, Wednesday - England became the last team to qualify for the World Cup quarter-finals after a dramatic penalty shootout as favourites Brazil and fancied France trained their sights on their last-eight opponents.
Englands victory against Colombia takes Gareth Southgates team into what looks like a winnable match against Sweden, who edged out Switzerland 1-0 earlier on Tuesday.
Both teams are in the bottom half of the draw in Russia, along with the host nation and Croatia, with England the only former winners of the four teams.
The top half contains more heavyweights, with 1998 champions France taking on two-time winners Uruguay and Brazil set to face Belgium.
Eric Diers spot-kick gave England their first-ever win on penalties at a World Cup at the fourth attempt -- ending the jinx that has dogged them for so long. But Southgate said he was already looking forward to Saturdays quarter-final against Sweden in Samara, with a last-four clash against either Croatia or Russia up for grabs.
This was special but I want us to go on, Southgate, whose penalty miss saw England lose to Germany in the Euro 96 semi-finals at Wembley, said.
Sweden is another team we have a poor record against. We have underestimated them for years. They have created their own story and made history. I dont want to go home yet.
Janne Anderssons Sweden have recovered well from a heartbreaking group-stage defeat by Germany, seeing off Mexico before edging out Switzerland 1-0 in the last 16.
RB Leipzig midfielder Emil Forsberg grabbed the only goal of a tight encounter midway through the second half to send his country into the quarters for the first time since the 1994 side who finished third in the United States.
NEYMAR IN THE SPOTLIGHT
For all the drama around England, the winner of the tournament is more likely to come from the top half of the draw, where the teams can boast a combined eight tournament wins.
Favourites Brazil will come up against Belgiums golden generation in Kazan on Friday while an exciting young France side spearheaded by Kylian Mbappe take on a shrewd Uruguay outfit in Nizhny Novgorod.
Much of the focus surrounding Brazils bid for a record-extending sixth world title has inevitably been on Neymar.
But the worlds most expensive player has hit the headlines as much for his perceived play-acting as for the on-pitch performances that have helped his side ease into the last eight without ever being seriously troubled.
Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio said the stoppages caused by Neymars antics stalled his team during their 2-0 last-16 loss to Brazil, claiming the Paris Saint-Germain forwards reaction to Miguel Layun stepping on his leg was a shame for football.
Belgium were on the brink of another major tournament failure when trailing 2-0 with 21 minutes to play, only for a magnificent breakway goal by Nacer Chadli in the fourth minute of injury-time to cap a stunning fightback. Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku, Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne are likely to give Brazils defence the biggest test of their campaign so far, although the South Americans have only conceded once in four matches.
This is the sort of game you dream about as a little boy and we can enjoy it from the first second, said Belgium coach Roberto Martinez.
France never got out of first gear in easing through the group stage, but turned on the style as Mbappe dazzled in a classic 4-3 victory over Argentina to set up the clash with Uruguay.
We have been preparing for months, for weeks to play matches like that, said France coach Didier Deschamps.
Uruguays success has been built on a solid defence led by Atletico Madrid pair Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin, with the old-fashioned strike partnership of Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani doing the damage at the other end with five goals between them.
No South American side have won on European soil since a Pele-inspired Brazil 60 years ago, but in a World Cup of shocks and surprises, nothing can be taken for granted.  AFP

English Impact Survey, vital
The British Council recently announced the findings of its English Impact Survey  an evaluation of English Language capabilities amongst students in schools across Sri Lanka. At the presentation, invitees were given access to statistics as well as to conclusions drawn from the report which was conducted for the first time, and on a global scale.
An independent research project in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the British Council evaluated nearly 1,500 students from Grade 11 across a targeted sample of 148 government-funded schools over a period of a year.
Students were primarily assessed for their reading, writing, listening and speaking skills, through the administration of the British Councils APTIS language test  an internationally employed English proficiency assessment formulated by British Council language testing experts.
The Aptis assessment is a computer delivered test (using tabs in this instant), that was used across Sri Lanka for this study. Aptis is a scalable, flexible and a reliable English assessment tool used worldwide that can be used for a variety of proficiency testing requirements in government, education or corporate contexts, with results delivered within 48 hrs, said Simon Creasey, Country Exams Manager, British Council. Participants were additionally asked to answer a questionnaire -delivered in Sinhalese and Tamil- pertaining to their socio-economic and educational backgrounds as well as their motivations for acquiring a proficiency in the English language
Commenting on the results at the launch of the report, Louise Cowcher, Director of Education at the British Council in Sri Lanka, said The results of the English Impact Survey is vital; not just in providing us with fresh insight on the quality of English language education in schools, but also with important evidence on the general perception of the language and its importance. This provides us with crucial information that will prove instrumental in driving improvements to the current system of learning English in Sri Lanka.
Key findings highlighted in the 2016/2017 report were:
Female students outperformed their male counterparts in all assessments. Of the two, female participants were also found to have greater confidence in their ability to learn the language and were also more strongly motivated to learn. Of the four language skills, listening scored the highest while participants were proven to find reading and speaking the most challenging.
There is a distinct co-relation between socio-economic status and English language learning motivation. Students from more advantaged backgrounds were found to be greater inclined to study the language than those from less advantaged families.
Young people hold very positive views of the English language, and understand its importance for their personal, social, professional growth.
Additionally, the survey is a reflection of the MoEs commitment to reviewing and enhancing the curricula and learning methods of the English language as part of the education reform process; for a lack of, or poor proficiency in English language skills can negatively affect a young persons ability to get a job, and on a national scale will greatly hold back economic prosperity when competing for business on a global stage.
The British Council is well-established as the primary provider of quality English education and resources in Sri Lanka, and is committed to working with relevant public, private, non-profit, and non-governmental organisations to produce a portfolio of impactful projects such as this English Impact Survey.

Gamifying Ahead Through  Enterprise Solutions Landscape
Gartner, Inc. projects worldwide IT spending to total $3.7 trillion in 2018 and notes that enterprise software continues to exhibit robust growth, thanks to the rise in the number of businesses actively investing in digital technologies to enhance their products and services. This is great news for markets like Sri Lanka that have identified ICT / BPM as a thrust sector for economic development.
However, enterprise engagements arent based on cost arbitrage alone, anymore. On-demand, real-time service delivery is becoming the norm across sectors and millennial consumers are seeking similar experiences in every interaction.
As they begin to dominate the workplace and the marketplace, businesses are looking to entice them through gamified engagement efforts.
In the digital realm, the task of shaping these engagement platforms falls on solution developers. They need to comprehend and account for the lifestyle choices of millennial end-users before embarking on any digital transformation project. Often, they tend to draw from their weekend gaming experiences to relate to how and why these Gen Yers do what they do.
A group of 15 young software engineers going by the name Virtusa Game Development Special Interest Group (GDSIG) have been involved in similar endeavors at Virtusas Advanced Technology Center in Colombo since 2006. It was initially envisaged as an informal platform that would allow them to challenge like-minded colleagues in friendly bouts of gaming while exchanging views on the subject.
Ramesh Maddegoda, architect  Technology at Virtusa was among the small group which founded the Virtusa GDSIG. At that time video gaming was not a popular idea in the Sri Lankan corporate world. So Ramesh and the team had to come up with creative ways to promote the positive aspects of video game development and drive this initiative.
Our shared passion for gaming brought us together, says Ramesh. In our discussions, we identified that there was an opportunity for Sri Lanka to tap into the game development industry. The soaring revenues generated by the big names in gaming, with some titles grossing as much as Hollywood blockbusters, caught our attention. Armed with basic game development skills, we sought to bring some of this work to Sri Lankan shores, he said.
The starry-eyed team got their first break in the form of an interactive storybook development project for a global education solutions provider. And they havent looked back since then.
Today, the unit includes Virtusans from different functions, practices and even geographies. They work closely with teams from around Virtusa on a diverse set of enterprise engagements wherein clients are looking to create game like interactive experiences.
We are currently exploring the potential of using augmented reality tags to provide information on off-the-shelf medication for pharmacists and patients, said Ramindu Deshapriya, senior consultant  Technology.
Elaborating on this project for a Fortune 500 healthcare services company, Ramindu said, Augmented reality overlay on a mobile app would provide a way for users to view the details regarding a particular medicine right at the drug store.
Chipping in about their work in promoting medication adherence, Thuan Preena, engineer  Technology at Virtusa said, Aging populations bring with them the challenges associated with caring for the elderly, especially those with medical conditions that require them to take medications regularly.
We developed an IoT based solution that rewards users with points when they take their medicines on time and allowed them to use these points to contribute to a charity of their choice. And we were delighted to see a marked improvement in medication adherence, Thuan added.
While these might seem like the obvious routes anyone should and would take in hindsight, we wouldnt have been able to come up with such ideas had we adopted a traditional approach to solution development, said Kavinda Karunanayake, senior consultant  Technology at Virtusa.
We had the opportunity to experience the power of gamified work environments first hand thanks to V+, our proprietary internal social business platform that helps drive collaboration and engagement amongst Virtusans. Our interactions with and through V+ guided us to take the gamification path.
We also had the privilege of being mentored by members of our leadership team who continue to inspire us, he added.
Scaling greater heights with their gamified approach to enterprise solution development, Virtusas Game Development Special Interest Group presents a strong business case for reimagining our digital worlds through gamification. While they continue to contribute to business projects, it is not all work and no play for the GDSIG.
As avid gamers they have been organizing the Virtusa LAN Challenge, a gaming contest for their fellow Virtusans, since 2010. It started off as a low key internal team building initiative and has now grown into a mainstay event in Virtusas calendar with teams from several leading local universities taking part in this years tournament.
The GDSIG team works together with the companys technology leadership and members of the Virtusa Campus Reach Initiative on this annual event.
They also seek to instill their passion for gaming and game development in the next generation of IT professionals.
Partnering with the Virtusa Campus Reach Initiative, team members can often be found delivering tech talks at universities around the island where they share insights on game development, opportunities available and more.

SL - China ties strong despite New York Times allegations
Diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and China are strong despite various allegations levelled against them in the New York Times article on the Hambantota Port, said Co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne, yesterday.
Answering questions on whether diplomatic ties have been strained between the government and China due to the article, Minister Senaratne insisted that allegations of bribery were against a Chinese company and not against the Chinese government.
The New York Times article had alleged that China Harbour Engineering Company had paid USD 7.6 million to fund former President Mahinda Rajapaksas 2014 Presidential campaign. The article also alleged that through their support of the former President and the granting of loans on high interest rates, the Chinese company had forced the Sri Lankan government into giving them the Hambantota Port.
The minister, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Parliament complex, said government MPs too should refrain from criticising the Chinese government.
In 2015, the CID started investigations into the dealings between the Chinese company and the former President but the minister said he did not know the current status of those investigations. He, however, stated that there were 16 active investigations against Rajapaksa. Three had been filed in court and Rajapaksa had appealed against them. The rest are yet to be filed in court.
The Prime Minister, meanwhile, informed Parliament yesterday that the CID would begin investigations into the complaint made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with evidence based on the New York Times article.

Action against Vijayakala after her explanation - PM
There is no need at all to revive the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorist organization, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, referring to State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwarans statement, yesterday said.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said that necessary steps will be taken against Maheshwaran after she gives an explanation to the government with regards to the matter. Premier Wickremesinghe made these observations establishing the UNPs stance on the controversial statement made by Maheshwaran.
He also said that the Speaker of the House has already taken steps to conduct an inquiry with regards to the matter.
The Prime Minister also said that the government looked into the controversial statement made by Maheshwaran as soon as they were informed about it.
Our political committee met immediately and discussed the matter. Maheshwaran will be given an opportunity to explain herself. Necessary steps will follow her explanation, the Prime Minister also said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that people and the military secured the country with their lives. Many leaders of UNP, SLFP, and Tamil parties were killed during the time of war. The Parliament also came under attack.
We will always secure the sovereignty of this country. The LTTE is already banned. There is no need of reviving it. We are still to reach a political solution agreed upon by all communities in the country. The government under the headship of President Maithripala Sirisena is presently carrying out the land releasing process. Development is compulsory for the North and East, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Referring to the commotion made by the Joint Opposition MPs in Parliament on Tuesday, Premier Wickremesinghe said that strict action should be taken against their behavior. He also suggested that the JO made such a commotion to cover up the revelations made by the New York Times recent article on the Hambantota port.
These are the very persons who gave a party president portfolio to an ex-LTTE head Karuna Amman who has killed over 600 police officers. These are the same people who bribed LTTE leader Prabhakaran to win an election. These are the very people who sent the Army Commander who won the war to prison. What right have they got to make such a big fuss about this when they have acted in such a manner, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said.
Meanwhile,in reply to a question raised by MP Douglas Devananda, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said a Development Authority for the Northern Province was established last month. According to the Prime Minister, this institute is under the purview of the Prime Ministers Office. The relevant officers have also been appointed to the institute, he added. The Premier pointed out that development is a crucial component for the Northern and Eastern Provinces. He also said that the government will soon solve the issues pertaining to graduate scheme recruitment.

Annual tobacco, cigarette consumption surpasses milk powder import cost, GSP Plus export revenue

Expenditure incurred on Sri Lankans tobacco and cigarette consumption surpasses the annual cost for milk powder imports and relatively, the annual export revenue from EU GSP Plus, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
The Minister said this while addressing an event themed Farmer Perspectives on Proposed Tobacco Growing Ban and Opportunity to Diversify, held in Colombo recently.
He said, 'Reports say that Sri Lankan consumers spend more than Rs 200 million per day for cigarettes. According to the World Health organization in 2015 the direct and indirect cost of tobacco use in Sri Lanka was estimated at Rs.89 billion or US$ 662 million'
'In that, we annually spend more than $ 660 million for tobacco use and resulting expenses. When we compare this $ 660 million with some other important values we can understand the huge cost for the economy from tobacco use', he said.
Elaborating on studys made on tobacco and cigarette expenditure the Minister said, For example, we spend US$ 400 million a year to import milk powder to be used by our households and hotels. The $660 million we spend for tobacco use is 55% higher than our annual bill for the milk powder imports.
Furthermore, the Minister said, The other example is that Sri Lankas annual expenditure on tobacco use is even higher than the additional export income from EU GSP plus which is around $480 million. In that, our annual tobacco and cigarette expenditure is 37% higher than our annual GSP Plus income alone.
Another example is that this annual tobacco cost is equal to total flood and landslide damages incurred by Sri Lanka in both 2015 and 2016 he said. These simple examples show the huge cost to our economy from tobacco use.
The Minister said, by taking these studies into account, that the government is making attempts to switch the tobacco economy to a more productive livelihood stream with alternate, export driven crops.
As for tobacco production it is reported that more than3300 metric tonnes of tobacco are produced in Sri Lanka. When it comes to cultivation only a very small percentage of lands are used at 0.07 percent of all agricultural lands only taken by tobacco.
Tobacco expert panel indicated that Tobacco is considered as an Industrial Crop, more than a commercial crop and since the bulk of the harvest is used for nicotine products, it immediately ends up in industrial/machine processing, unlike many other commercial crops.
Among all types of full time farmers in Sri Lanka, tobacco farmers are one of the most profitable, earning regular margins of 20% or higher.
The ban on tobacco cultivation in Sri Lanka is scheduled to start from 2020. Importation of cigarettes and tobacco also will be banned from 2020, the Minister said.

## Title: Asia needs a voice at OPEC

Asia needs a voice at OPEC
The drop in oil prices that has followed the weekend OPEC meeting in Vienna is clearly good news for consumers in Asia, the largest and fastest-growing market.
After weeks of argument, the oil-producing countries agreed to increase output by up to 1 million barrels a day in an effort to cool a rally that has seen prices surge to their highest levels since 2014.
OPEC acted after widespread public debate about the price rises, with U.S. President Donald Trump himself intervening in the argument to lambast OPEC in two tweets that generated considerable attention.
But in all the discussion, the big Asian oil-importing countries that have such a significant presence in market failed -- not for the first time -- to make their voices heard. It is high time that China, India, Japan and South Korea, which together account for around 23% of global oil demand, play a more substantial role in the OPEC policy debate. Only Indias Oil Minister, Dharmendra Pradhan, was in Vienna last week -- the lone voice of a major Asian consumer. None of the other three countries deemed it necessary to have a high-level representative in Vienna. While neither the U.S. nor big European countries sent ministers, it is not the West that needs to enhance its say. It is the Asian consumer nations.
Gasoline consumption
Khalid al Falih, Saudi Arabias Energy Minister, said on Sunday that an additional 1 million barrels a day would make their way around the world, with several hundred thousand barrels coming from the kingdom alone.
The Saudis presumably felt necessary to act when lobbied by Washington a few weeks ago to increase supply and cool down oil prices. Trump may be concerned by U.S. gasoline prices approaching a three-year high of $3 a gallon as the country enters its peak summer driving demand season. However, U.S. gasoline consumption remains robust amid strong economic growth and job market.
Emerging economies around the world, in contrast, are paying far more dearly for high oil prices. Rising domestic fuel consumption is necessitating rising imports of crude for most, causing a bigger drain of foreign exchange.
Asia was a relatively small consumer of oil compared with the U.S. and Europe until the turn of the century. The U.S., for long the worlds largest oil consumer and dependent on growing imports from OPEC until its shale boom, historically exerted its influence in the Middle East and has continued to flex its muscle with OPEC when it deemed prices to be too high. Asian governments now have the clout of being a more important market for OPEC, but have yet to learn to assert themselves with the producers organization.
OPEC is independent in how it makes its decisions. But it does not operate in a vacuum. Far from it. The fact that at least five of the major U.S. independent shale producers CEOs were invited to present their views to the ministers in Vienna (though only two were able to attend) is OPECs acknowledgement of the web of interdependencies between different parts of the oil ecosystem. Demand is half of the equation the producers group is trying to balance.
Emerging market economy
It is time major oil-consuming countries established a formal forum for communicating with OPEC and major non-OPEC producer countries: an Organization of the Petroleum Importing Countries, or OPIC. The major emerging market economies of China and India should lead the charge. OPIC could also provide a platform to the relatively smaller but fast-growing oil consuming countries in Southeast Asia. In addition to regular and routine coordination, a producer-consumer dialogue before any meeting on production policy is critical to ensuring that OPEC hears its customers points of view before making any decision.
Iran, Venezuela, Algeria and Libya have traditionally been the price hawks in OPECs history. But now, two and a half years of economic hardship due to persistently weak oil prices between 2014 and 2016, followed by relief and recovery as crude regained its strength, appear to have turned more producers in the organization hawkish. They would rather see crude spiking toward $80 a barrel again than risk it slipping below $60 -- a level they would have welcomed just two years ago.

Being  Sanju
Ranbir Kapoor was only 10 years old when he saw his first reel icon, Sanjay Dutt, in real life.
Accompanying his father, Rishi Kapoor, to the shoot of Sahibaan in Kashmir in 1992, the young Kapoor was mesmerised by the sight of the actor whose poster he had on his cupboard to rival that of his sisters favourite, Salman Khan.
He had the Saajan look, recalls Kapoor, long hair, an earring. He was chilling between shots, smoking a cigarette and walking with style.
The young Ranbir thought Dutt was super cool, way cooler than his own dad.
With such a fond memory, one would think that Kapoor would be eager to play his idol on the big screen. Instead, he admits, there was reluctance and self-doubt.
The responsibility to play a person who is still relevant was very daunting, says Kapoor, 35, who will later feature alongside Dutt in the period action Shamshera which begins shooting in December.
If its a dead or historical character, a few liberties can be taken.The Rajkumar Hirani-Abhijat Joshi script was a selling point, presenting a leading man with vices, weaknesses and self-inflicted adversities.
His life was a screenplay sent from heaven, says Kapoor.
I dont think I could be that honest to a filmmaker. It takes a lot of confidence to show that you have made mistakes.

We have always been happy to be a part of activities promoting Sri Lanka as an adventure tourism destination, and Around the Pearl takes it further by also being a worthy cause. he said.

British PM May admits to World Cup penalty nerves
LONDON, Wednesday - Englands World Cup penalty shootout win against Colombia proved to be almost as nerve-wracking for British Prime Minister Theresa May as for Gareth Southgates players in Russia.
The 61-year-old watched some of Tuesdays last-16 match that took place in Moscow, a spokesman said, without specifying which part exactly.
England looked on course for relatively serene progress to the quarter-finals for the first time since the 2006 World Cup before they conceded a goal in injury time.
Neither team were able to break the deadlock in extra time so the game went to penalties.
England stumbled first, with Jordan Hendersons spot-kick saved by Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina.
But Mateus Uribe rattled the crossbar and England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved from Carlos Bacca before Eric Dier tucked away the decisive spot-kick to complete a 4-3 win.
She did see some of (the match), said a Downing Street spokesman. She actually said earlier, she struggles to watch penalties because its a nerve-wracking time.
May appeared buoyed by the teams victory at Prime Ministers Questions in the House of Commons.
The country witnessed a very rare and welcome event last night -- the England football team winning a penalty shootout, she said.
I think the explosion of relief and most of all joy could be felt up and down the country. I want to congratulate Gareth Southgate and his team on a great performance.
May said she was delighted Englands St Georges Cross flag would still fly over Downing Street on Saturday for the match against Sweden.
She had announced previously that the flag would fly over her official residence on days on which England played.
Last week, I promised to fly the flag of St George above Number 10 for all of Englands remaining matches in the World Cup and I know the whole House will want to join me in wishing the England team the best of luck in Saturdays quarter-final, she said.
Lets keep that flag flying.  AFP

Cabinet nod for national Womens Wellbeing survey
A national survey on Womens Wellbeing would begin in October, this year, in a bid to quantify the status of women in the country.
Cabinet approval for the above proposal was received this week. The Cabinet paper, submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, said the Department of Census and Statistics, together with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), would conduct the survey. The UNFPA Ninth Country Programme Action Plan 2018-2022 (CPAP 2018-2022), which would also fund the programme, had agreed to provide a grant of Rs 26,978,109 for the survey. The survey report would be published in June, 2019.
The Cabinet paper on the subject explained that groups of women over 15 years of age would be interviewed around the country for the survey. The Prime Minister, in his Cabinet paper, pointed out that for years, both the government as well as NGOs had undertaken several programmes to empower women, but there had been no official statistics to ascertain whether the programmes had worked or not.
Further, given the downward trend in the labour force participation of women, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe believed that the unofficial statistics on various physical and mental harm such as gender-based violence and domestic violence, had a bearing on the low labour force participation rates. This has paved the way to realise the importance of official statistics on real life situations in society, the Cabinet paper said.
