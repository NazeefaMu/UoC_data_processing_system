Pakistan asks Facebook to help fight blasphemy

Pakistan says it has asked Facebook to help investigate "blasphemous content" posted on the social network by Pakistanis.
Facebook has agreed to send a team to Pakistan to address reservations about content on the social media site, according to the interior ministry.
Blasphemy is a highly sensitive and incendiary issue in Pakistan.
Critics say blasphemy laws, which allow the death penalty in some cases, are often misused to oppress minorities.
Earlier this week Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif voiced his support for a wide-ranging crackdown on blasphemous content on social media.
In a statement on his party's official Twitter account, he described blasphemy as an "unpardonable offence".
'Should share information'
Then on Thursday, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar reasserted Pakistan's determination to tackle the issue, saying he would take "any steps necessary" to make sure Pakistan's message got across.
He said he had asked officials to liaise with the FBI in the US and with social media platforms on a daily basis.
"Facebook and other service providers should share all information about the people behind this blasphemous content with us," he is quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.
There has been little official description of what blasphemous content has been found online so far, but in the past blasphemy accusations have ranged from depictions of the Prophet Muhammad to critiques and inappropriate references to the Koran.
But some critics say that this latest move is simply a way of cracking down on dissent.

Saudi king postpones visit to the Maldives over swine flu

The Maldives government said Friday that Saudi Arabias king has postponed an official visit because of the spread of swine flu in the archipelago nation.
King Salman was scheduled to visit the Maldives on Saturday. The presidents office quoted Foreign Minister Mohamed Asim as saying that a new date will be decided later.
According to health ministry statistics, 105 people have tested positive for the H1N1 virus, or swine flu, since January and two have died in the small country of 340,000 people.
Schools and the state university have been closed to control the spread of the disease.
The 81-year-old king is making a month long swing through Asia. Accompanied by a 1,500-strong retinue of businessmen, princes and support staff in close to a dozen aircraft, he has already visited Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and China.
Opposition parties in the Maldives had planned protests during Salmans visit against what they said was a government plan to sell 21 tiny islands to a member of the Saudi royal family.
