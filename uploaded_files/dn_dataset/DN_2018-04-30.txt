29 killed in twin Afghanistan blasts

Eight journalists were among 29 people killed in a suicide attack in Kabul Monday, including a famed photographer who had written of the dangers of reporting in the Afghan capital.
The journalists died when a bomber disguised as a TV cameraman detonated a second bomb at the site of an earlier explosion. Both attacks were claimed by Islamic State.

The first blast happened at around at 8 a.m. local time in the Shashdarak area of the city, where the US embassy and Afghan government buildings are located, prompting journalists to rush to the scene.

The second explosion came as the attacker, posing as a cameraman, detonated explosives as journalists huddled around the scene, Kabul City Police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said.

In a statement issued via the social media app Telegram, ISIS said a "martyrdom brother" blew his explosive vest up among a group of "apostates" and killed and wounded a number of them. The group named the bomber as Qaqaa al-Kurdi and the second attacker as Khalil al-Qurshi. ISIS did not provide any evidence for the claim.

Buddhas teachings resolve all problems: President
Gauthama Buddha's message amply gives us solutions to all existing problems. Therefore, I will implement the policies of the Government according to the guidance of the Maha Sangha," President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He was speaking at the State Vesak Festival-2018 held at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya in the Kurunegala District yesterday (28).
The President said that as pointed out by the Deputy Prelate of Malwatta Chapter today, he would implement the recommendations of the Buddhist Commissions appointed by the previous Executive Presidents to establish a peaceful country based on the Buddhist Teachings.
"Unfortunately, our social media platforms highlight several existing problems in our country to show that they are only seen in Sri Lanka. But those are common almost in all other countries," the President said.
"Even for drinking, people have no water. People of some parts in India too suffer without water. We should have self-confidence to face and overcome the challenges come across on our way. During the past three and half years, I have been taking a number of steps to materialise the wishes of the Maha Sangha and the peace-loving people of this country and to establish a just and meaningful society for the citizens," the President said.
Malwatta Chapter Deputy Chief Prelate Most Ven. Niyangoda Vijithasiri Nayaka Thera recalling the State Vesak Festival-2017 held in Sri Lanka said many distinguished guests of foreign countries took part in the festival last year under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
"At that occasion, it was decided to propagate the Theravada Buddhism and the sacred Teachings of the Gauthama Buddha all over the world. The responsibility of the Chief Prelates, President and the Prime Minister is to rule the country by following the noble Buddhist Teachings," the Thera said.
The Thera said a lot of controversial ideologies were spreading now over the proposed new Constitution. "Several Chief Prelates have already expressed their views over that matter. A far-sighted decision has to be made by the present rulers whether a new constitution is needed. Very reasonable and independent legal judgments must be taken on those responsible for unfortunate incidents in the Digana areas, the Thera said.
Kelaniya University Chancellor and All Sri Lanka Saranarakshaka Mandalaya Chairman Most Ven. Dr. Welamitiya Kusumala Dhamma NayakeThera said the citizens should follow their religious teachings and the Buddhists in Sri Lanka should follow the Five Precepts properly.
"Students of Buddhist Dhamma schools should be taught to follow Buddhist principles. It is our duty to safeguard the land that was protected for us by our ancient kings, the Thera said.
Buddhasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said that many meaningful Buddhist programmes would be launched during this year to educate students and the youth on Buddhist teachings.
"Under the guidance of the Maha Sangha, I will implement a lot of Dhamma education programmes and meditation programmes this year to equip the people with positive attitudes, the Minister said.
NWP-PC Governor Cultural Minister S.B.Nawinna, Postal Services Minister M.H.A. Haleem, NWP-PC Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake, Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara, Buddha Sasana Ministry Secretary Chandrapema Gamage, and Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs Nimal Kotawalagedara were present.

Doyen of Sinhala cinema Dr. Lester James Peries passes away
Dr.Lester James Peries unarguably the father of Sri Lankan cinema and the legend who took the Sri Lankan cinema to the world stage, passed away at the age of 99 years yesterday. He passed away while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Colombo.
Starting his career as a young reporter at the age of 17, Lester wrote to the blue pages of the Ceylon Daily News which was an arts supplementation.
He attended St. Peters College- in Colombo- as a teenager, before dropping out to pursue a career in journalism at the age of 17 with the Daily News.
In 1947, Peries travelled to England on his mothers advice to join his brother Ivan Peries who was there on an art scholarship. However Lester continued writing to the Daily News from England.
Dr.Peries celebrated his 99th birthday on April 5 this year and both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited his residence in Thimbirigasyaya to extend their wishes.
Dr. Lester James Peries will be revered in Sri Lankan history on account of quality  rather than quantity  of his filmography.
Film by film, Dr Peries planted a fresh seed in the industry. Film by film, Dr. Peries introduced a new wavelength.
He did not deliver art. He delivered a whole generation. That whole generation did not think outside the box. They formed a box for the industry.
Rekhava, officially premiered in 1956 incidentally coinciding with the Bandaranaike revolution, broke the prevailing grounds. The film was shot out of the studio premises and was confined to Ceylon.
The dialogues were more natural. The storyline provoked more emotional nuances. Ultimately it went on to be the first feature-length film down the local cinema annals.
It gained entry into the Cannes Film Festival in 1957  an international honour denied for the films hitherto produced. Yet, this was not consummation. Dr Peries was still experimenting with the subject.
The second feature film, Sandeshaya, was one step ahead, handling a more intricate plot outline: history. That was 1960. Three years later, Peries took over a new trial: a film based on a novel.
Gamperaliya was a few steps ahead with Tissa Abeysekara (known for his natural dialogues, and a revered scriptwriter whose posthumous films continue to emerge), and Reggie Siriwardana entering the scene as writers to the screen.
That was a more groundbreaking work with a number of performers such as Tony Ranasinghe, Henry Jayasena and Trilicia Gunawardane later earning a brand name in their own right. It received a widely acclaimed appreciation from the critics such as Ediriweera Sarachchandra. Reviewed Professor Sarachchandra: At last a Sinhalese film has been made which we could show the world without having to hide our heads in shame. I want to say a great film has been made of a great novel.
Gamperaliya was followed by Delovak Athara, Ran Salu, Golu Hadawatha and Akkara Paha. These films show Dr.Peries knack as well as a fondness for making films based on fiction. Yet, in 1972, he entered a different plane with the next film, Nidhanaya, originally a short story by G B Senanayake. Dr Peries had the blessings of a powerful script by Dr.Tissa Abeysekara, powerful music by Dr Premasiri Khemadasa and an equally powerful, yet small, skill-studded cast.
Ammawarune, the hitherto final movie, made in 2006 cannot be called the culmination of the Lester James Peries filmography. It is the continuation of the culmination he has already attained in the late fifties through seventies.
He was the first filmmaker who led the Ceylonese cinema into an international platform. That acclaim made things easier for the subsequent Sri Lankan cinema. Film after film, Dr Peries offered lessons on how indigenousness could be employed in filmmaking.
Peries is married to, Sumitra, who is also a renowned film director.

PM promises further UNP reforms
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday promised further reforms to the United National Party (UNP) structure.
The UNP leader in a statement said a policy decision has been made to implement recommendations of the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee and also to amend the party constitution accordingly.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa would be given more responsibilities, while Subject Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries would also be appointed to further strengthen party reorganisation.
We intend to allocate new responsibilities to the Deputy Leader in order to further strengthen our journey to victory so as to drive the process of organising the party towards success. We hope to give more opportunities to young Members of Parliament to help drive forward the Partys mission, the Premier added.
The UNP leader also said that the party was aiming to give specific responsibilities to each of the Members of Parliament and with this in mind was developing an initial procedure to do this.
The Premier said many of the younger members of the team have been involved in driving the process of organising the UNP forward to enhance the day-to-day functions of the Party.
As such, a number of appointments have been made.
Among those who have come forward to take on responsibilities for the Party are Naveen Dissanayake who has been appointed as the National Organiser of the Party, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as General Secretary, Harin Fernando appointed as head of mass-communication campaigns, Harsha de Silva appointed Treasurer and Ajith P.Perera appointed as Trade Union Secretary.
The new energy and approach that they bring will undoubtedly pave a the way forward, together with the Deputy Leader and the Assistant Leader. With their commitment and untiring efforts, there can be no doubt that the Party will progress, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
The UNP Leader said that party supporters, who have faithfully backed the United National Party, eventhrough the most difficult of times, must be given priority.
There remains a number of unresolved issues with our supporters that must be addressed. Furthermore, there are cases where justice had not yet been served where our supporters have faced injustice and we pledge that appropriate and immediate action will be taken regarding all these issues, the Prime Minister said.
On the subject of efforts to re-organise the Party following the Local Government elections, the Premier said the UNP is a party that listens to its supporters and the people.
We are a party that considers peoples opinions, attitudes and responses. We have accurately read and identified the message given to us by the people at the last Local Government elections and we are taking action to implement the necessary changes. In order to achieve this, we have made use of several Committee reports. The reports were reviewed by a Committee that was elected by Members of Parliament, and following discussions, recommendations were presented at the working committee meeting held recently, the Premier said.
By reorganising the Party at the wish of the people, Wickremesinghe said the UNP has demonstrated that it is the only political party that is flexible and people focused.
There are people who have criticised our re-organisation and there are those who have made light of this process. But none of them worked towards bringing our party to victory during the last local election. In fact, some of them actively worked against us. Some of them had the hidden objective of destroying the Party. However, we should not worry about their agenda. What we must instead focus on is taking the necessary action to strengthen the party with increased commitment, the Prime Minister added.
The Premier went on to say that discussion and convention have always been the means of resolving problems within the UNP.
Where possible, we always work to come to a common agreement on any issue, whether this involves the Working Committee or our Members of Parliament.
It is the proud tradition of the United National Party to respect all views, even controversial views, until a final common decision has been made. It is the duty of the true supporter to understand these traditions and to preserve them.
The UNP Leader said the party plans to elevate more new faces to the level of the leadership and to bring in young blood to further strengthen it.
The group of Members of Parliament, the Working Committee together with the newly appointed officers will implement the above plans with the utmost commitment and effort, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

Proposed amendments to Bribery Act before House
Proposed amendments to the Bribery Act which will also include powers to deal with bribery and corruption in the private sector will be brought before Parliament shortly, Bribery Commission Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC said.
The new proposals also include powers to file legal action directly in High Court, Jayamanne said during a workshop held for Parliamentary Journalists Association members at Pegasus Reef Hotel in Wattala yesterday. The Workshop had been organised with the assistance of the Internews organization.
Jayamanne went said that only four convictions have been recorded during the past 23 years in corruption cases due to snags in the system of prosecution.
However, convictions were brought in 57 Bribery cases last year, the highest recorded in a single year, Jayamanne said.
He said according to proposed amendments, the Commission will have the power to consult the Attorney General for advice in any legal matter when needed.
Also a minimum of a Rs.100,000 fine has been proposed to the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act for Non declaration of Assets and Liabilities. The current penalty for such an offence is Rs.1,000, he added..
The Commissioner further said that the amendments would be made to the Bribery Act, Bribery Commission Act and the Property Evaluation Act. The Cabinet has approved the amendments and the Legal Draftsmans Department is doing the paperwork which will be submitted to Parliament for approval.
The amendments would be made to an extent that the cases could be directly filed in the High Courts. Cases could only be filed in the Magistrates court under the current Act, Jayamanne said.
The Bribery Act was implemented in 1957 and amendments were made in 1994. However, many practical issues have arisen due to some complications in the amendment which has been made in a hurry, the Commissioner remarked.
There are many errors in this system. The cases go on for a long time due to the process of appealing and the inexperience of the persons handling these cases. The Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has only 200 inquiry officials to cater to the 210 lakh population of the country while Hong Kong has 1200 inquiry officials for its 60 lakh population, the Bribery Commission Director General said.
