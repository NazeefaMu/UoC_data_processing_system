The first Woman Referee making history at FIFA World Cup
Fernando Colombo, a 26-year-old Brazilian referee, will be the first woman to whistle at a FIFA World Cup.
Fernando found her line of interest after pursuing a degree in Physical Education. Despite not being able to make it in football, she was offered an arbitration course in refereeing, where she understood and contributed arduously in her area of work. It was the Brazil Cup 2014 which got Fernando the limelight, when she came in as a line judge in the party between Sao Paulo and CRB.
Her commitment and determination helped her to work extensively on her craft and escalate gradually, step by step. Fernando played in Brasilireo C and B before reaching A.
If I was not good, I would not be here because we are all professionals, said Fernando.
But not everything turned out so smoothly for the Brazilian. Fernando had caused a controversy during her debut as a referee in the Brazillian Seria A Championship between Cruzeiro and Atletico Miniero.
She misjudged a non-existent off-side which led to Cruzeiros defeat by 2-1. Following Cruzeiros objection against the impulsive decision taken by Fernando, the Cruzeiro sports director made a statement:
The assistant is beautiful but is not ready for this. The fans scream and she is wrong. Shes beautiful, but you have to be good at your job. She should leave it and pose for Playboy.
But Fernando didnt let the setback keep her from her passion. She was highly recognised by the International Football Federation for her hard work and determination, which gave her the room to be the only women to wear the referee badge for the FIFA World Cup 2018. Examples like these can open doors for many aspiring women who feel cornered in male-dominated fields.

A sudden electricity failure at the Nawalapitiya Base Hospital on June 20 night, compelled hospital authorities to transfer some patients including those in the ICU to hospitals in surrounding areas, Hospital Director Dr. Senarath Bandara said.
An in-house generator was activated to provide three-phase electricity to the hospital as a temporary measure, he said. There was suspicion that several equipment in the hospital was damaged due to a heavy surge of electricity from the generator, he said.
He said ICU patients were transferred to the Gampola, Peradeniya and Kandy Hospitals. The hospital ICU has been temporarily closed and no referral patients were admitted to the ICU from the surrounding hospitals.
He said the private firm which has supplied the generator had been notified to repair the damage.

ICRC, Health Ministry to upgrade medico-legal services
The Health Ministry and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) signed a Letter of Agreement to provide better medico legal services in the country.
The project will implement a minimum quality assurance program at the Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology (IFMT) to improve mortuary operations by standardizing and centralizing procedures and training non-medical staff to manage forensic data and human remains more efficiently.
The IFMT will be the reference mortuary. Chief JMO and Head of the IFMT Dr. Ajith Tennakoon and the ICRC jointly developed the pilot project on Minimum Quality Assurance to be implemented at the IFMT in 2016.
The Head of Delegation of the ICRC Gerard Peytrignet speaking at the signing said the core humanitarian mission of the ICRC, mainly carried out in situations of armed conflict and others situations of violence, or in their aftermath, is to provide protection and assistance to those affected by such circumstances.
This has led to the ICRC gradually developing specific capacities related with the search, recovery and identification of bodies and human remains, with a strictly humanitarian approach, to provide responses to bereaved families and allow them to properly engage in their mourning processes. The ICRC is mainly supporting the authorities rather than directly engaging in such operations. This will not only improve Sri Lanka's medico- legal system but it also contribute to a more humanitarian, public health and preventive approach to manage and identify the dead during natural disasters, catastrophes, migration and post conflict situations.
"Our work should not be bound by laws alone, but should reach beyond that" Chief JMO DR Ajith Tennakoon said. "It should also have a humanitarian perceptive and what we practice here is humanitarian forensics," he said.

2018 Milo Presidents trophy schools knockout rugby semi-finals :
Joes hold slight edge over Kingswood
Defending champions St. Josephs College Maradana will get their 2018 Milo Presidents trophy schools knockout semifinal campaign underway when they take on underdogs Kingswood College Kandy at the Sugathadasa Stadium today at 4.15pm.
The Joes head into this championship as overwhelming favourites having dominated this tournament in recent years. Kingswood has a reputation of giving the Josephians a hard time but if truth be told, the defending champions have dominated Kingswood
St. Josephs were given a hard time before winning their league match against Kingswood at Havelock Park 26-22. Kingswood has shown signs of improvement under consultant coach Ronnie Ibrahim winning five out of nine matches during their schools rugby league finishing fifth.
Josephian head coach Nilfer Ibrahim who himself is a past Kingswood College rugby player expects a tough encounter for his charges and highlighted his opponents prowess on defence.
They have a very good forward pack and a three quarter line and they are overall a very good team in schools rugby at the moment, so weve got a massive challenge on our hands and one that we are really excited about facing, said Ibrahim. We expect a very good fight from them and it will be a close game. I am confident St. Josephs will come out victorious in the end.
The match is a historic one for Kingswood for if they reach the final it will be the first time they will have done it in a school knockout since 2005. Incidentally they won the championship that year. For Kingswood their young nippy scrum-half Hirusha Sampath (nephew of former Navy SC and Sri Lanka national player cum place kicker Nuwan Hettiarachchi now domiciled in UK) will be highly motivated to do well against the defending champions. Sampath is blessed with a vast array of skills and that along with his crisp service to his outside backs makes him a danger on attack. Hes also a superb goal-kicker and will not let his side down if he gets opportunities to take shots at goal.
Also there will be lots of pressure on young Kingswood fly-half Asiri Seneviratne when he takes on his Josephian counterpart Santhush Algama in what should be an exciting duel. Although still young Seneviratne has shown lashes of brilliance and his playmaking skills will have to be at their best if he wants to get the better of Algama, who seldom plays poorly.
Seneviratne is regarded as one of the games best attackers and will be hoping to continue where he left off against the Trinity College outfit in the quarterfinal last week at Nittawala where he dished out a sensational game with his running rugby scoring one of the best tries of the season.
If it rains in the match day, then Kingswood will have the upper hand and they will come on top. Anyway as an old boy of Kingswood, I definitely want to see them winning and get into the final, but may the better team win, said Ronny Ibrahim, the ex-consultant coach of Kingswood rugby team.

Koreas to hold family reunions in August
KOREA: North and South Korea agreed Friday to resume reunions for families separated by the Korean War in August -- the first such meetings since 2015 and the latest step in a remarkable diplomatic thaw on the peninsula.
Millions of people were separated during the 1950-53 conflict that sealed the division of the two Koreas.
Most died without the chance to see or hear from their relatives on the other side of the border, across which all civilian communication is banned.
The resumption of the reunions was among the agreements reached between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the South's President Moon Jae-in at their landmark summit in April.
Officials from both sides met at the North's scenic Mount Kumgang resort on Friday and set a date for late August.
The reunion will be held from August 20 to 26 and 100 participants will be selected from each side, said a joint Seoul-Pyongyang statement released by the South's unification ministry.
South Korean officials will begin inspections of the Mount Kumgang resort -- the venue of the reunions -- from next week and the two sides will exchange their final lists of participants by August 4, it added.
Only about 57,000 people remain alive who are registered with the South Korean Red Cross to meet their separated relatives, and most are aged over 70.
For the lucky few chosen to take part, the experience is often hugely emotional, as they are given just three days to make up for decades of time apart, followed by another separation at the end -- in all likelihood permanent.
The reunion programme began in earnest after a historic inter-Korean summit in 2000 and the reunions were initially held annually, but strained cross-border relations have made them rare.
North Korea has a lengthy track record of manipulating the issue of divided families for political purposes, refusing proposals for regular reunions and cancelling scheduled events at the last minute.
Pyongyang has previously said it will not agree to family reunions unless Seoul returns several of its citizens, including a group of waitresses who defected from a restaurant in China.
It is unknown whether the defectors were brought up at Friday's meeting, but the two sides agreed to continue discussions on humanitarian issues through further Red Cross talks, according to the joint statement. - AFP

Lanka wins Best Performance Award at Korean travel fair
The Embassy of Sri Lanka, with the Sri Lankan Tourism Promotion Bureau, organised three tourism promotional events in Seoul, South Korea to promote Sri Lanka as an attractive tourist destination among the Korean public and the travel trade.
This included organising of the first-ever Sri Lanka Day in Seoul, with the support of the Korean Culture Association and the SEOULLO Management Office at SEOULLO 7017 - Magnolia Square. The Sri Lanka Day included attractive Sri Lankan dance performances by the Olaboduwa Dance Academy of Sri Lanka, and showcasing and selling of authentic Sri Lankan products including pure Ceylon tea, Sri Lankan batiks, Sri Lankan gems and jewellery, spa products and Sri Lankan food.
Sri Lankan dance and Kpop, as well as attractive games and quizzes, made the event both attractive and interactive for youth, adults and families with young children. The Sri Lanka Day was inaugurated by Members of Parliament Harshana Rajakaruna and Sujith Sanjaya Perera. Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Korea Manisha Gunasekera, Chairman Korea International Travel Fair (KOTFA) Shin Joong Mok, and representatives of the Seoul Metropolitan Government, SEOULLO management office, the Korean Culture Association, and the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau participated.
The Sri Lanka Pavilion at the 33rdKorea International Travel Fair (KOTFA) displayed at the COEX exhibition center in Seoul, attracted many Korean visitors over the four days. The Sri Lanka Pavilion was centrally located and well-designed featuring the countrys top tourist themes and attractions. Visitors to the Pavilion enjoyed Sri Lankan dance performances by the Olaboduwa Dance Academy, were served with a refreshing cup of Ceylon tea, and were given the opportunity to win gifts by participating in various mini-competitions.
A highlight was the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau winning the Best Performance award of KOTFA 2018 for outstanding performances by the Olaboduwa Dance Academy, which also performed at the KOTFA luncheon and were applauded by the dignitaries and invitees present.
As the third promotional event, Sri Lankan Ambassador Manisha Gunasekera, with Members of Parliament, formally presented two framed photographs of world renowned Sri Lankan Buddhist sites, the Gal Viharaya in Polonnaruwa and the interior of the Sacred Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, to the Chief Priest of the Jogyesa Temple Most Venerable Jihyun.
Framed photographs of Sri Lankan Buddhist sites were also formally presented to Chief Priests of the four Sri Lankan Buddhist Temples located close to Seoul who were present at the ceremony, along with representatives of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and senior clergy of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism.

The Government will conduct a special investigation in to the killing of a leopard in Kilinochchi on Thursday, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He made this observation in response to a question by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake who asked as to what steps the Government intends to take on the brutal killing of a leopard reported in Kilinochchi.
In the absence of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in the House, Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, who previously held that ministerial portfolio, replied that he was also shocked to hear of the incident and that the law must be implemented strictly against the offenders. This is a very inhumane act. First, I thought it was a news story coming from a foreign country. Sri Lanka is to host the CITES convention (the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) next year. This is a country where the Dhamma prevails. I urge that the perpetrators behind the killing of leopard be arrested. Minister Fonseka and his deputy have the greatest respect for law and order. I believe they will take necessary steps in this regard, he commented.

The Marie Musaeus-Rohini Alles challenge trophy netball encounter between Musaeus College and Gateway College will be held on June 30 at the Royal College Sports Complex from 2.00 pm onwards. It is organised jointly by the Museaus College and Gateway College Netball committees.
The organizers are confident that this encounter will foster enduring traditions and unite the two institutions, both on and off the field.
Students from one of Sri Lankas oldest private schools will pit their skills against those from a premier International school in an atmosphere of healthy rivalry and camaraderie. The two schools will vie for the Marie Musaeus-Rohini Alles Challenge Trophy, named after the founders of the two schools.
The annual encounters between the two schools have become a popular feature in the Sri Lankan sports calendar, with almost every sport adopting a shorter format to maintain spectator interest and enthusiasm. The response to this type of encounter was clear in the recently concluded basketball encounter between Royal and Gateway, who broke new ground by uniting two diverse sectors in the Sri Lankan education system.
The main focus of this netball encounter will be the under 20 match between the two schools. An exhibition match will be played between Visakha Vidyalaya and Gateway College, Kandy; and due attention will be paid to upcoming talent by incorporating an under 15 match at the start of this event.
The event will include activities for spectators and a joint follow-up social welfare program.

Messis Argentina staring at World Cup exit after Croatia humbling
NIZHNIY NOVGOROD, Friday - Lionel Messis Argentina were on the brink of a humiliating World Cup exit on Thursday after they were humbled 3-0 by Croatia on a dramatic day at the World Cup that saw the European side join France in the knockout rounds.
Argentina knew they had to chase a win in Nizhny Novgorod after their disappointing 1-1 opening draw against Iceland but instead collapsed in the second half to leave their campaign in tatters. A horrendous mistake by goalkeeper Willy Caballero and two further goals from Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic mean the two-time former champions have to rely on an unlikely sequence of results if they are to progress in Russia.
It was the heaviest defeat for the two-time world champions in the first round group stages of a World Cup tournament since they lost 6-1 to Czechoslovakia in 1958. The result spelt another night of misery for Barcelona star Messi, who missed a penalty in Argentinas opening match against Iceland.
In stark contrast, his eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo, who last month won his fifth Champions League winners medal, has already scored four goals in Russia and looks a shoo-in to win his sixth world player of the year award. Croatia sit at the top of Group D with six points. Iceland have one point, the same as Argentina, and Nigeria have no points, but both teams have a game in hand on the South Americans.
I had to devise a plan for this match. If I had set things up differently, things might have turned out much better. I dont think its realistic to put the burden on Caballero (for his mistake), said Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli.
I think because of the reality of the Argentinian squad, it clouds Leos brilliance. Leo is limited because the team doesnt gel ideally with him as it should. As coaches we need to realise these things and try to deal with them and Im the one that needs to accept it.
Yet Sampaolis remarks, implying that Messis team-mates were to blame, drew a blunt response from normally affable striker Sergio Aguero, hinting at tensions in the Argentine camp.
Let him say what he wants, Aguero said, when asked to comment on Sampaolis verdict. It is the first time that Croatia have progressed past the World Cup group stages since their third-placed debut in 1998.
From day one Ive trusted my team. I didnt believe we would be through after the second game, but I believed we would be through eventually, said Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic.
Argentina werent confused, we were excellent.
FRANCE QUALIFY
France, who won the tournament on home in 1998, earlier joined Russia and Uruguay in the last 16 with a 1-0 win against Peru, who cannot now progress from the group stage after two defeats.
Paris Saint-German star Kylian Mbappe tapped into an empty net in the 34th minute in Yekaterinburg and the South Americans were unable to respond.
Mbappe is now the youngest French goalscorer at a World Cup, aged 19 years and 183 days, beating David Trezeguets record of 20 years and 246 days.
Denmark, also in Frances Group C, stayed on course for the knockout rounds after drawing 1-1 with Australia in the early game of the day in Samara.
Christian Eriksens half-volley was cancelled out by Mile Jedinaks VAR-assisted penalty after Yussuf Poulsens handball, giving Denmark four points, while Australia are stuck on one point.
Australia coach Bert van Marwijk said the last piece of the puzzle -- goals -- was missing for his side who had several chances to win the game, leaving their survival in the balance.
We had chances to win and we deserved to win, so Im disappointed, the Dutchman said. Russia have defied pre-tournament predictions that they would struggle by qualifying for the knockout round for the first time since the Soviet era. They will be joined by Uruguay, condemning Mohamed Salahs Egypt and Saudi Arabia to an early exit from Group A. Morocco will also be leaving Russia after the first round following their defeat by European champions Portugal, who are level with Spain on four points at the top of Group B.  AFP

Musas double downs Iceland as Nigeria come alive
VOLGOGRAD Friday: Ahmed Musa struck twice to become the first Nigerian to score at two World Cups Friday as the Super Eagles secured a crucial 2-0 win over Iceland, who missed a penalty.
The African side will secure a spot in the knockout stage if they beat Argentina on Tuesday in Group Ds final round of fixtures.
A draw would be enough to eliminate the Argentines but would leave Nigerias fate hinging on the outcome of Icelands game against Croatia.
Musa, who came into the starting line-up in place of Alex Iwobi, announced himself with two of the goals of the tournament so far.
Musas sweetly struck half-volley fired Nigeria into the lead just after half-time before he added a second with 15 minutes to go to make the Group D game safe.
Iceland got a lifeline in the 82nd minute with a VAR-awarded penalty but dead-ball specialist Gylfi Sigurdsson blazed over the bar.
With Croatia heading the group on six points Nigeria knew a second defeat would mean elimination and Iceland started brightest after coach Heimir Hallgrimsson changed to a 4-4-2 from the 4-5-1 he had used in the 1-1 draw with Argentina.
Alfred Finnbogason, who scored the equaliser against Argentina as a lone striker, was joined up front by Jon Bodvarsson and the pair quickly made an impact.

International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking falls on June 22:
NDDCB holds island-wide programmes from June 22 to 26
The International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (June 22) will be marked with several programmes island-wide from June 22 to June 26, National Dangerous Drug Control Board (NDDCB) Chairman Prof. Saman Abeysinghe said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday morning.
The Chairman said drug abuse has become a major threat to schoolchildren above grade nine. The country has hot spots for drugs, but still eradicating drug menace is possible. Thirty two institutions implement a various projects and programmes island-wide to address the issue, he said.
Wasantha Kumara Liyanage attached to the Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Drugs said the circular number PS/DSP/DUP/07.18 was issued to implement island-wide programmes to mark the day and the week and schools, dhamma schools and others will participate the programmes. He said the progress of the programmes will be reported to the Presidential Secretariat. DIG Sajeewa Medawatta attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau said the illicit drugs have become a serious issue.
The country has several ordinances to deal with the issue. Ganja (KG), Heroin and Cocaine are the top three illicit drugs. But the schoolchildren are getting addicted to new artificial illicit drugs that come as gels, stamps and stickers. Parents should be vigilant on their children's behaviour and take corrective measures immediately if their children go wrong ways.
The public can provide any information on illicit drugs on the hotline 1984 and their confidentiality will be strictly protected, he said.
Excise Department Deputy Commissioner Kapila Kumarasinghe said 1,000 officers were deployed island-wide by the Department to implement programmes. Everything related to illicit drugs changes very fast. Therefore, the raiding methods must be changed fast. The department does its best with the limited resources, he said.
Former DIG Sirisena Herath said that around 6,000 youths were imprisoned on illicit drugs-related issues.

Nine of the Most Unstoppable World Cup teams ever seen
There have been some pretty unstoppable forces at tournaments down the years, and here are nine of the best teams football fans have ever seen...
BRAZIL 1970
Undoubtedly one of the most frightening teams that, not just football, but sport has ever seen. Brazil's bunch from the 1970 tournament in Mexico were utterly dominant that year, showcasing exceptional attacking play rather than the physical styles that had been on show in previous tournaments.
They won all six of their games on their way to glory, and Carlos Alberto scored one of the finest goals ever seen at a World Cup finals.
ARGENTINA 1986
1986 winners Argentina were unstoppable largely thanks to talisman Diego Maradona, whose speed and dribbling was simply too much for defenders to deal with in Mexico.
The diminutive ex-forward is still despised to this day by the English for his infamous 'Hand of God' goal in the quarter-final, but he then went on to score one of the best solo efforts of all time.
Argentina had a fine all-round team that year, but the influence of Maradona certainly made them one of the best to grace a finals.
SPAIN 2010
Probably the greatest World Cup side of the modern era. In 2010, Spain added the title of world champions to their European crown of two years before by triumphing in South Africa.
Made up of largely Real Madrid and Barcelona players, La Roja passed their opponents into submission, wearing them down expertly before delivering the killer blows.
They never battered anyone and actually lost their opening game of the tournament, but they were still a total joy to watch.
WEST GERMANY 1974
Led by Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany stormed to World Cup glory in 1974 - their second world crown.
This side played with the kind of ruthless efficiency that forms the nucleus of the modern Germany teams of today.
THE NETHERLANDS 1974
They may have lost in the final to the West Germany side mentioned above, but the Netherlands team of 1974 is still one of the best teams ever seen at a World Cup finals. Their brand of 'Total Football' was totally revolutionary, and has served as inspiration for many a football side ever since. Arguably, they are the best team never to win a World Cup, having come within a whisker in both 1974 and 1978.
BRAZIL 2002
Brazil had some great sides back in the day, but one of their best of all time went all the way in South Korea and Japan in 2002. Featuring stars such as Dida, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Lucio, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo, the South Americans were absolutely impenetrable and at times unstoppable in attack as they tricked and styled their way past stunned defences.
FRANCE 1998
The French team of '98 were unstoppable in every sense of the word, going on to win the World Cup without losing and conceding just two goals along the way.
They contested the final against Brazil and turned them over 3-0 - a huge statement to the watching world that perhaps France's time was to begin. Unfortunately they haven't followed up that victory with any more since, but 2018 sees their squad looking terrifyingly strong.
GERMANY 2014
The last winners of the World Cup, Germany had audiences around the world in awe of their incredible prowess and efficiency.
That was on show in particular at the semi-final stage as they absolutely destroyed the mighty Brazil 7-1 in front of their own embarrassed fans - an historic result that will surely never be toppled in terms of sheer shock production.
ITALY 2006
Italy's victory in 2006 was mainly made possible through their incredible defence. The Azzurri boasted stars such as Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta and Gianluca Zambrotta and Gennaro Gattuso, and their sturdiness at the back allowed the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Alessandro Del Piero, Filippo Inzaghi, Luca Toni and Alberto Gilardino the freedom to perform.
Their side had a perfect balance, and Italy stormed to victory that year after beating France on penalties in the final.  90min

Wildlife officials well equipped to tackle human - elephant conflict now: Dy Minister
The Wildlife Ministry had provide the Wildlife officials with the required vehicle facilities and Rs. 500 million for fuel, torches, crackers, chain saws, binoculars, etc. to enable them to efficiently handle the elephant - human conflict, said Deputy Wildlife Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma.
He said so in response to the Adjournment statement in Parliament yesterday. He noted that the Wildlife Minister along with him, had studied the elephant-human conflict thoroughly, before looking into a solution.
Many ridiculed us when Minister Sarath Fonseka and I were appointed ministers of the Wildlife Ministry. They interpreted it as a punishment appointment. Even the former President had said that the government had identified the right persons to resolve the wildlife issue. In other words, what he meant was that a wild animal had been appointed to resolve the wildlife issue.
The main fault was that the country's leaders had not identified this problem well and had never offered a proper solution to address the issue due to ignorance. When a human kills an elephant for whatever reason, the punishment was a fine of around Rs. 200,000 - 300,000 only. No one had identified the value of an elephant. There is no proper mechanism to protect wild elephants in this country, he added. Having done an in depth study of the issue, Thewarapperuma said the main issue in resolving this human-elephant conflict was an acute shortage of manpower. Even the officers who were serving, had no resources to carry out their duties. They lacked vehicles, weapons, elephant crackers, etc. So how could they carry out their duties As with the terrorist war, this issue could not be resolved in the same manner. The people nor the elephants could be killed. It is the poor people who are the most affected by this problem,he said.
Having understood the shortage of staff and based on a request, the President had agreed to provide around 3,000 CSD soldiers to handle the problem, while the Prime Minister too had granted approval to recruit another 2,500 personnel. Now the Wildlife Department has around 6,000 personnel and is in a better position to start dealing with the issue. Under the new Ministers Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka and Palitha Thewarapperuma, the Wildlife officers will begin to construct another 4,500 km of electric fences to prevent elephants from entering populated areas.
The electric fences constructed so far, did not meet with the require standard. Those who constructed these fences made money out of the contract. As elephants are intelligent animals, fences have to be built taking that into consideration. The more these fences are destroyed, the better it was for those who were making money. Earlier, for every 30 km area there were only around 3 - 4 officers deployed.
Now we have a plan and since we have the manpower, we have deployed one officer per km., and within that three km area, we will construct a tent and provide the needed facilities, including food for them to carry out their duties, he said, adding that from 2010-2017 589 people had been killed due to the human elephant conflict.

Failure by officials to act on Ombudsmans recommendations
Party Leaders to decide on future action at next meeting
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that the Cultural Affairs Department had failed to comply with the recommendations by the Ombudsman and that Party Leaders at their next meeting will have to decide on further steps regarding the matter.
Making an announcement at the commencement of sittings, the Speaker said Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) had reported him that the recommendations given after inquiring into a complaint by K.D. Kalyani, an employee at the National Art Gallery, have not been adhered by the Director of Cultural Affairs Department.
The Ombudsman has reported that Director of Cultural Affairs Department and Officer-in-Charge of National Art Gallery were summoned for the inquiry, but they dodged it by sending other officers. After the recommendations were sent, the Department Director has replied that she cannot execute them and that she feels those recommendations were one sided.
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara queried as to what action Parliament can take when the Ombudsmans recommendations were ignored stating that it was a serious problem.
The Speaker agreeing to MP Nanayakkara said necessary steps would be decided at the next Party Leaders Meeting.

Nearly 120 applications received for investments in Horana Industrial estate
Around 120 applications were received recently for investments in the Horana Industrial estate when applications were called for. A programme known as Enterprise Sri Lanka has also been established under the Finance Ministry, with an allocation of Rs. 80 billion, to assist local industrialists, said Commerce and Industry Minister Rishad Bathiudeen in Parliament yesterday.
He said this in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
The Industrialisation Commission has been reactivated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, on the instructions of the President and the Prime Minister. The Commission is chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury and pays special attention to issues faced by local industrialists. All industrialists meet with the Commission every two weeks, to discuss their issues. At present, there are 17 advisory councils functioning under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, he said.
Minister Bathiudeen added that currently 29, industrial estates are functioning, consisting of 330 industries with around 20,000 workers employed at these industrial estates. A forum at the highest level had been formed to present the issues faced by the industrial sector and the government, has taken action to continue with the exporters forum continuously, to facilitate the requirements of the exporters under the chairmanship of Minister Malik Samarawickrama with the Export Development Board.
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, had also finalised the SME policy action plan to facilitate sustainable development in small and medium level enterprises and the government hopes to launch it as soon as possible. My ministry is also providing low interest loans under two loan schemes. More than 10 billion had already been released so far to the SME industrialists. For the development of the craft and handloom industry, we have developed an integrated programme such as production and empowerment through small industries.
He noted that special focus had been made on promoting artificial intelligence and robotics for the development of the apparel and manufacturing industry. Sri Lankas apparel exports amounts to around 5 billion dollars.
According to Minister Bathiudeen, for the development of the industrial sector, the government has identified the importance of having firm policies and they are working on it.

Distribution of land to 150,000 estate families: Kiriella
The Good Governance Government has planned to distribute lands to 150,000 estate families in extent of seven perches each. We have commenced this programme and on July 01, a function would be held at Kelebokka Estate under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to distribute 500 land plots to estate workers, said Leader of the House and Minister of Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella, in Parliament yesterday.
He said this in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena, alleging that the government was liberalizing land policies on the pretext of liberalizing the market.
You keep asking me this question repeatedly, but these lands were distributed to estate owners during the Chandrika Bandaranaike government, but we are giving these lands to the estate workers.
In 1995 during the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge government, 900,000 acres was sold to companies through the stock exchange. If these lands had been obtained through the stock exchange, these transactions could be done through the stock exchange. He said although the 1994 government gave 900,000 acres to estates, the good governance regime was not like that, he added.
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena said it was his groups view that the lands under the Plantations Industry were being exchanged without Parliamentary or Cabinet approval.
He questioned as to whether other than selling lands through the stock market, if these lands belonging to plantation companies were being leased under short or long term lease basis or if these lands are being provided for other non-estate sectors such as tourism or farming.

No intention of taking over Samurdhi Banks: Harrison
The Government has no intention of taking over Samurdhi Banks under the Central Bank (CB), but a mechanism for the CB to supervise those banks would be set up, Social Empowerment Minister P Harrison said.
He was responding to a question by Joint Opposition MP Udaya Padma Shantha, who complained that the Government was trying to abolish the Samurdhi Banks and take their money to the CB. The Minister denying such claims, said if the Samurdhi Banks were to be absorbed into the CB, it should be done by way of a Parliamentary Act and so far, there was no such move. However, he said there was no wrong in the CB supervising the funds in Samurdhi Banks as it had the authority to supervise all banks.

Suwa Seriya 1990 revolutionised health sector: State Minister
The Suwa Seriya 1990 ambulance service has revolutionised the health services sector, said State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva.
He said this commencing the second debate on the 1990 Suwa Seriya foundation bill in Parliament on Thursday.
Today, while accidents have increased, there is no facility to take an accident victim to hospital, other than by a three wheeler.
In the event of an injury to the spinal cord, a proper ambulance service is required to properly transport these patients to a hospital, he said, adding that the 1990 ambulance service provides a great service today to these victims.
Thanking all those who assisted in establishing the Suwa Seriya ambulance service, the minister noted that this service has revolutionised the health service.
Through this Bill, the 21 million of the population in the country and foreigners who visit here will be able to use it free of charge. A fully-fledged ambulance service and qualified medical personnel are provided. This is not a mere ambulance service but its like a micro hospital.
Emergency medical technicians would also be available to take the patient to a hospital. Although we are a developing country, we have proved to be on par with the western countries in terms of this service. We never had this service previously, but today we have a fully-fledged pre-hospital care service on par with developed countries, added Dr. de Silva. He said certain magazines have pointed out that our 1990 ambulance service is better than the 911 service in the US. When the government had taken a decision to park these ambulances at hospitals, certain parties protested and did not want this service anywhere near the hospitals. Hence, the government decided to park these ambulances at police stations, which had proved to be a better option as it is the police who are first notified in the event of an emergency or accident.
The 1990 Suwa Seriya ambulance service commenced in July 2016 with just two ambulances in Hambantota. Later, it was expanded to several other districts including Colombo.
From its inception, the Suwa Seriya ambulance service had received 584,520 emergency calls and all of them were answered within two seconds, which is a 98.9% success rate.
We have dispatched 88,599 ambulances in response to emergency calls received by the 1990 service. Of it 79,904 had carried patients who faced emergency situations.
On average, 12.58 minutes had taken to get a patient to hospital. The majority of patients of 17% were those who suffered vehicular trauma while the others were general trauma and 10% were cardiac trauma patients. From the day we commenced this service to date, people have grown to revere this service.
Initially many criticised this service and advised people not to get into them, but today it has become a most reliable and vital component of the health sector, said Minister Harsha de Silva.

JVP commends taking over rights of distribution back to NFC
JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa yesterday in Parliament, commended the Government for taking over the rights of distribution of local films back to the National Film Corporation (NFC).
He said it was an admirable decision and as per the law, NFC is the sole distributor of films in Sri Lanka.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said 74 film halls had been closed down since four private companies were given the authority to distribute films in 2000. Three companies had been given the distribution rights by way of written agreements, while a fourth company had also been given the distribution rights simply through oral agreement. We cancelled all these agreements and took the distribution of films under the purview of the NFC, he said.
Responding to a question by MP Jayatissa on the conversation of old films, the Minister said the NFC would carry out a joint project soon, with the National Archives Department in this regard. There is no issue of financial allocations and we will commence the project soon, he replied.

Govt. removed tax relief exemptions to local industrialists
MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, accused the Government of trying to gradually remove CESS on imported goods and not doing enough to safe guard the local industrialists.
Raising a question under Standing Order 27(2), the MP said the Government had removed all tax relief and exemptions given to local industrialists. Local entrepreneurs are heavily burdened by excessive taxes and rising production and import costs. The Rupee is getting devalued, interest rates have been raised, taxes are being imposed and as a result, our national industries are virtually closing down, he said.
He said jobs of thousands of workers are at risk due to this plight. Under the trade liberalization policy of the Government and through the bilateral Free Trade Agreements, it enters with other countries, imported goods are allowed into the country without any limitation. This has posed a danger to local industrialists. Many SMEs have been closed. Not even US President Trump follows this type of policies and I have no clue as to what his minions are trying to do here, he commented.
The MP said President Maithripala Sirisena has been holding emergency discussions over the last three weeks to avert a national crisis.
However, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen rejected the claims by MP Gunawardena and highlighted the Governments commitment to safe guard local entrepreneurs.

Peterite-Wesley semi final evenly poised
The match between high riding St.Peters College Bambalapitiya and giant killers Wesley College Colombo will be evenly poised in their Milo A Division inter school President trophy knock out rugby tournament second semifinal match to be played at Sugathadasa Stadium tomorow (Sunday) at 4:15pm.
The Peterites lads under the leadership of acting captain cum play maker Jason Karunaratne and coached by Sanath Martis assisted by Bhanuka Nanayakkara and Rajiv Perera (Pikka) have an immaculate record in this years concluded league rugby tournament where they were placed third for 2018 school rugby season.
Peters cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable speedy three quarter line with their famous three quarter moves through scrum half Karunaratne, fly half Kenneth Wimaladasa, centres Madushanka brothers (Dilshan and Rukshan), winger Mark Assauw and they also have a reliable place kicker in full back Shehan Liyanapathirana and his
contribution in this match with his kicking boot will be vital for a Peterite victory.
On the other hand Wesley College possesses a good team with play maker centre Sahan Hansaja along with their entire three quarter line can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school exactly like they did against much fancied Isipathana College last time around in the quarter finals last week.
Wesley College are coached by Samoan Paul Toiya along with experienced Sri Lanka national rugby player Reeza Mubarak and old boy and national player Dulanjana Wijesinghe.
Meanwhile this will be also a do or die battle for Wesley College and if they lose this battle to St.Peters College today , then it could be worse for them as their hopes of getting in to the finals will be a mere dream and they will crash out of the tournament in disgusts.

Rapid progress in next 18 months
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe launching Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya (Village Transformation) programmes yesterday, said the next 18 months would see accelerated development of the economy.
When we took over in 2015, the Government could not afford to pay its own loans but after three years of proper fiscal management, we are in a position to provide loans to our people, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said at the launch held at the BMICH.
He stressed that the Government which had steered through choppy waters to bring economic stability was now looking to expand economic opportunities. Now we need investment, increase exports and more importantly improve spending power- people need money in their hands.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka scheme which encompasses 15 loan schemes for various sectors including agriculture, women and small industry, will be an impetus to improve the capacity and skills of entrepreneurs, the Prime Minister said.
Small businesses are the backbone of the economy but rising interest rates discourage many from taking loans to expand. Hence, these Government loans where the Government will take on the burden of paying the majority of the interest, is expected to encourage entrepreneurs to take the risks, he added.
The Prime Minister also explained that the Government will monthly monitor whether the loans have reached the right people and whether they are using them effectively.
Speaking at another function held in Boralesgamuwa earlier, the Premier said an export oriented economy will strengthen Sri Lankas working and middle classes. An export economy will attract investment, generate income and people will have more money in their hands, he said.
He said that in order to strengthen the working and middle classes, rapid urbanization is a must. The government shall not allow such projects to drag on.
When the Government increased certain taxes, everybody blamed us. Even now the same accusations are hurled at us. We have given directions to the Finance Minister to check whether any injustice is being done to any quarter owing to taxation. However much some people level baseless allegations against us, the Government must find money to pay the debts. We have come a long way surpassing all these difficulties, he pointed out.
He also pointed out that, until the end of war, loans taken by the Government were in Sri Lankan rupees. But after the war ended, Sri Lanka started to take loans in dollars. When the value of the US Dollar rises, our debts also change accordingly. This is the biggest issue we have right now. The amount of debt that we had in 2009 has increased three-fold because of this fluctuation. If we cannot understand this plight, we cannot go further. The export sector of our country had become very weak. So the government had to focus on this issue for two years. We had many environmental disasters to deal with in the following year, he said.
He said the present Government took upon the responsibility of the country because the previous regime was unable to rule anymore. If they were able to manage these issues, they would never have given up power. We won the crucial election and came to power. We do have shortcomings in our management, but we are going forward stronger. Th years 2017, 2018, 2019 have large debt installments which need to be paid. The largest debt amount we need to meet falls in 2018. It has become possible for us to manage this issue and go forward with large development projects.
The Prime Minister explained that said that developing various areas in Colombo does not mean development per se. If Colombo is to be developed, the condition of Colombo North and Colombo Central must be improved. Our aim is to develop all parts of Colombo with special attention to low income communities, he said.
When we took over the Urban Development Authority it had only debts. It took us two years to repay the debt. Even the UDAs building was created with a loan. They couldnt even pay their own debt. So while we were paying foreign debts, we had to meet these domestic debt requirements as well. After solving all these issues, we have now started the actual process of developing Sri Lanka, he explained.

Local entrepreneurs to be provided with right market, fair price - President
Zahrah Imtiaz
Credit for local entrepreneurs would only be effective if we also provide them with access to the right market and a fair price, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing the launch of the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme at the BMICH yesterday.
President Sirisena explained that other countries had developed on the strengths of their own people and local businesses.
But I also asked that concurrently, all ministries work together to ensure that cheap imports do not compete with local products and destroy them, the President said.
The President noted that 90 percent of entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka were agriculture based but they had issues with finding a market, a place to sell, getting a fair price and ensuring that their products are of good quality and standard.
Today, I am disappointed to say that even the kite is imported. When I visited Kalpitiya, which had some of the finest farmers in the country, they say that they have stopped farming pomegranates and bananas because these fruits are imported now, the President said.
We need to import information, technology and know-how from abroad but the labour, skills and enterprise should come from our people, the President added.Enterprise Sri Lanka which introduced 15 loan schemes has sought to condense the 100 loan schemes currently offered by various banks,
Eight months ago when we were looking at unemployment in the country, the Central Bank Governor and officials informed us that there were 100 schemes! But how many did the people really know about So we sought to condense them into 15.
President Sirisena remarked there discussions had also shown that State Banks had reaped immense profits over the years.
So the question was how much of this money has really gone to the people If they have been given back for government expenditure, how much has it really served the people If State banks are to make profits, that money has to be channelled to help entrepreneurs and the people of this country, President Sirisena said. In my view, a State bank unlike a commercial bank has to be 50 percent service oriented and 50 percent profit driven, the President said.
The government has undertaken a grand undertaking here, and we have allocated Rs.60 billion for this. So once the money is given, it is imperative that officials follow up on the entrepreneurs and check how they are doing, otherwise the purpose we set out to achieve will not be fulfilled.
Through this programme, the government is not only reviving the economy but helping create a motivated, entrepreneurial generation which can stand on their own feet, the President said.

S. Asian monsoons remove smog, spread pollution
US: Theres good news and bad news about the Indian summer monsoon. According to a new study, South Asian monsoons both help clean the atmosphere and spread pollution as far away as Tibet.
As South Asia burns fossil fuels, researchers from Germany say the clockwise-spinning storm pulls the emissions high into the troposphere. There, lightning-fueled chemical reactions transform the pollutants into more stable forms, which fall to earth as harmless rain.
However, not all the emissions reach those heights, and that is the pollution researchers found far from South Asia.
Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and his fellow researchers believed that the circulating air currents carry pollutants upwards and gradually scatter them across a greater area.
To test this, the scientists made seventeen high-altitude flights over the seasonal monsoons to collect air samples, which they measured for chemical signatures of pollution specifically from South Asia.
By combining these measurements with computer models of air circulation, the researchers tracked the path of the contaminants and how they changed as they reached higher altitudes.
As expected, at lower altitudes, the South Asian monsoon did disperse pollutants over a wide region, including distant areas like Tibet. However, the scientists also found that the monsoon pulled the polluted air from the atmosphere into the much higher troposphere, where with the assistance of the storms lightning, it reacted with other gases, and could be washed out by the rain.
While this cycle of extracting pollution does help clean the local atmosphere, the air flow towards the troposphere high above earth is an incredibly slow process that can take weeks. Researchers say that it can take more than a month for the pollution to collect and get chemically processed into a non-harmful form. - VOA

Son under pressure to save South Koreas World Cup
SAINT PETERSBURG, Friday - South Koreas Son Heung-min is bearing the weight of expectation at the World Cup just as heavily as Mohamed Salah, Cristiano Ronaldo and Harry Kane.
Even Lionel Messi, whose bid to add a World Cup to his career collection has become something of a communal objective for football, enjoys the support of a star-studded Argentinian side, from Angel Di Maria to Javier Mascherano to Sergio Aguero.
For Son and South Korea, the pressure is shared in the kind of unequal measure that perhaps only Salah would know with Egypt, before his own tournament was hampered by injury.
South Korea are teetering on the brink too, after a 1-0 defeat by Sweden left them needing at least a draw, and probably a win, against Mexico on Saturday to keep any hopes of progressing from Group F alive.
Son blamed himself for the opening loss. Im still disappointed about my performance, he said. I feel very, very sorry for my team-mates because if we dont score, its my fault, because I need to take the responsibility.
Responsibility is one take, pressure another. Son is a star in his home country, to the extent he has to wear a disguise when he leaves the house and Korean journalists are employed in London, where they wait to speak to the forward after every Tottenham fixture in the Premier League.
But for all the attention he receives, the 25-year-old, who moved to Germany when he was 16 and made his name at Hamburg and Bayer Leverkusen, is humble, driven and immensely popular with his team-mates.
He still lives in Barnet with his parents. His father, Son Woong-jung, is a former striker himself, whose professional career was cut short by injury. Tottenhams training ground, based nearby in Enfield, has housed Korean chefs, invited in by Son in the hope of ingratiating his team-mates to bulgogi (barbecued beef), japchae (stir-fried noodles) and Samgyetang (a type of chicken soup).
But for Spurs, Son plays behind Kane, and alongside Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen. He is a key player, but not the star. It is true that maybe he doesnt get the headlines of Harry Kane and other players but it is good to recognise him, Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino said.
Its like a player next to [Lionel] Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo that also deserves a lot of credit.
When you are next to Harry Kane, who scores and scores, it is normal that the focus is more on Harry Kane or on Messi or Ronaldo than on Son. But all the team love him. Not only because of his performances but because of how he is as a man. He is so humble and such a normal guy, and that makes him bigger.  AFP

Sports Minister bans alcohol at Sugathadasa Sports Hotel
Minister of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports, Faiszer Musthapa has banned alcohol selling at the newly renovated Sugathadasa Sports Hotel that will be opened shortly.
In a statement the Minister said: I took a decision to stop the sale of alcohol at the Sugathadasa Sports Hotel, simply because so many of our young uns patronise this stadium. I believe that it does not relate well with our nations culture and values and clearly is not aligned with my personal belief. With immediate effect I have banned the sale of alcohol at the Sugathadasa Sports Hotel.
The facility has been under refurbishment over the last couple of years and one of the main improvements was an established fully-fledged bar. This clearly does not resonate with the countrys ethos of empowering andenergizing our youth, especially through sports. The Sugathadasa arena is currently patronized by our young future athletes, swimmers, gymnasts and other sports. The credo for the Sugathadasa Sports Hotel was to provide dwelling for our youth from all across the island. Therefore, alcohol will be banned from this facility when it opens, in the near future, the Minister stated.

Swedens Forsberg can hurt Germans in World Cup crunch match
SOCHI, Friday: An early German exit from the World Cup seems unthinkable, but that could be the grim reality for the reigning champions unless they get the better of Sweden this weekend. Still, at least they know exactly where the danger is coming from.
The main creative threat in Janne Anderssons principally solid, unspectacular side lies in the shape of Emil Forsberg, one of the most talented wide attackers in Europe. Im a big fan of Emil Forsberg, hes a great player, said Germany defender Mats Hummels on Thursday when asked if anyone in the Scandinavians side could make it into the World Cup holders line-up. Bayern Munich defender Hummels and his international teammates are well placed to comment on Forsbergs ability. The 26-year-old has come to Russia on the back of two outstanding seasons in the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig, and on Saturday evening, at the Fisht Stadium by the Black Sea, he will come up against a German side featuring his club colleague Timo Werner.
The Germans came early to Sochi to acclimatise to the heat as they look to stave off talk of a crisis following their 1-0 defeat to Mexico, with which they began their trophy defence.
In contrast, the Swedes -- who stunned Italy in a play-off to qualify -- travel down the coast from their peaceful base in the resort of Gelendzhik in rather more buoyant mood after beating South Korea 1-0.
If Mexico beat the Koreans earlier on Saturday, a draw for Sweden against the Germans would probably condemn Joachim Loews side to an early exit in Group F -- Sweden could then play against the Mexicans in their final game knowing a point would take them both through.

Trump says North Korea still 'extraordinary threat'

US President Donald Trump has renewed sanctions on North Korea, citing an "extraordinary threat" from its nuclear weapons - just 10 days after saying there was no risk from Pyongyang.
"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea," he tweeted on 13 June, a day after meeting the country's leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
The move came as the US and South Korea cancelled two more training exercises.
The Pentagon said the goal was to support diplomatic negotiations.
It follows the decision earlier this week to suspend a major joint military exercise between the US and South Korea that had been planned for August.
President Trump promised to end the annual "war games" between the allies in an unexpected concession at his summit with Kim, calling them "provocative" and "expensive".
That came as a shock to many, as the US had previously argued that the drills were purely defensive and key to its military alliance with Seoul.
Has Trump changed his tone on North Korea
It does sound that way, but the US has had a "national emergency" in place with regard to North Korea since 2008. Since then, presidents have routinely renewed that status - and the anti-Pyongyang sanctions that go with it.
President Trump extended the national emergencyon Friday due to "the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of the Government of North Korea".
These "continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States", he said in a notice to Congress.
Democrats say the latest White House language contradicts the president's earlier boasts about the success of the Singapore summit. In another tweet on 13 June, he said Americans could "sleep well tonight!".

Trump takes on multiple targets in trade war
President Donald Trump has launched a trade war, principally against China. But in doing so he has also aimed at some erstwhile US allies, including Canada, the European Union, Japan and Mexico. In intransigently following protectionist policies he is undermining the rule-based world trading system guided by the GATT and followed by the WTO subsequently.
In fact the present trading system is more the work of the United States as it emerged as the most powerful economic and political power at the end of World War II. It is an irony of history that the United States has also threatened to withdraw from the WTO if the latter sides with US opponents in a trade dispute sent for arbitration.
Apparently President is following a hard inflexible stand which could be termed both nave and self-defeating. This is in stark contrast with the pragmatism he displayed on the Korean issue.
It all began on June 1 with the US imposing a 25 percent tariff on European Aluminum and Steel goods imports to the United States. Then on June 15 President Trump announced a US $ 50 billion tariffs on metal imports to the United States.
As a major trading partner these tariffs hurt China most. China has promised to retaliate in equal measure.
A spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said: We want no trade war with anyone, but if our hand is forced, we will not quail nor recoil from it. Therefore, if the day did come when the US take measures to hurt our interests, we will definitely take firm counter-measures to safeguard our legitimate interests.
In fact it has already imposed a US $ 50 billion tariff on US goods, mainly on agricultural and energy goods imported from the United States. On June 15 President Trump imposed another US $ 200 billion tariff on imports from China. Another $ 200 billion tariff is also on the way.
US tariff increases have affected Canada, its main trade partner and neighbour. Canada has also retaliated with  12.5 billion tariff on US imports.
The European Union is worried over the US action. It will also retaliate with tariff increases. It has announced  2.4 billion tariffs on US imports, especially on aluminum and steel goods. In addition, Mexico has also imposed US $ 3 billion tariff on US imports.
Obviously the consequences will be adverse for most economies including that of the United States, China, the European Union, Japan, Korea and Mexico.
In fact, no country will be immune from the shocks that will be generated by these developments. The possibility of a world depression cannot be ruled out. Opinions differ on who would be affected more  China or the United States. Stock markets have plummeted in both countries. Consumers in both countries will suffer due to higher prices of imports, in turn reducing the volume of trade. Investments would decline.
Since the sales of US firms are over 50 percent in foreign markets they will be seriously affected. For example, energy and industry product are respectively sold 59 and 57 percent in foreign markets.
The number of unemployed will reach 8 million in the US and the economy would grow slower with the prospect of a lower GDP.
It is expected that the United States will face an economic recession in 2019.
Israel grabs more Palestine territory
Israel has launched an operation to make more inroads into Palestine territory under its policy of colonial expansion. They not only violate the United Nations resolutions barring such practice but also openly boast about it. For example Education Minister Naftali Bennett has said that The West Bank and all settlements around it will soon be a part of Israel. The Military has given instructions to civilian authorities to demolish Palestine houses and other facilities and evict Palestinians to build Jewish settlements.
Israel has become so aggressive due to the political support and military assistance provided by the United States. In an expression of solidarity with Israel the United States transferred its Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem amidst widespread protests. Recently the United States withdrew from the membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) alleging bias against Israel. These actions by Israel threaten the two- State solution proposed by the international community as a peaceful resolution to the long drawn-out Palestine question.
Hence, international solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinians fighting for their right to live freely in their motherland is required more than ever before. Unfortunately the disunity of the Palestine liberation movements and the lukewarm attitude of some Arab regimes of the area and their subservience to the United States pose problems for the liberation movement.
However, the Palestinian struggle cannot be subdued and it is getting stronger even under most tragic conditions.

The legacy of President Premadasa :
THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE
The twenty-third of June every year is remembered and commemorated as the birth day of that great visionary leader of our time, Ranasinghe Premadasa, who kindled the hopes and aspirations of the people of this country, especially of the poor and the disadvantaged.
But to us, veterans in the Housing Ministry, it was more than his Birthday. It was the opening day of the annual Gam Udawa exhibition. The Gam Udawa exhibition, which commenced in Ampare on a modest scale, grew and expanded over the years to become not only the major showcase of the Governments development effort, but also the major annual attraction for the people around the country, especially the rural people who were rather starved of leisure and entertainment. It became the event to look forward to, and the people flocked in their thousands to the exhibition. Its grandeur and the exhilaration persisted from the end of one to the beginning of the next. For the few of us, who were involved in its planning and operation, its detail and glamour, it was an unparalleled and exhilarating management experience, marked with vision, innovation, precision and delegation.
The Gam Udawa exhibition grew in its might and variety and expanded every year. During its celebrated history, it went on adding new items, new features and novel ways of reaching the ordinary people of this country. It achieved unheard of prestige to an extent, that participation in the Gam Udawa was considered a signal honour amongst public servants as well as those from the private sector. Public institutions as well as private sector firms fought with one another to get a better exposure for their stalls. It attracted all types and kinds of artistesmusicians, dancers, dramatists, painters and poets. It displayed exquisite taste in arts, music, and dancing and a thorough understanding of our culture. Renowned singers like Amaradeva, Jothipala, Mohideen Baig and Latha adorned the stage. The rural population was provided an opportunity to watch stage drama like Maname.
Gam Udawa movement
I remember that the exhibition even attracted a puppeteer to hold daily performances. But the Gam Udawa exhibition never degenerated in to a gaudy or the noisy Bajawwa. It never attracted hooligans or thugs. The cultural traditions of the country were always given the pride of place. One of its most noteworthy achievements was its discipline and decorum. During the almost one and half decades of the exhibition, there have never been fights, scuffles or drunken disorderliness; neither have there been even thefts, harassments or other infringements of the law. Cleanliness and orderliness were given the pride of the place.
The Gam Udawa may have achieved such a state of discipline and decorum because the whole Gam Udawa movement was based on the principle, the Premadasa vision, of trusting the people, or it may have been due to the extra vigilance paid by the police and the law enforcement officers, with the President of the Nation gracing the exhibition almost every day.
The last exhibition, the Gam Udawa 1992 held in Buttala in the Moneragala District, I believe, culminated all previous exhibitions and became the best and the most extensive ever. I myself was fortunate to be a member of its core management team as the Director responsible for harnessing private sector participation, and play a major role in its organisation. For me, it was the most challenging but most enjoyable managerial task that I ever experienced.
Over the years, the Gam Udawa core management team evolved as a very tight knit, high calibre structure. Its planning and management came under the personal guidance and monitoring of President Premadasa and the direction and co-coordination of the then Minister of Housing and Construction, Sirisena Cooray. The affable, dependable and resourceful Mr. Cooray provided the political leadership and the direction that the exhibition management depended and trusted upon. He always stood as the buffer between the occasional wrath and impatience of the President and us, the ground workers, who were managing various aspects of the exhibition under great stress.
The planning and management of the Gam Udawa exhibition was structured around a carefully established system of Committees. Each Committee had been assigned precise tasks and clear lines of delegation. At the apex of this management structure was the Gam Udawa Main Committee, chaired by the Secretary to the Ministry, Ailapperuma. He was also the Director-General of the exhibition, with Siri Hattotuwegama, then the Secretary to the Presidents Fund as his erstwhile Deputy. Mr. Ailapperuma and Mr. Hattotuwegama formed the pivot around which the whole management structure turned: only they were fully conversant with the total picture of the exhibition and its allied activities. Each Committee under its own acknowledged leadership, had their own precise tasks, and I recollect that there were about fifteen Committees reporting to the Main Committee. The two most important Committees with the heaviest responsibilities were the exhibition ground committee chaired by Dr. Micheal Joachim, then the Additional Secretary to the Ministry and the District integrated Development Committee chaired by Conrad de Tissera, the other Additional Secretary. Other Committees included the Janahamuwa committee chaired at first by Bimal Padmaperuma in his role as Chairmen of the State Engineering Corporation, the construction committee chaired by Y M I Bandara, Director of Buildings, the Housing and Model Villages development Committee chaired by Susil Sirivardana, the Media and Publicity Committee chaired by Lakvijaye Palansuriya, the Processions Committee chaired by T. Mahalingam, the Religious Affairs Committee chaired by K. M. Abeysinghe and the security committee chaired by A. C. Lawrence, a retired DIG who was the Security Advisor to the Ministry. I as the Chairman of the Private Sector stalls Committee, had the responsibility for harnessing private sector participation in the exhibition. My task proved to be quite easy as the private sector was clamouring to participate, but I had to settle their claims for what they perceived to be better turf on the exhibition ground.
The private sector was also much concerned and fuzzy about their facilities, entry passes, servicing their stalls etc. and it was my committees responsibility to attend to their requirements, but my Committee, in the end turned out to be one of the highest contributor to the income of the exhibition.
The Exhibition management structure proved to be solid, united and dynamic and worked with a singleness of purpose. I do not remember any single even a minor failure in the complex spectrum of activities, during the period in which I served as a Committee Chairman, and a Director of the Exhibition grounds. There were well tried and well documented procedures for reporting, monitoring, servicing and for occasional fire-fighting. They never failed. I remember Mr. Ailapperuma issuing what was titled as Orders of the Day at mid-night. These orders which included each and every activity in minute detail for the following day were distributed to all key-officials. I recollect that the Presidents security detail waited to collect the Orders and take them wherever the President was physically present on the following day. The Programme, as issued, was strictly adhered to and could not be changed other than by the Director-General or his Deputy. It was a bureaucratic machinery par excellence.
The Gam Udawa annual programme was not a lone effort by the Housing Ministry, but a national programme supported by the whole Government. We received steady and ungrudging support from the powerful and respected R. Paskaralingam, the Head of the Treasury, who ensured that resources are made available to the implementing agencies in the integrated District Development Programme. M. B. S. Fernando, the Chairman of the Road Development Authority was a tower of strength, who did up all the roads in the District and within the Exhibition Grounds. Mr. Charitha Ratwatte, then the Head of the Youth Affairs Ministry, extended the total support of the NYSC to the exhibition.
Public and private sectors
It was a treat to watch the glamorously dressed NYSC Bands parading the exhibition grounds at regular intervals. M. Marasinghe Perera, the Colombo Municipal Commissioner performed the unenviable task of keeping the grounds and its environs spotlessly clean. There were many others like Jehan Cassim, Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon, Sunil Jayaweera, the Director of Sports in the Education Ministry, M A G Perera, Chairman of the Electricity Board, Peter Perera, Head of the Insurance Corporation, who were closely associated with the exhibition and spent long hours with us in its operation.
The Gam Udawa Exhibition also brought out many innate and hidden talents amongst its vast numbers of workers at all levels, both from the public as well as from the private sectors. They often proved most innovative and creative. I remember the enterprising officials of the Agricultural Department, who under the personal direction of their Minister, Mr. Dharmadasa Banda, successfully installed a paddy field and a vegetable garden, ready for harvesting during the exhibition period. They committed one whole year on this task and ultimately won the prize for the best stall. There was G M H Wijedasa, we called him Duwana Wije, then a Director in the Environmental Authority, who as assigned the task of stores Manager.
He, with the assistance of his daughter, computerized the whole stores management, and could produce any requirement, from a door-mat to bed-room or office furniture at very short notice. One ever-present, non-complaining figure was Sarath Jayatillake, the Working Director of the SEC, who was the sole custodian of the stage, its lights, sound and the decor. Sarath, and his able assistant, Milinda Gunawardena, were also in charge of the dailyflag-hoisting ceremony, which they performed with great finesse. There was Mr. Shelton Fernando of the Town & Country Planning Department, who tended to landscaping of the Gam Udawa site, ensuring that the flowers bloomed and the fountains danced during the exhibition period. One charismatic figure was T. Mahalingam, then the chairman of the Common Amenities Board, the organizer of processions and pageants. I recollect him leading the pageantevery day, in his white suit and white cap, riding a white roadster.
There was Bimal Padmaperuma, Chairman of the SEC, a silent and a resourceful worker, who was tasked with the construction of a Chaithya at each site, which proved to be a quite complicated task and a heavy responsibility. He was also the organiser of the annual Gam Udawa cycle race. Erananda Hettiarachci, the current Director-General of the SLBC was the ever present liaison with the TV and the media. He was also the untiring compere at all principal events, especially at which the President was present. Lakvijaa Palansriya, the present Chairman of the NHDA was responsible for media coverage and produced quite colorful souvenirs and invitation cards. Mr. Madugalle, the Chairman of the Water Bard, was our elder statesman. He ensured the supply of drinking water and co-ordinated other infrastructure facilities, and was an ever present figure in the Secretariat, always dependable to handle an emergency in the absence of the Director-general or his Deputy. A quite fascinating personality was B. Danwatta, the Chief Accountant of the Ministry, who was the Chairman of the Committee on Accommodation. Gam Udawa required vast amounts of temporary accommodation at all levels and Danwatte had a stressful job. His peculiarity was that he always carried his accommodation register under his arm and tolerated no interference even from the high and the mighty.
There was Kodi Dissanayake, the Chief Clerk in the Ministry, who was entrusted with the peculiar task of ensuring that all the flags, not only on the site but anywhere in the District, were flying and flagpoles were not slanting. He and his team had a 24 hour job. From the private sector came many innovative individuals: Jayasiri Semage who created classic artworks and pandals and Wimaladasa of the Renuka Electricals who created beautiful and colorful designs with his lights and illuminations. Wijesekara of the Parakrama Radio was quite innovative with the public address system and his tasty and sober selection of music to be broadcast.
There were many others, recounting about whom will take many more pages. The crux of the success was that they all formed a great team, bound, as I mentioned earlier, in a singleness of purpose. Minister Sirisena Cooray and Ministry Secretary Ailapperuma, extremely patient, resourceful and unflappable, were able to identify capabilities, assign responsibilities correctly and eke out the best out of everybody. They always stood by us, the foot-workers.
Much more can be related of that exhilarating experience of planning, organizing and managing the annual Gam Udawa exhibition. But I conclude by paying a tribute to those Gam Udawa greats who are no longer with us: Michael Joachim, Siri Hattotuwegama, T. Mahalingam, BimalPadmaperuma, Marasinghe Perera, N. D. Peiris, D. Peter S. Perera, Electrical Engineer Gurusinghe, Site Engineer Hemasiri, and Wimaladasa of Renuka Electricals amongst them. May they attain Nibbana.

## Section: Sports
## Date: Saturday, June 23, 2018 - 01:00
KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Two Kandy products coach Kingswood and Joes
Both Kingswood and St. Joseph's will go flat out for victory in the semi finals of the President's trophy knockout tournament, at the Sugathadasa Stadium. Both schools are coached by products of Kandy - Dinesh Gamage of Kingswood and Nilufer Ibrahim of St. Joseph's. Both teams have steadily improved and todays match should be an indicator to that. For Kingswood the forwards will be their main strength with their ball carrying ability and should give the side much needed momentum. Their fly half Asiri Seneviratne is also expected to give off his best by creating opportunities for his team-mates with his impressive skills. For the Josephians although they are playing in Colombo, a win in this all important game is a must. Their backs division comprises good players who are a genuine threat in attack and If they get the ball they are sure to dominate.
Siva to head
The AGM of the Old Trinitians Scrummage will take place today in Colombo, and former Trinity, Combined schools and Kandy SC prop forward Siva Playakats Subramanium is tipped to take over the chairmanship and continue the good work done by the earlier chairman. Scrummages object is to promote the advancement and progress of rugby in concurrence with the Principal, to enlist the support of former rugby players of the school, to foster fellowship among all former rugby players and to raise funds in support of rugby
Golf winners
The Rajawella Victoria Golf and Country resort did well to pocket both men and womens golfing events at the 2nd Victoria Gregory Golf Derby which took place at Rajawella recently. This is the second win for this golf club, they won it in the inaugural year both events. This event was held in the best 18-hole golf courses, which is stretching across a spacious area of 517 acres, the Victoria Golf course is a challenge, because of its terrain, to even veterans of the sport.
Kandys cricket can improve with more support and facilities
Despite 10 schools playing top class cricket in Kandy, the town hasnt been able to play in the Division I of the Premier Cricket Tournament of the country, for a few years now. The main reasons for the drop in club cricketing standards is that the players dont have a regular playground for practices and even for matches. All rivalry and no proper support for players have badly neglected the sport. The two clubs, which are playing Division I cricket, are Kandy Cricket Club and the Kandy Youth Sports Club, while several clubs played in Division II.
Kandy Cricket Club is one of the oldest clubs and in the early days it was known as Kandy SC and played cricket. Later due to BCCSL suspension, they formed the Kandy CC which has produced a galaxy of top players. Kandy Youth SC is not an old club, but play good cricket but hasnt risen to Division I level.
In Kandy, clubs have to play a significant role as nurseries, but it is unfortunate that cricket, at grass root level in clubs, is not as developed as it should be, mainly due to not having proper grounds for practices, clubs are run on a self help basis. They are lucky to have good presidents and committee members, who help to generate funds to keep the clubs alive.
The financial assistance from the controlling body is insufficient as whenever they go out they have to spend a lot on accommodation, food and transport. In the meantime there is a growing list of young schoolboys and school-leavers being attracted to Colombo clubs.
The newly formed Kandy DCA committee is going all out to put things in order.
Maheshika leads Mahamaya to win
Maheshika Hewage led Mahamaya Girls College to emerge champions at the 4th annual inter school swimming championship, which took place at the VA Sugathadasa Stadium. This was their 20th win in a row.
Trinity failed at rugby this season
Trinity College failed to live up to expectations in rugby. They started the season, with a players death through a heat stroke, on the first day's training off a road run when he collapsed and died. Then in the league they were placed sixth the lowest. ranking ever, and in the knockouts came up to the quarters and were shown the exit door.
KMC inter-department football
Due to the keenness of the Mayor Kessara Senanayake to promote sports among the staff, members an inter department 7-a-side football tournament will take place today at the Rakade P.T. Rajan play grounds where over 12 teams will be seen in action. The tournament will be played under the patronage of the Mayor and Opposition leader Sena Dissanayake.
KC AGM
One of the oldest clubs in the Central Province the Kandy Club will holds its AGM next Saturday 30 June in the evening followed by fellowship.
It is customary that the incumbent president will continue as president for a period of not less than three years with some of the committee members of his choice unless some others who are interested come forward to contest.
In the past those who were enrolled as members were of a different caliber and were all professionals and planters, but in this era you hardly get personalities that the club can expect.
Today this club has forgotten all the past good work.
Five schools from England, Australia in Kandy for cricket
Thanks to the efforts of former national cricketer Tony Opatha, young cricketers from England and Australia are to tour the historic city of Kandy and will be playing a couple of under 14, 15 and 17 forty-over matches.
These cricketers who are touring have planned to help poor schools and orphanage schools with cricket equipment, which is going to help them in a big way. The tour details are Dalyellup College and Rostrevor School are from England and others are from Australia, that is Belridge Secondary School, Rostrevor, Merchant Taylor School and Dr. Challoners School.
Radhika now in Nepal
Radika Hettiarachi who learnt his rugby at Dharmaraja College, left for Nepal, to take over as the head coach of their mens and womens rugby teams. Radika was a good wing three quarter.
At club level he first played for Old Trinitians SC, from there he crossed over to Kandy SC and polished his rugby and later played for CH and FC, CR & FC, Upcountry Lions and also led Sri Lanka 7s and XVs. He coached his old school Dharmaraja to win the league.
Boys champion
A Boys team called Central Province Rugby Development team, for which players were selected from Sri Rahula College, Sarasawiuyana MV, S. Thomas College Matale, Chandranda College and Nugawela Central.
This team toured India, to play in a friendly 7 a side rugby tournament at Bhuwaneswaran. According to the manager of the team Srinath de Silva it was organized by JYCA rugby promoter by the name of Yuri Ito.
He was behind organizing this tour, and the team was coached by Nalin Wijesinghe.
Wijawansa did a good job
W.D.O. Wijawansa, known as master Wija for most of the rugby lovers is one of the most successful match commissioners Kandy has seen. A product of Vidyartha College he was in the school staff for well over 20 years and was also one time MIC and POG. He is an Ex-Co member of the Sri Lanka Schools Ruby Association since 1992. He has been match commissioner for 23 games including the Kandy leg of the Bradby.
U15 and U17 cricketers do well

Scores: St. Annes 176 in 63.4 overs (Pasindu Tennakoon 51, Menan Mussamil 37 n.o, Imesh Rathnasiri 29, Shenuk Illukkumbura 5/3, Ranuda Somarathne 2/31); Trinity 167/9 in 54 overs (Rahal Amarasinghe 35, Akram Muthalif 20, Risika Perera 3/25, Menan Mussamil 2/29, Pasindu Thennakoon 2/50).

Vidyartha 62 in 28 overs (Abishek Anandakumar 3/1 Kavindu Dias 2/14 Dewmina Kularatne 2/20).
Indoor Stadium in a mess
The new Kandy Municipal Council indoor stadium with dormitory facilities at Katukelle is in a mess.
A person with no sports back ground has been appointed its head and has messed up in many ways. Now they are trying to do what they did to Bogamabara Stadium - trying to run it under a separate staff. Over to the Mayor to put things in order.

2018 FIFA World Cup:
Why goal keepers are not happy with the official ball
We did not yet reach the levels of Jabulani frenzy but Telstar 18 ball of Adidas is receiving recognizable questions from the goalkeeping community.
Essam El Hadary, the veteran Egyptian goalkeeper has seen more than most over the course of a remarkably enduring career.
This 45-year-old, Hadary hovered to become the oldest player in World Cup history last week, only for Egypt boss Hector Cuper to prefer Mohamed El-Shenawy for the opening Group A loss to Uruguay. Having made his international debut in 1996, El Hadary has lived through the conjecture of numerous supposed advances in match ball technology  a topic for conversation every time a World Cup rolls around as Adidas treat FIFA to their latest much-trumpeted interpretation.
Grumbling from the goalkeeping community is generally never too far behind and its most senior citizen at Russia 2018 let out a weary chuckle when the Telstar 18 came up ahead of Egypts crunch showdown with Russia in St Petersburg.
Yes, we are the victims of FIFA and the ever-developing football, he said. Every four years there are new footballs. The football might be more acceptable to the players than to the goalkeepers. Sometimes there are problems and the goalkeepers are always the victims.
Whenever there are new balls we need to be able to practice more. This ball has some problems but all the goalkeepers are facing that problem.
Maybe the balls are not always of good quality or acceptable to the goalkeepers but as a goalkeeper, we have to be ready.
In fairness, we are nowhere near the levels of Jabulani hysteria  Adidas infamous giant leap for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that Gianluigi Buffon described as horrible amid a wave of criticism that included condemnation from NASA.
But the tally of three direct free-kicks scored at this tournament already matches the number netted during the entirety of Brazil 2014, with further long-range goals casting possible light on the problems El Hadary alludes to.
The sight of two burst Telstar 18s during France v Australia was a moment Adidas will want to forget, given their assurances over a ball engineered to provide performance and durability both in the stadium and on the street, following rigorous testing assisted by the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus.
David de Gea described it as really strange before his performance in Spains 3-3 draw against Portugal that would fit a similar description.
I know what youre talking about. There was a lot of criticism against this ball but we cannot change anything now, Igor Akinfeev, the goalkeeper, and captain of the hosts said as he sounded a more diplomatic tone to El Hadary, while decked out in his Adidas regalia pre-match.
There is a sponsor that brings in the ball for the tournaments like this. We have to keep the ball, we have to make it stick to our palms.
Technologies are improving. Footballers are scoring from 40 meters. A ball is a ball  what can I say
Before a pivotal World Cup encounter at Krestovsky Stadium, it seems the goalkeepers union will once again have a fertile topic for discussion when they line-up in the tunnel.

## Title: Why support Trumps cesspool on Human and Childrens Rights
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Saturday, June 23, 2018 - 01:00
Why support Trumps cesspool on Human and Childrens Rights
Reconciliation and Religion, Human Rights and the Robe of the Sangha, have pushed the political divisions within the Government and the Opposition somewhat to the rear this week, with the politico-tactical and media reverberations on the US withdrawal from the UNHRC and the refusal by Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena to wear the prison uniform for convicts, known as the jumper.
There are strong demands emerging that Sri Lanka should now consider removing its co-sponsorship of the USA-led 2015 resolution of the UNHRC, dealing with issues of peace building, reconciliation and accountability in the post-war context in Sri Lanka. The resolution calls for necessary action on violations of human rights or any war crimes, alleged violations of international humanitarian law, and participation of Commonwealth and other foreign judges in the related Sri Lankan judicial mechanism.
The political strategies of the Opposition, especially the Joint Opposition with the SLPP, will make a strong move to bring pressure on the government, especially the President, to use the US withdrawal as a means to withdraw or reject the UNHRC Resolution. The Rajapaksa forces in the JO and SLPP will strongly support all moves against this Resolution, with narrow political concerns and little interest in human rights aspects.
The UNHRC Resolution 30/1 0f 2015 came for heavy criticism from those politically opposed to the government, and others who consider its contents a danger to the majoritarian concepts of governance in the country. It has prompted much objection as being a threat to the glory and dignity of the War Heroes in the battle against the LTTE, and criticized as giving in to moves of the pro-LTTE Tamil Diaspora active in the West.
The mounting criticism from these diverse quarters, largely in opposition to the Yahapalana government, did often make the government move backwards with regard to support for a resolution it did co-sponsor with the US and many other countries, and exposed the differences in thinking on the related issues between the UNP and SLFP within the coalition of unity. President Sirisena has since said he was both unaware and opposed to having any foreign judges in this context, and was opposed to any moves to bring disrepute to the War Heroes of the country. The UNP leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too had to move away from some of the highly critical aspects of the UNHRC Resolution, especially regarding foreign judges.
Better International Image
A resolution pushed ahead by the Yahapalanaya Coalition in its early period in office, seeking to bring a better international image to Sri Lanka from the near isolation threatening the country from the Mahinda Rajapaksa regimes confrontations with the UNHRC and the international community, has remained one of political disconnect for the government, with the developing clashes between the SLFP and UNP.
The government has made considerable progress on some aspects on peace building and reconciliation as sought by the UNHRC, such as setting up the Office of Missing Persons despite much opposition; increased release of land held by Security Forces in the North, moves for better rehabilitation of those who surrendered to the Security Forces after the defeat of the LTTE. There are issues such as continuance of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in a manner unsuitable in the current context, delays in filing action against those held in custody on matters of terrorism, and questions about the speed and functioning of the judicial process on terrorism related matters.
In this context the call for a withdrawal of the UNHRC resolution gathers content, coming from the pro-Sinhala majoritarian forces, especially the voices of War Heroes, and opposition political forces, particularly the SLPP  led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. The government, and particularly President Sirisena, will be have to face much of these calls, as this can be easily moved into a major political drive against Yahapalanaya, as some commentators in the media have already done.
Cesspool Twist
There is an interesting twist to the situation on US withdrawal from UNHRC. US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has called the UNHRC a cesspool of political bias. The Trump drive against the UNHRC comes as a support for Human Rights, while its real intent, said by Nikki Haley, is objection to its support for the Palestinian and Arab cause against Israel.
The US could not accept its defeat in the Security Council on the killing of more than 60 Palestinians from the Gaza, in the recent critical days of the Nakba Day (Day of Catastrophe) protests, especially when the US moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
What is worse in this US call for Human Rights in opposition to UNHRC is that its withdrawal came at the height of its current and most terrible violation of Human and Childrens Rights, when it put in cages more than 2,500 children, some infants, separated from their parents who tried to enter the US illegally through the southern border. The protests within the US were so strong, compelling Trump to issue an Executive Order, much against his will, to stop the separation of children from parents. Those calling Sri Lanka to follow Donald Trump and the US in withdrawing from the UNHRC should think a little more on the US records on Human Rights on a larger scale, and not be confined to Trumps tactics to Keep America Strong Again.
It is also useful to note that the Trump move was against the Arabs, especially the Palestinians, with whom Sri Lanka has strong ties, and has always supported of the right of the Palestinians to have a two-state settlement with Israel. Any move to follow the US and Donald Trump to move away from the UNHRC, which certainly needs much criticism, will be moving into the anti-Human Rights cesspool largely maintained by the United States.
The Right of the Robe
The new twirl in the twist of politics comes with the refusal by Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera of Bodu Bala Sena to wear the prison uniform for convicts, known as the jumper, after his sentence to rigorous imprisonment for highly unruly and disrespectful behaviour in a court of law, directed at the wife of the still missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda.
This shows a rise in the politics of religion with the Yellow Robe used as a major political icon, moving it away from the sacerdotal garb of monkhood that is so special to the culture and traditions of Buddhism. The calls from some members of the Maha Sangha and politicians, as well as academics and professionals promoting and emphasizing the religious dominance of Buddhism in this country, against any move to compel Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera to wear the jumper that is the traditional garb of a convict in prison raises many issues relating to religion and government, and the equality in enforcement of the law in the country.
While Nayaka Theras of some chapters and units of the Nikayas have written to President Sirisena on the matter, there are also street protests and calls for stronger protests and agitations if the prison regulations are to be enforced regarding the dress behaviour of this monk. It is certainly moving to a situation calling into question the basics of democratic society and governance, with attempts to push forward the concepts of a religion, and not, a law based society.
Sangha Sabhava
There is one political leader, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, from the political party that promoted Buddhist monks into parliament, suggesting that matters such as the garb of a Buddhist monk in prison should be decided by the Mahanayaka Theras or a special Sangha Sabhava. There is little thought given as to what such moves can cause in the context of unity in a society that has several religions, entitled to equal rights, while predominance is given to Buddhism in the Constitution. It is significant to note that the Bodu Bala Sena and Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera is one who has paid hardly attention to such equality among religions, which is better remembered by politicians, and future presidential hopefuls too, who have Iftar celebrations at Beruwela, where the Bodu Bala Sena was hugely, violently and tragically active in 2014.
Do politicians who seek Sangha Sabhas to decide on the handling of members of the Sangha, also call for Members of Parliament, and not the judiciary, to decide on how those who obtain crooked funds for election campaigns or any other purpose, should be dealt with
The Minister of Justice and Prison Reform Thalatha Atukorale, has made it clear that the Prison Regulations should be observed with regard to the garb of inmates, including those of the clergy of any faith. It is in the interests of democracy and social equality that such a position is followed by the government and its leaders; despite the popularity that some in key positions may try to achieve, by giving a pardon to the anti-jumper convict or give a new twist to the Constitutional provisions of Buddhism.

Alleged Rs. 16 billion revenue fraud for BMW imports
Writ petition fixed for June 29
A writ petition that sought an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Director General of Customs to conduct a formal Customs Inquiry into the alleged Rs. 16 billion revenue fraud which took place while importing 1675 units of high valued BMW Motor Cars during the last regime was yesterday fixed for June 29 by Court of Appeal.
This writ petition was filed by Murugesu Thayabaran, a former Director of the Central Investigation Directorate attached to Sri Lanka Customs through his counsel Nagananda Kodituwakku.
When the matter came up before Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara, Mr. Kodituwakku sought an order to impound the passport of Heinz Adolf Reuter, the Chairman/Managing Director of Prestige Automobiles Pvt Ltd.
This case is to be heard in a different Bench on June 29.
The petitioner cited Director General of Customs Chulananda Perera, Additional Director General of Customs T.W.A. Senanayake, Deputy Director of Customs Saman de Silva, Heinz Adolf Reuter, the Chairman/ Managing Director Prestige Automobiles Pvt Ltd and Attorney General as respondents.
The Petitioner stated that during his tenure in the Customs Department, he had conducted a number of revenue fraud inquiries amongst which the matter referred to in this Petition is the biggest fraud ever detected by the Customs, the value of which is running into over 16 billion of government tax revenue defrauded by the 4th Respondent.
The Petitioner stated that the revenue fraud reported herein involves the importation of 1675 units of high valued BMW Motor Cars during the the period commencing from March 2011 to Oct 2014.
The Petitioner stated that all the vehicles referred to in this case have been imported on tax concessions granted to permits issued by the government to certain categories of people holding public office, wherein strict conditions had been stipulated in the permits, which included the specified sealing on the engine capacity and the value of the vehicle.
The Petitioner stated that in the permit itself, it is stipulated inter alia that any violation of the valuation threshold mentioned therein would result in the recovery of all levies exempted at the time of importation.
The Petitioner states that the evidence of the valuation of BMW motorcars provided to Sri Lanka Customs by the German Customs Investigation Bureau, during the pendency of the investigation, confirmed that the exporter had declared the true value to the German Customs whereas the 4th Respondent Chairman/Managing Director of Prestige Automobiles Pvt Ltd had deliberately concealed it and instead had allegedly presented a fictitious made-up invoice generated by another business entity namely Navigare International GMBH, Germany, apparently owned by the 4th Respondents created for the purpose of promoting 4th Respondents motorcar trade in Sri Lanka.
The Petitioner states that the investigation findings had revealed that the total number of 1,675 units of BMW motorcars had been imported under the tax concessionary permits with false values declared in order to be qualified to claim tax concession, thereby evading the payment of levies actually payable on those vehicles.
Yet, it was further revealed that the 4th Respondent had recovered the true value of the vehicles from the permit holders under a false pretence that the said recovery was for handling and aftersales services, he added. The Petitioner stated that had the true value of the vehicles been declared, the permits would have become a nullity since one of the primary conditions of the permits, the specified valuation threshold has been violated.
The Petitioner stated that the 4th Respondent had been allegedly engaged in this fraudulent trade practice for a considerable period of time and in some cases where BMW motorcars had been imported on concessionary permit schemes, the Customs Department has been able to recover the Original invoice sent by the BMW car manufacturer in Germany to the 4th Respondents Company and also the fictitious invoice generated by Navigare International GMBH in Germany for the identical vehicle, to claim the special concessionary rate of levy chargeable for permit cars.
The Petitioner states that there is a deliberate failure on the part of the 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent to perform their offices as required by law which clearly amounts to abusing, exceeding or misusing of the powers vested in the 1st and 3rd Respondents for improper purposes. The Petitioner states that therefore, on April 27,2017 he made a formal complaint on this serious abuse to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption drawing its due attention to this major revenue fraud running into over 16 billion rupees.

Zimbabwe President Mnangagwa survives Bulawayo explosion

Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa has survived an apparent bomb attack in the city of Bulawayo.
Video footage from White City Stadium appears to show an explosion happening close to Mnangagwa as he was leaving the stage having addressed supporters.
While the president was unhurt, state TV reports that Vice-President Kembo Mohadi has suffered a leg injury.
President Mnangagwa came into power last November, ousting his former mentor Robert Mugabe.
The president was in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, to campaign for his Zanu-PF party ahead of nationwide elections taking place on 30 July.
The elections are the first in Zimbabwe since Mugabe was ousted after 37 years in power.
Presidential spokesman George Charamba issued a statement confirming Mnangagwa was safe and recalling: "There have been multiple attempts on the president's life over the past five years."
It is not clear how severe the injuries to Second Vice-President Kembo Mohadi are.
The Zimbabwe Herald newspaper described the explosion as an assassination attempt on the president.

All graduates should be given employment
Unemployed graduates should be recruited to employments, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Head Office on Darley Road, Colombo. The event on the Visanduma Project implementation in August this year was organized by the SLFP Youth Front.
He said country has around 57,000 unemployed graduates and the SLFP Youth Front should suggest President Maithripala Sirisena to recruit them to public service. "They should be recruited to the service since the non compatibility of their education with the job market is not their problem," Shantha Bandara said.
"It is a problem with the education that they had to follow," he said.
.He said the Visanduma project was designed following an year long discussions with youth from all districts including Badulla, Jaffna, Moneragala, Hambantota, Polonnaruwa, and Anuradhapura and it was presented in April in 2017. He said it was mainly designed to eradicate the youth unrest by providing them better employment opportunities.
"The programme would train the youth to cater the existing enormous job market in the country," Shantha Bandara said. "There are many jobs in the country and abroad for our youths," he said.
He said undergrads' qualifications are not fitting for them to get those employments.
"So we set up the Sri Lanka Institute of Career Guidance (SLCIG) and the Institutes of Career Guidance (ICGs) at the provincial levels," Bandara said. "The SLCIG would seek and collect employment opportunities at local and international level and then direct them to the ICGs to provide the training. Then they would be directed to the employments," he said.
SLFP Youth Front secretary Eric Weerawardena and Kalutara District SLFP Organizer Asanka Ediriweera spoke.

Sri Lanka has a skilled and talented workforce, and it will be expanded further in the near future, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
He was visiting the Koggala Free Trade Zone on Thursday.
The Minister inspected factories and addressed employees' issues. The Minister also vested a volleyball court constructed with the Shrama Wasana Fund with the public.
The Shrama Wasana Fund facilitates 8.6 million workers in the country. During the past 20 years, the fund provided scholarships, and welfare, empowerment and awareness programmes.
The fund also helps the workforce invest in their own businesses. The ministry constructed a dental clinic in the Biyagama Tree Trade Zone and three volleyball courts in the Katunayake, Avissawella and Koggala Free Trade Zones, the Minister said.
The Minister said the management and the employees in free trade zones have a good rapport. We will uplift the standards of the employees and do our best to protect investors as well, he said.
The Minister said the government has not set dates for the provincial elections, and it is too early to say about a new UNP leadership.
The Minister said he was disappointed as a Buddhist about the decision made by a Magistrate's Court on Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera. But we should make way to the law, he said.

Argentine fans weep as World Cup dream fades
BUENOS AIRES, Friday: The party at the Buenos Aires fanzone fell flat as a crowd expecting a Messi-inspired Argentina World Cup revival could only watch in horror at as the nadir of Nizhny Novgorod unfolded.
We lost very badly, they really humiliated us this time, said 22-year-old Joaquin. And now, on top of that, were depending on Nigeria!
After the abject 3-0 loss to Croatia, the team will have to beat Nigeria in their final game and hope other results go their way to advance.
For even the most passionate fans here, that seems a tall order now.
Lionel Messi came in for particular criticism after an under-par performance.
Messi, who keeps winning for Barcelona, who continues to deliver triumph after triumph for Barcelona, has given us nothing but defeats and sadness, said an angry Miguel Angel Gutierrez, 50, wearing an Albiceleste wig.
But this was no party in Buenos Aires as fans young and old hid their sky blue-and-white painted faces in their hands, the classic reflexes of cinemagoers at a horror movie.
Some wept and others hugged each other like survivors at a disaster scene. One man stood and gestured angrily at the big screen as passes went astray on the pitch in Russia.

ARMY DENIES CANARD ON ALLEGED WITHDRAWALS
The Sri Lanka Army denied reports that it was withdrawing several formations from the North and the East.
Issuing a media release, the Army said this is a canard reportedly made by disgruntled political elements desperately attempting to mislead the public.
The Sri Lanka Army categorically denies having taken any such decision, nor has it contemplated implementing a move of that nature at all as alleged by those elements who try to showcase that they are more patriotic than members of the armed forces in the country, the release said.
The Army while continuing amalgamation process without closing down any camp in the North and East maintains combat readiness and efficiency in combat at all times at strategic and operational level and is always committed to enhance its efficiency at all levels.
The truth is that many in the civil society have no understanding on some of the military parlance, like amalgamation and combat efficiency. Similarly, the Army currently engaged in its annual recruitment drive plans to recruit 213 Officers and 8631 Other Rankers to the Regular Force and 97 Officers and 4252 Other Rankers to the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force for the year 2018.
The Army which has brought peace to this country after so many years would be the happiest in peacetime and is committed all the time to safeguard the national security interests of the country on a priority basis than anyone else.
It is therefore requested that those supper patriots to desist from bringing this unique organization to public ridicule by spreading blatant lies and misleading false information, the release said.

Belgium face Tunisia at World Cup with eye on England
MOSCOW, Friday - Belgium take on Tunisia on Saturday with their eyes set on the knockout round of the World Cup but fearful that star forward Eden Hazard is set for another bruising encounter.
The Belgians want to win at the Spartak Stadium in Moscow to avoid making their final group game against England on June 28 a make-or-break qualification affair.
The Red Devils opened their account in Russia with a 3-0 win over Panama on Monday, when Romelu Lukaku netted twice, but Hazard was tightly marked and occasionally clattered by the Central American opponents.
Belgium coach Roberto Martinez hopes the Chelsea player will not get the same treatment from Tunisia.
It is a worry that in any of those tackles he could really get hurt, said Belgiums Spanish coach. It doesnt worry me if that is just their way of trying to stop him.
History favours the Belgians. They are yet to lose to African opposition at a World Cup, while Tunisia have never beaten a European side at a finals.
The experienced Oussama Haddadi is set to replace Ali Maaloul at left-back in the Tunisian defence and Martinez saw plenty of danger for his team in the north Africans opening 2-1 defeat to England.
They have a lot of bravery and theyre very dynamic, Martinez said.
The players have a good understanding between each others and they can bring energy and intensity on counter-attacks. They play direct, efficient football.
After seeing Lukaku and Dries Martens grab the goals against Panama, Hazard wants to add some goals of his own.  AFP

Brazil edge towards World Cup knockouts after Costa Rica late show
SAINT PETERSBURG Friday: Philippe Coutinho and Neymar broke down dogged Costa Rica in injury time on Friday, sealing a 2-0 win for Brazil that propels the five-time champions towards the World Cup last 16.
The Central Americans looked likely to hold on for a hard-earned draw, particularly after Neymar had a penalty award chalked off by referee Bjorn Kuipers after he consulted the Video Assistant Referee.
But Coutinho and Neymar finally broke through, scoring in the 91st and 97th minutes to put Tites side on the brink of the knockout stages.
At the final whistle, Neymar sat down on the grass and wept, with the emotion of victory hitting home after the tense Group E contest at the Saint Petersburg Stadium.
Neymar started despite limping out of training on Tuesday with a hurt ankle, which the Brazilian FA said was sustained as a result of snapping Swiss defenders.
After a ponderous start, Brazil enjoyed a gradual crescendo during the first period but their dominance in possession was not reflected in chances created.
Neymar faced the most devoted of markers in Costa Ricas Cristian Gamboa, the Brazilian spending most of the half hopping over scything tackles or dodging past a barging shoulder.
It was a compelling battle. One sumputous Neymar flick sent the ball flying over Gamboas head andlater he made an excellent run onto Coutinhos pass, only to squander the chance with a heavy touch.
Marcelo, Coutinho and Neymar, however, hardly make for the most conscientious combination out wide and when Johan Venegas ran clear down the right, his pullback should have been converted by Celso Borges, who skewed past the post.
Brazil might have had a penalty when Oscar Duarte blocked Paulinho at a corner and Costa Rica rode their luck again after the break, as Neymar, Gabriel Jesus and Coutinho all went close.
Jesuss header crashed against the crossbar and after some excellent work by Paulinho, Coutinhos follow-up hit the ever-present Gamboa on the line.
Neymar fired over from Paulinhos cutback and Coutinho shot straight at Keylor Navas after, again, Paulinho had teed it up. AFP

Depleted Sri Lanka look to make big closing statement
BRIDGETOWN, Friday - The lead up to the third and final Test has not been ideal for Sri Lanka, with Dinesh Chandimal suspended after he was caught on camera attempting to alter the condition of the ball during the second days play of the second Test, which ended in a draw in Gros Islet earlier this week.
Sri Lanka had already lost the services of Angelo Mathews and Lahiru Gamage, and with their captain first suspended and then choosing to appeal the sanction, the focus might have been a bit off over the past few days. But down 1-0 in the series, the visitors will have to put everything else behind them and put their best foot forward come Saturday at Kensington Oval.
After losing the opening Test in Port of Spain, Sri Lanka fought back well in Gros Islet. They got into a position from where they could pull level, but a dogged effort from Kraigg Brathwaite and spells of rain ensured the Windies came out with a draw.
Squaring the series will not be easy against an opposition that seems to be firing as a unit.
For the Windies, the batting hasnt always worked as well as Jason Holder would have wanted, but the pacers have done a fabulous job so far.
Shannon Gabriel, who returned extraordinary figures of 13/121 in the previous Test and leads the wicket-takers chart with 17 strikes in the two games, has looked lethal with both the new and the old ball. He has been well backed up by Kemar Roach, Holder and Miguel Cummins. Being a day-night game, the Windies pacers might be even tougher to handle.
The top order has had starts all through the series, but barring the century by Shane Dowrich in the first innings of the opening Test, no one has been able to breach the three-figure mark yet. They will hope to rectify this going into the final game of the series.
For Sri Lanka, the batsmen will need to find a way to tackle the threat of Gabriel, who has been a revelation this series. The best of the visiting batsmen have been Kusal Mendis and Chandimal, but with Chandimal out, someone else has to put his hand up.
Mahela Udawatte had an unimpressive debut with scores of 0 and 19, while Dhananjaya de Silva has also struggled since rejoining the team. Roshen Silva and Niroshan Dickwella did find some form in the second innings of the second Test but it is the big runs that the visitors will want from them.
The bowlers have done a reasonable job so far. Suranga Lakmal and Lahiru Kumara have been on the money right from the word go while Kasun Rajitha in his maiden Test did an excellent job picking up five wickets at a decent economy rate.
Sri Lanka and the Windies have played a day-night Test before, both against Pakistan. That means they both have an inkling of how the pink ball behaves under lights and will hope to use the expertise.
The Kensington Oval surface has historically supported the fast bowlers, and being a day-night Test much of the same is expected. The threat of rain, however, remains ever present.
Squads:
WEST INDIES: Jason Holder (captain), Devendra Bishoo, Devon Smith, Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich (wk), Shannon Gabriel, Jahmar Hamilton, Keemo Paul, Shai Hope, Kemar Roach
SRI LANKA: Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Mahela Udawatte, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Perera, Roshen Silva, Dasun Shanaka, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Kasun Rajitha, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, Asitha Fernando, Dhananjaya de Silva

Ending the Human-Leopard conflict
Sri Lanka is a wildlife and biodiversity hotspot well known for its unique flora and fauna. Hundreds of animal and plant species are endemic to Sri Lanka and we must ensure that these species survive and thrive. Otherwise, they will join the thousands of species that have gone extinct over the last few hundred years due to destructive activities of Man. It will be a sad day indeed if we have to visit a zoo to see an animal like the leopard and if we dont tread carefully, even that chance may be lost.
Sri Lanka has earned a worldwide reputation for its unique leopard species Panthera pardus kotiya which can primarily be seen at Yala National Park (it is called Diviya in Sinhalese and Siruththai in Tamil). However, they live in several other areas as well. But they are rapidly losing their habitat as human settlements increase and jungle territory is being reclaimed for agriculture and livestock purposes. This decreases the area available for these apex predators to hunt and survive. As their food supply dwindles, they sometimes target livestock and may tend to attack any humans who stand in the way. Much the same story can be applied to elephants losing their habitat, apart from the fact that they do not seek livestock.
There have been several disturbing killings of leopards in several areas in recent months. The most recent incident is reported from Kilinochchi, where a group of villagers had captured and killed a leopard after it had reportedly attacked and injured nearly10 people in the village of Ambakulam.
Although the villagers had not apparently tried to inform Wildlife officials in the previous instances, the Kilinochchi villagers had done so, according to our reporters in the area. The leopard had attacked and injured a man looking after cattle, after which the villagers had again informed the Wildlife Officers. According to the accounts of the reporters, there had been no response from Wildlife officials and the villagers had rather unfortunately taken matters into their own hands, resulting in the tragic killing of the leopard.
A heartbreaking video of men killing the leopard has gone viral on social media (it is too gruesome to be shown on mainstream TV) which has prompted condemnation by animal welfare activists with a question mark on the role played by the Wildlife officers, whom according to our reporters were lethargic and late on acting on the complaints of the villagers. The helpless leopard was the unfortunate victim of the villagers anger as well as the wildlife officials inefficiency.
Whatever the circumstances, the unnatural death of a leopard is a huge loss. We cannot however pass judgment in this instance without a thorough investigation being conducted into the whole episode, but to be fair by the villagers one must not overlook the fact they had sought the intervention of the Wildlife Department possibly with a view to relocating the animal. The lead in this regard must be taken by Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and his Deputy Minister Palitha Thevarapperuma. The latter was recently seen climbing a jak tree to pluck a fruit to feed an injured elephant calf who could not walk properly. This shows a hands-on approach and we hope the duo will do the needful in this particular case.
It is also quite necessary to conduct a survey to identify the number of leopards living in habitats other than the Yala National Park. This will give wildlife officials an idea about the next steps that should be taken to protect the members of this vulnerable species. We can also look towards India, which has a similar Tiger-Human conflict, to learn some lessons on co-existing with predatory animals. The Indian authorities and conservationists have devised many programmes and conducted awareness campaigns on co-existing with the 4,000 Tigers living in the wild. The Bera village in Rajasthan, where millionaire landowner Devi Singh devised a unique programme to stop the Tiger-Human conflict, has now become a prime example for human-animal cohabitation. Another example is the Soliga tribes people who live in harmony with Bengal Tigers in the Biligiri Rangana Hills in Karnataka, South India.
The Sri Lankan leopard is already on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, with less than 1,000 individuals left in the wild. We must remember that it is not found in the wild anywhere else in the world  there are however several living in captivity in zoos overseas (two cubs Yala and Nimala were born to a couple of Sri Lankan leopards living at a Zoo in Norfolk, England in January this year). Every attempt must be made to protect and conserve them. Sri Lanka must join worldwide efforts to protect the big cats which include not only lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar -- the four largest wild cats that can roar - but also cheetah, snow leopard, puma and clouded leopard. These are the most magnificent animals on Earth and it would indeed be a disaster if they were to disappear.
