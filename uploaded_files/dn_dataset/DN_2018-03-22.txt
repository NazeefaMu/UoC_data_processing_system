Lanka has made progress in promoting reconciliation and human rights
The relevant institutions will work according to the Constitution and law of the country when implementing the accountability measures in Sri Lanka, said Secretary to the President Austin Fernando.
Stating that accountability measures that need to be implemented in Sri Lanka will be discussed in Geneva, Fernando added that accountability mechanisms would follow the Constitution and law of the country.
Fernando made this statement at the launch of a programme to support reconciliation in Sri Lanka by the Ministry of National Integration and reconciliation, the European Union and the German Government at the Taj Samudra Hotel, Colombo yesterday.
He further said that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, also mentioned in Sri Lanka responding to a question raised by media that every country has its own view and accountability mechanisms need to be implemented in line with the Constitution.
In the meantime Fernando added that country has made progress in the implementation of resolution 30/1 on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights.
Fernando said that Sri Lankas Judicial system was questioned but the truth is the country has achieved certain things.
We assume that we would be able to do it better,he said.
He said after the present government came into power, they had to work out some systems and approaches to ensure that reconciliation takes place.
In the resolution that was passed by the United Nations Human Rights Commission on Sri Lanka, we agreed on four pillars of reconciliation. We said we will look into the missing persons issue. Therefore, we appointed a truth and reconciliation commission and established office for missing persons. Secondly, we agreed to look into accountability mechanisms and thirdly, we agreed to work on reconciliation and the fourth pillar was the steps to be taken for non-recurrence. We have government appointed group of people from various communities to look into these issues, he explained.
He said they are yet to see the outcome of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC).
Then we worked on Office of Missing persons (OMP), there were criticisms but we faced them all succesfully. The commissioners have been appointed and they have received more than thousands of applications. The other was the reparation unit. We presented the concept paper prepared to the cabinet two weeks before and now its with the legal draftsman. We hope to present it to the Parliament soon, he said.
The reconciliation programme launched is worth Rs 2.7 Billion, and it will be conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Co-existence, Dialogue and Official languages, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) as well as other relevant line ministries and civil society organizations. It will be implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenabeit (GIZ) and the British Council.
The goal of the four year programme is to support government, non-government and grassroots organisations in the national reconciliation process. The primary focus of the programme is to track progress on reconciliation, facilitate learning and strengthen institutions at national and sub-national levels as well as promote public engagement in policy making.

AIA Smart Pensions makes  retirement planning smarter
AIA Insurance has designed AIA Smart Pensions a comprehensive pensions solution packed with features that help your plan for retirement in a smart manner.
In retirement planning, it is always smarter to start saving early. The earlier you start saving, the more time you give yourself to build a healthy retirement fund.
AIA Smart Pensions recognizes this and rewards timely planning with the unique feature of Loyalty Additions, which can be as much as 1,750% of your annual basic premium. If you start early and save longer you will get higher benefits- for example, if you start early and save for 20 years, the Loyalty Addition is 1,225% whereas it is 825% for the savings period of 15 years (for annual mode premiums).
The other important aspect of retirement planning is how you receive your monthly income after retirement. With AIA Smart Pensions, you can decide on the period for which youd like to receive a monthly income after retirement and this can be up until youre 100 years old! So you know youll have an income to depend on as you get older.
Another smart and unique feature of AIA Smart Pensions is that it helps you manage inflationary effects during the pension payout phase. It allows for this by ensuring a growing monthly pension for you in retirement so you can combat the inevitable inflation that takes place. This happens with the Pension Booster feature, which pays out an additional 30% on top of the declared dividend on your pension fund, during your chosen monthly pension payout period.
And of course you want to ensure your family is well looked after if and when you are no longer around.Smart Pensions lets you do just that with a life insurance that will allow them to be financially secure. And should you pass away prematurely, AIA will continue to make premium payments on your behalf so that the family will continue to get the monthly pension just as you had planned for them.

CCEMs role in making economic decisions to be discussed
The President has agreed to discuss the role of the Prime Ministers Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) in making economic decisions in the country, said Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, yesterday.
The President had earlier asked that the CCEM be abolished and that all economic policies be decided through the Presidents National Economic Council (NEC), which the Prime Minister is also a part of.
The problem here was that every paper, before being sent to the Cabinet, went through the CCEM and even I did not like the fact that many of my papers were stuck there because of the workload, explained Minister Senaratne, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department.
Even if you need to build a hospital, it would go there, added the Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister.
The Minister stated that they had proposed that the CCEM only deal with mega development projects and have Cabinet projects, which need further studying, directed to them rather than them approving everything.
He indicated that the Prime Minister had agreed to this proposal.
The President, he revealed, has submitted a Cabinet paper on the CCEM on Tuesday (20) and agreed to come to terms with the Prime Minister on the CCEM in the near future.

Facebook CEO Zuckerberg admits mistakes in data leak scandal

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted on Wednesday that his company has made mistakes in a data leak that caused grave concern about user privacy possibly abused for political purposes.
"We also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it," he said in a statement.
Facebook has been plunged into a turmoil after U.S. and British media reported that the data of more than 50 million Facebook users were inappropriately used by a British data analysis company, Cambridge Analytica, in activities allegedly connected with U.S. President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign.
Zuckerberg said Facebook will take measures to prevent this from happening again.
"I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again," he said.
The world's largest social media company suffered the biggest one-day drop of its stocks by 7 percent on Wall Street on Monday in four years following the reported data leakage.
Also on Monday, Facebook announced on Monday that it has hired digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to investigate the alleged leakage of its users' data.

Facebook shares continued to slide on Tuesday, amid ongoing furore concerning the use of data collected by the social network.
The firm's stock closed down 2.6%, following a steep decline a day earlier.
The concerns infected fellow social media company Twitter, which was down more than 10%.
Investors are reacting to calls for tighter regulation of tech firms from politicians in the US, UK and Europe.
On Tuesday, US media reported that the Federal Trade Commission, a US regulator, is looking into Facebook's handling of personal data.
The questions follow allegations that 50 million Facebook users' private information was misused by a political consultancy firm.
Cambridge Analytica (CA), used by the Trump campaign in the 2016 US election, has been accused of taking personal data without users' knowledge.
The firm's chief executive Alexander Nix has been suspended by the company's board. (BBC)

Google pledges $300m to support journalism and fight fake news
Google has said it will invest $300m in helping news organisations to fight fake news and grow their businesses.
The search engine giant will also invest in new technological tools to enhance online news consumption.
The firm, which some argue has taken advertising money away from newspapers, acknowledged journalism was under pressure in the digital age.
However, it said it had a shared mission with the industry and wanted to support its future.
The search giant said it had already tweaked its search algorithms to recognise misinformation, but would now go further. In the past Google itself has been criticised for promoting fake articles, for example, in 2017 claiming that the shooter who killed more than 50 people in Las Vegas was a Democrat who opposed Donald Trump.
It said will now launch an initiative called Disinfo Lab, which will use computational tools and journalistic oversight to monitor misinformation during elections. (BBC)

Govt looking at alternative sources of financing
The government which will have to pay close to US$ 731.9 million during the first quarter of this year alone in debt repayments is looking to alternative sources of financing in Foreign Currency Term Financing Facilities, Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBU) or Off-shore Banking unit loans from domestic banks.
The Ministry having held discussions with the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank informed cabinet that there was a possibility of raising a maximum of USD 300 million from one or both banks through their FCBU or off shore banking units.
Cabinet approval was thus granted to use the USD 300 million for retiring the Sri Lanka Development Bonds in full or partially.
Acting Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne submitting the paper to Cabinet this week explained the reasons as to why the Ministry had chosen to go with the above options.
The Budget 2018 had proposed a borrowing limit of Rs 1,895 billion for 2018 but during the first quarter itself Rs 480.8 billion of Treasury Bills and Bonds are due to mature together with USD 889.8 million of Sri Lanka Development Bonds.
Thus during the first quarter of 2018, foreign debt servicing and repayment are estimated to be around USD 731.9 million.
Wickramaratne thus noted that since December 2017, interest rates of the government securities have shown an upward trajectory and that any additional tapping in the domestic market could further pressurize the interest rates to increase.
Further, given that 58 percent of the total debt repayments and servicing is due during the first half of 2018, it was important that the financing options are carefully examined and should the government access the domestic market heavily in the first quarter of 2018, there was a high probability that yields of the government securities market would see a significant increase creating a high benchmark which will have a negative impact on the borrowing of the government.
Rising US Federal Reserve rates, indicating one of more increases in the interest rate in 2018 with the reversal of quantitative easing and rising inflation pressures in the US also makes the outlook for emerging economies such as Sri Lanka uncertain.
The government which will look to the alternatives above also authorized the Secretary to the Treasury, Deputy Secretaries to the Treasury and Director General, Department of Treasury Operations to sign the necessary documents on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka.

The number of institutions under Labour Department inspection will be increased from 75,000 to 90,000 this year and arrangements in this regard have now been finalized, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry Secretary Nimal Saranatissa said.
He said the system of inspections will be accelerated to ensure that quick legal action is taken against errant institutions denying employee rights and privileges.
He said earlier, inspections were delayed due to a shortage of labour officers. An additional batch of nearly 200 labour officers has now been recruited and trained to be deployed for duty from March 26.
He said the new recruits would be assigned to districts which experience a shortage and they would inspect institutions denying EPF and ETF rights to their employees under a special plan devised by the ministry.

James Packer quits Crown Resorts over mental health
Australian billionaire James Packer has resigned as a director of his casino empire Crown Resorts Limited.
The businessman is "suffering from mental health issues", a spokesman for his private investment company said.
Packer, 50, rejoined the board of Crown in August after stepping down in 2015 as chairman and director.
The Australia-listed company thanked Packer, one of the nation's richest people, in a brief statement on Wednesday.
"We have appreciated James' contribution to the board and respect his decision to step down from his role as director at this time," executive chairman John Alexander said.
A spokesman for Packer's Consortium Press Holdings, Crown's largest shareholder, said the magnate "intends to step back from all commitments".
Earlier this month, Packer sold more than A$100m ($76m; 55m) worth of Crown shares. He retains a dominant stake of about 47% in the company, which owns casinos in Australia and London.
He had only rejoined Crown's board last year after the company exited its Macau and US investments, and switched its focus back to Australia.
It followed the jailing of 16 Crown employees in China for illegally promoting gambling.
His resignation comes after a tumultuous period for the billionaire, who was caught up in a scandal involving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month.
Israel's Channel 10 reported in December that Packer told investigators he gave the prime minister and his wife Sara gifts.
Packer's high-profile split from singer Mariah Carey in 2016 also gained wide public attention, as did his street brawl with an Australian TV executive in 2014. (BBC)

Japanese Envoy says No to foreign judges
Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma said yesterday that his government was not of the opinion that foreign jurists should be brought to Sri Lanka to evaluate claims of human rights violations.
Responding to a reporters question about the matter, Ambassador Suganuma said the Sri Lankan government has the capability to investigate alleged violations and bring those involved to justice.
UNHRC Resolution 34/1, to which Sri Lanka was a signatory in 2017, provides for foreign participation in the countrys post-war accountability and reconciliation process.
The involvement of foreign jurist to investigate whether human rights violations took place in the last phase of the countrys twenty-six- year civil war has been requested by many in the international community, as well as by the domestic Consultation Task Force (CTF) on Reconciliation Mechanisms appointed by the Prime Minister.
Ambassador Suganuma also said that he believed the Sri Lankan government has the resources required to handle incidents such as the recent religiously-motivated violence in the Kandy District.
He added that the Japanese government would offer technical assistant or legal advice only when asked.
He made these remarks at the conclusion of a grant-contract signing ceremony at the Japanese Embassy in Colombo. The contracts, marking the Japanese governments decision to provide grants for an agricultural project in Ampara and a fishery in Mannar, were signed by the ambassador and representatives of the affiliated Sri Lanka NGOs.
Speaking on the projects, Ambassador Suganuma said, We are advocating inclusive development for the country.
The first project, for the rehabilitation of a tank in the conflict-affected Ampara District, is to be implemented by the Child Rehabilitation Center with a grant of USD $134,448 (approximately Rs. 20.2 million).
Through the renovation of the Koongaswewa Tank in the district, the project aims to improve the livelihood of 3,120 community members in 780 families, including IDPs (internally displaced persons) and low-income farmers. The second project, for the improvement of sundried fish production by low income women in Mannar, is to be implemented by the Soba Kantha Environment Management and Community Development Foundation with a grant of USD $78,364 (approximately Rs. 11.8 million).
This project will provide dried fish production facilities to the womens group, benefitting around 60 women and their families, as well as support fish waste disposal methods, thereby improving the hygiene, sanitation, and environment around the facilities.

MoU to establish Health Evaluation Programme for Resident Visa Applicants
A MoU is to be signed between the International Organization of Migration (IOM) and the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine to establish and implement a Health Evaluation Programme for Resident Visa Applicants to Sri Lanka.
Cabinet granted approval to the MoU this week.
Sri Lankas National Migration Health Policy was developed and launched in 2013 to address challenges in the health sector due to a multi-faceted migration profile which includes outbound migration, inbound migration, international migration and health and social issues of families left behind of labour migrants.
Whilst extending universal health coverage to all who enter the country, immigrants may also introduce new diseases, reintroduce diseases which have been eliminated or be a reason for the increase in low prevalent diseases in the country, stated a Cabinet Paper submitted by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
Sri Lanka receives 40,000 long stay or resident visa applications per year and around 60 percent of them are from migrant workers arriving from countries with higher disease burden than Sri Lanka. Currently, there is no process to assess their health status and nor are they requested to obtain a health insurance to cover their health expenditure while they are in Sri Lanka, the Minister said.
The objective of the MoU is to facilitate the establishment of a health assessment process to achieve a healthy migrant population through public health approach including early diagnosis, treatment, referral and follow up of resident visa applicants, Minister Senaratne said.
The proposed MoU will be valid for a period of three years and would spell out the roles and responsibilities of the two parties concerned.

Minister Marapana said that the government was also planning measures to ensure a non-recurrence of such violence in the future.
Marapana also highlighted a host of measures taken over the recent past to address human rights concerns in line with its UN Human Rights Council commitments, including the operationalisation of the Office off Missing Persons, the enactment of the Enforced Disappearances Act, ongoing discussions on the draft counter-terrorism legislation to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act and a bill to set up the Reparations Office recently approved by Cabinet.
He also said that about 70 per cent of the lands in the former conflict affected areas which were held by the military have now been returned to their original owners.
Marapana spoke after Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights at the UNHRC Kate Gilmore gave details about UNHRC recommendations and other relevant processes related to reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka.
She apprised the gathering about the progress Sri Lanka has made on the promotion and protection of human rights and issues that need further attention.

Parents oppose KDU MBBS for all SAITM students
The parents of students in state medical faculties are against the awarding of the KDU (SAITM) MBBS degree to all students absorbed into the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU).
State Medical Students Parents Union Secretary, attorney Gamini Ekanayake said there are 101 unqualified students in SAITM and 40 of them have only Ordinary Level passes while another 28 of them have three simple passes in Advanced level examination (3S).Efforts are being made by a handful of parents to lobby for them to gain a KDU (SAITM) MBBS which does not have SLMC recognition.
The President is listening to advice offered to him by a few persons who do not have any background or understanding on medical education.One of them is a strong pro-SAITM person. A justifiable framework to solve the SAITM issue by offering qualified students a KDU MBBS degree as proposed by the President himself will not become a reality with these persons, he said.

MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera blasts attempts to relax ban on Glyphosate
Independent MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday, delivered a strong and influential speech against attempt to relax the ban on Glyphosate. Rathana Thera went on to say that if the Joint Opposition had the same line of thinking as he does on the controversial Glyphosate issue, he is ready to jump into their bandwagon, in order to defeat anybody who is attempting to relax the ban on the weed killer. Rathana Thera also queried as to what happened to the Parliament Interim Committee appointed to look into the matter.
MP Rathana Thera made these observations following a question by UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena on the Niroga lottery which was introduced as a fund for patients suffering from Kidney diseases, to which State Minister of Finance and Media Eran Wickremeratne replied.
In his reply, State Minister Wickremeratne said that Professor Buddhi Marabe had debunked the myth that there is a correlation between Glyphosate and kidney disease that dominates the North Central area of the country. We are not experts on this subject. So we need to listen to these experts when taking policy decisions. This information has now being forwarded to President Maithripala Sirisena as well, he said.
MP Amarasena then stood up to point out that there were two opinions that had emerged in relation to this Glyphosate issue. One group believed that Rathana Thera would support the toppling of the present government, if it was to relax the ban on Glyphosate. Another group seems to believe that those who are in favour of Glyphosate, are planning to topple the government if it did not lift the ban. It is not clear as to which opinion the government should follow, MP Amarasena said.
The decision to topple the government if a necessity arises, would be decided by the general public and not by any of us. There are three hundred thousand Kidney patients in this country and you are quoting this Buddhi Marabe Is he the only scientist in this country What about scientists such as Ravin Senanayake and Priyani Gamage When the government first set to ban the weed killer, a committee consisting of nearly hundred or so personnel, reasoned out and promoted the ban. So what are you now talking about MP Rathana Thera questioned.
There was an interim committee appointed to look into this matter. The committee consisted of Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Minister Susil Premjayantha. What happened to that committee Where is its report Where is this person who come from America to address this matter. How can he have a say in lifting the ban on Glyphosate Rathana Thera further quaried.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena rose in support of Rathana Thera and expressed JOs fullest support to him in the matter.
My speech was in no way disrespectful of SC Judges: Ranjan
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday, denied claims that his speech against crime and corruption was in noway disrespectful of the 13 Supreme Court Judges who are holding office at present. Ramanayake further said that he stands by every word of his speech and that he would not withdraw any opinion included in the speech.
Meanwhile, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemned the speech delivered by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake in Parliament last Tuesday (21), claiming that the independent judiciary should not be attacked under cover of Parliamentary privileges. Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella, in a swift reply quipped that It was you people who sacked Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake.
Several Joint Opposition supporters, including MP Dinesh Gunawardena, MP Wimal Weerawansa and MP Bandula Gunawardena, criticized Ramanayakes speech made yesterday on issues relating to the system countering crime and corruption in the country. They claimed that Ramanayakes speech was a contempt of court and should have been stopped by the presiding member in the Chair.
Minister Kiriella refusing the common point of view of JO supporters, said that MPs are allowed to speak their heart out in Parliament. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he would look into the matter.
JO opposes Active Liability Management Bill
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena objecting to the Active Liability Management Bill, said the JO would hamper its passage in Parliament unless the Government amends it as per JOs request.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told the House that the Active Liability Management Bill scheduled to be taken up for debate yesterday, would be moved today. He said the Government decided to postpone its debate by two days, because different opinions have been expressed with regard to the Bill.
However, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, questioned the fluctuating positions of the Government, stating that it was better the Government did not convene Parliament in this manner. What is the purpose of having Party Leaders Meetings prior to setting the Agenda if the Government changes it later At the PLM we told the Government not to take up this Bill today, because there were certain problems in its content, but the Government at that time, argued that they needed it urgently. Then again, it changes its stances and postpones it like tamed kittens. Why cannot the Government stay fixed to one decision he asked.
The Government presented the Active Liability Management Bill for first reading on February 19. The objective of the Bill is to manage public debt to ensure the financing needs and payment obligations of the Government are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long term consistent with a prudent degree of risk. The new Bill allows borrowing in advance for debt servicing in future.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said the Bill tries to grab Parliamentary powers over public finances. National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr Harsha de Silva pointed out that the JO previously challenged the Bill in the Supreme Court, but the SC determined that the provisions of the Active Liability Management Bill are consistent with the Constitution.
This Bill is an important one and the Government wants it to be passed in Parliament soon, he said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said a final decision on taking up the Bill for debate on Friday, would be taken at a Party Leaders Meeting at 12 noon today.
COPE highlights irregularities at SLFEB from 2012 - 2014
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in its latest report, has highlighted a series of financial irregularities that had occurred at the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau(SLFEB) from 2012-2014.
The report was tabled in the House by COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti yesterday. It comprises the findings of COPE on 12 public enterprises which came under its probe from March 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017.
The Auditor Generals Department has submitted to the Committee a special audit investigation report on misappropriation of a sum of Rs 247 million by officials of the Bureau during the 2012-2014 period using falsified documents.
An independent investigation in this regard had been carried out by the Bureau, but its final report is yet to come out. The audit query reveals details of 24 alleged irregularities, but the Bureau had only managed to complete the investigation and impose punitive action against a single case.
Some of the cases have been referred to the FCID. The COPE has directed the Foreign Employment Promotion Ministry Secretary and the Bureau Chairman to conclude the above investigations within a period of four months and respond to audit queries within a period of one month.
The COPE has instructed the AG to produce a Special Investigation Report pertaining to these 24 cases by obtaining audit responses of the Bureau, so that the Committee could table it in Parliament.
Among the 24 cases are a fraud involving cheques worth Rs 800,000 and preparing falsified documents and awarding a sum of Rs 1.6 million to a non-governmental organization in a fraudulent manner.
The report also details the findings on Vocational Technology University, University Grants Commission, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Lanka Coal Company (Private) Limited, Lanka Salt Company, Board of Investment, National Institute of Education, Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital Board, Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC and Gal Oya Plantations (Pvt) Limited.
Responsibility of loss lies on captains shoulders
The responsibility of a loss recorded by any given team, let it be cricket, politics or otherwise, should be taken by the team captain, Sports Minister SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday.
The statement came in the backdrop of question asked by MP Rohini Kumari Wijeratne, requesting Minister Jayasekara to explain as to who was responsible for the continuous losses recorded by the Sri Lankan National Cricket team. Is it the Cricket Board, the Minister or someone else who is to be responsible she asked. Wijeratne also hinted that there is a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe which could be taken as the setting to the answer Minister Jayasekara was about to provide.
An amused Jayasekara who was compelled to answer the question, came back with an "I know who made you pose a question such as this," and continued saying that the team captain should take the responsibility for the losses recorded by his or her team. MP Wijeratne denied Jayasekaras allegation that someone influenced her to ask the question. This is my question, not anyone elses.
Minister Jayasekara referring to the question asked by MP Wijeratne, requested everyone to refrain from using cricket as a political means.
MP Wijeratne initially questioned Jayasekara on the income earned through the matches held at the Dambulla International Cricket Stadium and on the staff assigned to the same. Jayasekara expressed his disappointment in Wijeratne for not knowing that 51 cricket matches had been held at the Dambulla Stadium between female cricket teams.
This is the area you represent. Even yesterday, there was a cricket match between two female international cricket teams. I will make sure to send you tickets to some of these matches, Jayasekara said in a lighter vein.
American Water (Pvt.) Ltd. abusing ground water system in Artigala
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, brought to the attention of Parliament the excessive use of ground water through tube wells by a private company named American Water (Pvt.) Ltd.
He said the said company had abused the ground water system in Artigala in Kelani Valley, leading to the wells and other natural water sources to go dry.
This company is provided with a permit to bottle only 200,000 litres, but they have already exceeded the limit and bottles over 700,000 litres by pumping out the ground water. They continue to operate ignoring public protests. When I raised this matter, the Government last year agreed to stop it, but no action had been taken up to now. Even though their name is American Water, it is not an American company, he added.
Replying to the MPs concerns, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem, told Parliament that a Cabinet paper was moved some time ago to regulate the tube well use in Sri Lanka to prevent excessive use of ground water. A Gazette notification was approved, but I am not sure whether it was issued or not, Minister Hakeem said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella reading out the answer received from the Irrigation Ministry, said water meters are to be fixed to that water resource shortly to monitor the amount of water being pumped out. It is true that no measuring mechanism is currently available at that water source. Once gauging devices are fixed, legal action would be taken against any violations of permit rules, he added.
Ganeshan requests Speaker to assign parliamentary staff to translate PRECIFAC report
Minister Mano Ganeshan yesterday, requested the Speaker of Parliament to assign a team of parliamentary staff to translate the PRECIFAC report if there is an immediate requirement of the report.
Ganeshan, the Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, informed the House that the Official Languages Department would only be able to submit the said report in the month of May this year. Accordingly, he requested to turn to other options available if the House was in a hurry to receive the translated report.
Minister Ganeshan also said that the Official Languages Department had not received the Treasury bond report to be translated. We have only received the PRECIFAC report, not the Treasury Bond Commission report, he informed. Several MPs on Tuesday, raised concerns with regard to the continuous delay in the debate on these two reports due to the absence of these reports in all three official languages.

Ranawaka petitions to halt inaugural Kotte MC meeting
Sri Lanka Freedom Partys Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte electorate Chief Organiser Janaka Ranawaka yesterday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking an interim order preventing the conducting the inaugural meeting of the Sri Jayewardnepura Kotte Municipal Council and in the election of the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the said Council, until the final determination of this petition.
Ranawaka stated that there is a disproportionate distribution of members among the political parties thus distorting the will of the voters of the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council area.
He further sought an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the relevant Gazette Notification published by the Election Commission determining the total number of members to be returned to the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council and determining the allocation of members to recognised political parties.
Filing this writ petition through counsel Manjula Balasuriya, the petitioner cited 50 persons including Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and the members of the National Election Commission as respondents.
The petitioner said at the conclusion of the Local Government elections, the Elections Commission will, through a complex system, determine the number of members to be returned for each party should be allocated based on the votes cast. Under the new system, the First Past the Post contests within the wards in each local authority are carried out within a larger proportional representation framework. The number of members elected from a local authority are finally apportioned according to the votes polled by each recognised political party or independent group.
Ranawaka states that the distribution of the number of members to be returned by each political party reflected in a letter dated February 19, 2018 by an Assistant Returning officer that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had been allocated 18 members as the number of members to be returned while they are entitled to only for 15 number of members to be returned which is as a result of the said party winning 18 of the 21 wards of the Municipal Council.
The Petitioner states that in the circumstances a perusal of the said letter reflects that the while the aggregate number of votes the political parties other than Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna received was 31231 votes they were allocated only 20 members as returned and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which received only 22068 votes was allocated 18 members as returned to the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council.
The Petitioner states that in the circumstances the qualified number in order for a political party or independent group to have one member as elected out of 35 members to be returned is 1522 votes.
The Petitioner states that in accordance with the votes received by each political party, each political party is entitled to the following number of members to be returned from the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council should have been as follows: 5 members for UPFA, 3 members for JVP, 12 members for UNP and 15 members for SLPP.
The Petitioner states that however since the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had won eighteen (18) wards out of the twenty one (21) wards of the Sri Jayawardanepura Municipal Council, the said political party has won three (3) members as returned more than the number of members such party would be entitled to return proportionate to the votes they received.
Ranawaka states that as a result, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna was allocated a member as returned in the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council for 1,226 votes despite the qualified number to obtain one seat in the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council being 1,522 votes. In the circumstances Ranawaka states that as a result of the aforesaid there is a disproportionate distribution of members among political parties thus distorting the will of the voters of the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council area.
He states that since Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna was allocated a seat in the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council for 1226 votes despite the qualified number to get a one seat in the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council being 1522 votes, the other political parties too should be allocated a seat for 1226 votes. The Petitioner states that if the other political parties too are allocated members as returned for 1226 votes, the number of members as returned entitled by each political party would be as follows: 6 members for UPFA, 3 members for JVP, 14 members for UNP.
Ranawaka states that the declaration of the Elections Commission that the overhang which existed comprised of 3 members and the failure of the Election Commission to allocate two additional members to the United National Party and one additional member to the UPFA is erroneous on the face of the record, unreasonable, irrational and ultra vires and made without due consideration of the law.

Tourist Police Force to be strengthened - John
Since the tourism industry is one of the countries main foreign exchange earners, it is the duty of the government to protect tourists visiting Sri Lanka, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
This can be done properly through the Tourist Police Divisions which have been established throughout the country, he said.
In order to achieve this target, the government has allocated Rs.50 million in 2018 to strengthen the tourist police force to enhance the safety of tourists.
As part of the measure to increase the efficiency of the Tourist Police Division, necessary equipment including laptops, photocopy machines, refrigerators, bicycles, video cameras, furniture and several other items were presented to the Tourist Police at a ceremony held in Colombo yesterday.
The ceremony was held under the patronage of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka.
Minister Amaratunga said that there are many complaints of exploitation and harassment of foreign tourists and it is necessary to take stern action against those involved. However, some tourists do not lodge complains with the Police about these issues. On the other hand, if something happens,falls propaganda will be working overtime around the world saying that Sri Lanka is unfavourable and unsafe for tourists.Therefore, we must take immediate measures to provide a safe environment for tourists.
Around 2.5 million tourists have visited Sri Lanka last year, but,the number of tourist arrivals need to be further increased to bring more foreign exchange to the country.But, recent incidents that took place in Kandy have had a negative affect on the tourism industry, the Minister said.
Kandy's tourism industry suffered a big setback since some countries had issued adverse travel warnings in the wake of the Kandy unrest.Therefore, we should form a concrete plan to protect tourists in case of any emergency situation.
Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera said a conducive environment for tourists should be created in the country. Otherwise, if even a minor incident occurs, it could have a negative impact on the country.

Visually impaired are second to none - Defence Secretary
Those who are visually impaired are second to none and they can achieve any goal. No person with an impairment is less important than any other. They are very talented and reach their goals with sheer determination and commitment,Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne said.
The Defence Secretary was speaking during a ceremony to hand over Braille Character Recognition and Translation into Sinhala Text software to the Principal of the Ratmalana School for the Visually Impaired,at the Ministry premises yesterday, as part of their social responsibility drive.
Defence Secretary Waidyaratne said he had grown up with a friend who was visually impaired,but,he always felt that his lack of sight never deterred him from reaching his goals.
In fact, my friend entered Law College ahead of me and I always took his determination as an example that if you put your mind to it, there is nothing that one cannot achieve. This event to hand over the Braille Character Recognition and Translation package to the School for the Visually Impaired is perhaps the most important duty, I have performed since I took up this appointment. Research-wise, I am proud of what we have achieved. This institution is not a profit making establishment but one that serves the country,he said.
The Centre for Research and Development, which functions under the purview of the Ministry of Defence has developed a Software to convert Braille to Sinhala using Computer equipment.
The Centre for Research and Development was established on July 30, 2006 with the aim of establishing a world-class science and technology base providing the military a decisive edge, by equipping them with internationally competitive systems and solutions
