China plans to eradicate poverty by 2020
CHINA: China will eradicate poverty completely by 2020 as it plans to lift nearly 70.17 million people living in the countryside above the poverty line, officials of the ruling Communist party said.
Leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) will gather from October 26 to 29 in Beijing for a key meeting to finalise the country's development plan for the next five years.
The fifth plenary session of the CPC Central Committee was scheduled at a meeting of its top officials, the Political Bureau, presided over by the CPC Central Committee's General Secretary and President of the country Xi Jinping.
The Plenum will deliberate on 13th five-year plan (2016-2020) for economic and social development.
Poverty alleviation will be a major task in China's development plan, an official said ahead of the 23rd International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on Saturday, which also marked China's second National Poverty Relief Day.
"In the past 15 years, China has lifted more than 600 million people out of poverty, accounting for about 70 per cent of those brought out of poverty worldwide," said Hong Tianyun, deputy director of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development of China.
Despite this, China still has 70.17 million people in the countryside living below the country's poverty line of 2,300 yuan (USD 376) in annual income at the end of last year.

World Humanitarian Summit Global Consultation in Geneva
Decisive action to protect human dignity
The first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, set to take place on 23-24 May 2016 in Istanbul, is a call to action by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to reshape the global agenda for humanitarian action. The Summit has two goals. First, it should re-inspire and reinvigorate a joint commitment to humanity, and second, it should initiate a set of concrete actions aimed at enabling all stakeholders to better prepare for and respond to crises, and be more resilient to shocks.
A preparatory World Humanitarian Summit Global Consultation in Geneva meets this week.
Human suffering from the impacts of armed conflicts and disasters has reached staggering levels. Nearly 60 million people, half of them children, have been forced from their homes due to conflict and violence. The human and economic cost of disasters caused by natural hazards is also escalating. In the last two decades, 218 million people each year were affected by disasters; at an annual cost to the global economy that now exceeds $300 billion.
Even as global leaders pledge to "leave no one behind", the needs and dignity of millions of people in crises are being neglected. Millions suffer from the devastation wrought by frequent disasters that recur before they can fully recover their livelihoods. Political paralysis leaves the root causes of armed conflicts and vulnerability to disasters unaddressed, while also hindering access to those in need.
The humanitarian system has never reached more people in so many places, but with its current resources and structure, it is no longer able to address the scale and complexity of present, let alone future needs. Each year, an ever larger proportion of life-saving humanitarian needs remain unmet, despite greater funding contributions. The strengths and skills of the growing diversity of humanitarian partners, particularly from the Global South, are not sufficiently harnessed; nor are the transformative powers of science and technology.
Decisive, collective action is needed to uphold our shared responsibility to save lives and enable people to live lives of dignity.
Between May 2014 and July 2015, eight regional consultations involving more than 23,000 people, as well as major thematic and stakeholder consultations and online dialogues took place, backed by over 400 written submissions. This consultation process resulted in five major areas for action, each presenting an ambition for the future of humanitarian action. From this foundation, stakeholders can build the commitments, partnerships and transformative actions required to deliver change at the World Humanitarian Summit.
Dignity
Empower people to cope and recover with dignity through humanitarian action that puts people at its heart, delivers equally for women and girls, reaches everyone, invests in youth and children, and protects and enables people as the primary agents of their own response.
Safety
Keep people safe from harm by putting protection at the centre of humanitarian action, increasing political action to prevent and end conflict, preventing and putting an end to violations of international humanitarian law, and ensuring humanitarian action is not instrumentalized.
Resilience
Build hope and solutions for people in new or prolonged crises through collective action by humanitarian, development and other partners to strengthen people's resilience to crises, by investing in preparedness, managing and mitigating risk, reducing vulnerability, finding durable solutions for protracted displacement, and adapting to new threats.
Partnerships
Build diverse and inclusive partnerships that reaffirm the core humanitarian principles, support effective and people-driven humanitarian action, enable first responders to take a leadership role, and leverage the power of innovation.
Finance
Ensure sufficient and more efficient use of resources to preserve life, dignity and resilience in crises through new and diverse funding sources and expanded support to local organizations.
Towards Istanbul
The consultations have generated a demand for a vision of a world whose fundamental humanity is reaffirmed and restored.
The Summit will take place within an unprecedented global drive for change. It is situated within the push for the renewal of global frameworks for disaster risk reduction (Sendai, March 2015), sustainable development (New York, September 2015), climate change (Paris, December 2015), and urban development (Quito, October 2016). It will also benefit from the reviews of the UN peacebuilding architecture (June 2015), UN peace operations (also June 2015), and the Women, Peace and Security agenda (October 2015); the High-Level Panels on Humanitarian Financing (November 2015) and the Global Response to Health Crises (December 2015); and the 32nd International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (Geneva, December 2015). Finding new ways to address humanitarian needs and to comprehensively manage risk will be a critical part of this global agenda.
Migrants looking for a better life
The UN SG must be applauded for overseeing a complex and exhaustive process setting the context for Global change.
As one looks closer a few concerns emerge. The huge consultations in 2015 links somewhat inadequately with the need to take on board the strengths of citizens who when given the tools can be a very powerful force in situations of recovery of victims. The same is true about attracting resources of citizen's, corporates etc. For example in Sri Lanka they are prescribed Government designated funds which attract tax concession for those contributing. However if a prioritized Social Responsibility regime is compiled with corresponding tax free concessions it will attract considerable resources.
Globally disasters are striking ever so frequently not only due to natural causes but also by ever increasing human triggered causes. The international regime representative of the entities shown earlier quite struggles to cope.
A Group of Global Experts have prepared a submission for the session on IDPs and is reflective of the urgent call for greater global institutional leadership. The key points are:
1) Higher priority among national governments, international organizations and donors to IDPs as a population of special concern during conflict. While there has been great progress since the promulgation of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, there are still problems in gaining access to IDPs during conflict, which presents barriers to delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance.
There are also far too many IDPs who have been displaced for decades, often living in camps or with little access to mainstream services in urban areas. The SG's report can reinforce that concerted effort on the part of the entire international community is needed to address these problems: to ensure access to all IDPs and to find solutions for IDPs as soon as is practicable. Setting goals of a) increasing the proportion of IDPs with access to assistance and protection by 50%, and b) reducing the number of IDPs in protracted situations by 50% could be an effective way to raise visibility of these issues.
2) Institutional reforms to enhance the protection of IDPs both in situations of armed conflict and disasters. Many at the workshop noted need for a 'visible face' for the protection of IDPs. Whether because of the downgrading of the position of Special Representative to Special Rapporteur or because of the limits of the strictly human rights approach, there appears to be a vacuum of leadership in bringing attention to the needs of IDPs. At the same time, the cluster system has improved responses in many humanitarian crises but protection of IDPs remains a weak link in the response system.
UNHRC's willingness to lead the protection cluster for conflict IDPs is welcome but UNHRC faces numerous barriers to its ability to fulfill its responsibilities. These include its lack of a clear mandate regarding IDPs (as compared to its strong mandate regarding refugees), inadequate financial support from donors for its work on IDPs, and security constraints in reaching IDPs as well as other conflict affected populations. The problems UNHRC faces are compounded by the weak role that some humanitarian coordinators play with regard to protection of IDPs.
The Secretary-General in his report should recognize the important role that the humanitarian coordinators and the protection cluster could play with adequate support and pledge that he will make serious efforts to strengthen their activities in this area or make changes in the institutional architecture. The report should also call on donors to increase the funding that they provide for assistance and protection of IDPs and do so in a way that does not diminish their support for other vulnerable populations such as refugees. Finally, the report could urge that there be regular briefings or reports to the Security Council by the Emergency Relief Coordinator on barriers to access to IDPs and others at risk in their country and ways to overcome them.
3) The Secretary-General should urge regional bodies to adopt declarations and conventions on IDPs, citing the Kampala Convention as a model and promote implementation of these instruments. He should also urge governments to adopt national laws and frameworks based on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and develop country strategies -- together with donor governments, international organizations, civil society and IDPs themselves -- to implement the agreed goals and work toward resolving displacement situations.
4) Because displacement has many phases, including return, settlement and reintegration, the SG should strongly encourage an early role for development actors in conflict situations as well as an enhanced role for outside political actors, so that situations of mass displacement can be in part prevented or reduced and more effectively resolved. The report should prioritize efforts to support self-reliance and economic initiatives so IDPs do not need humanitarian assistance for prolonged periods. These initiatives should be undertaken in ways that support IDPs and host communities and involve, as much as possible, local governments and civil society organizations.
As a particularly vulnerable population, the fate of IDPs rests with the strong commitment of the international community to work with governments to ensure adequate protection, assistance and solutions. The WHS is the perfect forum to reinvigorate the role of the international community in this regard.
The Pope for example during his very recent visit to the US had to specifically make reference to climate change in his address to Congress. A forgotten dimension in definitions is the fact poverty is a disaster for those affected given an very uncertain existence every day whilst even farmers, fisherman also face seasonal disasters. Ultimately the menu of reasons bringing people together in Geneva and next year in Istanbul requires states to act within, collectively regionally, the UN system needs to be much more effective to stay relevant and global action requires Governments, corporates, non-profits and citizens to act in tandem. This is a tough act.

## Title: 'DOOSRA' dealt with a Doosara
## Supertitle:

'DOOSRA' dealt with a Doosara
Years ago, after a practice session there was a team meeting at the NCC. At that meeting where strategy was discussed, Michael Tissera asked new ball bowler Nihal Seneviratne how he goes - meaning to what field does he bowl to. Prompt came the reply from witty Seneviratne - 'by bus'.
And today we ask which way will the Doosara go Have we missed the bus
Which way will the Doosara now spin Which of our spinners will be Doosath These are the questions that haunt spinners in the world and especially Sri Lanka where it was made a fine art. That the dreaded 'DOOSRA' AKA the one that goes the other way, was a delivery invented by former Pakistani off spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and made a fine art by Sri Lanka's off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. That an illegal action is required to bowl it is old hat now.
The latest bowler to fall foul and be penalized for bowling the 'DOOSRA' with an illegal action is Sri Lanka's promising offie Tharindu Kaushal. Kaushal was a find and bowled his offies tantalizing and with vicious spin and bemused batsmen not only in domestic cricket, but most importantly in international cricket.
Then when he looked like being another Abu Fuard, Neil Chanmugam, Lalith Kaluperuma, Vijaya Mahendren, Cyril Ernest, Mahinda Athulathmudali or a Ralston Burke, some smart Alec introduces him to bowling the 'DOOSRA' and then he finds himself in a flat spin. The above mentioned bowled the one that went the 'other way', using the seam to get the ball to move the other way. But their actions were legal.
'Offie' Tharindu Kaushal reported - sub head
Kaushal was reported after the Indian series and after being tested was found to be bowling the 'DOOSRA' with an illegal action and the International Cricket Council has like the perennial by that gentleman of song JIM REEVES been 'accused, convicted and condemned' by the International Cricket Council.
The ICC cricketing sheiks in Dubai have bowled the 'DOOSRA' back at Kaushal and have ordered that he not bowl the 'DOOSRA' again, but can continue to bowl his offies. It certainly would have knocked the confidence out of the youngster. He was among the wickets bowling the offie. Why he had to resort to bowling the 'DOOSRA' which requires an illegal action is inexplicable.
Then a pertinent question to ask his bowling coach former left arm leg spinner Piyal Wijetunge is: Was he as coach ignorant of the fact that it requires an illegal action to deliver the 'DOOSRA' He has been bowling coach for long and cannot claim ignorance. Then why did he risk allowing Kaushal to bowl the 'DOOSRA'
Wijetunge debarred from bowling
It is no secret that Wijetunge who bagged bags of wickets in inter-school cricket playing for St. Anthony's College, Kandy, domestic cricket and representative cricket also had a suspect action and was debarred from bowling. We are not trying to belittle the bowling coach, but facts are stubborn.
Now that Kaushal's confidence must surely been tested , it will be interesting to watch whether he still retains his ability to be among the wickets like he did in the few Tests he played or whether he will be history like Senanayake.
The selectors would have been in a quandary to play him not. But the selectors have done well in playing him in the First Test against the West Indies which began on a Galle wicket that has become spin friendly in recent times and if he varies his offies should meet with success.
Bemused opposing batsmen
Bowlers such as Pakistani, West Indian and Sri Lankan spin champions - Saeed Ajmal, Sunil Narine and Sachitra Senanayake dominated the cricket scene and bemused opposing batsmen with this delivery capturing bags full of wickets before being stalled in their tracks.
Before Ajmal, Narine and Senanayake, it was Mushtaq who made batsmen look silly and captured wickets consistently. Then Muralitheran learned the ropes and baffled batsmen by fine tuning it to be his main wicket taking weapon and when he bowled it, it was always a wicket taking delivery and most of his 800 wickets came off the 'DOOSRA.
The 'DOOSRA' is a delivery bowled with an off break action which pitches and instead of turning in like a normal off break, viciously spins and goes the other way fooling the best of batsmen who play imagining it is an off break and falling prey.
Batsmen complained
With off spinners dominating with this delivery and making batsmen succumb, it was not long when batsmen suspected and complained that the 'DOOSRA' was being delivered with an illegal action that looked to be more of a throw which forced umpires to have a close look and complain.
It was later discovered that for the 'DOOSRA' to be bowled it requires an illegal action and when Ajmal, Narine and Senanayake delivered umpires reported and tests proved that the bowlers were delivering with illegal actions.
All three bowlers needed correction and when they came back to the big game, they were never the menacing bowlers they were before being tested and corrected. They had lost their viciousness, looked ordinary and it was sad to see them dropped from their national teams.
Pakistanis dump Saeed Ajmal
The Pakistanis have dumped their number one spinner Saeed Ajmal who spun them to many memorable and exciting victories saying that he is not the bowler that he was before having his action corrected. Pity because he was such a wonderful sight to watch when spinning and having batters in a flat spin.
To the West Indies- Sri Lanka series and it is encouraging and interesting to note that the Windies selectors headed by that 'super cat' Clive Lloyd have reposed their confidence in Sunil Narine and slotted him into their one-day squad. It will be interesting to see how he goes. Offies Nathan Lyon and Moeen Ali don't bowl the 'DOOSRA'.
Using the phrase - how he goes - brings to mind an amusing anecdote. A Board President's X1 led by Michael Tissera which included the writer was slated to play Hong Kong in a three day Unofficial Test at the CCC ground in 1972.
Going by bus
After a practice session there was a team meeting at the NCC. At that meeting where strategy was discussed, Tissera asked new ball bowler Nihal Seneviratne how he goes - meaning to what field does he bowl to. Prompt came the reply from witty Seneviratne - 'by bus'. Didn't the team break out in lung splitting laughter
Seneviratne who opened bowling for Saracens under the leadership of Shanti 'Kiri' Pieris after a successful seasons with Wesley College was the son of another opening bowler for Wesley who resembled a Wesley Hall, Christe Seneviratne, a former Sports Editor of the 'DAILY NEWS' who played in the exalted company of that Sri Lankan batting legend Mahadevan Sathasivam for Wesley.
Playing on their home turf in Galle and with weather conditions and the wicket to their advantage, if the Sri Lankans are unable to beat Jason Holder's Windies babes, it will be a sad indictment on their game and everything it stands for.
Drop in all aspects
The Lankan game had dropped in all aspects - BATTING, BOWLING and FIELDING as was proved in the Test series losses to Pakistan and India. It will be interesting to watch how and what interim coach Jerome Jayaratne and his fellow coaches have done to resurrect our game all round. The end of this Test series will tell.
The Calypso boys from the Caribbean are entertainers. In batting they know only to hit the ball, and as they say it is not to be poked at. When it comes to fielding it is electrifying. In bowling speed was their forte. But sadly not any more. So over then to the Test series and let's hope to sing the Calypso perennial at the end - cricket luver'ly cricket - not at Lord's where I saw it, but in paradise- Sri Lanka.
By the way enjoy life now. It has an expiry date on it.

Resolution on Sri Lanka
'Goes beyond levels of mechanism on war crime investigations'
Criticizing the recently tabled resolution on Sri Lanka by the US, Sri Lanka and other partners at the UN Human Rights Council, the National Patriotic Movement yesterday said at a discussion held at the Abhayarama temple in Narahenpita, that the resolution reflects an R2P type intervention by the US.
The Movement's General Secretary Dr Wasantha Bandara said, the resolution in question is one that goes beyond levels of war crime justice or mechanism on war crime investigations.
He said," Under the pretext of transitional justice, the US-proposed resolution is seeking to punish military personnel of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces without even court hearings having to be held in terms of the the allegations concerned through two Commissions, namely the Truth Commission and the Commission on the Disappearance of Persons."
He said, "the functions of the two commissions have already begun due to the disappearance of Ekneligoda over which a number of military intelligence officers have been taken into custody even before the establishment of what would be a shared justice mechanism as per the resolution."
"It seems that this process would be carried forward indefinitely, regardless of the proposed justice mechanism," he said.
If the international community has so much confidence in Sri Lanka's judicial system since the advent of the new government, there is no need for them to have any participatory role in carrying out its functions, he said.
"It is very clear that the proposed judicial mechanism with international participation is going to take place in Sri Lanka," he said.
The guest speakers on this occasion were Mohan Samaranayaka and Shamindra Ferdinando.

Point of view:
Open letter to Minister Arjuna Ranatunga
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga has proposed his brother Dhammika as a candidate for the post of Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Answering a question by The Nation newspaper, Mr. Ranatunga has defended himself saying, "A final decision (on the appointment) will be made by a committee which includes the President. However, if he (Dammika) has the necessary qualifications, then why not"
What on earth is Arjuna Ranatunga thinking This is not good governance. This is clearly nepotism, which is something which Mr. Ranatunga said he stood against when he asked us to reject Rajapaksa Brothers Private Limited and asked for our vote. He asked for our vote while standing on the platform of good governance. And now, although Mr. Ranatunga says his brother is qualified, he has not said what these qualifications are. Neither has he demonstrated that his brother is better qualified than other candidates. Sri Lanka has a large shipping industry with experienced people who have an understanding of the problems and the solutions that would be practical.
Has the Minister successfully encouraged the most qualified and experienced people to apply for the job This is the Minister's responsibility. If he says that no one better could be found, then it is the Minister that is not doing his job properly!
What is the Minister's brother's previous experience in the shipping industry Does he have any special qualifications and experience, or at least a proven track record of effective management in a related area that would justify his appointment
Since it is fashionable these days in political circles to keep comparing us to Singapore, let us compare Dhammika Ranatunga's qualifications with those his Singaporean counterpart - Mr Lucien Wong, the head of the Maritime and Ports Authority of Singapore.
Easily accessible online, here are some of Mr. Wong's qualifications. (You may skip to the next paragraph if you get bored reading the long list):

By contrast, google Dhammika Ranatunga and his main qualification appears to be two Tests and 4 ODIs for Sri Lanka in 1989! Have the Ranatunga brothers discovered some sort of secret weapon Does cricketing skill give you an advantage in the field of shipping and ports Is Dhammika Ranatunga going to whip the Sri Lanka Ports Authority into shape with his rusty right-arm off-break Or maybe he can get a few heads to roll with his right-arm batting But perhaps this all a misunderstanding based on a typo
Do the Ranatungas think that they are trying to fill a vacancy in the Sri Lanka Sports Authority instead of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority If it is not any of these, please tell us, Mr. Ranatunga, what are your brother's qualifications This government has yet to prove to voters that they can deliver sustainable economic benefits to the people.
How long this government will last depends mostly on economics. This government says that encouraging investment, both foreign and domestic, is important to their economic plans. However, this blatant nepotism within important public institutions - and make no mistake, this is the worst type of human resource mismanagement - gives the impression that the economic framework of the country within which a business has to operate is not meritocratic and is broken. This puts investors off. Why on earth would you want to risk investing your money in a place that might not treat your business fairly In this kind of system, the moment your business conflicts with the interests or whim of some politician, which one do you think is going to come out on top It sends a warning signal to the business community and the world at large. So, this is not a small problem, Mr. Ranatunga. This is a pretty big problem.
The world is watching. The business community is watching.
The good governance activists are watching. And, perhaps far more importantly for you, the voters are watching. Do you think that you can so blatantly take those who voted for you - based on what you said about good governance - for a ride You may have changed your mind about wanting good governance, but the voters have not.
It would be good to keep that in mind. It was the voters that voted for good governance who brought you into power.

PM, govt failed to present details of joint resolution at UNHRC
The Prime Minister and the government have so far failed to present the details of the conditions on which it had agreed to host a joint resolution at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, UPFA MP Dinesh Gunewardene said.
At a media briefing addressed by the joint opposition leaders, Gunewardena said although 15 days have passed, neither the Premier nor the government has produced any document in parliament describing the contents of their agreement at the UNHRC on carrying out investigations and prosecutions on alleged human rights abuses during the war.
He went on to say that if a Hybrid court is established as proposed in the resolution it would pose a great danger to the country.
Meanwhile, UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma noted that although the government was trying to portray the Geneva resolution as a victory achieved by it, the proposals in the resolution contradicts the government claims.

Russia doubles number of daily airstrikes in Syria
RUSSIA: Russian warplanes are carrying out more airstrikes in support of Syrian government ground troops as rebels are firing more U.S. anti-tank weapons, deepening the impression that a proxy war between the United States and Russia is joining the list of interlocking conflicts in Syria.
Russia doubled the number of its airstrikes over the weekend to more than 60 a day, Russian state news media said, helping government troops take two villages Monday.
Videos posted online by pro-Russian outlets, from an area above the village of Tal Skayk, in Hama province, showed Syrian troops and allied militias watching as heavy barrages sent smoke towering from clusters of houses, while a narrator enthusiastically described progress in fighting "terrorists."
At the same time, the handful of insurgent groups that received covert assistance from the United States have intensified their use of TOW anti-tank guided missiles, posting more than two dozen videos in the past few days of the missiles weaving over open fields before hitting their targets.
Russia and the United States have both said that they are fighting militants of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, but the two countries support opposite sides in the battle between President Bashar Assad and Syrians who are rebelling against his government.
The dynamic has ratcheted up the dangers of the conflict, while also bolstering morale for combatants on both sides, because the higher stakes have led some fighters to expect stronger commitments from their backers.
With air support from Russia, Assad's government is trying to retake territory seized this year by insurgent groups that include the Nusra Front, the Syrian affiliate of al-Qaida, and U.S.-backed units calling themselves the Free Syrian Army.

SL helped US avoid divisions within UNHRC - CP
The Communist Party yesterday, said that Sri Lanka had helped the United States in its subtle move to avoid divisions within the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) over allegations of human rights violations in Sri Lanka.
"Sri Lanka by becoming a co-sponsor, has helped the US in its subtle move to avoid a division within the Council over this issue," said General Secretary DEW Gunasekera, in a statement recently. He said
that none of the developing countries had decided to join the core group that sponsored the resolution.
The statement further said that the statement issued by Russia and China in this regard, had clearly demonstrated their principled stand that they were totally opposed to a country's specific resolution and that Sri Lanka should be allowed to solve their domestic problems without foreign interference or intervention.
"In this connection, the Communist Party of Sri Lanka wishes to reiterate its original position that the government should have expeditiously and effectively implemented the LLRC Report in pursuance of the programme for the post conflict development - rehabilitation and reconciliation," he said.
The party reiterated its position to demand a domestic inquiry into the allegations and an exclusive domestic mechanism for the purpose, without compromising the country's sovereignty in any manner.
The statement added that the commissions appointed by the previous government in particular, its failure to implement the recommendations of the LLRC Report created conditions for external forces to interfere in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
"A striking feature of the US sponsored resolution was Sri Lanka's decision to become a co-sponsor to the resolution supported by a core group of European countries. Sri Lanka being the concerned party, had taken upon itself accountability for the alleged war crimes and violations of human rights. It has also undertaken the responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations in the resolutions sponsored by the US.
The Communist Party insists that the UNHRC Report for 2015, was fundamentally not different from the reports in respect of the previous years.
"It was based on an exclusive and external investigation into the alleged war crimes and violations of human rights," he said.

South Korea to rewrite school history books
SOUTH KOREA: South Korea has declared that beginning in 2017, its middle and high school students would be taught history only from government-issued textbooks, prompting criticism that President Park Geun-hye's conservative government was returning education to the country's authoritarian past.
Monday's administrative directive to wrest control over history textbooks from private publishers comes after months of heated public debate over how to teach children history. The controversy has focused largely on how to characterise the history of modern Korea, including Japan's colonial rule in the early 20th century and South Korea's tumultuous, often bloody march toward democracy.
For years, conservative critics have charged that left-leaning authors poisoned the current textbooks and students' minds with their "ideological biases".
The critics were especially upset with the way the textbooks described North Korea and the military dictators who once ruled South Korea, including Ms Park's father, Park Chung-hee, who seized power in a 1961 coup and remained in control using torture and martial law until 1979.
Opponents of Ms Park, including some civic groups and regional education leaders, vowed to protest the government's move, which they said would embarrass the country globally by creating a textbook system similar to the one in North Korea.
The main opposition party said it would work on a bill to ban the government from writing textbooks. But Ms Park's party, which dominates the National Assembly, supports government-issued textbooks.
"The house is not just leaking or requires small repairs here and there, but its very foundation and design are wrong," the vice prime minister and education minister, Hwang Woo-yea, said, explaining why textbooks written by the government should replace the current books.
Ms Park's critics said the idea smacked of her father's dictatorship, during which the government wrote history textbooks and used them to glorify his coup as a "revolution" and to justify his prolonged rule. These critics fear that Ms Park's government will use the new textbooks to stifle opinion and whitewash the legacy of the old conservative elites, including her father, who served as an officer in Japan's colonial military before overseeing South Korea's rapid economic growth.
"The father staged a military coup, and now the daughter is engineering a coup in history education," said Park Han-yong, a chief researcher at the Centre for Historical Truth and Justice, based in Seoul. "This is a history coup that supporters of pro-Japanese collaboration and the past dictatorship have been preparing for 10 years." The centre recently revealed documents that it said showed that the father of Kim Moo-sung, leader of the president's party, was a rich businessman and pro-Japanese collaborator who once urged Koreans to make donations to finance warplanes for Japan's World War II military.
Some of the privately-published textbooks now in use in South Korean schools delve into long-hidden aspects of the recent past: collaboration with Japanese colonialists, mass killings of civilians during the Korean War and the abuse of political dissidents under the dictators.

Springboks recall Pietersen for Wales quarter-final
South Africa have recalled experienced wing JP Pietersen for their World Cup quarter-final against Wales at Twickenham on Saturday.
Pietersen -- who scored a hat-trick against Samoa -- is the only change to the starting team that beat the United States 64-0 in the Springboks' final Pool B match, at London's Olympic Stadium last week.
The 63-times capped Pietersen has recovered from a knee injury and takes over from Lwazi Mvovo.
Bryan Habana, who needs one more try to break both New Zealand star Jonah Lomu's World Cup record of 15 tries will revert to the left wing against Wales.
Veteran lock Victor Matfield was again left out because of a hamstring injury, with Eben Etzebeth and Lodewyk de Jager in the second row.
South Africa suffered a shock 34-32 loss to Japan in their opening match of this tournament but recovered to top Pool B.
"It made sense to reunite Bryan and JP on the wing as it brings a lot of experience to our backline, which has been doing well despite the relative inexperience of Handre Pollard, Damian de Allende and Jesse Kriel," said South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer after naming his side on Wednesday.
South Africa's bench showed four changes from the USA match, with Adriaan Strauss, Jannie du Plessis, Ruan Pienaar and Pat Lambie -- who have 252 caps between them -- among the replacements.
"We've seen first-hand how important it is to have experienced players on the field at the end of a match and to have this kind of experience available on the bench in a knockout match is great," said Meyer.

Sri Lanka club cricketers to earn big money
Club cricketers in Sri Lanka have been told to turn their backs on contracts in England and Australia and instead look to swelling their bank accounts by playing in the domestic Premier League and Zonal tournaments that will now be offering players a minimum payment of Rs. 1 million each for a season.
Sri Lanka Cricket attributes the increase in payments at local tournaments to a revision in dole-outs for first class cricketers.
"It has been the aim of SLC (Sri Lanka Cricket) over the years to professionalise cricket and to make it a livelihood. I am extremely happy to oversee a Committee which has implemented this long felt need. It will no doubt lay the seed for cricket as a livelihood in Sri Lanka", said SLC chairman Sidat Wettimuny
Domestic first class cricketers can earn 25,000 for a day at a Zonal 50-over tournament and Rs.20,000 per day for a Zonal four-day match in addition to Rs.15,000 a day for a T20 match. For contesting the three-day Premier League matches a club player can earn Rs.7500 a day which will be the same amount a cricketer can be entitled to for taking part in the 50 over tournament and T20 championships.
SLC contends that the increase in contract fees reflects the new course domestic cricket was now taking.
"This is certainly a step in the right direction and will persuade our young and aspiring cricketers to remain in Sri Lanka and play competitive cricket rather than move to Australia or England on a regular basis, to play cricket and boost their income", SLC said. As many as 154 cricketers are active in the Sri Lanka domestic set-up.

Swedish charity workers mistaken for Islamic State terrorists
SWEDEN: A club of bearded men posing for a photograph in the Swedish countryside with their black flag was mistaken for Islamic State militants, prompting a visit from the police, a club member said Monday.
Andreas Fransson, 32, was with his bearded buddies on Saturday outside the ruins of Brahehus Castle in southern Sweden when two police officers turned up.
"They told us that a motorist thought he had seen a gathering of Islamic State terrorists," said Fransson, whose Bearded Villains organization does charity work.On grasping the situation, the two officers "had a good laugh" and got back in their patrol car "with smiles on their faces," said Fransson, who works in public relations.
He acknowledged that the club's flag - two crossed sabers on a black background - could easily be confused with that of the Islamic State group.
"We belong to a club that is part of an association created in the United States, called the Bearded Villains and which fights against injustice, homophobia, racism and oppression," he said. "The flag gets passed from club to club around the world and we take pictures with the flag to show our community," he said.
"It was a funny incident but it's a shame to be associated with Islamic State given our charity work." Last week, an engineering school in southern France called ISIS ran into trouble with Canadian customs agents worried over a possible link to the jihadi group, which also uses the same acronym.

Sylvestrians celebrate their proud history
St. Sylvester's College Kandy are celebrating their 75th year with a series of sports activates to mark the occasion. According to information cricket, football, hockey, rugger, athletics, and boxing tournaments will be organized.
In the field of sports the most outstanding of all was Malcolm Bulmer, who was a unique boxer that the country has produced. His record is unmatched. From the time he got into the ring he gave of his best under the guidance of the famous coach Derrick Raymond. Malcolm as a schoolboy achieved many a milestone. By the time he left school at the age of 20 he had already represented (Ceylon) Sri Lanka, at the Commonwealth Games in Perth in 1962, Olympics in Tokyo 1964 and also had beaten all the champions in his weight class in Sri Lanka and won many best boxer trophies.
In 1966 Malcolm migrated to Australia and continued his boxing and won the Australian National Championship. He was selected to represent Australia in 1968 Mexican Olympics but very unfortunate lost that opportunity. There was a rule in Australia that since he had represented another country he has to be a resident of Australia for three years to qualify.
He was short by four months. But Australian government was prepared to bear all his expenses to the Olympics and they were prepared to permit him to represent Sri Lanka because Australians thought that he was a potential gold medalist. But it was so sad as Sri Lankan authorities refused permission. What an unfortunate end to a brilliant amateur boxing career. Malcolm, a South Paw, was the best boxer produced by Derrick Raymond. Some of the other boxers Raymond produced are famous all-round sportsman Nimal Lewke now a retired DIG, who too was a stylish boxer and brought honor to the country at several meets locally and internationally and was adjudged the best boxer at national meets. The others who come to mind are: A.C.R. Herathge, M. Reyal, S.A. Azwer, H. Gunasinghe, J. Peterson N. Thirukumar.
But the first Sylvestrian to win a national boxing title was Donald G. Labrooy who won the Bantam Weight title in early 1950s. He was followed by Malcolm Marshall, Milroy de Soysa, Annabel de Soysa, M.E. Marikar John Gye. Boxing was synonymous with St. Sylvester's which was in the forefront of schools boxing, winning the coveted Stubbs Shield several times (within fourteen years they won on 12 occasions.)
In Cricket it was in 1955 that St. Sylvester's College made a modest beginning by playing a few inter school matches. Their first inter school match was against Vidyartha College, which is today their big match. The first team was coached by J. Denlow and Ronnie Stephen. The side was led by Tony Dirickze and the team was made up of Nihal Pelpola, T. Sathyamurthi, H. Dias, T.G.M. Peries, N. Ratnayake, Vernon Nanayakkara, V. Croos, U. Ariya Chandra, I. Heppenstol, M. Direckze, V.W. Wanigasekara, R.Tilly, and U de Silva. Then it was M.E. Marikar who became the first Sylvesterian to play representative cricket, at a time when St. Sylvester's College had not taken to cricket in a big way. He played for Moors SC, Sinha Regiment, Kandy Sports Club, and Central Province and later for Kandy Lake Club. Nihal Samarasekara became the first to play for the country - before we got test status. Ishak Sahabdeen was the first test player.
The other cricketers who did well for the school and clubs are Nimal Lewke. A fine spinner, in 1967, he was placed second in the Schools' Best Bowling list. He later played for the Police and Government Services. Malcolm Perera became the Sri Lanka Cricket Coaching Manager. Some of others who come to my mind are Roland Perera the present coach, David brothers - Gerard, Kingsley, Sydney and Rodney, N. Herathge, Jayatilake brothers - Rangith and Bandu, Gerry Alexander Hidelarachchi, Mervyn Rodrigo the first Silvestrian to win the 'best outstation school boy' award. T. Thirimane, Iqbal Haniffa, Rajarathne brothers Prasana and A.S., Sarath Basnayake, Nimal Rajakaruna, Motha brothers Quintus and Bently, Colombage brothers Edward and Ranjith, Sena L Wijesinghe, T.S. Hassan b, Michael Denlow,, T.E.Badurdeen, L.S.B.Cabral ,M.S.M.Fazal, M. Ayub, I. F.A.Nanayakkara, S.I. Premacahandra, Boyagoda brothers Ajith and Lalith, Tudor Gunaratne, Marikar's Hilmy, Foumy and Faleel, Tikiri Kobbekaduwa, Namal Hettiarachchi, A. Kodithuwaku, J.G brothers. Thilakasiri and Udayatilake, A.S.Dange, M.Y.M.Fazleen, S.Daluwatta, T. Jayasekara, Ajith Wanasinghe, C.N.B. Rajapakse, Mervyn Perera, Anura Devapriya, C.K. Rajapakse, S.Samidon, D.J.S. Keragalle, Chnaka Wijasinghe, Ranga Dissanayake, Tharaka Jayasekara, Arosha Perera, Shiraz Ajireen, S. Gunasekara, A. Abeyasekara, Vandort brothers Duncan and Malcom, Anil Gunawardene, and Hemantha Wickramaratne.
Undoubtedly 1994 was the greatest year for St. Sylvester's cricket. Under the present coach Roland Perera's and late Bertie Nilagoda's stewardship as principal. The school won the all Island League Championship but they were deprived of the 'double,' when they got knocked out in the semi final by Ananda College.
Football was another popular sport. From the beginning of the school, many played for the country and it was Mahinda Aluwihare who became the first Sylvestrian to lead the country In eight international games. Then there was M.P. Shabdeeen, W.M. Jawffer, R.P. Wijasiri, M.E. Marikar the first to lead the Ceylon Government services XI and he together with Leslie Weerakody played for the Combined Schools, , Newton .E.A.Perera, I.M. Saheed, Leslley Marshal, Abdul Razak, Edmun Samaraweera, Gerad David, A.H.M. jabar, Jaya Aluwihare, Tony Direckez, Percy Samaraweera, Silva brothers, Rukman,. Rajendra, Rangith and Lakshman, Lesley and Malcom Marshal, Cyril Aluwihare, Abdul Razak, Hasan Peer, Shanthi Mendis, Hector Galuge, M. Ayub, I.M. Anwer, Meera Sibo, Dean Zouril.
Then in hockey this school earned a name thanks to Coach P. Thangaveluin. In the field of hockey there are many who have made the school and the country proud. Now Rugby is one of the most popular sports. They first played rugby in 1954 and 1955, and they gave it up due to lack ground facilities and the game was reintroduced in 1982. It was Malcolm Marshal who led the side first in 1954. Then in Athletics they have produced several top sprinters who have done well in public school games and national events, and at present Darshana Rajapaksha is doing well for the school, Kandy and the country. Then also in sports like Basketball, table Tennis, Chess and Gymnastic they are doing well. The old boys give a big hand for all sports.

Tamil Tiger ordered to be deported from Canada for terrorism
A member of the Tamil Tigers who was allegedly sent to Toronto to run the Sri Lankan guerrilla group's Canadian front organization has been ordered to be deported for terrorism, according to documents filed in the Federal Court.
The government has been trying to deport Manickavasagam Suresh since 1995, when he was first arrested in Toronto. The case was thought to have languished but last week the case reappeared on the court docket.
The Immigration and Refugee Board declined to comment Tuesday. But in an application filed in Toronto on October 5, Suresh asked Federal Court to overturn an IRB decision "in which Suresh was found inadmissible to Canada."
The decision was received September 17, according to the documents, which indicate that Suresh was found inadmissible under sections of the immigration law that allow for the deportation of members of terrorist groups and those engaged in terrorism.
Lawyers representing Suresh wrote in their application that they wanted to argue that the IRB erred by finding that he had "engaged in terrorism," was "complicit in terrorism," and that there had not been an "abuse of process."
The Suresh case has a long history in the courts. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, allegedly tasked Suresh with running the World Tamil Movement, a non-profit organisation that Canadian officials said had "raised significant funds" for the rebels.
His arrest in 1995 was approved by the then-Liberal government of Jean Chrtien. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the case, writing that, "Those who freely choose to raise funds to sustain terrorist organizations bear the same guilt and responsibility as those who actually carry out terrorist acts."
But Suresh appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned his deportation order in 2002, ruling that the security threat he posed to Canada had to be balanced against the threat of torture he faced upon his return to his home country.
The government appeared to have backed off Suresh, 60, who lived in Mississauga, Ont. and was working as a computer engineer. The new case, however, indicates that officials have continued their attempts to remove him from Canada.
The leadership of the WTM acts at the direction of the LTTE and has been instrumental in fundraising in Canada on behalf of the LTTE,
IRB spokeswoman Anna Pape said she could neither confirm nor deny any information about the Suresh case. A copy of the IRB's reasons has not yet been filed in the court so it was unclear why it had approved his deportation at this time.
But in January, Sri Lankans elected a new president Maithripala Sirisena, widely considered more reform-friendly than his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose 2009 military defeat of the Tamil Tigers killed an untold number of civilians.
Much has changed since Suresh was first arrested two decades ago. The World Tamil Movement was dismantled following an RCMP investigation called Project Osaluki that found evidence the group had funneled millions to the rebels. The WTM was added to Canada's list of terrorist entities in 2008.
"The leadership of the WTM acts at the direction of the LTTE and has been instrumental in fundraising in Canada on behalf of the LTTE," reads the listing on the Public Safety Canada website. "WTM representatives canvas for donations amongst the Canadian Tamil population, and have been involved in acts of intimidation and extortion to secure funds."

Tough tide ahead
Three months after the general election, the government's crackdown on various acts of commission and omission during the previous regime is gathering momentum. As if in response to mounting public criticism about inaction against corruption, there are many investigations underway and hardly a day passes without a stalwart of the former administration making headlines for alleged misdeeds.
Within the last week former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga, former Minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon, former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan (Pillayan) were all brought before law enforcement authorities.
All this is in keeping with the promises made by President Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential election and the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) which promised yahapaalanaya or good governance and a return to the rule of law during the general election. However, this drive to 'name and shame' alleged culprits is politically a double edged sword.
The hiccups in the processes are quite evident. When former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and another senior official of the previous regime, Anusha Pelpita were granted bail, an explanation was called from Police as to why they were afforded that privilege.
Political agenda
Elsewhere, D.M.S. Dissanayake, Senior Assistant Secretary in the Defence Ministry and the officer-in-charge of Civil Security has come under investigation over the controversy surrounding the Avant Garde Maritime Services Limited. Then there was feverish speculation in some sections of the media that there would be developments regarding massive amounts of money stashed away in a bank in Dubai, leading to a public denial by parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.
Clearly, it is no easy task to clean the Augean stables. On the one hand, the government is being accused of not doing enough, quickly enough, to institute action against wrongdoers. It has also been accused of being selective in its prosecutions, implying there was a political agenda underlying the targeted individuals.
On the other hand, the government is also hamstrung by several factors: in keeping with the tenets of good governance that it preached, it has to adopt a 'hands off' approach to the prosecution process, allowing the law to take its course. This may at times not yield the expected results. A case in point was the investigation into Kumaran Pathmanathan, better known as 'KP', financier to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and a most wanted man. The Attorney General was to inform courts that, despite his chequered history, there was no evidence against him to justify a prosecution!
There may be legal technicalities that led to this conclusion, but a government which came into power comparing the fates of KP (being mollycoddled by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government) and Sarath Fonseka (jailed during the Rajapaksa era) now finds that it cannot prosecute a man with known terrorist credentials.
Ministers have also expressed their displeasure about senior officials in the state bureaucracy. Most of these officials attained their position during the previous government and were beholden to their political masters to ensure that they kept their jobs, in keeping with the political culture of that time.
When the Sirisena government took office in January, while there was much reshuffling, there was no mass scale purge of state officials.
When questioned about this, President Sirisena reportedly said that if all officials loyal to the Rajapaksa regime were to be dismissed, there would be no one left! Now though, the government is encountering obstacles in implementing its policies and investigating its predecessors because these officials are either hampering inquiries or creating difficulties for the new administration.
There were reports that an official of the Defence Ministry was a stumbling block in the Avant Garde inquiry. Similarly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was perturbed by the pronouncements of our envoy in Geneva during the recently concluded sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and had to intervene personally. These are just two instances where officials whose loyalties still lie with the previous regime are believed to have been 'difficult'.
August general election
Another obstacle encountered by the government is its own composition. Because the UNFGG did not win an absolute majority at the August general election, it was compelled to form a 'national government' with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of which the leader is President Sirisena.
Although the UNFGG could have cobbled together a coalition either with the support of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) or by obtaining the support of a handful of SLFPers (both of which were reportedly forthcoming), both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were keen on pursuing the national government option, with an eye on introducing key constitutional reforms that would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
This political marriage of convenience has however led to snags primarily because it has allowed the stalwarts of the previous administration to gain ministerial and deputy ministerial status, while still having allegations of corruption and abuse of power against them.
These individuals have been accommodated either because they were known as Rajapaksa loyalists and their allegiance has been sought to strengthen the President's grip on the SLFP or because they command significant support at the electorate level, despite the charges pending against them.
Although the President has publicly pledged that investigations against these individuals would continue, this is easier said than done. Officials conducting investigations are in a quandary and fear consequences because their 'targets' are presently holding office.
This is hampering the investigation process, because the country's bureaucracy still subscribes to a culture of serving the political masters of the day instead of acting independently.
President Sirisena must also be mindful that, despite the power he wields as Executive President, his hold on his own party, the SLFP, will be constantly put to the test by Rajapaksa. For now, the former President is content to maintain a low profile as a parliamentarian for the Kurunegala district, resorting only to releasing the occasional press statement, as he did on the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.
But there is little doubt that given half a chance, Rajapaksa will not hesitate to seize the initiative and attempt to wrest control of the party. Hence, President Sirisena has the unenviable tasks of co-habiting with a United National Party led government, keeping his own party men happy lest they desert to Rajapaksa's fold and at the same time honouring his election promises of punishing those guilty of corruption and abuse of power.
Prosecuting wrongdoers
The latter is also not an issue that could be resolved with the prosecution of a handful of cases. There are many politicians who have earned a reputation for being corrupt and the unrelenting exposure in the media - including social media which has proved crucial in recent times - demands that all of them be dealt with, especially if they continue to represent the masses in the country's legislature.
So, it is a saga that will continue for some time to come. In the meantime, the government has a few short term challenges to overcome. Its first 'proper' budget is due in a few weeks. Local Government elections are scheduled for March next year.
Through all this, the 'national' government is tasked with providing a stable administration while at the same time prosecuting wrongdoers without fear or favour. Indeed, the polls in March might provide an indicator as to how the general public rates the major parties in the performance of these responsibilities.

Truly GREEN!
State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management Vasantha Senanayake's guiding light is his conscience. His principles are his rock. The Daily News features this principled politician who feels that spirituality is inside you.
Early days
Being an only child he studied at S.Thomas' Prep. He did his O/Ls there and did his A/Ls as a private candidate. He then went to England for a brief period and did his LLB there.
After coming back to Sri Lanka he entered politics for the traditional reason that many of his family members including his great grandfather D.S. Senanayake have been in politics.
"I have always acted according to my conscience. My conscience and my instinct go together. It is very difficult sometimes in politics to do that, because you sometimes feel one way and you have to sometimes toe the party line. Then it is difficult. But I have always tried my best to act according to my conscience and it is always backed with my instincts. I think I have got into politics for the right reason. Which is, you try to do something for the people. Which is what I have really tried to do. And coupled with the fact that I have worked hard, I have become successful. Hard work is always a vital component to success," says the young politician.
Vasantha has done his LLM degree at Kothalawala Defence University. At this point he is finishing his thesis and hopes to do his doctorate after that.
Secrets!
"My school years were very interesting. In our time technology was not so advanced. There were no mobile phones to text messages like what is happening today. What we used to do was write these long letters of love and poems. And in my letters I used to spray a little bit of cologne into my letters! It was the cologne I used to wear. So each time the letter was opened, the scent of cologne came out! So looking back it was quite funny. But children nowadays don't do silly things like that. But it was silly and romantic in its own way. A great meeting point those days were fairs and carnivals and places like the Liberty Plaza," he smiles.
So what next
"The girls came at a particular time and the boys would also come there and usually there was 'the girl's' mother who followed her. We would always try to find a time to try and avoid the mother and either slip a note to the girl without the mother seeing this! Sometimes we succeeded sometimes we didn't. So this was always a very tricky but sweet issue. But it is different from what it is nowadays. I met my wife through her friends who went to Ladies College. It was a wide circle of people who knew each other. We were round about the same age, I was just one year older."
His challenges
Senanayake has faced many challenges in life. He feels that sometimes in politics you feel that you do not get the due recognition that you should have got. That is a constant factor that keeps coming out. He has often felt that he has been overlooked or ignored sometimes. But Vasantha maintains that in politics you can't let that affect you. You have to go on despite the fact that you think you do not get what you deserve. That does not mean that you should throw in the towel and quit. You have to continue, that is the reality of politics.
Another challenge this young politician outlined, that is common to many, is to sit with people whose values are very different and try to work together. He feels that this is very hard when you have a certain set of principles and a set of values.
In politics people think that you are a lot more powerful than you really are. This Vasantha feels is a drawback. As the State Minister today and as a Deputy Minister in the past, he knew the amount of things that he could do. But people sometimes expect you to be a magician who can wave a wand and do miraculous things which often you are not able to do. It is a challenge to be able to keep the people's faith in you yet understand your own limitations and try and work around it.
You have so much technology in your hands. But you need to balance or be able to balance technological advancement with the culture of this country. Understanding of the history of this country comes first. You must look at the international arena as well and not be frogs in the well and be limited with what you see around you in your community. You must look at the greater picture as well. All this has to be done with a balance. Know your history, know your culture and then embrace what is from outside and blend it in a way that suits your culture and country.
Exemplary figures
Senanayake admires the Buddha for the Dhamma he brought saying that Buddhism is a noble philosophy. Despite the fact that he is not a Christian, he is also inspired by the life and teachings of Christ. He also admires Geoffrey Bawa and David Paynter for their artistic brilliance. He admires the poet Anne Ranasinghe, Lester James Peries, Iranganie Serasinghe and Ena de Silva for their contribution to the arts and creativity.
"There are even politicians whose politics itself I may disagree with, but their commitment to their cause I may admire. Dr. N .M. Perera and Colvin R De Silva may fall into this category."
"I admire Otara Gunawardena for her commitment to animal rights and wildlife and Jezima Ismail, J.S.L Fernando and R I T Alles for their commitment to education, and also Rajiva Wijesinha, who I think is a little too idealistic for today's politics!"
Books, movies and sports
Minister Senanayake is a history buff who like reading on true life crime and mystery also. Some authors he has enjoyed reading are Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Alexander Dumas and Leo Tolstoy and Martin Wickremasinghe's writings on country life in Sri Lanka. His favorite novel ever despite being a one off was Arundathi Roy's 'God of Small Things.' He enjoys reading about the Pharaohs of Egypt and about figures from Greek and Roman history, the Romanov's of Russia and of course Sri Lankan history. His favorite poet is T. S. Elliot.
Minister Senanayake is no fan of modern music saying that heavy metal gives him a headache! He prefers old music in English and Sinhala, and mind you this is really old music! Even before his time! Jazz is his preference when it comes to English, liking Frank Sinatra, Fitzgerald and Eta James, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martins and Marilyn Monroe. When it comes to Sinhala music it would be Chitral Somapala and the older music. Though not a fan of Michael Jackson he quite likes the Jackson Five.
His taste is mostly 50's and 60's. Post 80's is not his cup of tea except for that odd song!
"I watched one American Idol series that I quite enjoyed because a lot of the numbers they were singing were older numbers! And there was one particular artiste on American Idol that I really thought was fabulous, and I still think he is fabulous and I stopped watching American Idol when he didn't win it! He came second. The artiste is David Archuleta. He is the most fabulous performer I have ever seen in recent times and I was so sad he didn't make it. A person I consider to be very inferior - David Cook won. I was so shocked I didn't want to watch it again.
Vasantha Senanayake Pictures by Marlon Karunaratne
I like to listen to composers and various people playing the piano and orchestra music."
The Minister is also a huge fan of movies based on true stories that have a strong element of reality in it. Those are the movies he can relate to understand and enjoy. These are movies like the 'Last King of Scotland' which was on Idi Amin and the 'Queen' was on Diana's death and how the Royal Family and the Queen dealt with the situation. Another movie he likes is 'The Blood Diamond'. Even though the characters were fictitious it was based on an actual ongoing situation - the blood diamonds that are mined in Africa.
When it comes to sports the sports he is interested in is Badminton and Swimming. Van Gough is one of his favorite artists and he counts Van Gough's 'Olive Trees' and the 'Starry Night' as his favorites.
Spirituality
"I have my own views on spirituality. My own view is you don't need to go to a temple or religious place to practice. I think what is right and wrong is naturally in a human being's conscience. If you don't listen to your conscience for long enough perhaps you cannot hear it. But from childhood if you listen to your conscience then spirituality is inside you. You have to be intelligent enough to listen to that spirituality."

World Food Day and food security
World Food Day is a day of action against hunger. On October 16, nations come together to declare their commitment to eradicate hunger from the world. This day was declared by FAO's member countries on its 20th General Assembly in 1979. Since then this day has been observed every year on October 16 highlighting the awareness of the issue of hunger and food security.
The objectives of the World Food Day are
*To heighten public awareness of the problem of hunger in the world
*To encourage attention to agricultural food production and stimulate national, bi-national, multinational and nongovernmental effort
*To promote the transfer of agriculture technologies to the developing world
*To promote international and national solidarity in the struggle against hunger, malnutrition and poverty and draw attention to achievement in food and agricultural development
*To encourage the participation of rural people, particularly women and the least privileged categories in decision making and activities influencing their living conditions
*To encourage economic and technical cooperation among developing countries.
FAO's mandate is to raise levels of nutrition, improve agricultural productivity, improve the lives of rural population and contribute to the growth of world economy that no child, women or man has to live with food insecurity.
World Food Day has selected different themes every year to highlight areas needed to take action since 1981. The theme this year is 'Social protection and agriculture - Breaking the cycle of rural poverty.' Social protection is a basic right recognised by the UN and the ILO. It consists of policies and programmes designed by governments and the private sector to eradicate poverty and economic and social vulnerabilities of poor people.
It promotes human welfare, social security, social stability, economic growth and to live in dignity. Social protection can be generated by agriculture through input subsidies, input grants extension services, hi yielding varieties, storage and marketing facilities.
Social protection and agriculture interventions are powerful tools to improve food security. Agriculture growth leads to stable food security and greater income to manage risks of hunger and poverty.
About 73 percent of the world population have no access to adequate social protection. The majority of them live in the rural areas of developing countries many of them dependent on agriculture to make a living. Incorporating social protection policies in to national programmes on agriculture, fisheries and livestock can help to improve productivity income generation and market functioning and food security for the vulnerable households.
Food security is not just an issue of vulnerable people. It is much larger issue that involves the whole food system and affects every one of us in some way .issues such as whether households get enough food, how it is distributed within the household and whether that food fulfils the nutritional needs of all members of the household show that food security is linked to health.
Food security and nutrition is inter linked and cannot be separated. It directly affects the dietary energy supply of the population.
Therefore food security can be described as a phenomenon relating to individuals. It is the nutritional status of household member that is ultimate focus. It is an inter grated system and includes every action from farm to table.
The world has the resources and technology to eradicate hunger and ensure long term food security for all in spite of many challengers and risks through a 21st century GREEN REVOLUTION.
It however needs a combined effort by everyone. Food production was in pace with the population increase up to now. Therefore as the largest humanitarian organization fighting the hunger in the world FAO's aim of "Food for All" will be a reality to ensure the food security in the future world.
