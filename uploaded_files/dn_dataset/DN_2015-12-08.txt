Anti-graft code of conduct for corporate sector
The Bribery Commission will soon introduce a code conduct for the corporate sector amending the existing laws, Bribery and Corruption Commission's Director General, Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe said
Speaking at a breakfast forum organised by Shipper's Academy Colombo at Hotel Galadari she said that we must also make private companies liable if they are involved in bribery and corruption.
She said that bribery and corruption also takes place among private companies as well. The Director General said said that she was pleased to say that almost all multi-nationals and top corporates do not get involved in corruption. She recalled that she personally knew of an instance where Hemas Holdings destroyed a consignment of Bio Oil mid sea since a Customs officer wanted a huge bribe to clear it.
She said that she will also look at the Customs Ordinance as she has received many complaints that tougher legislation is needed to reduce corruption in that institution.
Wickramasinghe said that today some are afraid to come out and expose corruption since they think that they will be harassed by authorities and in courts. "This is a myth. What you just got to do is to dial 1954 and just give us a detailed account and we will follow it up from there."
Speaking to 'Daily News Business' she said that her officials are every honest but they need to think newly. "For this we are obtaining the services of two officials from US and UK with the assistance of their Embassies in Sri Lanka."
She also said that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake too is backing her and has allocated Rs. 500 million to strengthen the Commission. The UNDP too has offered us funds as they feel corruption should be not reduced but eliminated.

## Title: Budget proposals vague on transport and logistics

Budget proposals vague on transport and logistics
The following is an analysis of the Budget Proposals 2016 from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) on matters pertaining to the industry it represents. Even though this is unsolicited advice to the Government, it is provided on the belief that through this analysis, the final vote on the budget will be more focused to make the budget an effective instrument of reform, modernization and growth of the sector.
Road Transport
109. The correct diagnosing of the transport and traffic problem as being the continuous negligence of public transport is commended. However the budget proposals do not allocate any significant public investment towards this.
461/467. While attention has been drawn to traffic management, it fails to specify any noteworthy measures or funding. The only proposal is to spend Rs 500 million on traffic encoders which are a yet unproven technology for any form of traffic management. If vehicle owners require better traffic information and security, it is they who should pay for it and not the public.
462.The legislative amendments to the NTC Act are welcome but the budget does not indicate what regulatory steps such as limiting access, tariff or safety are proposed in the control of three wheelers, taxis, school vans and cargo transportation vehicles. No funds have been committed to develop the required institutional capacity for effective regulation. Besides the operational regulation of these are a function devolved to the Provincial Councils and would not entirely be under the NTC.
463. Allocating funds to manufacture new buses from old bus chassis is not the best approach to modernize the fleet of buses which should be aligned more towards higher quality, low floor buses which cannot be manufactured from scrapped buses, in keeping with the increasing income of commuters. Moreover allocating Rs 10 billion at Rs 1.5 million a bus means that 7,000 buses are to be manufactured in 2016. The annual requirement of buses in Sri Lanka is less than 3,000 and in SLTB less than 1,000 buses. Instead there should be an incentive to import modern, low floor, environmentally friendly, low emission modern buses. There could also be concessions offered for setting up local manufacturing plants for high quality buses that could be purchased by both state and private sector.
465. The proposal to encourage four wheelers instead of three wheelers is unlikely to result in better safety as small four wheelers also have poor safety records. Moreover, it has been found that 2/3rd of the three wheeler fleet is in excess of the demand. They have poor utilization. They should be used only as access vehicles for 'last mile operations' and improved bus and rail transport should be encouraged if overall safety is to be improved.
466. Conversion of commercial vehicles to electric maybe a good idea. However allocating Rs 150,000 per three-wheeler may not be cost effective. It is prudent to invest in such a manner after thorough feasibility study of energy conversions as done in many countries rather than to embark on ad hoc technological journeys. In any case the allocation of Rs 50 million will allow the conversion of only 3000 three wheelers thus covering less than 1% of the fleet. Steps must be taken to actively seek measures to reduce the excessive three wheeler fleet. It is more beneficial to incur public investment to conduct an energy audit on the transport sector to qualify for low cost international financing for such upgrade of transport equipment.
468. The proposal to set up a Railway Development Council is commended. However its terms of reference should be clearly specified and intended solely for the purpose of improving the carriage of passengers and goods by railway which is the primary function of the railway. The entry of private sector for better utilizing of unused railway capacity is a progressive step. There is however no mention of the regulatory functions for such a task.
470/473/474. The on-going feasibility study for railway electrification has not been mentioned as a government priority and the proposals of the recently completed Colombo Metropolitan Regional Transport Masterplan have been completely ignored and instead several ad hoc transport projects have been included. For example, Rs 1.5 bn is proposed based on 'demographics' on KV development, a project which ranks much lower in the Transport Masterplan. It is not clear on what basis this investment was decided surpassing many other critically needed investments that have been prioritized. We also fail to understand the justification of exorbitantly high investment in rehabilitation of railway lines. Nothing is mentioned about developing railway freight services, the proposed new Battaramulla railway, or the Negombo line/Airport access development. There is also no push for extension of double tracking of main lines or any other new tracks for which studies have been done. Instead, monorail which is not even been considered as the first two priority alternatives in the Transport Masterplan have been proposed for the Negombo corridor and other corridors. Funds should be allocated for the implementation of projects under this plan and not on ad hoc projects that seems to convey they are supplier driven initiatives.
472. The comments that railway freight is to be encouraged is a statement in the correct direction. It is unfortunate that no strategy to create ICDs, or investment is allocated to make this statement meaningful.
471. It is encouraging to note that "Park and Ride" facilities attached to both railway stations and bus stations have been mentioned. This is a meaningful initiative for which Rs 1 billion has been allocated. However the strategy of charging vehicles that do not carry 4 people is a failed strategy in many parts of the world. Utilizing modern technology such as Electronic Road Pricing is essential if this is to be implemented practically. Moreover, public transport quality has to be significantly improved before Park and Ride can be implemented as an enforced measure. None of these have been mentioned.
475,476/477. Water transport has been provided special attention. It is important to note that none of the planning studies carried to date by international or local experts have identified the financial or economic viability of this mode of transport. Spending Rs 250 million on such an initiative when there are other urgent needs for recommended projects cannot be understood.
490-493. It is encouraging to note that the government intends proceeding with the Central Highway and its extension to the north and east. However it must be reiterated that the feasibility of neither of these is yet to be fully determined and made public. The current traffic levels and current speeds beyond Dambulla are unlikely to make such extensions a necessary investment in the present context. There is a grave danger that the failure of the last government referred to in the budget as the "over-zealous attitude to improve the road network" is likely to continue.
The government which is trying to develop the country with restricted finances should explain how the economic feasibility of projects such as the proposed Ruwanpura expressway has been established. Moreover there is concern that a government established on Yahapalanya principles appears to want to continue with single source contracts without competitive bidding, a feature which was severely criticized by the then opposition before the January 2015 election.
Moreover, none of the roads in the Western Province mentioned in the budget including the elevated road to Kotte, have been found to be economically feasible in the recent transport studies. Allocating nearly Rs 30 billion towards these without any allocation for the recommended projects intended to improve public transport makes the statement of the government that "the important aspect is to what level the public transportation system should be developed to ensure that any citizen of the country could utilize the facility without resorting to private transportation' an empty promise. In all aspects it appears that most of the public money allocated to transport is to be spent on building roads and the rather small allocation in the budget on public transport is only for projects that have little benefit to the public.
494- 497. Creation of an Infrastructure Development Authority awaits explanation. Allocating Rs 1 bn for same is therefore observed with concern. However the intention of creating integrated infrastructure is welcome. The proposed North East highway should have a much broader planning scope that would not only create industrial parks but also improve the quality of life of the people. Expressways are expensive infrastructure for fast movement between two exits of a road, but contribute poorly to overall mobility improvement in a country unless accompanied by the relevant transport and regional development policies. We are unaware of any such in depth studies that have been done either for the Central or the North East Expressway which will have a combined investment of several hundred billion rupees- a fact that has not been disclosed.
557. The government appears to take a very futuristic approach to environmentally friendly vehicles. The reduction of Excise Duty for Solar and for Hydrogen and in the case of Helium which is yet to be even suggested as a fuel for vehicles, is interesting. What is worrying is the non inclusion of more established technologies such as electric and hybrid vehicles which were promoted heavily over the last few years. In reality now there is no real concession for import of vehicles using non fossil fuels. It is a pity that every budget experiments with concessions for different technologies confusing the consumer and causing immense losses to the industry. In other countries, government intervention regarding new fuel types are followed only after universities and research institutes are asked to comment on the viability and future sustainability.
559. The Vehicle Emission Testing program even though somewhat flawed, is one of the most effective steps taken to curb pollution. There is no logic for increasing the fee to Rs 5,000 and will only increase the likelihood of corruption. The testing centres are currently making profits and there is no need to increase the burden on the consumer by raising this fee. The fact that the government has been unable to effectively regulate the two present operators, raises the question how it will regulate liberalized issuance of emission certificates. If government wishes to impose an 'environment tax', adding a levy on fossil fuel would be more effective and equitable.
563. We agree that the vehicle permit should be withdrawn and replaced with a suitable compensatory measure. Senior public officers can and should use public transport whenever possible. In fact we suggest that withdrawing these permits even for Members of Parliament would become one reason to improve the quality of our public transport system. If indeed the government loses Rs 40 billion a year from these concessionary permits, half of that money if invested wisely over 20 years will be adequate to improve and modernize the entire public transport network across the country to a world class system.
605. While the intention of reducing road accidents is laudable, it is sad to note that the only action towards this has been to increase the fine for damaging public property which is unlikely to have any impact. No funding for serious improvement in road safety has been considered. As such the public cannot be assured any safer travel
Aviation Sector
397-409. The intention of converting Mattala Airport to a facility for logistics and cargo services is a welcome approach. However, the key components for attracting airlines or land connections to production areas of goods are not even planned. Moreover flights operating only for cargo (freighters) are questionable, as the yields in Sri Lanka are phenomenally low for a viable operation. The government may consider specific actions such as to encourage especially European, Chinese and Indian leisure carriers to enter into SL using Mattala which eventually will open belly capacity for cargo. It could consider concessions for Sea-Air hub operations targeting markets in Bangladesh, China and Africa.
It is also felt that Sri Lanka in the current context requires only one national airline. Getting Mihin to operate domestically will undoubtedly add more losses and any such move should be only on the basis of commercially viable operations. There is no explanation how the locations for new domestic airports were picked. We need to understand the rationale and benefit of these new investments when many of the existing airports need funding for expansion so that we do not continue with follies similar to Mattala.
Shipping
478-482.The Government's aim to make Sri Lanka one of the top twenty transhipment hubs in the world by 2025 represents moving up about 10 places in the world rankings, which should be possible if the demand led expansion of the south port continues over the next decade. Since the primary infrastructure is already in place what is now required to make this happen is robust enabling legislation relating to the peripheral development of other maritime related services such as flagging, adjudication and arbitration, regional head offices for maritime players.
The proposal to issue further licenses for "deep sea bunkering" is confusing and raises doubts whether any studies have been done on the impact on the current operations.
Logistics and Freight Forwarding
483-486 It is unclear if the industry is to be liberalized or not. The first step on the road to such liberalization was announced in the speech and retracted by Monday! Implementing an ICD is imperative and private sector investment should be actively sought for this on urgent basis.
484. Introducing an annual license fee of Rs 100,000 per vehicle for entering the port will certainly have a negative impact on transporters as well as import/export trade in the country as it will simply increase operating costs of all the stake holders for no justifiable reason.
131. This statement on how to develop supply chain linkages of agricultural products appears completely incorrect and displays a poor understanding of the working of supply chains. This should be redrafted or removed.
Disappointing
The budget is rather disappointing that it gives no clear direction to improve the sector. The budget appears to follow the trend of previous years in supplier driven ad hoc investment proposals for infrastructure which are likely to increase indirect taxes imposing inequitable bearings on who pays for the use of infrastructure.
Moreover, there are no significant regulatory changes proposed to bring about the paradigm change required in the transport and logistics sector to modernize and to be efficient to make Sri Lanka a globally competitive destination for investment and services.
The continuing preference for single source contracts, lack of transparency and adherence to feasibility studies and dubious economic benefits of many of the proposed projects appear to continue and will invariably take away investment from critical infrastructure upgrades that have been highlighted in many studies and during representations made by industry personnel in public forums and meetings over the last few months.

Comfy KAY's launches pillow for nursing mothers, babies
An infant support pillow that provides support to nursing mothers to feed their new-born babies was launched by Comfy KAY's in Colombo recently.
The contoured nursing pillow is designed to fit around the mother's waist easily, while eliminating the stress on the mother's back, neck and shoulders.
"This nursing pillow is both soft and comfortable yet firm enough to lift baby up to the required level for easier latching and relaxed feeding," said Maheshi Gunawardena, of Comfy KAY's. "The unique ergonomic design ensures correct feeding position by naturally rolling the baby towards the mother. When the baby gets older, the pillow functions as a prop to support and sit the baby up."

These feeding pillows come with an attractive zippable slipcover which can be removed and either hand washed or machine washed on a delicate cycle. The inner cushion which has a soft and non-toxic fiber-fill can also be machine washed in cold water on a delicate cycle by itself.
Mothers who have used this pillow following natural birth and cesarean section vouch for its effectiveness and ease of use when feeding their new-borns, Gunawardena said. "Many mothers who have started using this pillow have told us that feeding has never been so easy."

Doing business made difficult.....
The Budget 2016 presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has drawn attention from diverse groups. As a tax consultant, I write my perspective on certain significant budget proposals presented in Budget 2016.
Sri Lanka has made it difficult to register and carry out a business by paying annual fees on every company registered with the Registrar of Companies will be subject to an Annual License fee of:
Leaving aside the quoted and other companies, Rs. 60,000 is a high fee for a small company and also discouraging the SME sector.We have to think that these companies have to pay their Auditors and Company Secretaries too.
- Private Companies Rs. 60,000 - Public Quoted Companies Rs. 500,000 - Others Rs. 100,000 (including companies non-functioning)
The annual cost of running companies which is very high. The priority given for SMEs rather than big companies should be appreciated.
SMEs sector can be considered the back bone of the economy, as you know it creates more job opportunities and plays a dominant role in the economy.
This will not be a positive and encouraging move for a person to register a company and get into a business.
The 50% rate deduction available under the Inland Revenue Act for listing in the CSE will be extended by increasing the present deadline of April 1, 2017 for further;
(i) 2 years for listing in CSE; or (ii) 3 years for listing in any foreign stock exchanges
By considering the above incentive for small companies to go for listings at any moment the company may go for listing but they will have to pay Rs. 500,000. My personal opinion is to look into those provisions seriously at the point of drafting the amending Act to ensure this.
Another bad situation is the fees are even payable even if a company is not functioning. It is my understanding that there are about 25,000 companies which are non-operative as per the Registrar of Companies.
Another discouraging factor is, at the time of companys voluntary liquidation Rs. 250,000 will be charged on liquidation.
All the hoteliers are expected to register with the Tourism Development Authority. From a tax point of view, the 1% Tourism Development levy will be removed. However the increasing rate of VAT and NBT will directly affect the service charges of the hotel industries.
The above revenue proposals are not practicable as far as SMEs sector is concerned. Finally the Budget 2016 has introduced nine new levies altogether.
They are the Company Annual License Fee, Voluntary Liquidation Fee, Emission Levy, Vehicle Valuation Certificate Fee, Unregistered Vehicle to be Registered fee, Vehicle Entitlement fee, fine on road accidents, a charge will be imposed on airlines on the sale of international tickets and Local Council nominal fee.

GDP to remain robust -Moody's
Moody's says that the operating environment for banks in Sri Lanka will remain healthy and that asset quality and profitability will be stable over the next 12 to18 months, offsetting some moderate deterioration in funding and liquidity.
In their Banking Sector Outlook for Sri Lanka, Moody's says the GDP growth rates in Sri Lanka will remain robust. "We expect annual growth of 6.7% over 2015-16."
An accommodative monetary policy supports the growth outlook.
In addition, investments are likely to have more participation from the private sector, compared with the public-sector-led approach of the past few years, a shift which should provide an impetus to loan growth.
The gross nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio has improved over the past 18 months, coming down to 4.0% in September 2015 from 5.6% in December 2013.
Problems in the pawning sector the key reason for the pick-up in NPLs in the recent past have been addressed. "At the same time, banks' underwriting standards have been fairly tight over the past two years, as reflected in only moderate loan growth in 2013-14 even as the economy was growing rapidly."
"On the one hand, net interest margins (NIMs) will remain under pressure, primarily due to the low interest rate environment. On the other hand, have Sri Lankan banks have already made significant investments in their branch networks and personnel in recent years, so faster loan growth will lower their cost-to-income ratios. Some banks will also benefit as elevated credit costs associated with pawning NPLs are no longer required, "the report further states.
The current level of liquidity in the system is adequate with the statutory liquidity ratio in the domestic book at 36%. However, liquidity should tighten over the outlook horizon, as we expect annual loan growth of around 20%, faster than deposit growth of 16%.
This should put pressure on the banks' funding profiles as they will need increase their dependence on more expensive sources of borrowing, including foreign-currency borrowings.
"Sri Lanka has a track record of providing systemic support to banks when needed and we assume that such support would be forthcoming, if required. Sri Lankan banks need to comply with Basel III capital norms, as well as liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) norms, from January 2016 onwards."

'Govt to review motor import tax in 2017'
Chairman Stassen Group and Aitkin Spence, Harry Jayewardene and Dilmah Tea Chairman and Founder Merrill J. Fernando strongly criticized the move by the government to import tea to the country subsequent to the Budget 2016 proposals.
Speaking at the Business Forum on budget 2016 organized by Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation at Waters Edge yesterday, the duo said that this move would have severe negative impacts for the local industry. "It would dilute the quality of the Sri Lankan brand name of tea which we have strived for years to create."
Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that there had not being an increase in the size of the tea industry and this move was to inspire the local industry. He also said that Sri Lanka also needs to innovate.
However both Jayewardene and Fernando disagreed and said that the decision on import of tea has to be re-looked.
Responding to a query by Chairman of the Sri Lanka Vehicle Importers' Association, Indika Sampath Merinchige the Minister said that they needed to balance the budget with fuel prices and this was the reason for them to increase the tax of electric vehicles. "We request the industry to bear with us for about one and half years in this regard."
Managing Director, CEO of Caltex Lubricants Lanka Limited said that there is an imbalance by default Sri Lankan Human Resources. "Sri Lanka is exporting house maids and importing Senior Managers, CEO's. This must change."
John Keells Group Deputy Chairman, Ajith Gunawardne said that tourism industry is well positioned to move from US$ 2 billion industry to a US$ 10 billion industry in five years.
He said that though some points may not directly involved in the budget, Sri Lanka must strive to get the right tourist to the country. "For this, standards should be maintained in service standards and also when building high rise hotels in coastal areas."
Dharma Dheerasinghe, Chairman Commercial Bank said that they saw two key issues in the macro economic background in which the budget was presented. "One is the fiscal imbalance that prevailed in economy and those issues relating to the fiscal sector that needs to be fixed. And also we have a growing balance of payment deficit and this too has to be addressed."
National Chamber of Commerce, Chairman, Tilak Godamanne said that most of the features were accepted by them.
"The proposal to set up a venture capital and give them a tax holiday for five years is welcome."
Minister of Finance, Ravi Karunanayake said that it is a very good idea to send suggestions to the Government mainly through Chambers without going behind politicians.

Hemas Hospitals partner Credence Genomics to offer cutting edge genetic diagnostics
Hemas Hospital laboratory services entered into a collaboration with Credence Genomics, the pioneer in genomic research and diagnostics in Sri Lanka.
The collaboration allows Hemas hospitals to offer high end molecular biology and genetic tests that have been developed by Credence Genomics for diagnosis of infectious diseases, tumour treatment, breast and colorectal cancer predictions and a range of inherited genetic disorders.
The infection detection test could within 24 hours detect the infection, whether it is bacteria or a fungi. A further set of tests can then identify exactly which bacteria or fungi is affecting the patient.
This is a culture independent highly sensitive test, which even gives the relative abundance of the microbes.
With respect to cancer diagnostics, the 'Tumor Hotspot analysis ', tests for common cancer genes in one go and assists in the fine-tuning of chemotherapy to minimise side effects.
Hemas Hospital is a subsidiary of Hemas Group, a leading Sri Lankan conglomerate that has business interests in four key sectors - FMCG, Health care, Transportation and Leisure.

Lanka selected for inclusive mutual insurance
Sri Lanka is one among the five countries which has been selected for the development of inclusive mutual insurance for the next 5 years under the ICMIF's AOA 5-5-5 Inclusive Mutual Insurance initiative.
Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said the Philippines, Kenya, India and Sri Lanka and one Latin American nation has been selected based on their performance and potential as emerging markets in the insurance industry.
Delivering his keynote speech during the inaugural day of the International Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation's (ICMIF) three-day symposium, he said the forthcoming budget has proposed an Export Import Bank (EXIM). However he noted that the establishment of such a corporate institution was not solely sufficient to drive the country's exports.
Commending the initiatives of the International Cooperative Mutual Insurance Federation for its efforts to integrate Sri Lanka into its partnership program of attempting to reach out to 5 million underserved households in 5 countries, over 5 years, the Deputy Minister said we need to unlock the economic potential of the country.
"I must stress that while the government is here to serve the people, it realistically can't rescue a firm or industry at every turn. In fact, government rescue is a weak form of insurance."
Sri Lanka's export finance sector should be given due recognition since it lacked sufficient insurance whereas the sector was concerned, he said."
One longstanding, major problem in the insurance sector has been insuring against risks that affect rural communities.
For example, agricultural crop insurance is difficult.Insuring farmers against fluctuations in weather or bad harvests is a serious issue.

Litro Gas completes Hambantota terminal
Litro Gas has exhibited a significant sales growth of above 30pct in the domestic market during the first 10 months of this year. This complements with the imposed price reductions by the government.
The recent decision taken by the government to reduce the price of 12.5 kg domestic LP gas will further have a positive impact on its sales and volume, which are expected to surge by end this year,the company said yesterday.
The price reductions imposed within a year is significant (44pct) benefitting the lower and middle-lower customer segments, and this has allowed households in both urban and rural areas throughout the country to switch from the traditional firewood to LP gas which today is an affordable cooking fuel.
Litro Gas enjoys a market share of around 73pct and is increasingly capable of catering to the growing demand of the entire LP gas market in the country with its current infrastructure.
Litro Gas Lanka Executive Chairman Shalila Moonesinghe said 'We've had a very positive performance during the last ten months with favourable market conditions. Our increased storage capacity and sales channels shows our ambitious plans to expand our reach of domestic LPG gas to every household in the country.'
Recently the company completed its new LP gas terminal located at the port of Hambantota consisting a storage capacity of 3,000 m/t. The storage facility of Litro Gas now increases up to 11,000 m/t with this new addition.
Litro Gas also moved its' filling operations to its new filling plant in Kerawalapitiya, which is one of the largest LP gas filling plants in the Asian continent.

New technology driving scramble for shipwreck treasure
US: The Spanish galleon San Jose was overloaded with 200 passengers and 700 tons of cargo on a summer night in 1631 when it smashed into a rock off the Pacific coast of Panama, spilling silver coins and bars into the Gulf of Panama. More than 400,000 coins and at least 1417 bars were lost over a 65 kilometre trail.
Four hundred years later, that shipwreck has become one of the latest to land in a legal quagmire over who should have the rights to historic artifacts trapped under the sea. This one involves the United Nations, the US Department of Homeland Security, the government of Panama and Americans accused of being pirates. At issue is whether private companies should be able to claim and profit from historic treasures.
Those questions are of particular interest to businesses in South Florida at a time when technology is making it easier to find and recover sunken loot. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that there are more than 1000 shipwrecks in the Florida Keys alone.
In the case of the San Jose booty, commercial treasure hunters, financed in part by an adventure entrepreneur who runs tours to the Titanic, spent over $US2 million ($2.75 million) and 10 years recovering portions of the treasure, only to see their permits questioned and bounty confiscated.
"They called us thieves, looters, plunderers and pirates," said Dan Porter, a Florida captain who led the expedition to find the San Jose. "That's an insult. I hold this work in the highest regard."
But the industry is engaged in a battle with academic marine archaeologists and UNESCO, the Paris-based UN agency that tries to protect cultural treasures around the world. Critics say buried coins and loot should be studied and preserved in a museum, not sported around an investor's neck.
"Treasure hunters are to maritime archaeologists what astrologers are to astronomers," said Filipe Castro, a nautical archaeologist at Texas A&M University.
The Department of Homeland Security has opened an investigation into the case, and several criminal complaints are pending in Panama. Those actions underscore the perils that often accompany maritime salvage recovery, particularly as nations become increasingly sensitive to the cultural significance of underwater treasures.
In the colonial era, Spain sent fleets to the new world to excavate gold and silver from places like Bolivia and Peru, but hurricanes and other mishaps often sent ships and the gold they carried to unreachable depths.
Pirates and plunderers have long sought to recover them. As technology to find them has improved in recent decades, many legitimate companies have begun hunting, too, only to find their discoveries challenged in court.
Panama was so committed to preventing plundering that in 2003, it became among the first countries to sign a UN treaty protecting underwater cultural heritage. But at the same time, Panama's Ministry of Economy and Finance granted a contract giving salvage rights along its waters to a company called Investigaciones Marinas del Istmo, or IMDI.
Investors included a former Panamanian governor; a Mexican-American engineer; Mike McDowell, an Australian adventure entrepreneur; and - for a different IMDI salvage project - Pat Croce, a former owner of the Philadelphia 76ers.
IMDI spent about 10 years fighting legal challenges. The company prevailed, and, with permits and court verdicts in hand, the subaquatic dig for the San Jose went on. Panamanian government inspectors supervised the project, and a "world class" conservation lab was built to log and preserve each discovery, the company said.
Among other items, divers found gold and diamond jewellery, pottery, and nearly 10,000 silver coins, worth up to $US1000 each. Only one 60-pound silver bar was recovered. Based on the contract, the government got to keep anything it considered historically relevant, plus 35 percent of everything else.
Some Panamanian government officials objected to the deal and brought in UNESCO, which sent a task force to Panama to review the project. Excavation stopped. Even after the haul was divided and the government received its share, the country's comptroller noted a number of irregularities in the contract, questioned its validity and requested an investigation into how it had been obtained. - NEW YORK TIMES

[Reel Reviews] The Time Traveler's wife
No boundaries for love
There are some novels which simply cannot be made into a film. Adapting Audrey Niffenegger's wonderfully complex novel 'The Time Traveler's Wife' could not have been easy but Robert Schwentke and his team had dished out a considerably tolerable version of the tale. The lifelong romance between Clare and Henry begins at the age of six when Henry experiences the horror of his mother's death and time travels for the first time.
Later we see him approaching Clare when she was a little girl, and introducing himself to her for the first time. The two form an instance bond and in later years she becomes his wife.
Minus point
One of the drawbacks of Schwentke's movie is that a viewer who is not familiar with Niffenegger's original text may take time to pick up the pieces of the plot. There are times when he or she may not understand some of the incidents in the tale at all. Henry's habit of jumping randomly to the past and future is enough to perplex even those who know the story. The fact that he shows up somewhere buck naked out of the blue contributes to the viewer's bafflement and complicates his relationship with Clare.
Another minus point is that the reason for Henry's constant time traveling is not given much screen space in the movie expect for a few chitchat lines about genetics. The latter part of Niffenegger's novel deals with this topic in a wider scale while the film hastily touches upon it and makes more room for the romance between the lead pair. It is also unclear why Henry keeps on being drawn to Clare at different periods of her life.
Good reason
Eirc Bana and Rachel
McAdams as Henry and Clare
At the same time a good reason is not given on why Henry cannot make use of his ability to save his mother from the automobile accident. There is nothing to suggest that he cannot make use of his gift as he does take advantage of it by winning the lottery to buy Clare their dream home. Such loopholes and absence of logic puzzle the audience and lets Niffenegger's bestseller down.
One of the worst crimes that a director could do to an adaptation is to change its concluding scene. This we have witnessed in movies like 'My Sister's Keeper' which had a less heart-tugging climax than Jodi Picoult's masterpiece. The same has been done to Niffenegger's work.
The scene indicates that Clare did not have to wait long to see Henry for the last time while the book reveals that Clare waited decades, stretching onto her twilight years, to catch one last heart-stopping glimpse of her husband. Such an alteration tones down the emotional impact on the audience.
Soulful stares
Hunky Eric Bana and the lovely Rachel McAdams make a striking pair though they lack chemistry in each other's arms. However their individual acting skills keep the film from falling apart.
They come up winners with their soulful stares and the emotional struggles they undergo during certain circumstances such as Clare in her miscarriages and Henry after getting a vasectomy.
'The Time Traveler's Wife' is about romance in every sense: its enduring qualities and ability to transcend time and space. However just like Bana's Henry, the audience too does not know if they are coming or going in most instances of this adaptation. It needs much improvement to be on par with the elegance of the 2003 novel.

Pathfinder Foundation to launch Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives
The Pathfinder Foundation (PF) will launch the "Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives" on the 8th December, in Colombo at a ceremony officiated by Indian High Commissioner. Y K Sinha and PF Founder Milinda Moragoda.
A visiting delegation from the Pathfinder Foundation's Indian Track-2 Partner, Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF), will also participate at the opening. The high level 5 member VIF delegation will be headed by retired General Nirmala Chander Vij, former Indian Chief of Army Staff from 2002-2005.
Since its inception the Pathfinder Foundation has placed a special focus on identifying ways and means through which the Indo-Lanka bilateral relationship can be strengthened. In 2002, the apex body of the Pathfinder Foundation, the Milinda Moragoda Institute for People's Empowerment, set up the first Sri Lankan non-governmental demining project in collaboration with two Indian organizations, Horizon and Sarvatra. During the ensuing 10 years, this initiative was responsible for clearing a large number of land mines in the North and East of Sri Lanka.
For nearly a decade, the Pathfinder Foundation has put out regular briefs and held forums on various aspects of Indo-Lanka relations.
In 2012, with the assistance of the Indo-Lanka Foundation, the Pathfinder Foundation conducted a preliminary study on how Sri Lanka could integrate into India's manufacturing supply chain.
In the same year, together with the Manipal Global Education Services, PF conducted a Track-2 initiative, which resulted in the publication of the groundbreaking report: "Resetting Indo-Lanka Relations".
This document, which was prepared by a group of retired senior officials from the two countries, was presented to the then National Security Advisor of India and the Secretary to the President of Sri Lanka. In 2014 the Pathfinder Foundation together with the Indo-Lanka Foundation inaugurated the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Lecture, and invited respected Indian author and journalist M. J. Akbar to deliver the first lecture.
In 2014, the Pathfinder Foundation signed a Memorandum of Intent with the Vivekananda International Foundation.
As part of this understanding these two institutions have begun a Track-2 process that aims to devise a road map for Indo-Lanka relations for the short and medium term.
It is now the intention of the Pathfinder Foundation to build upon these activities by setting up a Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives aimed at bringing about a special focus on this important relationship.

Rock band caught in terror attacks play again in Paris
FRANCE: Three weeks after they watched helplessly as dozens of the their fans died in a hail of bullets, the Californian rock band that played at the Bataclan will return to Paris for an emotional performance.
Eagles of Death Metal are to join U2 for their last song in front of a crowd of more than 16,000 at the AccorHotels Arena in eastern Paris tonight.
It promises to be a moving finale to one of the French capital's biggest concerts since the Nov 13 massacre of 130 people and a highly symbolic act of defiance by the American band.
Paris is scarred by the coordinated assaults on several targets, claimed by Isil. The worst attack brutally cut short the band's performance at the Bataclan, where 90 people were killed.
The members of Eagles of Death Metal escaped injury and halted their European tour to return to the US. They have said they want to be the first to perform at the Bataclan when it reopens after refurbishment at the end of next year, and are expected to resume their tour in February.
In an interview with Vice.com in Los Angeles, they described their horror as they watched terrorists shooting indiscriminately into the crowd, many of whom initially mistook the bursts of automatic gunfire as part of the show.
U2 helped them in the aftermath of the attacks, buying them mobile phones to replace the ones they abandoned during the chaos at the Bataclan, and offering them the use of their plane.
Members of U2 were among the first to visit the Bataclan to pay tribute to the victims as the Irish band was in Paris preparing for two concerts that weekend, which were postponed after the attacks. They are finally playing them tonight and tomorrow.
U2 has often explored the theme of terrorism. A simulated bomb has gone off half-way through its recent shows during the song Raised by Wolves, which commemorates 1974 car bombings in Dublin. "Blood in the house, blood on the street," Bono sings. "The worst things in the world are justified by belief."
Jesse Hughes, the lead singer of Eagles of Death Metal, is a contradictory figure. A flamboyant rock musician and reformed drug addict, he is also an ordained priest and a Republican supporter who has boasted about how many guns he owns and his opposition to gun control. He will be joined on stage by his childhood friend and the co-founder of the band, Josh Homme, who rarely tours and was not in Paris on the night of the attacks.
There will be unprecedented security at the concerts. France remains in a state of emergency with thousands of police and soldiers guarding the streets of Paris. -AFP
