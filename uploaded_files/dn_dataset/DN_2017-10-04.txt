France approves tough new anti-terror laws

France's lower house of parliament has approved a new anti-terrorism law intended to bring an end to a nearly two-year-long state of emergency.
The law will incorporate several measures first authorised under the emergency arrangement.
They include easier searches of homes and confining individuals to their home towns, without judicial approval.
Most people in France approve of the move, but it has been criticised by rights groups.
A state of emergency was first introduced after the attacks of 13 November 2015, when militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) killed 130 people in gun and bomb attacks in Paris.
It has since been extended six times, but there was a consensus that to continue with the state of emergency indefinitely would be undemocratic, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris.
The bill was approved by by 415 votes to 127, with 19 abstentions, and is expected to become law before the latest state of emergency extension expires on 1 November.
Interior Minister Grard Collomb told parliament on Tuesday that the threat level was still "very serious", saying: "We're still in a state of war."
The new law will allow members of the government - rather than judges - to approve the confinement of individuals to their home towns, requiring them to report to police once a day.
The authorities will be allowed to mount security perimeters around places deemed at risk - such as railway stations and airports - within which people and vehicles can be searched.
Mosques or other places of worship can be shut down if preachers there are found to be promoting radical ideology.
A recent poll by the conservative Le Figaro newspaper found that 57% of French people were in favour of enshrining the measures in law.
But Bndicte Jeannerod, France's director for Human Rights Watch, said France had been progressively "weakening" judicial oversight in its counter-terrorism efforts, and "the normalisation of emergency powers crosses a new line".

Gatlin left off shortlist for best athlete
Paris: Controversial world 100-metre champion Justin Gatlin was left off the list of nominees for the IAAF's World Athlete of the Year awards.
Gatlin, who has served two doping bans, was a surprise winner of the 100m in London in August as Jamaican great Usain Bolt bowed out of his top-class career with a disappointing bronze medal. When the IAAF named on Monday their 10 male and female nominees for the 2017 awards, Gatlin's name was conspicuous by its absence.
It is the first time since 2004 when Gatlin was also omitted that the world or Olympic 100m champion has been left off the list.
Gatlin's omission is no surprise, though, as the IAAF changed its rules in 2015 to exclude from its list anyone who has ever been sanctioned for a serious doping offence.
That came after Germany's Olympic discus champion Robert Harting asked for his own name to be removed from the list in protest at Gatlin's inclusion in 2014. AFP
The 2017 list is led by British 10,000m world champion Mo Farah and South Africa's 400m star Wayde van Niekerk.
The women's list includes comeback queen Sally Pearson of Australia, the 100m hurdles champion, and South Africa's Caster Semenya, the winner of the 800m.

GRI selects IFS Applications to drive operational  excellence across its global organization
IFS, the global enterprise applications company, announces that Sri Lankan specialist tire manufacturer, Global Rubber Industries (Pvt) Ltd (GRI), has chosen to implement IFS Applications as its central enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
GRI was founded in 2002 and has since grown into Sri Lankas largest specialist tire manufacturer with over 600 employees who support customers in over 50 countries.
In order to support its growth ambitions, GRI needed to improve visibility throughout its value chain, from procuring raw materials to delivering finished-goods, in order to improve planning and accommodate fluctuations in global demand.
Following an extensive evaluation process comprising of all major tier-one ERP vendors, IFS Applications was selected for its capabilities, modern architecture and the companys successful track record in the industrial manufacturing sector.
IFS Applications will be deployed and rolled out across the organization to give management a complete view of resources and performance that will enable quick and accurate decision-making.
The solution will support business-critical processes such as production and planning, finance, procurement, sales and marketing, quality management, maintenance and document management.
We were impressed with the capabilities of IFS Applications, its vast array of local and global customer references as well as industry analysts confidence in the solution.
It was clear to us that IFS Applications was the most fitting solution to achieve our objectives, said GRI Managing Director Prabhash Subasinghe.
He said, As global tire manufacturers are faced with volatile pricing in raw materials such as rubber, it is extremely important that we are able to plan for fluctuations in customer demand, changes in material prices and availability of materials, all simultaneously, while working to meet strict timelines for product shipments.
In addition to this, as competition increases in an expanding global marketplace, it is necessary for manufacturers to monitor and respond accordingly to competitor behavior, specifically to pricing, promotions and discounts.
Having the right information to hand through IFS Applications will provide GRI with the ability to operate proactively, and therefore be able to provide its customers with highly efficient and effective products and service. We therefore look forward to the rapid implementation of this platform, along with a fruitful collaboration with IFS.
Jayantha De Silva, President and CEO for IFS in Sri Lanka, said, It is with pleasure that we embark on this implementation project together with Global Rubber Industries (Pvt) Limited (GRI).
We are confident that IFSs technology will bring about great improvements in efficiency, as well as greater visibility and integrity throughout the companys operations.
IFS fully understands business challenges associated with such a large-scale implementation and our team has extensive experience in helping clients in both the rubber and industrial manufacturing industries.
We are confident with this expertise,best practices and strong local presence that we will deliver an outstanding solution that will meets the high standards of GRI.

Health Minister orders probe into Sachini Sewwandi death

Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Rajitha Senaratne called for a complete investigation into the cause of death of the second heart transplant patient.
Health Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said it was not the surgery but a post-operative infection which was the likely cause of death of the patient.
The patient, 19-year-old Sachini Sewwandi passed away on Saturday (30) at the Kandy General Hospital. The cause of death was said to be high blood pressure in the lungs.
Addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing yesterday, he reiterated that there was no sign of sabotage in the case.
I had discussions with the surgeon concerned and he explained his side to me. The childs disease was only seen through one angle. The surgeon had been warned not to undertake this operation but he had gone ahead with all the inputs from his senior professors, and was well prepared. From his side, he did it well. The heart started to pump and the child regained consciousness, he explained.
The operation has been rife with controversy from the start with a tug of war between the surgeons at the hospital having caused delays to the operation.
They had also complained that they were not given the right machines to undertake the operation.
Minister Senaratne however explained that he had made all the arrangements to get the machines they needed and that they started with all the necessary equipment.
The operation was successful and the patient recovered faster than the first one.
She was young and so was her heart, said the Minister. He added that she would have caught the infection during her recovery in the ICU.
Minister Senaratne said they were awaiting the microbiological report on the patient to further confirm their initial findings.

Hopeful world of disaster
We have come a long way in the subject area of narratology. Over the years, the creative writers have been engaged in the art of expression as well as the extent to which the contents should be waylaid as human experiences, worthy of expression.
At a period in history where technology and the impact of it on the globalisation is felt both as necessities as well as evil forces, the creative writers have enjoyed the freedom of expression superseding the past narrative forms.
The modern Sinhala narrative writer has accepted these social changes to the point that there arise various controversies as well as tributes paid to them. One such example is the award-winning Sinhala novel by Katyana Amarasinghe titled as Vanna Dasi (Suriya 2017).
Moralities undermined
The narrative embraces almost all the aspects of complexities of the modern human. It if is to be translated well, I am sure it will win the hearts of many a reader around the globe. Katyana, a fiction writer, does not undermine the moralities of the social sphere in her narrative when she creates the character of Ama, the protagonist who narrates the experiences of herself and her mother. She presents the portrait of her mother as a sex worker disclaiming her as a whore.
Amas mother, though is the pivotal character in the work, Ama too faces the same situation as she traverses the struggle to exist as a skilled painter, designer and above all a beautician commending off from being a makeup artist attached to a commercial tv channel surrounded by all the nuances of the so-called popular visual culture. The pomp and pageantry repel her.
This happens as a result of her intimacies with another skilled young man named Sasha. Both of them who leave the popular TV channel attempt to build their own salon that excels both in value and attraction.
They build their business knowing each other as humans and not as business dealers. The narrative explores the nature of Sashas behaviour as a homosexual not so much clamouring for the same. Katyana, the creator does not make a sensation issue out of the subject. Instead allows the reader to justify what it means by living as co-partners in a well-planned business deal, while the business flourishes the overwhelming calamities arises from the antagonists as well as jealous folks who so desire to bring about destructions.
Destructible enemies
The evil forces of the world built by Ama and Sasha react to the climax when hidden political forces to emerge as destructible enemies. Their business firm is ultimately burnt down to ashes before their own eyes.
Then all these disasters are followed by the advent of a suggestive saviour of the souls. He is named as Malan, a friend who comes from abroad with all the qualifications of changing the existing social forces. Malan who perceives the ins and outs of the social situation are seen as the liberator who carves out a new political party.
This helps both Ama and Sasha to attract themselves to him closer and closer. The trio, Ama, Sasaha and Malan are seen attempting to b build a new world. This is a narrative which spans over a period of roughly 20 years or so.
Perhaps the reader of my calibre may be seen as feeling a sense of puzzle to what the socio ideology of Malan that could change the existing pattern of evil forces. This may look perhaps a construction and conflict of ideas born in the mind. But then all is said Vanna Dasi the page-moving resourceful narrative embracing spiritualism as a thread in the content.
Katyana Amarasinghe attempts to show the world of Ama, makeup artist cum designer through packed with disaster is yet hopeful of betterment. The term Vannadasi is symbolic as it is alluded to the facial makeup female servant who had lived in the harems of ancient kings thus suggestive of a facelift for the entire calamitous world of humans.

We need to take necessary action before the outbreak of dengue intensifies once more. It is a grave public health concern and an issue that needs serious measures of control. Whilst supporting the immediate needs bycarrying out preventive measures we also have to look at solutions that work in the long term. As a corporate entity that has been part of this country for the last 125 years, we believe inproviding sustainable solutions to overcome issues faced by communities across the country and transforming their lives for the better, commented Mark Prothero, CEO, HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives.
HSBC also joined hands with the Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management (A-PAD)to assist school children from areas worst affected by floods and landslides that devastated the country at the start of the southwestern monsoon season.

Mahendran was answering to a question raised by Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera suggesting that he (Mahendran) conveyed about ending private placement method to Arjun Aloysius between days from February 24 to 27, 2015. De Livera pointed out that Mahendran was aware of a Rs. 15 billion urgent funding requirement. There is no other tenable reason as to why Perpetual Treasuries Limited bid 15 times higher than the advertised amount on February 27, 2015, De Livera suggested.
Answering to the suggestions, Mahendran said he would not have done such a foolish thing as to divulge market sensitive information. I did not give any information to Arjun Aloysius. Mahendran emphasized.
De Livera asked Mr. Mahendran you did such a thing because you thought it will never leak to which Mahendran said that he does not understand what De Livera meant by the question. At this juncture, Mahendrans legal counsel Romesh de Silva PC stood to ask, What leak are you talking about to which no answer was given but a change of question.
De Livera then asked Mahendran about the conflict of interest between him and his son-in-law. De Livera suggested that Mahendran failed to disclose the conflict of interest between him and his son-in-law while living under the same roof. Mahendran previously informed the Commission that he was living with his daughter, son-in-law and the little child, from January 22, 2015 in Sri Lanka.
Mahendran said that he was dealing at arms length with his son-in-law with regards to their conflict of interest. De Livera asked what is your arms length and a smiling Mahendran who was sitting at the witness box stretched his hands to display his arms length. De Livera, in a lighter tone commented Oh, is that it to mean the arms length is not enough distance.
De Livera then asked Mahendran on Aloysiuss resignation from the CEO position of the PTL. He pointed out that the resignation was tendered on January 16, 2015, which was prior to Mahendrans appointment as the Governor. Does not this mean you started talking about your job with your son-in-law De Livera asked.
Mahendran said he was already packing bags to return to Sri Lanka and his family got to know about his appointment including Aloysius. My appointment was not market or price sensitive information! Mahendran pointed out.
De Livera then asked Mahendran as to why he did not decline the position of CBSL Governor because of the conflict of interest.
Mahendran said he discussed about the conflict of interest with Prime Minister, Finance Minister and several other ministers. I acted at arms length. I never discussed about my official endevours with my family. I had already told him not to expect any sort of favourations from my part regarding his company. I stayed out from all Monetary Board meetings where documents relating to PTL were discussed. I have also asked not to mention Primary Dealer names in the progress reports as well. Mahendran explained. The Commissioner Justice P. S. Jayawardena commenting on the matter of conflict of interest said that it was the same case with former Governor Ajith Nivaard Cabral who had his sister as a Director of the Perpetual Capital Holdings. However, I am not for a moment suggesting that it is correct to have a conflict of interest. Two wrongs do not make a right. Justice Jayawardena said. It is a matter of what is good for the goose is good for the gander, Justice Jayawardena also added a comment amusing those who were at the hearing.
The Commission will continue the cross-examination today as well.

I will act independently: SLMC Chairman
The newly appointed Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Dr.Colvin Gunaratne yesterday said he would function as expected and act in accordance with the SLMC Act to independently perform his duties.
The government has appointed me and I will do my job,said Dr.Gunaratne as his appointment drew fury among state medical students and the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday. The former engaged in a protest outside the SLMC while the latter convened a media briefing to state that Dr.Gunaratnes appointment was an attempt to silence the SLMC.
Dr.Gunaratnes predecessor, 84-year-old Prof.Carlo Fonseka too joined the student protests and alleged that the current chairman was appointed because he was a supporter of SAITM.
In reply to such allegations, Dr.Gunaratne said, He is the man who visited the student protester who broke into the Ministry of Health in prison and came out to say that he would overthrow the government. So, it doesnt matter what he says.
The post of SLMC Chairman had been left vacant for three months, ever since Prof.Fonsekas term came to an end on June 30.

IRD to pilot new approaches to tax compliance - Guruge
The Inland Revenue Department is moving to adopt international good practices as a basis for improving tax compliance from some of the largest companies operating in Sri Lanka.
Internationally, many tax offices approach improving large taxpayer compliance by tailoring their dealings with taxpayers based on an understanding and assessment of risks posed by individual businesses.
We have decided to pilot new approaches to tax compliance in Sri Lanka, similar to those used internationally, said Deputy Commissioner-General Nadun Guruge. Initially, over the next 4-6 months we will focus on large businesses in the construction sector. We will be applying a mix of service and enforcement approaches that have been shown to improve taxpayer VAT compliance in other countries, he also said.
The pilot program is planned to commence from October 2017. After evaluating impact of the pilot towards the end of this year, the IRD will then determine the suitability of broadening the approach to other industry sectors and businesses.

ITC ONE COLOMBO ONE  undertakes second largest concrete pour
A large pour of concrete of quantum 5500 cubic meter was undertaken for the Hotel Tower raft at ITC One Colombo One project located adjacent to the Taj Samudra hotel, Colombo-01, on September 29.
This concrete pour is the second largest concrete pour in the history of Sri Lanka and the same team did the first one (6500 cu.m- the largest concrete pour) in August 2017.
ITC One Colombo One project is a mixed use development project of two tall towers on the Galle Face Road, consisting of 135 units of high end residential apartments in a 224 meter tall tower and a five star hotel of 350 keys in another tower of 140 meters in height.
The project has a unique feature of a sky bridge with a swimming pool at 100 meters height connecting the residential tower with the hotel tower.
The contractor, Larsen and Toubro Limited from India were appointed by the owner Welcom Hotels Lanka Private Limited in January 2017.
The Hotel Tower which is 30 floors tall is being constructed by the subcontractor M/s Nawaloka Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd (NCC), one of the reputed Sri Lankan engineering construction companies.
This concrete pour is undertaken with a special mix design of C50 grade concrete, the ingredients' proportion designed especially for this purpose to cater to the temperature and durability requirements of the foundation and mass concrete.
The concrete pour has 660 MT of reinforcement work with a height of 2.75m. Concrete core temperature of 70 degree Celsius was maintained throughout.
The concrete was meticulously planned in segments for operational ease and planned on a weekend to avoid traffic inconvenience to the neighbours and the general public.
Utmost care was taken as regards safety of the concrete pouring operations including risk assessment and communication, pre-task briefings, strict traffic management and workmen's welfare.
Safety requirements such as emergency arrangements including the ambulance and male nurse and work permit system were also meticulously followed. Adequate lighting arrangements, rain precautions and provision of safety equipment were ensured and this was witnessed by the District Factory Inspector from the Labour Department who inspected the site on September 29.

Japanese technology for long-term food preservation
A Japanese company has pledged to provide its Cells-Alive System (CAS) technology for fish and food preservation in Sri Lanka.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, during his recent visit to Japan, met ABI Chairman Norio Owada. The company management briefed the minister on the CAS technology which keeps food fresh for a longer period.
During the meeting, Minister Amaraweera inquired the possibility of using the CAS technology in Sri Lankan fisheries and other industries to reduce post-harvest loss.
ABI was established in 1989 and developed innovative CAS freezing technology for long-term storage by keeping tissue cells alive. Norio Owada developed a freezing system with magnetic induction function with which he succeeded in freezing cream for the first time in the world.
Thereafter, he invented CAS which was a revolution in long-term preservation of food products while keeping the taste of the defrost product as if it has just been harvested or produced.

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunatillake directed Inspector General of Police to look into the affairs of the Headquarter Chief Inspector of Mount Lavinia Police who is not producing police information books regarding heroin drug cases that come up for trial before the High Court.
The Judge also issued notice on the Mount Lavinia Headquarter Chief Inspector to appear before Court on October 12.
When drug trafficking, the cases were taken up before Court, no police officer had been present from the Mount Lavinia Police.
The police do not produce information books regarding the cases of drug trafficking. Although the Courts had instructed Mount Lavinia Police HQI to produce police information books regarding drug cases, the police are in the habit of not producing the information books when the cases are called before Court for trials. Why is that the Judge queried.
Since there is no response from Mount Lavinia Police, the Inspector General of Police must look into this matter urgently enabling the Court to dispose the drug trafficking cases, the Judge stated in Court.
The Judge made these comments when a drug trafficking case was called before Court for trial yesterday.
In this case, the Attorney General charged Adamberage Roshande Alwis with possessing more than one gram of heroin and trafficking within the jurisdiction of the High Court. The case was postponed by the Judge.

Keeping prices under check
I refer to the news item under the heading President instructs reduction of prices of some essential items. It goes on to say that the President instructed the officials to reduce prices of some essential items.
The President is rightly concerned about the prices of essential items since they affect the living conditions of the people. Most people are more or less on fixed incomes and cannot cope with increases in prices in the short run since their incomes are more or less fixed. Almost since the 1950s, the governments of the day have asked the Food Commissioner and the CWE to be engaged in the import and distribution of essential food commodities consumed by the people.
They did so since the local wholesale and retail markets were small and were controlled by a few importer-wholesalers. The obvious answer was for the government authorities also to be engaged in the import trade of these essentials. So the Food Commissioners Department and the CWE by being engaged in their trade played a key role to keep prices under check preventing local importer-wholesalers from taking advantage of temporary market scarcities due to shipping delays or seasonal shortages in the import source countries - and sometimes even creating such scarcities. When dhal was short in India it was necessary to import lentils from the Middle Eastern countries. We consume a lot of imported food items and attempts to produce them locally have been bedevilled by the high domestic costs of production (due to years of inflationary deficit finance by the populist governments since 1956).
Domestic production costs
So although closely integrated with the world economy we have moved out of step with world production prices and hence import prices have been cheaper despite several depreciations of the Rupee. This has caused continuous deficits in our balance of trade which have been met only from the remittances of our migrant women workers abroad. But our attempts to produce domestically have hardly succeeded because of our higher domestic costs of production. o we have had to subsidize domestic production costs to domestic producers since imports were often cheaper. But we cannot be continuous lotus eaters and we must export in order to import. So we have to promote exports and maintain an export growth equal to our import growth rate. Presently our import growth rate is roughly double that of the export growth rate and this is not sustainable. So we cannot give up on our domestic production of import substitutes.
Promote export growth
If so we must accept higher domestic prices instead of stressing the reduction of prices. While consumers like lower prices producers prefer higher prices. The government must give greater preference to production than consumption if we want development.
So too much emphasis on reducing prices is not in our long-term interests. Some people have a mistaken faith in the free market to achieve trade equilibrium. But we have to make conscious efforts to promote export growth rate to at least equal our import growth rate. But our domestic price structure is out of alignment with world market prices and we must support the prices of our domestic production by limiting competing imports by imposing protective tariffs to safeguard our domestic production processes and products. So the consumer has to pay the price of such support for domestic production for the lopsided situation cannot be allowed to last forever.
So ordering the reduction of domestic prices may be detrimental to domestic production. What the government can do is to remove duties on imports but maintain them at a level competitive with domestic production prices. But attempts to administratively reduce prices of products in the domestic consumer market may not be desirable for our domestic production processes.
We have to give preference to production over consumption if we are to become a developed country.
What the government can and must do is to stop deficit financing of the budget through inflationary bank borrowing and use only borrowing from the public to fund its budget deficit. It would be better still if the government avoids budget deficits altogether. It is only then we can continue to be integrated with the world economy without adverse effects on our domestic production.

Key to weight loss is what time you eat
Being aware of the time you consume food is a huge part of weight loss success, researchers say.
Researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital conducted a study to show how meal times affect your weight. Eating too close to bedtime, cramming our meals in one or waiting too long to eat in between meals spells doom for weight loss, even if we are healthy eaters, the Daily Mail reported.
Experts say it comes down to giving your body enough time to digest. Our circadian rhythm or body clock affects our metabolism. However, it is not so simple for those working night shifts or odd hours. For the study, researchers analyzed the data collected from 110 participants. They provided information on body fat, body mass index and what time they consumed food.
The data was then compared with the persons body clock. The participants sleep times and meal intake were observed for 30 days.
We found that the timing of food intake relative to melatonin onset, a marker of a persons biological night, is associated with higher percent body fat and BMI, and not associated with the time of day, amount or composition of food intake, study author Dr Andrew W. McHill told the Daily Mail. These findings suggest that the timing of when you consume calories, relative to your own biological timing may be more important for health than the actual time of day.
The studys results provide significant evidence that consumption of food during the circadian evening plays a vital role in body composition, the report revealed.

The Las Vegas carnage
The horrendous massacre in Las Vegas, USA, where a lone gunman opened machine gun fire on an open air Country and Western musical show, no doubt, would have shocked the entire civilized world. At the time this is being written 59 persons were reported killed and over 525 injured, scores of them critically, in what is described as the biggest massacre in peace time.
The 64 old gunman, who, it is reported, carried a pilots license, had lodged at a hotel in the vicinity of the concert venue, biding his time for three days, till the dawn of the day of the concert. He had booked a room on the 37th floor of the hotel, obviously with the aim of facilitating his mission, to account for as much victims as he could. He killed himself after accomplishing his macabre deed.
The US Police later found 12 guns in the assailants hotel room and another 37 rifles at his home. It is reported that he had purchased the rifles in their original form and converted them to machine guns over a period. Hence, the killer had clearly been planning his deadly mission well in advance to execute same at a time and place of his choosing.
The mass killing had once again thrown open the whole debate on Gun Control in the USA. Even in the Las Vegas aftermath the pro-gun lobby was sticking to its guns in the midst of strident voices time calling for the ban on the open sale of guns. The issue no doubt is a politically charged one with no one to bell the cat in the foreseeable future.
Strangely, the Las Vegas assassin had no police record, although it was claimed that his father was a bank robber, responsible for several hold-ups. Monday dawns blood bath, by all accounts, is the biggest mass tragedy to hit the USA, outside of natural disasters. US President Donald Trump appeared on American television to condemn the attack and condole with the next of kin of the victims, pledging not to allow evil to triumph, while Senators of Nevada and the Sheriff of Las Vegas praised the efforts of the first respondents, such as the crew of the fire-brigades, and hospitals, but for which, the death toll was bound to have soared. Urgent appeals also went out for blood while TV footage showing chaotic scenes unfolded on the screens. Moving accounts of heroism too were recounted by some of the survivors on television while the deeds of two off-duty policemen who had rushed to the scene, when the staccato bursts of gun fire first rang out, apparently to warn the revelers, only to be gunned down, came in for much acclamation.
The US authorities have discounted any terrorist link in the massacre although an Asian female who had been in the company of the assassin, is being pursued. The attack, from all evidence, so far gathered is a lone wolf project carried out by a sick mind.
Efforts though has been by a local English daily to portray the Las Vegas carnage as yet another terrorist attack and that the US, and west in general, were only getting their just deserts for taking the soft approach against terrorism in the Third World countries, such as Sri Lanka, while also importing terrorism to these countries. The inference is clear. Where Mahinda Rajapaksa succeeded in defeating the worlds most ruthless terrorist outfit, the US and the West is still groping in the dark.
Be that as it may, Sri Lankans certainly can empathize with the families of the victims of the Las Vagas tragedy, having being witness to scenes of a similar nature for nearly three decades. While Mahinda Rajapaksa, no doubt, gets the lions share of the credit for presiding over the final battle to eradicate terrorism from the country, to other leaders, before him, should also go part of the kudos for their contribution towards the military build-up, over the years, in terms of man power, weaponry and training, that facilitated the end, in no small measure.
Has Sri Lankas cricket turned the corner
There will, no doubt, be smiles on the faces of all Lankan cricket fans, following the thrilling victory clinched by our boys against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. The victory will be doubly exhilarating, since it ended a barren spell for the Lankan team, following the serial losses against India and below par performances against underdogs Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. It is hoped, that, with this turn around, the Lankan team will once again get back to winning ways, which marked our performances soon after the 1996 World Cup victory.
Of course, one swallow does not make a summer, and, admittedly, the lads have some hard work ahead, if we are to maintain a winning streak. The narrowness of the victory, and the fact that things could easily have gone the other way, is an indication that there is no room for complacency.

Leader made St. Josephs College
The key to success lies in strong links. If the company holds true then a team can succeed. If there is a weak link the strongest force can fall apart. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of St. Josephs College Raveen Antonio who understands this well, which is why he is successful as a leader.
Every link in the chain is important, and I play rugger and I am the vice -captain of my college. We have a motto. That is  You can have a thousand enemies around you, but if there is one enemy inside your team that will be a big problem!. So I feel all 37 of my prefects must be united and if there are any loopholes it is going to be a big problem. I have made sure that this does not happen. There can be no room for misunderstanding. Because this can lead to a big problem. The link is the most important thing. Everyone needs to work towards one goal, explained Antonio.
Rigorous trainer
Rugger is the sport he plays. Rugger is when 15 men go against another 15 men. From their young days they are trained rigorously at matches. When you play a lot of matches and gain a lot of experience you dont have that fear. If you have experiences you dont feel the fear. The opposition team can be really good or really weak, but on one day the weaker team can be better.
What I feel is that you should lead in the proper way. There can be good luck or bad luck for both sides. If we do all things correctly, if I give my first tackle properly and collect the ball well, then I can gain confidence. Then you dont feel nervous. If you do the basics correctly and understand that small things can make a difference on the field then you can be successful. To do well in rugger you should know the basics first. You need to know the hard work can beat luck, added Antonio.
Antonio certainly has a bright future and has been selected to South Eastern University of Sri Lanka.
I have done my A/Ls and I have obtained four As and have been selected to South Eastern University of Sri Lanka. Currently we are also working on our college walk and preparing for Prefects Day. As a Prefect, it is the most important day for a prefect. That is the day we do a lot of work. It is also the time when we get a lot of experience approaching sponsorships meeting people. I am also doing ACCA at Mercury Institute, said Antonio.
TO understand life
As a Head Prefect, the experience of being a Head Prefect has benefited Antonio a lot. A Head Prefect understands life. The need for a leader to understand life could be clich statement, but that is exactly what it is. The society beyond the world of a student is a complicated and full of peril. One is suddenly beset with various problems when stepping into this world beyond school. Society makes demands and one is suddenly surrounded by its multiple problems. It is what you learn at school that will prepare you to engage with these personalities who may not be very friendly or nice, personalities whose motives maybe ill-intentioned.
As senior prefects at St. Josephs from an early age we are sent out to approach a lot of people. We go from bank to bank to get advertisements, banners and sponsorships. So that environment enables us to understand how to approach a person and talk to a person. It is really easy for us. As prefects we have learnt a lot. The role of Head Prefect is easy for me because I have had that experience as a senior prefect, said Antonio.
Antonio has faced many challenges as Head Prefect. Overlooking the work in college is what he find most strenuous. In an event the Prefects hand has to be there. Invariably the prefects are involved, and working with the teachers is one of the main challenges.
Gigantic task
One of the most challenging events was when we had to control 200 cardinal priests at the Presidents House in December (Asian Bishops Conference) So, there were only 37 of us prefects. This was gigantic task. That gave us invaluable experience. It was a first time I was there with all the security systems and we were basically doing the ushering part, said Antonio.
A person who relishes putting himself to the test, Antonio works very hard. From morning till dusk he works. He is a finisher while relying on his deputies. A man who believes that the best way to getting something done is to do it yourself, he is no stranger to hard work. He does the job no matter what.
They key to my success is the family background that I have. My religion is also a great source of strength. The fact that I went to church from a young age has helped me a lot. I have received many things spiritual, and I believe in doing something useful for the country. One of the most important keys to success is the ability to listen. Listening is also being silent. I feel that listening hard can put you onto the road of success. Discipline and commitment are also important. Words are powerful, so be careful about what you say. It can break someones heart. Once it is said you cant take it back. They say the tongue has no bones but can break a heart, pointed out Antonio.
Antonios leadership is not just a title. He wants people to respect him not for his position but for his character. But he also believes in talking to people the correct way. Then they will listen to him. So when controlling the student body he distributes his work amongst his fellow prefects. So organization is the key.
For anyone in life bravery is important. You need to be really adaptable. There are situations where you have to adapt. This applies to life and to his Rugger. Rugger has helped him a lot to work as a Head Prefect.
Cleverness and strength can make a big change. And of course you have to be brave to play rugger. Then you will give your heart and soul to the field. I have sustained many injuries on the field but that cant be helped. My position is fly half and cleverness is needed in that position. He generates ideas. The main position ideas are generated is in the fly half position, stated Antonio.
Feeling that any decision is better than no decision he is able to assess the situation. This is off the field and on the field. He will act. If it is tough he will ask those who are senior to him like his parents or teachers or the principal.
They are always there to help me. I will get everyones idea and select the best idea then I can solve the problem easily, said Antonio.
Antonio feels that to be a good leader you have to have patience. You have to be strong because trouble finds anyone in leadership. You cant prevent it from coming to you but you can control the way you react.

Legal action against Ambewela Milco factory protesters
Legal action will be taken against people who conducted a protest campaign opposite the Ambewela Milco Milk Factory as they have caused damage to a large number of factory assets and robbed several other equipments, Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison said.
Minister Harrison was responding to questions raised by the media during a workshop held for dairy farmers and a distribution of Milco members cards held at Kahatagasdigiliya recently.
Minister Harrison said, the Ambewela factory was about 50 years old. The factory had lacked a filtration faculty. Now water filtration machines were being installed at the new factory building. The installation of machines delayed owing to the tender procedure and other work activities. It was during this time that the protest campaign was launched. They would never leave room for any environmental damage. The delay had caused an injustice to dairy farmers and other water consumers. Steps would be taken to expedite installation work and prevent such inconvenience in future.

Magical feminist books to inspire creative resistance
Writing magical realism can be risky; its easy to fall into clichs. But it should never be dismissed as some kitschy literary device. Its history and traditions are firmly rooted in the literature of resistance, in the literature of re-visioning. Which makes sense: If we dont like reality as it is, with all its violence and injustice, we have to reimagine it. And sometimes, that reimagining includes leaps of enchantment.
The supernatural elements in magical realism can serve to disrupt reality, giving voice to the other. Patricia Hart first used the term magical feminism thirty years ago to describe the work of Isabel Allende, the Chilean-American author who was compared to Gabriel Garcia Marquez until critics turned cobalt blue. But Allende had her own literary vision. In magical feminism, the merging of the rational and the fabulist often includes strategies of defamiliarization, supernaturalization, and border transgressions, depicting witches and faith healers, shape-shifters and mixed-race protagonists, intersex and trans characters, and visions of femme-centric utopias.
The Stories of Eva Luna, Isabel Allende
Allende is famous for writing hybrids of family history and fiction, giving voice to ghosts and sexually empowered women alike. In The Stories of Eva Luna, we meet characters on the brink of moments of social changeoften with one foot in the old, oppressive world and one foot in a world theyre only daring to imagine. She went by the name of Belisa Crepusculario, Allende writes of one character, not because shed been born with it or baptized it, but because she herself had searched until she found the poetry of beauty and twilight and cloaked herself in it. She made her living selling words. Magical feminism allows characters to create their own identities.
The Vicious Red Relic, Love, Anna Joy Springer
In her fabulist memoir, Springer uses text and image, re-imagined myth, deep sexual desire, and an imaginary friend made of tin foil to lead readers into a world where interpersonal ethics supersede tired, patriarchal social norms and death has no dominion.
Voodoo Dreams, Jewell Parker Rhodes
Marie Laveau was born a free woman of color just before the Louisana Purchase made New Orleansalong with pretty much the entire Midwestpart of the United States. Laveau was barred from holding public office because of her race and gender, but by all accounts it was she, and not municipal authorities, who reigned over the city for the better part of the century. Although her influencepolitical, social, and spiritualwas legendary, the historical material on Labeau remains fragmentary. Enter the magical fiction of Jewell Parker Rhodes. Moving through the centuries, blending fact and vision, Rhodes brings the woman who walked like a queen vividly back to life, and makes her relevant to the here and now.
Watercolor Women Opaque Men, Ana Castillo
Castillo is perhaps the most versatile of the magical feminists, equally at ease in poetry and prose. This epic in verse shows off Castillos sheer range, following Ella, a Chicana everywoman and single mother who describes herself as Part Medusa/Part Mother Goose/and part Xochiquetzal as she works, struggles, and busts through walls to raise her son, striving for more than the opaque version of masculinity that the world seems to require.
Sassafrass, Cypress, and Indigo, Ntozake Shange
Sassafrass, Cypress, and Indigo came to me in the early 90s, when I was stuck in the seemingly endless end-phase of a violent relationship, still bound to my ex because wed had a child together, and here was a book that directly addressed domestic violence. The story follows three powerful, creative sisters as they begin to make their way in a world that is terrified of power and creativity in black women. Shanges young, marginalized characters turn to each other more often than they turn to law enforcement, casting spells of protection and aspiring, always, to control their own fates.
The Legacy of Lucy Little Bear, Barbara Robidoux,
This novellas poetically shifting point of view illuminates the experiences of shape-shifting women and marginalized men as they navigate threats, both from within their own families and communities and from the outside world, where indigenous women vanish and search parties are rarely formed.
Sexing the Cherryby Jeanette Winterson
In a fantastic world that is and is not seventeenth-century London, Dog Woman, a giant murderer of Puritans who wears a skirt big enough to serve as a ships sale, finds a baby in the river and nurtures him until hes ready to travel the world and his own strange mind. I mean, what could go wrong Throw in the refracted fairytale of The Twelve Dancing Princesses, and its enough to destabilize five centuries of patriarchal power structures. Historical magical realism at its gender queerest, this is a tale worth reading at least once a decade.

Communicable diseases such as measles and rubella will be eliminated by 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, Sri Lanka is well ahead of other countries in the region when it comes to controlling communicable diseases. However, dengue and HIV are on the rise in Sri Lanka. The Health Ministry has implemented several programmes to address the situation, the minister said.
He was addressing the gathering after launching a three-year dengue control programme organized by the Sanasa Development Bank at Beruwala, recently.
Minister Senaratna said 90 percent of the dengue menace had been eradicated in the past but all dengue control programmes need to continue. Managing solid waste is important when it comes to dengue control. Garbage disposal needs more attention, he added.
Dengue is prevalent in developed countries such as the US, Singapore and Malaysia.

Myanmar beauty queen 'dethroned over Rohingya video'

A Burmese beauty queen has claimed she was stripped of her pageant title over a video she made on the ongoing violence in Rakhine state.
Shwe Eain Si had posted the clip online last week, accusing Rohingya militants of perpetuating the unrest.
The 19-year-old lost her Miss Grand Myanmar title in recent days after the company which crowned her revoked it. But the firm denied the video was the reason, saying it was because she breached contract rules.
The company, Hello Madam Media Group, announced on Sunday that Shwe Eain Si had been stripped of her title because she did not behave like a role model. On Tuesday, the beauty queen drew a connection between her dethronement and her video clip.
"Yes, Shwe Eain Si made a video about the reign of terror brought about by the Arsa militants in Rakhine state, but that was hardly qualified as a failure to project a decent image of a pageant contestant," a statement posted on her Facebook page said, making reference to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.
It added that she "is obliged as a citizen of this country to use her fame to speak out the truth for her nation". But Hello Madam's director Soe Yu Wai later told the BBC that the decision "does not concern... her Rakhine video", and claim they stripped her of the title before the clip was published.
Shwe Eain Si came second at the Miss Universe Myanmar competition organised by Hello Madam last year, winning the title of Miss Grand Myanmar, and was due to represent her country at the Miss Grand International competition later this month.
In the graphic video, posted on her Facebook page last week, the beauty queen says Arsa's "caliphate-style movement" attacks were "out of proportion".
Speaking in English, Shwe Eain Si accuses the militants and their supporters of conducting a media campaign "so that harbingers of terror and violence themselves [now seem] as if they are the oppressed". Her video makes no mention of allegations that the Burmese military have carried out widespread atrocities against the Muslim Rohingya minority.
The army, which has been accused of conducting ethnic cleansing, has said it is only targeting militants. The latest outbreak of Rakhine violence began on 25 August when Arsa militants attacked security posts, triggering a military crackdown.
More than 500,000 Rohingya have since fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. Rakhine villagers and other minorities such as Hindus have also been affected by violence. But correspondents say that the large wave of Rohingya migrants and their widespread claims of abuse at the hands of the military indicate their community has been disproportionately affected.
Shwe Eain Si is not the first beauty pageant winner to run into trouble in recent months.
In September the winner of Miss Turkey 2017 was stripped of her crown after it emerged she had shared a post referencing last year's coup attempt. Competition organisers said the tweet was "unacceptable".

New Constitution, no threat to countrys unitary status: Patali
An interim report on the new Constitution compiled by the Steering Committee will pose no threat to the unitary status of the country and would accord the foremost place to Buddhism, Megapolis and Western Province Development Ministrer Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister was addressing the media at theJathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) headquarters yesterday.
The Minister added that no new Constitution has been prepared but only a set of draft of proposals to the Constitution has been forwarded by the Steering Committee appointed to prepare a new Constitution.
Therefore, there is no base for agitations since the new Constitution has not yet been prepared.
However, it can be observed that certain people are levelling baseless allegations about the countrys unitary status and the priority accorded to Buddhism, he said. Minister Ranawaka added the draft of a Constitution presented to Parliament recently contains the proposals of nine political parties including the SLFP,JHU,JVP, TNA, etc.
The draft is to be amended and it is not the final copy of the Constitution, he added. Asked about the procedure followed with regard to the formulation of the Constitution, Minister Ranawaka said there will be a debate in Parliament on this matter. Then it would have to be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament and followed by a referendum.
There is no base for agitating that the country is going to be divided and that Buddhism will not be accorded priority, he noted. The Minister further pointed out that all Parliamentarians have unanimously agreed to prepare a new Constitution and therefore all MPs have become members of the Constitutional Assembly.

New Constitution will unite nation
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said the new Constitution which aims at uniting the country, will further strengthen Parliament.
We expect to fulfill the hopes for a new Constitution, which will not divide the country but unite the nation and cater to all needs of the public, the President said joining in the vote of commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliament Democracy in Sri Lanka yesterday.
The President stressed that the governments intention is to further strengthen Parliament and support all political parties required to make this aim a reality.
We will continue to strengthen Parliament.Our intention is to further strengthen this House and we expect the support of all political parties, President Sirisena said.
He said this in Parliament joining in the vote of commemorating 70th anniversary of Parliament Democracy in Sri Lanka which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
President Sirisena said as in the past, SAARC will help strengthen regional cooperation in the future as well. He added that all should sacrifice to maintain cordial trade relations with SAARC countries, establishing democracy in SAARC countries, using technological advancement and to create a civilised society.
Expressing his joy at this significant juncture when Parliament celebrates 70 years of establishing Parliamentary democracy, he appreciated the presence of the Speakers of the SAARC countries who had accepted the governments invitation and attended this historic event. He said their presence strengthens relationships in the SAARC region.
The past seven decades were important for our country. As a result of the recommendations of the Soulbury Commission and the Soulbury Constitution we were able to establish Parliament for the first time. All previous governments should be commended for having taken measures to establish democracy. The 1972 Constitution changed the we Governed the country. A new Constitution was established in 1978. Creation of the Executive President with unlimited powers and authority deteriorated or deduced the powers of the Parliament to a certain extent. The 18th amendment to the Constitution placed Parliament in a very difficult situation. But the current Government, which came into power on January 8, 2015 to repeal the 18th with the 19th amendment to the Constitution has been able to strengthen Parliament, the President added. He also made special note of all past leaders who had contributed in establishing democracy within the country as well as from abroad including D.S. Senanayake, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Dudley Senanayake, J.R. Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, D.B. Wijethunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa.
We have gained immense experience in developing the nation. It is our responsibility. The executive, judiciary and the legislature should work in ways that will not create frictions but to uphold supremacy of Parliament. I strongly reiterate that it is necessary to act in a way that it will not tarnish the countrys democracy. Fundamental rights, human rights, democracy should all be established. Economic prosperity should also be established. The rule of law has to be established and it is of vital importance that the independent judiciary is required, noted the President during his address.

OUR UNITY CANNOT BE SHATTERED BY EVIL: Trump
US: US President Donald Trump decried the massacre of at least 58 Las Vegas concert goers as an act of pure evil Monday, but refrained from addressing calls for gun control or an unproven claim of responsibility from the Islamic State group.
Delivering televised remarks from the White House, Trump ordered that flags be flown at half-staff until sunset Friday, offered prayers for the victims and announced he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.
Trump did not address an IS propaganda agencys unverified claim that one of its soldiers who had converted to Islam months ago was responsible.
White House officials also refused to comment on that claim at this point saying the local authorities investigation was ongoing. The FBI says it has so far found no connection between international terrorist groups and the Vegas attack.
Calling for unity, Trump instead tried to console the nation -- an act that has become a grim rite of passage for modern US presidents as each mass shooting rekindles the divisive national debate on gun control.
In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one -- and it always has, Trump said.
Our unity cannot be shattered by evil. Our bonds cannot be broken by violence. And though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today -- and always will, forever. But in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, that unity was difficult to find. Police have identified the heavily armed gunman behind the Sunday night massacre in Las Vegas -- the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history which left more than 500 injured -- as a 64-year-old Nevada resident named Stephen Craig Paddock.
Paddock apparently killed himself before a SWAT team breached his hotel room overlooking the concert venue, recovering at least eight rifles.
Trumps vanquished election rival Hillary Clinton hit out at the gun manufacturers lobby -- the National Rifle Association -- which has backed a congressional push to make it easier to obtain a gun silencer. The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, tweeted Clinton, whose Democratic Party has tried in vain to introduce lasting gun control measures despite the national scourge of mass shootings. - AFP

Over 1,500 in Bandagiriya sans drinking water
Nearly 1,506 farmer families in Bandagiriya settlement scheme in Hambantota have fallen into dire straits due to the lack of safe drinking water.
They say the water supplied through the Bandagiriya community water supply scheme is brackish and cannot be used for drinking proposes.
Moreover, their pots and pans, and clothes are soiled when washed in the water supplied.
Although the Hambantota Divisional Secretariat had taken steps to deploy a bowser to distribute water, residents in one section of the scheme had not received it.
They request authorities to provide them with water from the Ruhunupura project.

Overseas Realty to invest US$ 180 mn  on largest office complex, retail mall
Overseas Realty (Ceylon) PLC will invest over US$ 180 million to build one of Sri Lankas largest office complexes and retail and entertainment mall areas in Havelock City premises.
The proposed office complex towering 50 floors will be similar to the World Trade Centre and would also cater to the same commercial market segment, said Pavir D. Samarasinghe, Director Group CEO, Overseas Realty (Ceylon)PLC. The mall would be adjoining the office tower and would have five floors.
In addition to this investment, Overseas Realty is also embarking on the second stage of the residential complex where two additional residential towers are being built. The two residential towers of 226 units each will also have parking slots for 520 vehicles. We have also concentrated on the garden space and offer seven acres of landscaped gardens, Samarasinghe added.
The first residential tower would be ready by June 2019.
He said that the demand for both mid and luxury housing would keep on increasing in Sri Lanka. Its not a bubble that is about to burst.
He said that Sri Lankas demand for housing is increasing mainly due to people moving to the city and also because people are investing on a second home concept. There is also a trend where people buy apartments and rent it and this trend would not decline.
He however said that Sri Lankas apartment pricing is high in comparison to rents in the region. If you take an average apartment its around Rs. 25 million; in India or Indonesia, the same size apartment would be Rs. 15 million.
The main reason for this is high cost of duty on construction materials and also high cost of labour.

Paris Accord   Will it reduce or aggravate  future Hurricanes
At public consultation session ofPublic Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka on June 15, 2017, I made a presentation (this is available in PUCSL Facebook) wherein I showed the two major large scale atmospheric circulation models Hadley and Walker Circulations as given in Kiehl & Ramanathans Frontiers of Climate Modeling.
I mentioned that when it comes to Sri Lanka, Hadley Circulation originating here will move northwards at 120  150 x 109 kg/sec until it reaches north of India, drop moisture and come down and south towards Sri Lanka, while longitudinal circulation at 810E per Walkers would be about 0-10 x 109 kg/sec. Last few weeks,North India and Nepal and Bangladesh experienced severe rainfall killing more than 1000 and affecting few millions, may be in line with Hadley Circulation.
I also mentioned that at Longitudinal range of 650 to 1250 W, country receiving this onslaught from Hadley Circulation at same speeds and onslaught from Walker Circulation at 0 - 75 x 109kg/sec is USA. While Hadley would hammer stretch from New Orleans to California, Walker Circulation would beautifully fit into USA. In April, 2017 MIT newsletter had indicated that large scale atmospheric circulation models provide more accurate predictions than recent climate models in interpreting high precipitation events in USA. So,it appears that Hadley Circulation had been very active at different longitudinal coordinates at approximately same time.
In USA, majority would be worried about precipitation than about high temperatures, heatwaves or wild fires. Damage to economy of USA as well as to population of USAdue to Hurricane Harvey may be many times that by wild fires which affected western parts of USA only a few months back.
What the Paris Accord Says
If one looks at the 25  page, 29  clause Paris Accord, one would not see a single statement about water vapour  which is what would yield precipitationas no other greenhouse gas has ability to precipitate  nor about precipitation. It has many references to climate change. It is as if proponents of Paris Accord do not know that climate has three major parameters, temperature, precipitation and wind. There are references to greenhouse gases in the agreement, but general understanding shared by scientists manning both UNFCCC and IPCC is that although water vapour is most effective greenhouse gas in atmosphere, any new water vapour entering atmosphere will not be able to exert additional greenhouse gas effect because that new water vapour condenses after a short residence time in atmosphere.
This crooked thinking promotes less carbon containing, but more hydrogen containing fuels like natural gas instead of coal. Although Paris Accord does not talk about this specifically, it mentionsthe need to reduce greenhouse gases as early as possible as only way to achieve a maximum of 20C rise in temperature by 2100AD. When they talk about greenhouse gases, they do not include new water vapour entering atmosphere. If you look at stand taken by International Energy Agency, they have said in their document Redrawing the Energy  Climate Change Map published in mid-2013, on page 37 as follows: Natural gas is the only fossil fuel with increasing electricity generation in the 450 scenario but it still peaks before 2030 and then starts to decline ending 18% higher in 2035 than in 2011. As such I take it that advocates of Paris Accord also intend to increase consumption of gas only until the peak year and it may be approximately a 18% increase.
How would such a 18% increase influence two major types of catastrophes faced by mankind  hurricanes, cyclones, etc and heatwaves, draughts and wild fires. Our objective is to evaluate how these phenomena would be impacted by Paris Accord promoting more usage of natural gas to (a) replace coal or (b) supply additional energy required.
Our Methodology
One needs to remember that every atom of carbon in oil and gas is associated with 2 and 4 atoms of hydrogen respectively. Natural gas is Methane (CH4) and oil can be depicted by (CH2). Substituting oil or gas for coal, we are reducing CO2 emissions because carbon content in fuel burnt is less. Balance amount of energy need to come from some combustion and that is of hydrogen in new fuel, oil or gas. This combustion  reaction of this hydrogen with oxygen in air  will yield what I call Newly Formed Water (NFW). I call it NFW because that water vapour was not available as water in global water cycle during last million years.
When you burn oil or gas a mixture of CO2 and NFW (and never only one of them) leaves the system together, at an elevated temperature. When Climate Scientists like Prof. John Seinfeld at Caltech University calculated that when CO2 concentration in atmosphere increases from 280ppm to 560 ppm (a 280ppm increase or addition of 2094 Gt of CO2) atmospheric temperature increases by 1.20C, they also computed that 1302Gt of water vapour will evaporate from oceans and land to maintain constant relative humidity at this elevated temperature (by 1.20C), and this water vapour increases temperature by an additional 1.60C to give that much talked about total increase in temperature of 2.80C (1.20C rise due to 2094Gt of CO2 and 1.60C rise due to 1302Gt of H2O).But any new additional water vapour to maintain constant relative humidity at this further enhanced (by 1.60C) temperature & thetemperature increase due to same is/was not considered.
So here also we envisage these two primary stimulants CO2 and NFW from combustion of gas or oil, willincrease temperature to bring secondary stimulant stream of water vapour into atmosphere from oceans and land and exert a second increase in temperature and nothing more. When you burn 1 litre of gasoline (0.8kg) as fuel in your vehicle, 1.08kg or 1 litre of NFW along with 2.64kg of CO2 will get into atmosphere. These two primary stimulants will bring another 3.08 kg of water vapour (secondary stimulant ) into atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity. When one burns a liter of gasoline s/he should be preparedto receive this 4.16kg of water as precipitation whenever or wherever that is going to come down. Obviously this water does not come down along the track of vehicle immediately after passage of vehicle. So both spatial and temporal accumulation takes place and what would be the most probable time for this water to come down. It would be when heaviest rain fall would take place under normal circumstances. Is it surprising that we receive much more rainfall than we used to and every passing year amount of gasoline used increases, amount of CO2 andNFW formed increases and amount of water vapour coming to maintain constant relative humidity increases and rainfall/precipitation received also increases.
In March, 2011 at Georgetown University, President Barak Obama announcing a four - prong attack on climate change requested heavy vehicle users to switch over to natural gas. Complying with this request, 55% of new heavy vehicle purchasers in 2nd part of year opted for gas powered vehicles and natural gas combustion increased. What did this imply
If the efficiencies of two types of engines  oil fueled and gas fueled  remain same, anybody who was using 1 litre (0.8kg)of oil would now be using 0.833kg of gas and generating 2.3kg of CO2 (instead of 2.64kg from oil) and 1.88kg of NFW (instead of 1.08kg earlier) and this flow of flue gases would bring up another 3.94 kg (instead of 3.08 kg earlier) of water vapour to maintain constant relative humidity. So the propensity for precipitation increased by a staggering 40%due to this switch over. We experienced this increased propensity in New York in November, 2012 in facing Sandy. In fact I wrote an article titled  From Georgetown to New York in 18 months and e-mailed it to Mr. Brian Dumaine at Fortune magazine suggesting that he uses it in any way he thinks appropriate. I am not sure whether he made use of it.This is what happens when you switch over from oil to gas and it is plain ordinary level chemistry and most elementary climate science. I am not sure whether anybody informed the President about these possibilities.
Triple effect of NFW
Normal theory of CO2 based climate change leading to precipitation would not yield such high values for probable precipitation. If we brought about total energy of 129,000 TW hrs used in 2015 only from coal, we may have generated only 39.6 Gt ofCO2 which may have brought up another 23.8 Gt of water vapour into atmosphere and what would have been available for increased precipitation may be, only this 23.8 Gt at the most, assuming it comes down only once. If this total energy was obtained from gas we would have generated 29.7 Gt of CO2 along with 24.3 Gt of NFW and these two streams would bring an additional 39.4 Gt of water vapour to maintain constant relative humidity. Thenwhat would be really available for precipitation will be 63.7 Gt ( 24.3Gt of NFW and 39.4 of evaporated water ) if they come down only once. So if we obtain all our energy from gas instead of from coal, the propensity for precipitation and cyclones would increase by a staggering 168%. So are you surprised that Harvey brought down 45 trillion litres of water on Texas and Louisiana.
If we assume that NFW does not bring about a greenhouse gas effect as our climate scientists want us to believe, then we should be having only 17.8 Gt of new precipitation from evaporation due to CO2 and 24.3 Gt of NFW totaling 42.1 Gt which will be 33% understatement.
If we look at temperature it would spell out a similar picture. The 39.6 Gt of CO2 from coal combustion and 23.8 Gt of water vapour entering the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity would increase temperature by 0.0220C and 0.0290C respectively. If this total energy were to be obtained from gas, then 29.74 Gt of CO2 and 24.37 Gt of NFW generated would have raised temperature by 0.0470C and water vapour entering atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity at this higher temperature would increase temperature by another 0.0620C totaling 0.1090C which is 109% increase above the set up with coal combustion.
Now let us look at the third climate parameter wind.
When Sandy or similar hurricanes  above normal ones belonging to hurricane season and region  impact USA, they generally say it is due to warm, moist winds coming from Africa, warm ocean water and low wind shear. If one looks at all these three aspects one would see that water vapour from oil and gas combustion would yield more heat and moisture to the winds, surface temperature increase will be more due to water vapour than due to CO2 and viscosities of O2, N2, CO2 and H2O are in the ratio of 29,25, 19 and 13.
According to Wikipedia, there are six reasons which leads to formation of cyclones and NFW makes significant contributions towards five of these; sixth one is a location specific requirement. In September, 2008 Nature Magazine carried an article which said that from 1981 to 2006, wind speeds for strongest tropical storms increased from an average of 225km/hr to 251km/hr and ocean temperature averaged globally over all regions where tropical cyclones form increased from 25.20C to 28.50C i.e. at 0.0120C per year. Previous paragraphs showed us how NFW influences both wind speeds and temperatures.
It may be worth noting that when one considers last 120 years , only 12 year period which saw 5 major hurricanes along the east coast of USA happens to be the last 12 years.
Way forward
If we are interested in reducing/eliminating these hurricanes we need to reduce amount of NFW we emit every year. This is not the way Paris Accord wants us to move. If we want to reduce the number of hurricanes or their intensities, we need to look at these numbers and decide specifically whether we want to move away from hydrogen containing fossil fuels as soon as possible. Then question arises as to how mankind is to obtain energy required. Amongst possible alternatives solar would rank high due to its ready availability. Main obstacle to use of solar energy on large scale to match amount of energy required for, say, transportation in a scenario when battery electric vehicles are the predominant mode of normal road transportation is availability of land and the need to carry out deforestation for establishing solar parks.
Nobel prize winner in Physics, Dr. Ivar Giaever has said global warming we experience is basically due to deforestation and construction of highways with black tarred surfaces. Forest cover not only converts CO2 in atmosphere to O2, energy in solar radiation to chemical energy  both these during photosynthesis  and reflects a certain fraction of solar radiation into outer space, but also cools the atmosphere by transporting water in the ground whenever necessary. The elimination of these four leads to global warming. Then when tarred road surface is built incident solar radiation is almost entirely absorbed only to be reemitted as longwave infrared radiation leading to global warming.
So best place to lay photovoltaic solar panels to convert solar energy to electricity will be above highways and Highway Solarisation is defined as A dedicated infrastructure for generating electricity for supply to the main grid and / or powering battery electric vehicles using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above the highways as a solution for climate change. In a future where BEVs become main mode of road transportation, Highway Solarisation will enable us to provide power needed with least amount of transmission losses.
When this is done, we will be using a manufactured solar panel to (a) eliminate most amount of greenhouse gases  CO2 and NFW  for unit of energy actually used, (b) eliminate most amount of waste heat generated for unit of energy actually used and most importantly, (c) eliminate 1.4 kWhr of global warming for every kWhr of electricity generated/used. What more would you expect from a solution for climate change
Conclusion
The fact that Newly Formed Water (NFW) from combustion of oil and gas burnt to obtain energy is far more dangerous than CO2 it replaces in providing energy stems from secondary level chemistry and elementary knowledge of climate science. NFW becomes dangerous due to its ability to impact significantly all three climate parameters temperature, precipitation and wind.
Right now we are experiencing the worst of tropical cyclones to hit USA and trillions of gallons of water disrupting the lives of millions of people and causing damage to the tune of $ 100 billion. Paris Accord, if implemented and usage of gas is promoted to achieve its objectives, could increase these water related disasters dramatically thus bringing up results contrary to its expectations. This is due to the inadequate study of energy generating techniques carried out by Scientists at helm of the science establishment providing support to the accord.
What we propose is to implement Highway Solarisation as early as possible and eliminate generation of NFW to providelow CO2 energy, as fast as possible and also eliminate global warming due to (a) deforestation as well as (b) highways already constructed or to be constructed.
It was President Donald Trump who initiated this pause to the Paris Accord and benefits arising from same could be enormous. He might be remembered as the American President who challenged the might of an army of global scientists and suggested we have a second look at climate change. Who knows  it might make all the difference and save mankind from water related disasters.. [Please note that due to the climate change effect of greenhouse gases not been directly proportional to their concentrations,the related absolute values given may not be exact. But I emphasis very strongly, that the relationships between them would hold true in all instances quoted. One of my objectives is to remove the veil of mystery cast over climate change aspects, so that intelligent citizens of the world could understand it and constructively participate in its resolution]

Reconciliation thrives as democracy prevails: Gayantha 
Reconciliation among the communities in the country is soundly built as democracy is established under the present government, Chief Government Whip and Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said yesterday.
"Reconciliation among the communities could not be built in the past since there was no democracy.
The government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe established democracy creating a healthy environment conducive to reconciliation," Minister Karunathilake said. The Minister made these observations yesterday in Parliament joining the vote of commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said Sri Lanka the oldest Parliamentary democracy in the region.
"The contribution of Parliament is commendable in the country's development as a welfare State," Minister Karunathilake said, adding that the members have contributed immensely in the development of health, education, transport, agriculture, land and housing sectors.
He said the support of all the parties in Parliament, including the Opposition at a crucial juncture is a commendable feature and an example to the other countries in the region.
President made history by giving up power to strengthen Parliament: Minister Kiriella
President Maithripala Sirisena has made history as the first President in political history, who gave up his powers to strengthen Parliament, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament joining the vote of commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said President Sirisena is willing to grant more powers to Parliament. He said Parliament wanted to strengthen Parliamentary democracy. Independent Commissions were established for the purpose, Minister Kiriella said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe took measures to set up Parliamentary Oversight Committees.
"When we were in the Opposition, we got minimum opportunities to join the duties of the government. But today, Opposition members get opportunities in the Oversight Committees. Out of the 17 Oversight Committees, nine are chaired by Opposition members and work on behalf of the government," Minister Kiriella said.
He said the government passed the Right to Information Bill. The Minister said when Speaker Karu Jayasuriya attempted to get the Right to Information Bill while he was a member in the Opposition, the then Government rejected it.
He said all parties in Parliament participate in the new Constitution making process under the guidance of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
"This is special because the Tamil Political parties did not participate in those processes during the J R Jayawardena regime and Chandrika Bandaranaike regime, but for the first time, all parties are working together," Minister Kiriella said.
"When we obtained independence, our economy was second only to that of Japan," Minister Kiriella said, adding that today, we have not been able to maintain that position. We have reversed due to party politics, he said. He called on all parties to unite to drive the country forward.
unity government established to introduce new electoral system: Nimal Siripala
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) joined to establish a unity government with the objective of introducing a new electoral system, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday.
He said the SLFP expects a new Constitution could be presented and passed later in the same process.
He made these observations yesterday in Parliament joining the vote of commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Minister Nimal Siripala said Members of Parliament represented the people and since independence have maintained diverse political views.
"Even those revolutionists who thought power should be gained through bloodshed too have accepted the democratic path," Minister Silva said, adding that the people hold Parliament and democracy in high esteem.
He said past members such as Amirthalingam, R. Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali and Lakshman Kadiragarmar had to sacrifice their lives due to the scourge of separatism.
"They had to sacrifice their lives as they came to Parliament to strengthen democracy," Minister Silva said.
The Minister said there was an attempted military coup during the regime of Sirimao Bandaranaike, but the SLFP defeated the attempt and protected Parliament democracy.
"There is a need of a new electoral system to strengthen democracy further," Minister Silva said.
He said the civic rights of the then SLFP leader Sirimao Bandaranaike was removed by Parliament. He said democracy was threatened in 1983 by way of a referendum.
"But the people re-established democracy as they don't fancy dictatorship and military rule," Minister Silva said.

Parliamentary democracy strengthened despite transformations: Speaker
Measures have been taken to strengthen Parliamentary democracy despite many transformations, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this statement delivering his winding up speech at the vote of commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Speaker welcomed the guests present in Parliament from other SAARC countries, adding that Sri Lanka takes pride in being the country in Asia that has the longest history of Parliamentary democracy.
We have had many victories. The government has established independent commissions to strengthen Parliament. We have passed the Right to Information Act. We have not only included government members but even opposition and other party members in the sectoral oversight committees. We have given an opportunity to question the Prime Minister once a month. These are great achievements, including the measures taken to bring in laws for new electoral system and increase female representation in Parliament.
The government has presented a set of ethics for members of Parliament. The government has also taken measures to introduce an electronic voting system in keeping with modern technology. International Parliamentary relations have also been strengthened, including many initiatives taken by the government to strengthen Parliamentary democracy, Speaker Jayasuriya said.
Country preserved democratic governance through electoral processes: Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan addressing Parliament on the vote of commemorating the 70th Anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, said over the past 70 years, the country has preserved democratic governance through electoral processes.
He said the electoral process alone cannot ensure democratic governance. The electoral process quite often serves to retain majoritarianism, he said.
Recognition and respect for pluralism are fundamental to the achievement of democracy. Incipient steps towards respect and recognition of pluralism by agreement among leaders of the country were not implemented. Constitutions that were claimed to be autochthonous were no more than self-serving and did not in any way serve the needs of a pluralist society. On the contrary, they entrenched majoritarianism, he said.
"We have had insurrections and long periods of armed conflict from which the country and its people have suffered. The worst victims have been the Tamils who have long struggled for the preservation of their identity and dignity. The issues that were the causes of the armed conflict remain and need to be resolved, he said.
Sampanthan said it was a great privilege that as the Leader of the Opposition, he together with the Prime Minister was able to move the motion commemorating yesterdays sitting of Parliament at the 70th anniversary of the Parliamentary tradition.
He recalled the first meeting of Sri Lankas independent Parliament, on October 14, 1947 at Independence Square in Colombo, when the Duke of Gloucester acting on behalf of the Kingdom and the Government of the United Kingdom, the last of the country's colonial rulers, granted Sri Lanka then known as Ceylon, independence.
"We had been under colonial rule for more than 400 years. As a young boy, I was present at Independence Square when Sri Lanka was granted independence. I watched that event with great pride. Our first Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake received that instrument of independence on behalf of the People of Sri Lanka," he said. We were then a united people. Irrespective of ethnic or religious differences, we wanted independence from foreign rule. In fact, the Jaffna Youth League voicing the sentiments of the Tamil people were not happy with the dominion status. They wanted Poorana Swaraj, absolute independence, he said.
Sampanthan said: "We have learnt many lessons, from the most, harmful situations that have prevailed in our country. It would be a tragedy if in the name of patriotism any one seeks to prolong the harmful situations."
There are several processes to create a country devoid of conflict and violence, where issues are resolved through discussion and debate, and on the basis of national consensus. This would mean that all the Sri Lankan people, irrespective of their ethnic or religious differences in a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka look upon Sri Lanka as their own country, and become an integral part of the Sri Lankan nation, with a Sri Lankan identity, Sampanthan said.
Today, we are attempting to move towards being a united people in a united, undivided and indivisible country. I do not think that there can be any disagreement on that. If we want our wish for Sri Lanka to succeed, we need to unitedly work towards the achievement of that goal, the Opposition Leader said.
Country on the threshold of constitutional reforms to avoid pitfalls: Hakeem
The country is on the threshold of a process of constitutional reforms to avoid the pitfalls of the past.
A debate on relative merits and demerits of the presidential form of governance is before the people, SLMC Leader and Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem said in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations joining the vote commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
The Minister said while we celebrate 70 years of parliamentary history, it is opportune for us to look squarely at our profound failure to forge an overarching national ethos of democratic debate and to reflect with some degree of disappointment at the gradual decline of the quality of debate in the house.
"The first Parliament disenfranchised a segment of the people who voted at the elections.
That was the thin end of the wedge that over the years developed into a process resulting in a conflict that lasted three decades, he said adding that "emerging from the conflict, we defeated a cessationist movement, but failed to restore the kinships and fraternal relations among our diverse people."
Hakeem said there emerged a triumphalist mindset that enveloped Parliament as well. He said the Parliamentary majority jettisoned the Parliamentary feature of accommodating dissent. Alternative points of view could not be presented. What was more pathetic, he said, was that alternative views were considered rebellious, anti-national and unpatriotic.
He said whatever form is adopted, it must ensure transparency, acceptability and high quality of legislative output and executive excellence.
What we should do is to arrive at a trade-off between the two systems with an institutional structure that is resilient in ensuring the interest of the people notwithstanding the politics inherent in party politics," Hakeem said.
Parliamentary democracy blemished: Dinesh
Parliamentary democracy in the country is blemished with black marks, Join Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He said periodic elections should be held at the right time if there is Parliamentary democracy.
"Elections are not held at the proper time. It demonstrates that there is an issue with democracy in the country," MP Gunawardena said.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday joining the vote of commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said the Joint Opposition has 54 members, but due recognition has not been given to them in Parliament.
EPDP joined mainstream politics with confidence in Parliamentary democracy: Devananda
The EPDP joined the mainstream politics with increased confidence in Parliamentary democracy, Jaffna District EPDP Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda said.
He said they had to take up weapons as there was no confidence in Parliamentary democracy. He said with the Indo-Lanka Pact, they saw a change in the people of the south and decided to enter into mainstream politics 30 years ago.
He made these observations yesterday in Parliament joining the vote of commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Devananda said when they came to mainstream politics, there was no civil administration in the North. They found it hard to establish civil administration in the province, he said.
Democracy suppressed in Parliament: Anura Kumara
Parliament has been a place where democracy has continuously been suppressed, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations joining the vote commemorating the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka, which was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He said some say Parliament is the centre of democracy, but it is a wrong notion.
Dissanayake said Parliament was a place where democracy had been misused for selfish motives of those who ruled the country from time to time. The Parliamentary system had been manipulated for the sinister gains of a few families, Dissanayake said.
Parliament passed laws legitimising the Criminal Justice Commission to render punishment without hearing their cases. It passed laws to punish selected persons, he said.

PMs office conducts Train the Trainer program for persons with disability
The Train the Trainer Program to empower persons with disability was held from September 20 to 22 for private sector institutions, field officers of National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and Vocational Training Authority (VTA), a press release from the Policy Development Office of the Prime Ministers Office stated.
The Policy Development Office has established a Sub-Committee on Vocational and Technical Training focusing on persons with disability (PwDs) to enable vocational training schools to absorb more PwDs in the near term. The committee recommended conducting a Train the Trainer program under a pilot scheme. Over 35 participants from various districts took part and were benefitted through this three-day programme.
According to the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) data in 2012, 71% (1,105,761) of the total population of persons with disability (PwDs) have functional difficulties, aged 15 years and above and are mostly economically inactive. Persons with Disability (PwDs) have difficulty in accessing the job market and have issues of social, economic inclusion.
The output of the programme will be improved access to vocational training, continuing education, employment, live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life for persons with disability (with visual, speech, hearing, mobility, intellectual, and psychiatric disability).
The three-day training programme was a success, in that the participants committed themselves to make a change in the lives of the persons with disabilities which will be monitored periodically by the TVET Subcommittee on PwDs. It was organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Department of Social Services, Employers Federation of Ceylon, Youth Business Sri Lanka, World University Service of Canada, MAS Holdings and the Subcommittee on Vocational and Technical Training focusing on Persons with Disability of the Policy Development Office of the Prime Minister's Office.

Politicians should not denigrate Maha Sangha: President
Politicians should not disparage or blaspheme the most venerable Maha Sangha in making various statements on political, social or religious issues. Politicians should uphold the august dignity and veneration of the Maha Sangha, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Galle.
He was addressing a gathering that followed the religious events in inaugurating the golden fence around the Bo Tree abode and the unveiling of newly constructed 12-cubit Standing Buddha Statue at Dangedara Jayawardenaarama Ancient Temple in Galle on Sunday.
The religious festival was held under the patronage of the Maha Nayake of the Supreme Sangha Sabha of Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya Most Venerable Kotogoda Dhammawasa Thera.
Owing to some belligerent and pugnacious conduct of a few Bikkhus, no one should degrade the venerable Maha Sangha as a whole. I would never condone or encourage
such confrontational statements of some of our politicians and civilians, the President said.
I believe that our culture is more supreme than the law and the Constitution of the country. We have diverse cultures in our country. We have the Sri Lankan culture.
Then we have Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim cultures. In the same way, we can observe different provincial cultures.
The Northern Province culture is dissimilar to that of the Southern and the Central Province culture has different features in comparison to Western or North Central cultures and other provinces. Although our country is small geographically, it is a glorious nation gifted with rich and diverse cultures, the President added.
We have to study comprehensively and cautiously about the countrys past, present and future. In the study of our history, we can observe that it was a struggle-filled past. In any state we see various internal conflicts throughout their histories.
Due to the geographical location of our country as an island, we have many advantages as well as disadvantages. Making the utmost use of the geography, we have to initiate new ventures, making use of potential for tourism, resources for agriculture and marine resources for the fishery industry. We can develop our country by improving our agriculture, President Sirisena said.
We have many social, political and economic problems in the country. The draught prevailed in five districts and a number of districts were severely affected with floods for over one and half years. Owing to these natural calamities, our agricultural output declined by 50 percent.
On the other hand a vast potion of our crops is destroyed by monkeys, apes and elephants. At a recent economic forum, the Kegalle District Secretary revealed that in the Kegalle district alone, over 75,000 monkeys threaten cultivations. We cannot advocate the killing of these wild animals as we are a Buddhist country. We have to consult the Wild Life Department and formulate a suitable scheme to address this wild animal menace, the President said.
Various allegations are leveled against contemporary economic, social and political issues. Anyone can criticize our work and further, protest against the government. However, such moves should be taken after correctly analyzing the issues, he said.
Several Mahanayaka Theras including Most Venerable Kotuwegoda Dhammawasa Thera, Ven. Ittepane Dhammalankara Thera and Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayaka Thera wrote to me recently about some vital issues including the long-standing Sangha Kathikavatha (Ecclesiastical Code). Our government on a number of occasions tried to rectify the issue.
We moved it in Parliament too. However, due to various obstacles, our effort became unproductive. I am greatly concerned about all matters raised by the Venerable Maha Sangha. I promise that I will fulfill all your sincere aspirations for the country, the President affirmed.
The importance and dignity of a person is measured by his deeds and behaviour in society.
The Buddhist ideology and tradition has guided us in this respect. Since the era of ancient kings, our Maha Sangha has led our nation in making it a glorious State. In the same manner, the Mahna Sangha has come to the rescue of our country at all times of national crises and foreign invasions. Hence, our veneration for the Maha Sangha remains in our hearts forever, the President said.
Amarapura Maha Nikaya Maha Nayaka Most Ven. Kotagoda Dhammawasa Thera delivered an anusasana while administrative Viharadhipathi of Dangedara Jayawardenaraamaya Ven. Pallawela Sumedhawansa Thera proposed the vote of thanks. Southern Province Governor Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara also spoke. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva, and Ministers Wajira Abewardana, Gayantha Karunathilake, Chandima Weerakkodi, former Minister Anura Batian and Deputy Ministers Nishantha Muthettigama and Manusha Nanayakkara, Provincial Minister U. G. D. Ariyathilake, Galle District Parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi, Provincial Councillor Jayantha Jayaweera, politicians and others were present.

President Maithripala Sirisena opened the new building of the South East Asia  Middle East  Western Europe 5 (SEA-ME-WE 5) state-of-the-art submarine cable system landing station built by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), at Matara, on Monday.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system spans approximately 20,000 km, offering POP-to-POP (Point of Presence) solutions from Singapore to Europe via France and Italy.
The system connects 17 countries and serves as a new platform for development in the ICT industry.
The conceptualization of the new submarine cable system evolved around the capacity requirements of inter-continents to support the next generation of internet applications, which come from all parts of the world. The SEA-ME-WE 5 is designed to provide upgradeable transmission facilities by adopting the latest state-of-the-art multiple 100 GBPS technology. When fully loaded, the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system is capable of carrying a total 24 terabytes per second: the equivalent of transmitting around 4,800 high-definition movies every second.
The President opened the new building of the SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system in Galle using the digital technology and he also laid the foundation stone for the network station located in Galle.
Ministers Harin Fernando, Mangala Samaraweera, State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Deputy Minister Tharanath Basnayake and Southern Province Minister Chandima Rasaputhra and several other ministers, Sri Lanka Telecom Chairman Kumarasinghe Sirisena and the Board of Directors were also present on the occasion.

Refugees under UNHCR care top 728
There are 728 refugees in Sri Lanka now under the care of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
The minister, addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, said they belong to 10 countries, adding that the majority of them are Pakistani nationals.
Bringing out the statistics of refugees in Sri Lanka as at August 31, 2017, the minister said there are 533 Pakistani nationals, 113 Afghanistan nationals, 35 Myanmar nationals, 14 Syrian nationals, 10 Palestine nationals,8 Maldives nationals, 7 Iranians, 6 Yemen nationals and one each from Somalia and Tunisia among them.
At the same time there are 605 asylum seekers in Sri Lanka pending the refugee status of the UNHCR. Among them are 504 Pakistani nationals and 77 Afghanistan nationals. He said the UNHCR has undertaken the responsibility to send them to a third country as soon as possible.
Asked by a journalist as to where these refugees are presently located, the minister said he was not aware. I dont know, but the Government must be aware. I will inquire and let you know, the minister replied.
The minister said Sri Lanka is not a party to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention along with India, Pakistan and many other countries, and therefore not bound to keep refugees permanently.
Despite that, we look at the humanitarian aspect of the issue and act in keeping with the international law. The Sri Lankan Government has signed a Status Agreement in 2005 with the UNHCR and according to it, the UNHCR is bound to send them to a third country as soon as possible, he said.
He also said the Government acted responsibly during the recent agitation near the refugee shelter at Mount Lavinia that housed 31 Rohingya refugees, adding that the arrests made following the incident showed that the Government acts swiftly against the law breakers.

Sangakkara bids adieu to Frank Sinatras My Way
Farewells are usually sad affairs and emotional and Kumar Sangakkara being the great cricketing legend he is, was no exception to it. After three successful seasons with Surrey County the elegant left-hander bid adieu to cricket bringing to an end a glorious first-class career and the parting with Surrey was not without emotion.
To show their appreciation to a great servant of the game the club put together a memorable video to the meaningful lyrics written by Paul Anka and sung by that great singer of his generation Ol Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra - the song My Way where video clippings of the repertoire of Sangakkaras strokes for Surrey during those years were played throughout the song. But what was most poignant is the way each player of the team described Sangakkara in one word.
The words used were: Unique, Legendary, Prolific, Gentleman, Majestic, Astounding, Humble, Inspirational, The Greatest, Role Model, Gracious, Master and King.
Sangakkara left a legacy behind Surrey scoring 5269 runs at an average of 64.27 and 19 first-class centuries.
The lyrics of that legendary song are quite in tune to the achievements of Sangakkara:
My Way by Frank Sinatra
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way.
Sangakkara is the latest of a long line of Sri Lankan cricketers who displayed their skills on the English cricket fields starting from Dr CH Gunasekara, the first Sri Lankan to play for an English county in the 1930s and the only Sri Lankan so far to appear in a championship winning side Middlesex.
In the pre-Test era it was the likes of cricketers like Dr Gunasekara, Laddie Outschoorn, Gamini Goonesena, Dan Piachaud, Stanley Jayasinghe, Clive Inman and Gehan Mendis that kept the countrys flag flying high with their deeds on the English cricket fields. In the post Test era there have been many cricketers from Sri Lanka to grace the fields of English county cricket, the most notable of them before the advent of Sangakkara was Aravinda de Silva who played one season for Kent in 1995, a year before Sri Lanka won the World Cup.
What that one season did to De Silva was to reignite his appetite for runs and make him a better player converting him into a consistent performer on the international stage. It was not that he had not performed at international level before but the one season with Kent tightened his defence and disciplined him to the extent that he was a totally different player altogether. We dont have to reiterate De Silvas contribution to the national team from there onwards  the highlight no doubt was the two outstanding knocks he played in the semi-final against India and in the final against Australia for Sri Lanka to win the World Cup in 1996. But the impact De Silva made in the one season with Kent is described vividly here:
Henry Blofeld in the Independent:
Aravinda de Silva is one of the few batsmen in the history of the game whose batting technique has been touched by the divine hand. He has scored more than six thousand Test runs and has distributed his favours just about equally against the attacks he has encountered.
Kent supporters will need no reminding of his talents, for he delighted them at the lovely St Lawrence ground almost as much as another left-hander, the legendary Frank Woolley, did all those years ago. The hundred De Silva made for Kent against Lancashire in the Benson and Hedges Cup final at Lord's in 1995 was one of the best ever played even on that ground.
Mark Nicholas in the Telegraph:
Aravinda is a marvellous, instinctive batsman, by nature an entertainer who sees his job to taunt, tease and challenge bowlers and force error from their frustration. There are elements of Javed Miandad to his play in the compact set-up, the short back-lift and the ability to manoeuvre the ball into hitherto unseen spaces.
He played a season for Kent in 1995 and they loved him in the hop county. A charming fellow, wrapped in layers of thermals and woollens until July when, once or twice, he peeled off the long-sleever and promised to withdraw his hands from his pockets. In the evenings, when the Kent players would knock on his door to take him for dinner, he would be in front of the mirror, miming the off-drive, head still, elbow high, bat straight - utterly a man of cricket.
Aravinda and Sanga have left a legacy behind them in English county cricket for other budding Sri Lankan cricketers to emulate. How many of the present generation can match their deeds

SEA-ME-WE-5 submarine cable landing station,  Matara  inaugurated by President Sirisena
Sri Lanka Telecoms SEA-ME-WE-5 Submarine Cable landing station at Browns Hill Matara was inaugurated by President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday evening.
The President also digitally laid the foundation stone for the South Asias first state-of-the-art Submarine Cable Depot in Galle port which will be operated and managed by SLT and provide submarine cable maintenance within an area between Djibouti in the west, Perth in the South from January 1, 2018.
Sri Lanka will be the only Submarine Cable Depot in the South Asian region. Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said that they presently Sri Lanka is one step ahead of India as they are still not connected to SEA-ME-WE-5 cable network.
He also said that they hope to provide every Advanced Level student with a tab and a key board with internet connection by April next year. This will also help to take ICT to rural homes. The pilot project in this regard was held at Visakha Vidyalaya Badulla and it was a big success.
We will also be introducing the Local Government Network (LGN) soon which will help reduce government expenditure on printing, travelling and officials time in day to day administration of the nation.
This SEA-ME-WE-5 (short form for South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-5) undersea cable system will enable SLT to provide higher transmission speeds as well as reduce their cost. It will increase SLTs international bandwidth capacity tenfold and will be sufficient to meet the ICT requirements of the country for 25 more years, said P. G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena Group Chairman of Sri Lanka.
SEA-ME-WE-5 is capable of delivering a gigantic 24 Tera bits per second global bandwidth capacity to Sri Lanka and this will also help contribute greatly towards the vision of making Sri Lanka the digital hub of the region. Sri Lanka Telecom has invested over Rs. 20 billion for this project which spans more than 20,000 kilometers was completed within a space of two years. Sri Lanka Telecom always makes investments with Sri Lankas future ICT requirements in mind. Of SLTs total investment of Rs 275 billion, Rs 100 billion has been invested on digital technology. He also disclosed that the tier 3 data center in Pannipitiya will be commissioned in November this year.

Seven decades of Asias oldest democracy
Amidst a major political debate on the delay of elections to local bodies and provincial councils that concern the status of Democracy and representative government in the country, the Parliament of Sri Lanka celebrates its 70th Anniversary, the institution recognized as the Parliament of Asias oldest Democracy.
The traditions of this Parliament began before independence in 1948, from the State Council established in 1931, under universal adult franchise, and before all other British colonies and most Western democracies had accepted universal franchise.
The beginning of representative democratic governance came through many struggles for such a system from the early years in the last century, by nationalist leaders, socialist campaigners, trade unionists, Buddhist revivalists, and many advocates of freedom, who sought changes in the system of colonial rule, giving more power to the people.
The gaining of universal franchise and representative democracy was a result of Britains response to the demands of nationalist campaigners, by establishing the Donoughmore Commission in 1927 that recommended universal franchise and a wider representation of the people in the State Council, and the Soulbury Commission in 1944, recommended a parliamentary form of government for the country. It directly led to the birth of the Parliament celebrating its 70th Anniversary today.
The British House of Commons enacted the Ceylon (Constitution) Order-in-Council of 1946, which by Article 7 provided for the creation of the first Parliament in Ceylon.
Although February 4, 1948, is the Independence Day of Sri Lanka, the beginning of the Parliament that was, and remains the key institution of this Democracy, dates before that. The first election to the new House of Representatives was held over a period of 19 days from August 23 to September 20, 1947.
State Council Building
The first meeting of Ceylons Parliament took place on 14th October 1947 at what was then the State Council Building  later to be the Parliament  for the purpose of electing a Speaker of the new Parliament. Although the UNP had won a majority in the first election to Parliament, the first to take their seats in the new Assembly were Florence Senanayake  the only female member of the new Parliament and Dr N M Perera, both of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), followed by two more LSSP members Philip Gunawardena and Robert Gunawardena, and then by the other members of the new Parliament. The first Speaker then elected was Sir Francis Molamure.
This Parliament has since continued widening and strengthening democracy and peoples power through many challenges. It has seen many ups and downs in the practice of democracy, committed to preserving the values of democracy and the rights of the people; amidst major changes in political thinking in the country. It has seen the progress of representative democracy, through the past 70 years, while similar establishments in South Asia, with similar colonial histories, have collapsed, or were rebuilt with many of the values of democracy seriously harmed.
From its very inception, this Parliament was and remains in the midst of controversial political activity. At the very early stages, it passed legislation depriving a whole minority community, the Tamil plantation workers, their citizenship rights, making them stateless. Yet, this same Parliament, many years later, restored full citizenship to these people, showing the Parliaments role in the better functioning of democracy.
This Parliament saw a major threat to democracy with the attempt at a military coup dtat in 1962, mostly by reserve and retired military and police officers, whose efforts were defeated.
In 1971, the Parliamentary system faced the first youth uprising, led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, seeking to overthrow the elected SLFP-led government of the country, which failed after much bloodshed. It also faced a second JVP uprising in 1987 - 89, under the UNP-led government, which too was defeated by the armed forces of the democratic State. In August 1987, a Member of Parliament and a Parliament employee were killed, a Minister of the Government seriously injured, and the Prime Minister and several MPs injured in an armed incident within Parliament.
Later, the country faced an uprising of ethnic rivalry, leading to a separatist war that lasted almost 30 years, from the 1980s, which was brought to a military defeat in 2009. This action by the forces of separatist terrorism was the most serious threat to democracy faced by Sri Lanka, and its defeat was a major contribution to the progress of democracy in the country. This Parliament sustained the democratic process during these critical periods in the country.
Economic and political strategies
This Parliament has seen the transfer of power in the country from a father to son  from the first Prime Minister D S Senanayake to his son Dudley Senanayake, after the fathers demise. It saw the assassination of a Prime Minister S W R D Bandaranaike in 1959. It later saw the election of the worlds first woman Prime Minister, Sirima Bandaranaike, the widow of the late S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. The first woman President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, was also a Member of Parliament and Prime Minister.
Legislation from this Parliament did lead to many significant changes in the policies of the country, from the adoption of Sinhala Only as the Official Language in 1956, and moving towards a state-centred economic process with the nationalization of bus transport and the ports, and the State moving into Banking and Insurance, the carrying out of land reform and control of the plantation industry, following the political changes of 1956.
But in later years, with the major electoral change of government in 1977, this Parliament also saw the introduction of a market-driven and largely private sector-led economy. The political debate on these systems and the need for new economic and political strategies continue to be much of the parliamentary and public debate to this day.
It also saw the change from the original House of Representatives from 1947 moving to the first Republican Constitution in 1972 and the National State Assembly, and next to the 2nd Republican Constitution, with an Executive Presidency from 1978, and the legislature being named Parliament.
From 1947 to 1978 as all Heads of Government or Prime Ministers were members of this elected legislature, in keeping with the tradition of the House of Commons. After the adoption of the Executive Presidency in 1978, when the holder of his office is Head of State and Head of Government, all of them since 1978 have been Members of Parliament. They are J R Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa, D B Wijetunge, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa and the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena.
It has been the representative House for members who entered it with exceptional knowledge of the parliamentary process, and others who gained such knowledge in the House. There were skilled debaters, political moderates and extremists, academics and professionals, and leaders of the workers and peasants, who enriched debates with humour, sharp criticism, and verbal anger, reaching the highest standards of parliamentary performance.
Democratic society and culture
The original Legislature was housed in two premises. The House of Representatives was in the building put up to house the old Legislative Council of Ceylon, which opened in January 1930, and one year later housed the State Council, and next transformed into the House of Representatives  the Lower House of Parliament - with the achievement of Independence in 1947. It is today the Presidential Secretariat. The Upper House or Senate was located in a building opposite the Governors Residence or Queens House, was abolished in 1971, prior to the adoption of the first Republican Constitution in 1972.
Parliament moved to its new premises in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte in 1982.
While the old Parliament building was of distinctly Western tradition and architecture, the present Parliament building portrays a style of regional modernism, giving an important position to the traditional architecture of Sri Lanka, with much Japanese influence too, because of the Japanese assistance in its construction. It is a great work of the Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa.
As the Parliament of Sri Lanka celebrates its 70th Anniversary, it can look back at the development of a democratic society and culture in Sri Lanka, moving away from colonialism to freedom, independence, and national sovereignty.
It has moved from Dominion State after direct British colonial rule, to that of a Democratic Republic, and has seen the country overcome many threats to democracy. Overall, it has seen the peaceful changes of government, through elections, and has been the centre of legislative changes that have steadily improved the social, economic and cultural advancement of the country.
The Parliament today is the House to a coalition of the two largest  and traditionally rival political parties, and the debating often leads to angry and heated confrontation. It is also considering constitutional changes that could further advance Democracy.
On this 70th Anniversary, the Parliament of Sri Lanka must look forward to further strengthen its role in the advancement of the democratic process, making further contributions to the progress of Sri Lanka as a nation and a member of the international community of nations, with the continued commitment to democratic governance.

Short Story: AU PAIR
I had an American au pair. It was the result of my constant search for an au pair with the consent of my family members. Bandulakumara Gurugamage, my worthwhile friend, made my dream come true through a friend living in The United States.
My children Amalka, Navoda, son in law Thisara and my beloved wife Somalatha were on cloud nine with the happy information of her arrival. Our little Hima, the only grandson, Amalka and Thisaras first baby, a toddler of four was always looking at the western sky unendingly waiting for Cassidy Grace, our au pair. Her arrangements appeared on my e-mail and it was followed by the documents delivered at my doorstep through snail mail.
Happiness knew no bounds; we were at the Bandaranayke International Airport to collect her on 23rd May, happily on my 67th birthday. The coincidence went into our family history, on our way home on the expressway to Galle, we had to answer a barrage of questions from our au pair, she was quite curious to know about our culinary arts, language, our reciprocal arrangements on her behalf, and about her child minding part we had requested. Hima gave all the living answers, Well begun is half done.
Our simple dwelling nestles among the verdant tea plantations, with a huge tea factory in the backdrop of greenish vegetation with an enticing topography. The naturally blue vault of the sky and the ambience seemed to have mesmerized our au pair even for a longer stay. Her three month stay added to our historys face. Even our grandmother next door came to life from her eroded shore like old age.
Our American visitor slept like a log on the first night because of jet leg and wearisome travel and in her sleep we attended to her room and lodging facilities as a norm of keeping an au pair and upholding our own culture to her sense and sensibility. My wife hung a huge tapestry of the Kandy pageant on the opposite wall of her bed. She was made able to breathe our culture just fresh from the bed. The morning sun beams reached her bed through the window making every morning a sunny dream. Our grandson woke her up every morning, saying, Cassidy aunt, sky is blue, wake up wake up! Thank you Hima, my good boy, good morning. Our child prodigy always uttered in his singing voice, Every morning is a good morning in Lanka I gave GOOD AFTER NOONS by LUDOWYKE from my library to read and feel GALLE.
Good morning Somalatha nenda. Good morning Dasa mama. Can I help you
It was the voice of Cassy, our au pair. We lovingly called her Cassy which she liked very much. We lately learnt that it had been her pet name at home in her teenage. Cassy was twenty when she became our au pair. She was slim and about six feet in height corresponding to her age. Her white skin was the main attraction for our Hima, but her complexion dimmed in our sun in which she basked a lot. She drank sunlight and learnt hari awwa Navoda became her language teacher. She gave nice tongue twisters to her within her first week of her sojourn.
Api ada polsambal hadanava. Polkiri hodith hadanava. Cassy doo kemathida My wife told her in our general Sinhala parlance. It was very interesting to hear how she put our words into American accent. She was treated to an authentic Sri Lankan meal for the first time. It seemed that her taste buds had saturated beyond expression as she told us that she had no words to express. Nenda I have no words to express your culinary excellence. East can give a lot to the west. My wife raised her collar for her genuine appreciation, what is poignantly lacking in me. My wife is a culinary ambassador in the presence of foreigners. She doesnt have any sense of xenophobia.
Around nine at night Cassy tiptoed to my writing table fully aghast. The few hairs on my bald head raised. Ei Cassidy doo Duwa bayaunada Ne mama, kauda kandayak kegahanawa maha haiyen. Mama hithana eyala loku partiyak danava wennethi. She said in good Sinhala. She had improved spoken Sinhala a lot by that time. She has picked up a lot from our family in language acquisition.
I felt very shy. I felt like a failed ambassador in his duty. The old nanny of the adjoining house next door had died. People in the vicinity had gathered there for their nocturnal merrymaking of playing carom, eating for transferring merits for the dead and also for giving a helping hand. This owl type behavior of the mourners of our country was a big shame for me when she said, Lankawe maranayak samaja uthsawayak da I was flabbergasted.
I lost courage. My patriotic emotions died. Her words were an inadvertent slap on my ambassadorial dignity for three months. Later I happened to read that she had written her authentic experience on the social media how Sri Lankan people could convert any serious happening of sorrow to merrymaking overnight.
Next day, I took her to our famous village temple DUTUGEMUNU RAJAMA VIHARAYA. My wife led her all the way climbing up hundreds of stony steps to the shrine room. Aunt, who are these big cemented people in array with different weapons in their hands. They look very energetic, determined and brave. Cassidy asked from my wife. My daughter Amalka not only explained about the ten great generals of King Dutugemunu, but also the much chronicled Sandarawala legend to her in her lucid mother tongue. I explained the gist in American accent for her utmost happiness.
Cassidy was very thoughtful. One day, she asked me an unexpected question. As it was quite palpable to her she wanted to know the expenses that we, as the host family, had done on her, so far. I simply said to her not to worry over it as we were duty bound to pay some little money for her numerous engagements in our household chores and child minding. A big thank you mama. I can still remember how she uttered those words very understandingly and lovingly.
To my utter surprise ,she was dancing in our parlor one night. You look very happy today, Cassy duwa. I told her. Mama, some people are singing some aboriginal type of songs and I think they are dancing. Dear mama, could you take me there It was a house of devil dancing. I took her there with our little Hima. It was a good treat to her eyes.
Mama, mama hari asai nettuwange endun walata. Mama australiawe aadivasinge netum dekala thiyenawa. Mama bayauna naya enavita. E unata mama balagena hitiya kenek hangila indagena nayek kesel pathura dege evanawa. Nayage dala keduwama bayanehe. The secret of devil dancing as a mental therapy to cure mental disorders is known to most of the people now. Cassidy was a careful observer. Later she said that she had worked in a serpent farm as an apprentice so she had known the properties of venom.
There remained only a few days of her sojourn with us. Our Hima was crying left and right. Our culinary expert was full of tears. Her wetted eyes were swiped by Cassidy several times a day. Her language teacher Navoda left no stone unturned to hide her tears. Amalka lamented a lot. I kept my spirits as I had to take her to the airport.
We arranged a sumptuous dinner for her the previous night. Mama, mata puluvanda pelyak indaana mamage lassana watte oyalata mava matakwenna Her spoken Sinhala was perfect. Her feelings were great. Her child minding was extraordinary because of her dedication and gentle hands. I could bear no more. I burst into tears.
Mama, nenda, mage Nan Gila denna ha mama masa thunak balagaththa Hima podi putha, ada mata Hari dukai, mata hari satutui, mama kohamada oyal dala yanne Mata ugannapu devalta, mate kanna dipu devalta, oyale lassana ratata mama godak istuthi karanawa. She burst into tears. Tears were pouring down her white cheeks. My wife was uncontrollable and she tightly wrapped her in her hands and started weeping on the eve of Cassys leaving. In no time all of us wrapped together making a huge heap of humanity.
On the way to the airport, we were in great feelings, yet in less talk. All of us breathed her warmth again and we were seeing her departure through the glass walls till she became a tiny dot among the teeming crowds. We stopped our car in the vicinity of the airport and watched her plane in flight carrying away our American au pair.

SL stands by Myanmar in Rohingya crisis - Minister
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday stressed that the Sri Lankan Government stands by the Myanmar Governments position with regard to the Rohingya crisis.
The minister defended the recent statement of Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi on the Rohingya people.
Sri Lanka has strong bilateral relations with Myanmar. As a Theravadi Buddhist country, Sri Lanka has historical ties with Myanmar.
We can relate Myanmars situation to what we experienced during the war time. I can recall the false charges and misinterpretation of facts Sri Lanka faced during those times.Suu Kyi has faced a similar situation now.However, she has assured that no Rohingya person is looked down upon and that the Government would investigate if anybody has subjected to persecution, the minister noted.
Commenting on President Maithripala Sirisena being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, the minister said it was a great achievement that the whole country could be proud of. It was for the first time in history that a leader of our country was shortlisted for it. It reflects the international recognition he enjoys, he stated.

Some docs lost respect due to wild cat strikes: Rajitha
A certain section of doctors have lost public respect due to wild cat strikes launched by them which greatly inconvenienced the people, Health, Indigenous Medicine and Nutrition Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing a felicitation ceremony jointly organized by the Rajitha Senaratne Foundation and the Beruwala Yahapalana Sansadaya (Forum) at the Aluthgama Pradesheeya Sabha playground to mark International Elders Day on October 2.
Dr. Senaratne said the elder population in the country would increase rapidly in the future and more funds had to be allocated for the health service to cater to their health needs.
He said new medical facilities would be set up at the Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa Universities shortly while the Medical Faculty at the Ruhuna University would further expand.
Although there were allegations that the government planned to privatize education over the SAITM issue, the government would never privatize education, he said.
Today there is an ideology which tries to prohibit education to people with financial means. A child of a brick-making labourer is also studying at the SAITM today under a scholarship, he added.
The JVP and the Frontline Socialist Party were also trying to obstruct the SAITM. Although even some members of the government feared to delve on the SAITM issue, he was not scared to express his views on it, the minister said.

Sri Lanka hosts inaugural IATO Outbound Convention
The Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) is holding its inaugural Outbound Convention from October 2 to 4 in Sri Lanka. This is also the first time the association is having a convention outside of India.
This is the third major travel convention hosted by Sri Lanka in less than a year having hosted the French Travel Agents Convention in Colombo last November and the PATA Annual Convention in May this year.
The theme for this years IATO Outbound Convention is 'Regional Tourism - Beyond Boundaries'.
The Convention was ceremonially inaugurated by Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga and Minister of Special Assignments Sarath Amunugama at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo.
Over 160 high profile delegates representing Indias travel and tourism sectors are participating in the three day convention. IATO President Pranab Sarkar in his address appreciated the lengths to which the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau, the official host and the national carrier SriLankan had gone to in order to make the event a reality.
Speaking at the event Sri Lanka Convention Bureau Chairman Prema Cooray said that it was an honour for Sri Lanka to host the inaugural IATO Outbound Convention. Indias outbound tourism sector is growing at a rapid 20% and is expected to reach 50 million travellers by 2020. Sri Lanka will welcome 400,000 Indian tourists this year and our target is to aim for 1 million Indian tourists by 2020, he said. The MICE sector will be very important in this regard.
IATO President Pranab Sarkar noted, The cream of Indias travel trade is here in Colombo. Sri Lanka is now an exciting destination for the Indian traveller. Contrary to various perceptions Indians are the biggest spenders on shopping in both Singapore and London. They are on the lookout for new destinations and considering the excellent connectivity with over 150 flights a week and short distance, Sri Lanka is becoming the first choice, he said.
Keynote speaker Minister Sarath Amunugama recalled the close relationship Sri Lanka has shared with India over many centuries. Rekindled interest in the Ramayana Trail is a positive sign in attracting Indian tourists. With Indias outbound market growing at a pace only second to China, Sri Lanka is well placed to benefit from this boom, said Minister Amunugama who also emphasised that Sri Lanka is one of the safest destinations for tourists.
Tourism Minister John Amaratunga noted that Sri Lanka offered everything the Indian tourist could desire within a very short travel period. Colombo will soon be an entertainment hub with all the top hotel brands coming in to the country. Be it gaming and entertainment, shopping, adventure, wellness, sports or cultural tourism Sri Lanka has it all, he said. Minister Amaratunga called upon the delegates to explore the country and convey the good news to the Indian market.
IATO Executive Committee
Leading travel and tourism industry personalities from both India and Sri Lanka will participate as panellists at the IATO Convention which will be followed by B2B sessions with the local travel trade. IATO is the national apex body of tour operators with a membership of over 1,600 across India. IATOs membership consists of the nations inbound tour operators, travel agents, hotel chains, airlines and other stake holders in the tourism and hospitality industries.
IATOs annual convention is considered the most important event in the Indian travel calendar and attracts between 1,200  1,400 delegates each year. It also attracts strong participation from all the states as well as numerous dignitaries from the political and administrative arms of the central and state governments.

Stamped out!
The total number of classical dances was officially regarded as seven. But today the total number of Indian classical classes is officially recognized as eight. Presently the Indian classical dances are regarded as Bharata Natyam, Kathak, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Manipuri, Mohiniyattam and Sattriya of Assam. Sattriya of Assam is the recent inclusion of the list of Indian Classical dances.
In October 1975, the Government of India officially published six different classical dance images in six different postal stamps. The overall dimension of the stamps is printed in 3.91 X 2.90 cm. The printed dimension area of the stamps is in 3.56 X 2.54 cm.
Important role
Anything printed on the national stamp is regarded as a great national honour and state recognition. In earlier days stamps played an important role rather than today. Today electronic mail or email is quite popular in the fast-moving world. Among the present generation the email, the Facebook and WhatsApp are the common, confidential, quickest and the fastest communication modes. These modern communication modes are quicker and faster than the postal communication system. Still, the postal communication system is very much needed. And this postal communication the system is a concrete mode of transaction method for the hard copy documents. The stamps are not only used for posting letters but also they are utilized for numerous other purposes including for legal documentary purposes.
Hence getting a place in the postal stamp is regarded a prestige at national and international level. Through the stamps, a countrys culture, numerous historical factors and national heritage factors are invariably exposed to the world. The Indian stamps bearing six different dance images were released on the 20th October 1975 to commemorate the Indian classical dances. The six different important classical dances that appeared on the Indian stamps are Bharatha Natyam, Kathak, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Manipuri and Odissi.
Bharatha Natyam evolved out of temple dance known as Sathir. Bharatha Natyam is the classical dance form of Tamils. And it is regarded as the Tamil Nadu state dance. It has its own grace, charm, and standing in the international sphere. The value of the Indian stamp which contains the Bharatha Natyam image is 25 Paise.
Moghul cultures
Kathak is another Indian classical dance form. And it regards as North Indian classical dance form. It has been influenced by Hindu and Moghul cultures. It reached the peak of its achievement during the 16th and 17th centuries. The value of the stamp which contains the Kathak dance image is 75 Paise.
Among the Indian classical dance forms, Kathakali is another dance form. The South Indian dance form Kathakali is a dance form of Kerala. The ordinary people called Kathakali as Atta kathai, because it is based on stories. It is a story-oriented dance. Even female roles are played by the male dancers and still, males play a major role in this classical dance form. Originally, it was danced by the males alone. These dances had their close links with temple traditions. Chakaiyar were the male dancers. Still, the males are the dancers of Kathakali.
Mythology and devotion
Kathakali is also one of the temple arts based on stories. Kathakali and Bharatha Natyam are deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and devotion. Kathakali originated from Krishna Attam. The value of the Kathakali dance image stamp is one Rupee.
Kuchipudi is also another classical dance form of South India. It belongs to the classical dance of Telugu Desha, based on drama. Present day Andhra Pradesh was earlier called Telugu Desha. The northern border of Tamil Nadu is Andhra Pradesh, which its own classical dance form has called Kuchipudi. Kuchipudi originated in the village Kuchipudi in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, near the Bay of Bengal. And later this dance form acquired the name of the village Kuchipudi where it originated. The value of the stamp which contains the Kuchipudi dance image is Rs 1.50 Paise.
Odissi is an important classical dance form of the East Indian state, Orissa. The Odissi originated from Kalinga Desha of India, presently known as Orissa. Earlier Odissi dancers were males. They were called Kothipuwar. The male dancers dressed themselves as females and danced. It is essentially a temple dance. The Odissi female dancers were known as Maharies. The value of the Odissi stamp is 50 Paise.
Manipuri dance originated from the East Indian state of Manipur. The word Manipuri is also often used for Manipuri saris. The excellent Manipuri saris are also manufactured in the Manipur state of India. In Manipuri dance, the Rasa Lila, dances are deeply linked to devotional worship and they were earlier danced in temples. The dances were performed at the Nat Mandapas in temples. The value of the stamp, which contains the Manipuri dance image is two rupee.
Aesthetic essence
Hence different Indian classical dances originated in six different states of India with excellent aesthetic essence. All dances are well displayed on Indian stamps.
Besides these classical dance stamps another stamp of Uday Shankar, the father of Indian fusion dances, was published by the Government of India, on September 26, 1978, to commemorate the first death anniversary of Uday Shankar. This stamp was printed in a vertical position. The dance pose is depicted with Thandava Nirttya pose of Uday Shankar. The printed area of the stamp is a 3.91cm dimension. The value of the stamp is 25 Paise.
Sri Lanka also released some beautiful stamps on Kandyan dance on different values in different years.

Painting allows children to express their creativity and at the same time have fun. Developing a skill like painting provides the stimulus children need to be successful in all aspects of life. Overall, the painting will nurture their small souls.
State Childrens Arts Festival and Exhibition 2017 held on October 1 saw 115 budding artists being awarded certificates, cash prizes and medals. The event which was concurrently held with Universal Childrens Day was organised jointly by the Department of Cultural Affairs and the State Advisory Board for Visual Arts under the instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs.
Art competitions for the festival were held under the categories of Primary (5-6 years), Post Primary (7-9 years), Junior (10-12 years), Senior (13-15 years) and Senior Secondary (16-18 years).
Winners were selected out of more than 100,000 drawings received from around the island including Northern and Eastern provinces. Drawings selected for the final round were on exhibition at the occasion. Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister, S. B. Nawinne and Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Deputy Minister, Palitha Thewarapperuma participated at the event.
Drawing is a powerful medium of art. It is a medium of communication that developed at the very beginning when men lived in caves. A drawing by a child no doubt depicts his or her innocence and genuineness. State Childrens Art Festival is an effort to evaluate the paintings of our children and give them the due accolade on State level, Cultural Affairs, Director, Anusha Gokula Fernando said.
State Advisory Board for Visual Arts Chairman, Senior Lecturer, Sarath Gunasiri Perera said childs inborn inquisitiveness makes him respond to the aesthetic beauty using auditory and visual senses. This is a spontaneous action which is later manifested in their various activities including drawing. Childrens drawings originate from their own lives.
They need to be guided and supported in the best way to think creatively. Educationists in other countries encourage children to be involved in art activities to stimulate positive feelings and motivate them to be professionals in future. State Childrens Art Festival is held every year with this objective in view, he added.

Treasury Bond issue : Mahendran questioned on alleged Central Bank losses in 2015
The Treasury Bond Commission yesterday questioned former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran on alleged losses incurred by the Central Bank, when he took office as the Governor in 2015.
At the outset, the Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge P.S.Jayawardena said it is important for the Commission to have an understanding of these losses since the Central Bank cannot incur losses of any sort.
I find it extraordinary for a Central Bank to incur losses, Justice Jayawardena said.
At a previous proceeding, it was mentioned that a Central Bank cannot incur losses as it has the option to print money.
Justifying his decision to transfer several officers of the Central Bank to different departments, Mahendran said, the Central Bank was at a mess when he took office.
He pointed out that there were crisis regarding 15 finance companies with relation to the Central Bank, including the Golden Key issue.
He also pointed out that there was a shortage in coins in the country at the time as well.
According to former Governor Mahendran, the Central Bank had made some imprudent investments in managing foreign reserves which eventually resulted in losses.
Of course there was the Greek Bond issue. But, the bigger issue was Gold. I couldnt get to the bottom of this. But allegedly, there had been huge window dressing exercises where the CBSL hadsold from its Gold Reserves in the end of December and repurchased it in January at a much higher price, so that they could show profit for the preceding year, Mahendran said.
The cost of gold that the CBSL held was 1600 dollars an ounce. However, the market price had fallen to 1100 dollars an ounce. We were already sitting on a 500 dollar loss on each ounce. That was a big loss to the Central Bank. The gold prices started to fall somewhere at the end of 2013. Through that period, we had recorded massive losses in the foreign exchange devaluation account. Mahendran explained.
Then the second loss is that the Central Bank took a big position on Australian dollar, Mahendran further explained. The Australian dollar then collapsed all the way to seventy five US cents causing much looses to the Central Bank, he said.
The third one was the biggest issue. In 2013, three Sri Lanka banks, the NSB, DFCC and BOC went to the international market and issued dollar bonds to the extent of 1.35 billion dollars.In the budget of that year, the President at that time, made a statement that the CBSL would guarantee the foreign exchange losses at that time to these banks who issued these dollar bonds in case the rupee depreciated during the period of those bonds. The CBSL gave a zero cost option to buy back the foreign exchange to repay the bonds at the cost of the Central Bank. Mahendran further said.
According to Mahendran, these three major reasons including others caused the Central Bank to incur losses in the years 2012 and 2013.
Mahendran then explained that it was his decision to place qualified people in the departments who were able to handle these issues. To remedy the issues earlier pointed out, Mahendran said he as the Governor at that time, took decisions to sold the Australian dollars.
He pointed out that Sri Lanka is still stuck with the said gold. However, by 2016 we gained Rs.22 billion profit, Mahendran pointed out.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera extensively questioned Mahendran on 14 transfers he had done when he was the Governor. De Livera asked Mahendran if he remembered several CBSL officers including Trade Union representatives, came to the Bank House (the official residence of a CBSL Governor) to express their distaste regarding some transfers.
Mahendran in reply said he would like to know when these meetings were held. De Lievra said the participants of the meetings do not remember the exact dates when they discussed with Mahendran. Mahendran said according to his recollection, these discussions were held at a later stage regarding several other matters.
De Livera went on to say that Mahendran was not telling the truth and it is very easy to say when he is lying. Mahendrans Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva pointed out to the Commission that it was a cheap question.
De Livera questioned on several transfers done by Mahendran including former Superintendent of Public Debt Deepa Seneviratne, CBSL officer Saman Kumara, former SPD of the PDD Dhammika Nanayakkara, Dr.Z.Azim, then DG P.Samarasiri Naveen Anuradha and few other persons.
SASG De Livera suggested that Mahendran purposefully transferred these persons to different departments in order to support his son-in-law in the February 27,2015 auction.
SASG De Livera, speaking on former SPD Deepa Seneviratne asked Mahendran whether he wanted to place a green horn in the Public Debt. Department.
Mahendran refuted the suggestion that former SPD Seneviratne was inexperienced and added, that Seneviratne was managing the EPF which holds the largest bond portfolio of the country when she was the EPF head prior to the transfer.
SASG De Lievra then asked if Mahendran wanted to weaken the Public Debt Department by assigning its work to Seneviratne to which Mahendran replied that She had tremendous experience in the Bond market, and would be tarnishing her image if one call her inexperienced.
SASG de Livera suggested that most of the transferred persons lacked expertise in the new areas they were assigned ito and Mahendran vehemently refuted the allegation that the said Central Bankers were inexperienced persons.
He also expressed his dissatisfaction on De Livera repeatedly suggesting that the said officers were inexperienced and observed that it was a travesty and a shame.
At this juncture, Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva rose to comment that According to this line of questioning, it seems that 50% of the Central Bank higher officials are incompetent!
De Livera then asked Mahendran as to why, if he valued the services of experienced officers, did he transferred former SPD Dhammika Nanayakkara. Well Mr. Nanayakkara was a good officer. A good Central Banker. But, it was apparent that he spent very long time periods abroad. And then he was running some media campaigns for the previous government. These campaigns were Central Bank funded. Then, he argued much against the public auction system. So I thought such a person is not suitable for the job. Mahendran explained.
Mahendran also said he was not involved in transferring Saman Kumara to EPF or Naveen Anuradha to the NSB. Evidence was led before the Commission suggesting above mentioned persons gave inside information to Arjun Aloysius, who was the owner of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited. Mahendran said the Human Resources Department transferred Saman Kumara to the EPF where as Naveen Anuradha was sent to the NSB as recommended by Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe.
The Commission will today examine Chairmen of Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank and the General Manager of the Peoples Bank. Mahendran will again testify on Friday.

We will ensure return of Northern lands to rightful owners: Basil
Responding to a question on land and missing persons, former Minister Basil Rajapaksa said a government run by his party would ensure that all private lands in the North would be returned to their rightful owners. Those who dont have land have to be given land by the government, he added addressing reporters in Jaffna to launch the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the new party formed by Rajapaksa loyalists. He further explained that during the previous regime, after his brother former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took over office on November 17,2005, the government did not take over any private land in the North.
The ones that had been taken over were that which was done previously by the IPKF and Army,he said.
We released 80 percent of the land during our regime, stressed Rajapaksa.
Rajapaksa also chose not to answer the question of the missing and instead stuck with the rhetoric that; land and housing were a common problem all over the country but in the North, it is a problem that needed to be resolved.

Hundreds of Army soldiers-turned flag-bearers, attired in formal glittering dresses, representative of the entire organisation, lined up inside the Welimaluwa (lower layer) precincts this morning (2) before all Army flags were taken to the Udamaluwa (upper layer) for symbolic invocation of blessings.

As has been the practice, all the Army Flags, representing the Army Headquarters, the Volunteer Force Headquarters, Security Force Headquarters, Forward Maintenance Areas, Divisions, Brigades, Regiments, Units and Army Training Schools, were blessed after they were taken in the colourful procession around the Weli Maluwa (lower layer) thrice. The flags were then accepted by Senior Officers, waiting at the Meda Maluwa (middle layer). The Commander respectfully laid the flags around the sacred tree later on.
A special cash donation of Rs one million for development of the sacred place was offered by the Army Commander to Ven. Pallegama Siriniwasabhidhana Nayake Thera, the Atamasthanadhipathi and the Incumbent of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya, after the main ceremony.
The days religious ceremony began after the arrival of the Chief Guest, Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake in the sacred premises. He first paid his obeisance to Ven. Pallegama Siriniwasabhidhana Nayake Thera, the Atamasthanadhipathi in his Awasageya (residential monastery) and offered a traditional Pirikara and a tray of fruits inviting him formally to perform anniversary blessings, together with other members of the Maha Sangha.

SLFP wont support abolishing Executive Presidency
Ishara Mudugamuwa
Science Technology and Research State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne yesterday said the SLFP would not support the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
The State Minister made this observation at a media conference held at the Industrial Technology Institute.
Explaining his partys stand on the much-debated Executive Presidency, the State Minister said the SLFP would not support the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
The Central Committee of the SLFP has unanimously taken a decision not to support any move to abolish the Executive Presidency. So no member of the SLFP can go beyond the decision of the partys Central Committee, he said.
Although President Maithripala Sirisena promised to abolish the Executive Presidency during his election campaign, the abolition of the Executive Presidency will affect the unity of the country, State Minister Seneviratne stressed.
He added that the public should not panic over the place given to Buddhism by the Constitution and under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, the foremost place given to Buddhism will not change.

'Blade Runner' influenced 35 years of fashion. Can its sequel do the same

Renee April knows she's playing with fire talking to the press. Over the course of our phone interview the costume designer wrapped her answers in riddles and apologized profusely. "They'll kill me," the French-Canadian added at one point, laughing.

She was referring to the producers behind "Blade Runner 2049," 2017's hotly anticipated sequel to Ridley's Scott's sci-fi masterpiece. April, like everyone else involved, is walking a tightrope of nondisclosure agreements. One slip could compromise this unlikely second chapter 35 years in the making.

Pressure abounds. "Blade Runner" is lauded as one of the most accomplished works of science fiction of all time. It achieved cult status through the years thanks in part to Scott's continued edits, forcing audiences to reevaluate what was once a critical headache -- "muddled," "will turn off many" -- but now a film considered poetic, existential and profound. Three decades after release it stands monolithic, casting a long, intimidating shadow. Who would dare try to succeed it

Not April. At least, not at first. When she was approached by director and long-term collaborator Denis Villeneuve, she didn't want the gig: "I said 'Oh my God, I'm going to fail. It's too much, I can't.'"

She relented, however, and as its release approaches, she's glad she took the plunge.

Among audiences, April knows there's a certain coterie she needs to satisfy: fashion designers. A week prior to our chat, a friend had showed her pictures of Raf Simons' "Blade Runner"-esqueSpring-Summer 2018 collection, staged under the lamps of New York's Chinatown, with models walking under umbrellas in deconstructed macs.

Simons is just the latest designer to draw inspiration from the film.

"'Blade Runner' is one of the sci-fi films that influenced me the most,"Jean Paul Gaultiertold CNN, one high-profile example and a man not averse todressing sci-fi movies himself.

Fashion was integral to the fabric of Scott's Los Angeles, circa 2019. Unlike the homogenous look of sci-fi forebears like "THX 1138" or "Logan's Run," "Blade Runner's" costume design was rich, varied and uncannily familiar.

Much of its aesthetic was sourced from the past. Costume designers Charles Knode and Michael Kaplan read into the noir elements of detective narrative and saw Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and Orson Welles in the beleaguered android assassin Rick Deckard. Costumes for Rachael, the femme fatale played by Sean Young, drew explicitly from that era:Kaplan has citedAdrian (costume designer for Joan Crawford, among others) as the inspiration behind her '30s and '40s-cut skirt suits.


Deckard's rogue androids, called "replicants," channeled punk in leather, studs and dog collars, affecting the look of a disenfranchised underclass. East Asian looks were prominent among the huddled masses; layered, asymmetrical designs reminiscent of Issey Miyake's '80s output littered the city.

A seven-year-old Jeremy Scott was transfixed. The American creative director of Moschino and his own namesake label recalls watching alongside his older brother in a small-town cinema in the summer of 1982: "I was never the same after that."

"I was mesmerized by the mix of what was then futuristic with what was already retro," wrote Scott in an email. "That is what makes 'Blade Runner' the gold standard (among) sci-fi dystopian worlds, as it's believable. Because we do not live in a world where everything is from today ... We live in a chaotic world of various decades of architecture, automotive design and fashion, combining and colliding all (in) that same moment."

Months after its release, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren debuted "Punkature," a collection featuring a skirt printed with a smiling geisha -- the same face seen on a billboardseveral stories high in the film.

After this initial homage, fashion's response has largely been self-reflexive towards Kaplan and Knode's work. Take for example Rachael's tailoring: the costume designers exaggerated existing silhouettes, and in a feedback loop, fashion houses amplified Kaplan and Knode's "whacked-out take" in turn.

Alexander McQueen's angular, tailored Autumn-Winter 1998 ready-to-wear collection for Givenchy remains a paragon. In the same collection he worked in apared-down tributeto Rachael's ostensible fur coat, and a year earlier created headdresses halfway betweenbearskinand backcombed bob, reminiscent of Pris the replicant's hair.

(Almost two decades later, Gareth Pugh's skirt suits for his Autumn-Winter 2016 collection traced a line back through McQueen's work at Givenchy to the film that inspired him.)

Pris, played by Daryl Hannah, caught Jeremy Scott's eye too. For "Rampage," his second collection in the late '90s, Scott "wanted to create a wardrobe that appeared to be constructed from trash bags, fish and net" -- perhaps a call-back tothis scene. "I wanted the feeling of the collection to convey (her) emotion and aggression," he added.

Similarly, Jean Paul Gaultier remembered Hannah's character "as a new superwoman, sexy and (an) atomic bomb," and he appropriated her "amazing" raccoon eye makeup for his Autumn-Winter 2009 Haute Couture collection.

Since a "Blade Runner" sequel was first mooted in 2011, its predecessor has received increased sartorial attention from the fashion industry. Standing at a crucial juncture in such an influential story, perhaps April was right to be nervous. So what can we expect from her, and from Los Angeles, circa 2049

"Denis (Villeneuve) was thinking and thinking at the beginning, and finally he came out and said 'It's the same world, except it's more brutal. It's really brutal,'" April remembered of their initial discussions.

"The world -- this world -- did not evolve very much, because they're dying. It's bad over there. If you're still on Earth it's because it's not going very well for you ... The ones that stayed behind, it's because they're not healthy enough or they're not rich enough," she added.

"The Earth is dying, basically, and they're in survival mode."

Villeneuve and co. have mined Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep", the source material for "Blade Runner." Set in an irradiated San Francisco in 1992, after a catastrophic global war, the book has more apocalyptic overtones than its film adaptation. Radioactive dust is claiming both bodies and minds. Mental aptitude and financial resources are required to buy a ticket off Earth. Many lack one or both.

Conscious of this, April set to work imagining fashion 32 years from now.

"I had to restrain myself," she said, but there were still opportunities to show some flare. "We're using a lot of fake fur and plastic and lights... (and) a lot of breathing masks, because it's so polluted."

The fur is explicitly fake, she added, because the real deal "hasn't existed for many years" -- another nod to Dick's novel, in which animal life is scarce. And the shearling jacket worn by Ryan Gosling's Officer K; the oneEsquire called"badass" and "the real star" of the film's trailer It's fake too. "Actually it's not shearling," April says. "It's not leather, it's cotton," waterproofed and painted.
Avid fans will be looking for clues in April's work. Deckard, for one, appears dressed down in a gray t-shirt and cargo pants. April confirms the character has ditched his clashing striped shirt and plaid tie combo.

"It scared me to do that," she says, "but at the end of the day, he didn't change and he's timeless ... we really wanted something timeless." Those still arguing whether Deckard is human or replicant, read into that what you will.

One character who might know is nefarious replicant designer Niander Wallace, played by a Jared Leto. Wallace's monochrome kosode (similar to a kimono) was inspired by production designer Dennis Gassner's "so zen, so pure" sets, April said.

"I wanted something you almost don't notice. I wouldn't say that I was going to dress him like Steve Jobs, (but he probably) wears a new one every day ... like a uniform."

Leto loved the costume, said April -- so much so that the Oscar-winner took it home.

Further details are scant, and the costume designer is unable to divulge as much as she would like. Only on Oct. 6 will April's full efforts be revealed. One hopes "2049" will leave behind more loose threads for designers to spin into the fabric of their work. Inspiration can be an ephemeral thing, after all:like tears in the rain.

Carter 'feels sick' over drink drive error
Wellington: All Blacks legend Dan Carter said Tuesday he still "feels sick" about drink driving in France earlier this year and is grateful no one was hurt by his actions.
Carter was banned from driving for five months after police caught him intoxicated behind the wheel in Paris last February.
The two-time World Cup winner, who is now playing for Racing 92 in France's Top 14, said he had let a lot of people down.
"It's not about the punishment that the judge gives you or the fine or anything like that, it's actually the potential consequences that really hit home for you," he told New Zealand's Radio Sport in a phone interview. AFP
"It actually made me feel sick and it makes me feel sick now, thinking and talking about it.
"Much as I'd love to say I've moved on from it, it's something I'm going to have to live with for the rest of my life."
Carter, who played 112 Tests for New Zealand, lost a sponsorship with Land Rover over the incident, which dented his image as one of rugby's most marketable players.

Charge of the katakatha brigade
Ratnayake Wasala Mudiyanselage Abeyratne Ratnayaka, more popularly known as A Ratnayake was the first Cabinet Minister of Food, Co-operatives and Home Affairs in independent Sri Lanka and the last President of the now defunct second chamber called The Senate. He was also a Member of State Council and Parliament. RAT to his colleagues, A Ratnayake, received his education at Dharmaraja College, Kandy and at Royal College, Colombo. The former Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo, Professor Kshanika Hirimburegama was his granddaughter.
A Ratnayake had been very critical of D S Senanayake and his policies during the years they spent in the State Council and later in Parliament. On occasion too he had supported Dr N M Perera and Philip Gunawardene, the two Marxists, elected by the people of Ruwanwella and Awissawella to both legislates, and his chances of becoming a Minister he thought were remote.
Will you pay me the compliment of agreeing to serve as Minister of Food and Cooperatives (The Prime Minister offering a Cabinet portfolio to an ordinary MP)
However, to his great surprise, one night when Ratnayake lifted his telephone receiver and heard DSs voice asking,
I say, Rat, how would you like to join my Cabinet
Ratnayake was speechless for a few seconds, in Sinhalese he told DS,
Sir, ara ibba waturata danawa wage ne  (you remind me of a man praying to a tortoise to enter the water.)
Soulbury Constitution
A loud guffaw deafened Abeyratne Ratnayake. He asked D S Senanayake what portfolio he had in mind for him, and told him that he would prefer the education portfolio since he had served on committee of the State Council for education for so long and had acted as Minister of Education too. Then DS said:
No Rat, I want you to take on the subjects which I was dealing with at State Council, will you pay me the compliment of agreeing to serve as Minister of Food and Cooperatives Undertakings; the other half I want my son to takeover and Dudley have agreed to handle the Agriculture, you are the only man I can trust to carry out the plans which I have initiatedeven though you have been one of my worst critics.
Immediately after the first Parliamentary election was held under the Soulbury Constitution seventy years ago in 1947, DS turned to Sir John and said: I say Lionel, look around and see if we have a majority, if not try to get some chaps to join the government. The Eastern Province members are the best bet. They always come to parliament with absolutely open minds.
Senator Ranayake, talking about the first Parliament once said, after 16 years of giving the government hell, I found myself at the receiving end; and what a fearsome opposition there was. Among them, of course NM and Philip and Dr Dahanayake. Taming that opposition was like trying to humanize hell. Dahanayake was the sternest critic of Ratnayakes policies. But he was not the only one who felt the sting of sharp tongue, he attacked J R Jayewardenes policies and using parodies to drive home a pointonce during debate on Budget proposals in the house he said,
Twinkle, twinkle, JRJ., How I wonder what you say;
Workers starve and children die, While you twinkle in the sky
Why Daha lost his popularity
Wijayananda Dahanayake before he became Prime Minister, was a simple unassuming politician, who always rejected personal security. Daha, with his disarmingly simple gestures and modest ways, he had, in his rather extended political life, acquired a name for honesty, outspokenness, unpredictability and for being on the side of the poor. He was, at first glance, looked the common man himself dressed in the white national  not always spotless, cut like Bandaranaikes. The non-smoker and teetotaler, Dahanayake, the Thomian and English literati, spoke easily in colloquial Sinhalese with a choice of words which was spoken in Galle his home town.
In early 1960, during a family excursion to Kataragama, the writer witnessed how the police prevented the pilgrims from bathing in Menik Ganga, a compulsory ritual practiced in good old days. While we were waiting on the banks, a cordon of armed security, guarded the Prime Minister Dahanayake who was bathing in the stream. The Kataragama scene unusual and unbelievable scenario became the talk of the town, for Daha was a common mans leader who travelled by train from Galle to Colombo as an MP, from State Council days and while holding the education portfolio in 1956-59 too. He was a politician who never lost the common touch. Being made the Prime Minister, [head-of-state] he lost his simplicity and humility, and adopted a totally different attitude. No politico including Heads of State, before and immediately after Daha ever used security men apart from one single bodyguard, usually a Sub Inspector. After the 62 Coup conspiracy, Sirima Bandaranaike, and Dudley Senanayake, as Prime Ministers were given small contingents may be around two dozen men, which was enhanced following the 1971 JVP insurrection.
Daha, known for his strong personality and for being forthright and fearless, lost his unassuming, simple ways and popularity no sooner he was crowned as head of state, a chance happening rather than a seniority based posting, following the tragic death of former Prime Minister S W R D Bandaranaike, and in the absence of next in command C P de Silva who was in London for treatment.
Speculation and suspicion on his participation in the cold blooded killing of PM, aroused by a rumour, (katakatha brigade) and his rejection to heed to the advice of the party seniors and Cabinet to get rid of two ministers whos names emerged in the course of the investigation, and also the overnight dismissal of ten ministers, (mind you in a Cabinet of sixteen) and the reciprocal act by the SLFP in suspending him from the party, contributing to the above.
Daha, dissolved Parliament, formed a new party named Lanka Prajatantrawadi Party [LPP], and fielded 100 candidates island-wide, against the UNP and SLFP at the 1960 March general election, but was even unseated from his abode in Galle. How power change men

Bus burden
While I was in Colombo for a fortnight on state service (GCE A/L marking and evaluation) I had to travel by bus between Modera and D S Senanayeka College, Borella. Unfortunately, I had to take three buses to reach my destination. The worst part of travelling around Colombo is the peak hours between 7.30 and 9 in the morning, and 4.30 and 7.30 in the evening. The congested traffic jams remains a stumbling block to attend to urgent matters. The Alluthmawatha road leading to Hettitiyawatta had been blocked for days because of some pipeline construction. The commuters had to use Bloemendhal road as an alternative.
Usually, the private bus conductors are hell-bent on gathering passengers despite whatever the difficulties they would face eventually. The buses on the route between Mattakkuliya and Colombo Fort brim with passengers. This applies to most other buses during the rush hour. The passengers  older people, infants and children in particular - are compelled to suffocate without proper ventilation. Some commuters choose the footboards with both driver and conductor ignoring it. They would suddenly urge the passengers inside if they happen to spot traffic police officers.
The Traffic Police, on the other hand, do not strictly enforce law and order even though the public break it in the broad daylight. When a passenger gets down, they are forced to squeeze themselves through the crowds. Although the bus is short of space, the conductor would still force the passengers to go further inside.
The conductors move back and forth, shoving the people inadvertently, to collect the ticket fare. As a remedy, passengers should be allowed to use one entrance to get on and the other is to get off. At the same time, the conductor can get the bus fare easily without troubling and making the situation awkward.
The bus journey, honestly speaking, is inconvenient and molestation to the female commuters. Buses keep on increasing, but there is no smooth, stress-free happy journey on a metropolitan city like Colombo. Sadly, this is the travelling routine in Colombo.
The transport authority should not only be keen on generating money but should be concerned about the comfort and health of the people as well.

Confidence instilled by new selectors a key to success - Gurusinha
ABU DHABI: Cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha said that the confidence instilled on the players by the new selection panel headed by former Sri Lanka speedster Graeme Labrooy has brought about an unbelievable improvement in some of the players and contributed immensely towards Sri Lanka pulling off a stunning 21-run win over Pakistan in the first Test played at Abu Dhabi on Monday.
It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where it started to go right but the pre-tour five-day program which we put together got on very well and got the team together. It was the confidence that everyone was giving the team, said Gurusinha who was a member of the previous selection committee as well as the present one.
The first thing we wanted was to have a stable environment so that players are not going to the middle and thinking will I play tomorrow. Thats the worst thing to do. Our main goal was to give that confidence to the players and talk to them individually. All the selectors spoke to most of the players individually and told them how important they are to this side. If there are any areas to improve we addressed those with the players, he said.
Ive seen unbelievable improvement in some of the players not on the playing side because we knew their talent but its the whole focus of what they do and confidence. Some of the players actually came upto me and said I need to thank the guys who helped me here.
Comparing the two selection committees Gurusinha said, I was actually part of the early selection committee for three months but when there is a change, players also have a different focus on things and thats what the new selectors have done talking to the players and giving them confidence. The earlier selectors did a lot of hard work but when you lose, at the end of the day you are responsible, you cant run away from it. Its changing and the players are binding a lot together here and most probably one of the other major aspects is playing away from Sri Lanka. The pressure was so much in Colombo they are enjoying more privacy here and thats helping them as well.
They dont work as seniors and juniors they work as one team. The senior players are actually disciplining the juniors and thats the best way to build a good culture in a sporting team. Chandi (Chandimal) and the senior players have taken ownership on that and even at training you see it is the senior players who are running around a lot and the new guys also have to do it. Kaushal Silva coming into the side on the first day when we had a very tough session he did 3 to 4 laps on his own. Nobody told him to do. Thats the kind of leadership these guys are bringing into the team, Gurusinha said.
TOUGHEST PERIOD
The win over Pakistan was a long awaited one considering the criticism and pressure the team had to undergo in the past six months that the countrys cricketing stocks come plummeting down with a maiden Test loss to Bangladesh, a maiden ODI series loss to Zimbabwe and a total whitewash across all three formats against India.
Most probably it was the toughest in a cricket environment that I have gone through, described Gurusinha those six months.
I realised that I need to get through this first and we were beaten by a good side yes, and there were other issues in selections but we had a lot of faith in this young team and thats the reason that we kept going. It is all history now what happened but I wouldnt say that I am relieved.
I am very happy for the team because at the end of the day we can be here today and gone tomorrow but the players are the ones who suffered in that Indian series. I am really happy for those guys because they suffered a lot, he said.
The win actually was achieved in the absence of Angelo Mathews, the former captain and the most experienced batsman in the side who failed to make the tour for the first Test with a calf strain and most unlikely to be out of the second Test that is starting at Dubai on Friday.
Angelo has been a great cricketer for Sri Lanka he is injured and we cant go back and think about where he is. We had a lot of confidence with this team and we picked the best side, said Gurusinha. Playing Dickwella at six and Dilruwan coming in at seven we knew the team was well balanced on this track. A lot of people questioned when we played the fifth bowler with Dilruwan and it paid off at the end because we realised this wicket was going to be tough. We missed Angelo but the other guys stepped up very well.
For the first 11 of the 15 sessions of the Test it seemed the game was doomed for a draw as both sides played cautious cricket until things started to happen in the final session of the fourth day where four Sri Lanka wickets fell and was followed by a further 16 wickets on the fifth and final day.
I feel yesterday (fourth day) the last one and a half hour we played negative cricket and we got Pakistan into the game. I feel Pakistan played negative cricket today (fifth day). They were just trying to hang around and this is not a track when the loose ball is there youve got to go for it and rotate the strike, said Gurusinha.
We went into a big shell yesterday and we lost four wickets. If you look at those wickets it was not taken by the bowlers we gave some of them. Both sides went into a negative mind set and thought more about the wicket rather than playing the ball. It is a very tough wicket to play and Yasir Shah turned a lot because he is a wrist spinner and he can do it. But our guys also showed how tough it is if you bowl straight, there is a lot of chance of getting wickets.
PRAISE FOR TOP PERFORMERS
Gurusinha said that Lakshan Sandakan who is also a wrist spinner were two different bowlers. The speed of the wrist is the reason that Yasir got so much turn and bounce whereas Sandakan is a bit slower through the air but still a wicket taking bowler. The score wasnt enough for us to take a risk with him but luckily Rangana and Dilruwan did it. Otherwise we had the option of going to Sandakan and seeing what he can do.
On veteran spinner Rangana Heraths outstanding bowling performance where he took a match bag of eleven wickets and became the first left-arm spinner to cross the 400-wicket barrier in Test cricket, Gurusinha said, He is a legend. He came in for about 10 minutes and i actually went up to him and said, I dont care what you do, I want you to get out there and play the whole day. He replied, Dont worry I will be there till the last ball. I knew he will give everything hes got and that kind of character is very rare in a lot of teams these days. Sri Lanka is very lucky to have him. He might give us another year but we will play it by ear with him.
There were also two other significant performances that contributed towards the Lanka victory. Skipper Dinesh Chandimals first innings marathon effort of 155 not out and wicket-keeper/batsman Niroshan Dickwellas two matured knocks of 83 and 40 not out that gave Sri Lanka a second innings total barely enough to bowl Pakistan out.
Chandis was a real Test innings and captains innings. Its not just occupying the crease but the way he batted and the way he built partnerships with a couple of players to get us the score. He led from the front and that is leadership we are looking at and Chandi is giving us tenfold, said Gurusinha.
We had a nice long chat with Dickwella in Colombo and he is one person we said is how important is to this team. He threw his wicket away against India so many times but still scored a lot of runs. Our main thing was to tell him to start scoring those big runs because he can still do it without those fancy shots.
He changed his mind set with our batting coaches Hashan (Tillakaratne) and with Nic Pothas (head coach) with whom he worked very hard. He eventually came up with his own plan how he would tackle. Thats the attitude hes got now very focussed and, he knows what he wants to achieve. He knows there is a long future for him. The future is in his hands and he is showing more maturity, he said.

DFCC Bank felicitates inaugural batch from the Samata English programme
Pursuing its commitment to uplifting the standards of education in the country, DFCC Bank counts education as a key pillar in its corporate social responsibility initiatives.
In fact, DFCC Bank has actively supported education over the years through various initiatives. In keeping with this, the Bank conducted an English Education programme, 'Samata English' as a pilot project in the Gampaha and Kalutara areas, targeting youth between the ages of 16-22, earlier this year.
The main objective of the Samata English project was to teach Spoken English and equip youth with the basic English knowledge required to enter into the workforce. DFCC Bank tied up with Winner International, an institution specialising in teaching spoken English to youth for this purpose. Considering the satisfactory outcome of the project, the Bank now plans to extend it to other areas across the country in the near future.
A Graduation ceremony was held recently to recognise the achievers of this programme at the DFCC Bank Auditorium, which was well attended by students, parents, senior management and staff volunteers.
Commenting on the inaugural 'Samata English' programme, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said, DFCC has continually strived to empower the youth of the country, through building skills, capacity and general knowledge. Realising that the gap in spoken English skills were hindering job prospects for youth, we embarked on this educational project under our 'Know and Grow' initiative to impart spoken English skills to youth so as to enhance their employability and to fulfil their professional aspirations.
The Spoken English course was carried out at DFCC's Gampaha and Kalutara branches from April to August 2017, witnessing the participation of approximately 45 youth. The students sat for an initial assessment prior to starting the course and a final assessment upon completion. The impact of the project was evident as 70% students who sat for the final assessment after benefitting from the Spoken English course scored over 60 marks.
DFCC Bank adopts a holistic approach to its CSR activities in line with the Bank's brand values, strengths and processes where the main pillars include Education, Entrepreneurship, Environment and Emergency Relief. The Bank continuously strives to create sustainable value for all stakeholders and provide its valued customers with a comprehensive range of innovative financial solutions.

Even suicide blast can't stop rising Afghan star
Kabul: Such is Rashid Khan's popularity that even a suicide blast at Kabul's main cricket stadium couldn't keep his fans away -- and the teenager is now eyeing the sport's big prizes as his international profile grows.
The 19-year-old leg spinner started playing with a tennis ball in the remote and poor province of Nangarhar, but he has now starred in the Indian Premier League and will soon make his debut in Australia's Big Bash League.
At last month's Shpageeza Cricket League, Afghanistan's Twenty20 domestic tournament, he became the youngest player to take 100 T20 wickets as he helped the Band-e-Amir Dragons to victory.
Khan's success has helped elevate cricket's profile in Afghanistan, where most players were introduced to the sport in refugee camps in Pakistan after fleeing the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation.
Even after a suicide bomber blew himself up within metres of the Kabul stadium, killing three people, Khan's fans continued to flock to watch him play.
They waved the Afghan national flag and chanted songs for Khan, some showing their devotion by painting his name on their bodies.
"I play cricket to bring victories for my country and to make Afghanistan proud on the world stage," Khan told AFP in an interview in Kabul.
This year, Khan became the first Afghan to play in the lucrative IPL, and he will also be the first from his country in the Big Bash League when he turns out for the Adelaide Strikers in December.
Adelaide Strikers coach Jason Gillespie hailed Rashid's signing as a "major coup" when it was announced last month.
"Rashid has set the world alight in T20 cricket with his energy, enthusiasm, and great control for a young guy," Gillespie said.
"He has some great variations, can bowl stump-to-stump and can be very hard to pick."
Khan was born during the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule, when sport was considered a distraction from religious studies.
He learned cricket by studying the techniques of Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar and Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi on television, and then practising outside in the dirt with his brothers using a tennis ball.
Khan, one of 12 children, began his professional career in Afghanistan's domestic league where his deceptive bowling technique soon caught the attention of national selectors. At 17, he made his international debut against Zimbabwe.
Since then Khan has been on a rollercoaster ride, taking 63 wickets in 29 one-day internationals, including the fourth best figures in one-day history -- seven for 18 against the West Indies in June.
He is also the first bowler to take a hat-trick in the T20 Caribbean Premier League, when playing for the Guyana Amazon Warriors.
