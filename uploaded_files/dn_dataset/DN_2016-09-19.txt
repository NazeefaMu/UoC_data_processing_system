Pathums double-ton marks the start of Under 19 Div. 1 tourney
A dominant bowling performance followed by Pathum Nissankas unbeaten 205 steered Isipathana to a last-minute innings victory over Presidents, Rajagiriya in one of the U19 D1 first-round fixtures concluded last Tuesday at Colts ground. Madushika Sandaruwan and Lahiru Dilshan both completed 6-wicket match hauls as Presidents were bowled out for 145 and 173 in their two innings in reply to the enormous 319 for five scored by Isipathana in mere 60 overs in the only innings they batted.
Sri Lanka youth player, Pathum Nissankas unbeaten 205 that he scored off just 188 balls with 29 fours and 4 sixes was his career-best at any level of cricket in his cricketing career. This was Pathums second double ton at U19 level after his 200 for Kalutara Vidyalaya against Debarawewa NS in 2014/15 season.
It actually was a dramatic finish as Presidents needing 175 to make Isipathana bat again fell just two runs short of the target when they lost their last second-innings wicket with the score at 173 despite Hiruna Sigeras stubborn 86 at the top.
President's: 145 in 41.5 overs (Hiruna Sigera 35, Shanaka Bandara 30, Mohomad Rifaz 22, Madushika Sandaruwan 4/30, Neranjan Wanniarachchi 3/33, Lahiru Dilshan 2/30) & 173 in 66 overs (Hiruna Sigera 86, Lahiru Dilshan 4/31, Madushika Sandaruwan 2/57)
Isipathana : 319/5 dec. in 60 overs (Pathum Nissanka 205*, Sanjula Bandara 31*, Heshan Fernando 25, Kalana Perera 22, Thanula Chamod 2/79)
Vimukthis 13-wicket blitz helpsKingswood win on first-innings triumph
Vimukthi Wijesiriwardana completing a match-bag of 13 wickets including two five-fors helped Kingswood gain first-innings advantage over St.Sylvesters in their U19 D1 first-round fixture concluded on Wednesday in a tame draw at Peradeniya Campus ground.
St. Sylvesters : 175 in 76.2 overs (Avindu Herath 30, Kavinda Perera 26, Lasantha De Soysa 24, Vimukthi Wijesiriwardana 7/67, Rangana Rathnayake 2/19) & 149/7 in 42 overs (Avindu Herath 76, Vimukthi Wijesiriwardhana 6/58)
Kingswood : 229/9 in 59.1 overs (Ganidu Kaushalya 74, Yasod Kavinda 70, Lasantha De Zoysa 5/63, Kavinda Perera 2/35)
Bowlers put Trinity on top of St.Servatius
Vimukthi Nedumal and Thisaru Dilshan sharing seven wickets helped Trinity defend a modest first innings total and claim first innings points over St.Servatius College, Matara in their drawn U19 D1 fixture concluded at Trinity ground on Wednesday.
Trinity, thanks to two fifties from Hasitha Boyagoda and Kalana De Zoysa scored 163 for one in their second innings at close of play on the final day after Servatius had made 166 in reply to the Trinitys first innings total of 188. Thilan Prashan scoring a 53 and Shashika Dilshan with four wickets played well for Matara school.
Trinity: 188 in 67.1 overs (Hasintha Jayasuriya 58, Thisaru Dilshan 30, Shevon Fersivel 25, Thilan Prashan 2/27, Shashika Dilshan 4/44) & 163/1 in 39.2 overs (Hasitha Boyagoda 68*, Kalana De Zoysa 57*, Shammuganadan Sanogeeth 33)

Gurukula in first-innings win
Lasindu Arosha and Sachintha Chamith well defending a meagre 188 bowled St.Joseph Vaz out for 167 helping Gurukula claim first-innings points in their U19 D1 match concluded on Thursday at Albert Peiris Ground. Shehara Ranatungas untiring all-round effort with a five-for and a half-century went in vain as Joseph Vazs reply innings disintegrated so pathetically that they could manage only 167 even after Shehara Ranatunga played a lone-hand with a determined 61 with the bat.
Gurukula : 188 in 65.2 overs (Achintha Malshan 34, Malindu Viduranga 29, Udara Ravindu 28, Dumindu Sudaraka 25, Shehara Ranathunga 5/53, Akash Kanishka 3/39) & 153/9 dec. in 54.1 overs (Nuwan Chanaka 22, Udara Ravindu 20, Shehara Ranatunga 3/51, Danushka Rodrigo 2/14)
St. Joseph : 167 in 63.1 overs (Shehara Ranatunga 61, Akash Nanayakkara 37, Lasindu Arosha 2/23, Sachintha Chamith 3/22) & 67/4 in 14 overs (Sachintha Chamath 2/18)
Supun Helps Ananda claim first inningspoints over Mahinda
All-rounder, Supun Waragoda who made the most of a collective batting effort by Ananda batters following his two wickets with the ball became the mainstay in Anandas first-innings win in their U19 D1 match against Mahinda College, Galle concluded on Saturday at Panagoda Army ground. With time permitting, Ananda had an outside chance to complete an outright victory as Mahinda in their second innings were reeling at 133 for seven with a slim lead of 23 runs when match dribbled to a result-less conclusion. KK Kevin who accumulated 87 runs and two wickets in the match played well for Mahinda.
Mahinda : 131 in 66 overs (Kavindu Ediriweera 35, K K Kevin 33*, Asel Sigera 3/16, Dileepa Jayalath 3/21, Supun Waragoda 2/22) & 133/7 in 71 overs (Vinura Hiranjith 42, KK Kevin 52*, Sammu Ashan 4/61)
Ananda : 241/9 dec. in 65.1 overs (Supun Waragoda 51*, Kavindu Gimhana 36, Sahan Suraweera 32, Kavishka Anjula 39, Kamesh Nirmal 27, Prageeth Malintha 3/35, KK Kevin 2/54 )
Prageeshas ton propels Thurstanto an easy 10-wicket win
Prageesha Mendiss match-winning unbeaten century after Nipuna Lakshan and Thushal Madushanka shared 12 wickets steered Thurstan to an easy 10-wicket win over brittle Dharmapala in their U19 D1 match concluded on Saturday at Dharmapala ground.

Nalanda romp home with Under 15 division one Championship
Nalanda College, Colombo won the 2016 under 15 division one Championship when they earned an easy first-innings win over St.Sebastians College, Moratuwa in the finals concluded on Wednesday at Thurstan ground pushing St.Sebastians to the runners-up position. Nalanda on their way to this final beat Royal-Panadura, Holy Cross and S.Thomas whilst St.Sebastians overcame Isipathana, Mahanama and Prince of Wales, in the final round.
Lakshan Kashyapa, Nalandas mainstay with a match-winning 72 won this important fixture for his side after Nalanda bowlers, led by Jayod Kaldeera with three wickets to his credit disintegrated Sebastians innings for a modest 172 in which only Dunith Wellalage (31) and Janishka Perera (21) made sizable scores. After Sebastians chose to bat, Nalanda bowlers were so dominant that Moratuwa school batsmen had to bat-out almost 88 overs to get to their meagre total of 172.
Nalanda chasing 173 to gain first-innings advantage in this two-day game reached the target in 66 overs losing just four wickets in the process. As there was hardly any time left to get to a positive result, Nalanda were eventually declared the winners of both finals and the Championship.
St. Sebastians A : 172 in 87.5 overs (Dunith Wellalage 31, Janishka Perera 21, Jayod Kaldeera 3/25, Thamidu Kamalasooriya 2/30, Raveen De Silva 2/17)
Nalanda A :179/4 in 66 overs (Lakshan Kashyapa 72, Raveen De Silva 27, Jayod Kaldeera 21*, Dunith Wellalage 2/45)

Janishkas ton propels St.Sebastians to the finals
Janishka Pereras entertaining century followed by Shanel Fernandos cracking 82 helped St.Sebastians amass 310 for nine in 90 overs after they won the toss and decided to bat first in their U15 D1 semifinal fixture against their town-mate Prince of Wales. As Prince of Wales in reply managed only 155 with Osanda making the top score of 28 not out following his five-for with the ball, St.Sebastians with first innings advantage were declared winners after the match settled for an amicable draw. Shanel Fernando and Chamod Mendis bowled well for the winners.
St. Sebastians A: 310/9 in 90 overs (Janishka Perera 109, Shanel Fernando 82,Sukitha Prasanna 40, Osanda Sandaruwan 5/58,Kaveen Chthushka 2/32)

Nalanda sneak to a first-innings win over S.Thomas
Nalanda after they gained a marginal 4-run advantage over S.Thomas on the first-innings in their semifinal fixture played at St.Josephs ground on 10th September were able to seal a place in the finals of U15 D1 tournament.
Dineth Wanniarachchi, leading the attack with five wickets restricted Nalanda first innings to a modest 164 after Nalanda were put in by the opposition who won the toss. Lakshan Kashyapa (41) and Moksha Sankalpa (31) batted well for Nalanda, but others crumbled against the bowling of Wanniarachchi. S.Thomas needed just 165 to gain first innings advantage, but their batting failed against the bowling of Thamindu Kamalasuriya who caused the structural damage claiming five wickets for just 44 runs before Thomas innings imploded with four runs short of their target.
Nalanda set a final target of 203 after they batted for the second time making 198 and S.Thomas surrendering meekly lost six wickets for just 31 runs in 9 overs before match dribbled to a lame conclusion with Nalanda being declared the qualifier to the finals as they gained the first innings advantage in the end.
Nalanda College (A) Colombo: 164 in 42.2 overs (Lakshan Kashyapa 41, Moksha Sankalpa 31, Dineth Wanniarachchi 5/39) & 198 in 47.4 overs (Avishka Perera 39, Mokshya Sankalpa 48, Dilmin Rathnayaka 5/73, Krishan Munasinghe 4/28)
S. Thomas College (A) Mt. Lavinia: 160 in 62 overs (Ranuk Gunawardana 34, Kishan Munasinghe 34, Dilmin Rathnayaka 31,Thamindu Kamalasuriya 5/44) & 31/6 in 9 overs ( Jithesh Wasala 4/08)

St.Josephs, Wattala emerge U15 Division two Champions
St.Josephs College, Wattala romped home with the 2016 - U15 D11 Championship after a superb game of cricket with two players making the headlines. Wattala school after scoring a mammoth 401 for seven in just 90 overs in reply to the meagre total of 112 scored by Prince of Wales, who batted first on winning the toss, won the first innings advantage that was sufficient for them to become Champions as an outright win was highly unlikely in this high-scoring two-day final concluded on 12th September in front of a partisan crowd at Wesley ground.
Prince of Wales led by Yohan Kariyawasam opted to bat first after they won the toss, but they were soon in trouble as their batsmen looked decidedly uncomfortable against an attack led by skipper, Isuru Pinto from the front.
Cambrians innings imploded in just under 49 overs for a paltry score of 112 as their batsmen failed to put-together any batting partnership. Other than Savin Appuhami (28) and Akalanka Peiris (22*) no other POW batsman could come out with a sizable score as Isuru Pinto completed a masterly five-for conceding mere 32 runs.
Prince of Wales chances for a first-innings triumph which was the most important achievement in this two-day game immediately faded away after Joseph openers, Isuru Pinto and Pasindu Jayath got off to a dominant start that produced 130 runs for the first wicket before a glorious 228-run stand between Pinto and Kavishka Zenith for the second wicket deprived the Moratuwa school of any hopes of an outright win either.
Isuru Pintos 107 scored off 250 balls with 14 fours that actually paved the way for a bigger total was however over-shadowed by the entertaining 113 Shashika Umayanga scored from just 91 balls with 13 fours and five well-hit sixes that helped St.Josephs go past the enormous 400-run mark proving their absolute dominance in this all important final.
Prince of Wales: 112 in 48.5 overs (Savin Appuhami 28, Akalanka Peris 22*, Isuru Pinto 5/32)
St. Josephs, Wattala: 401/7 in 90 overs (Isuru Pinto 107, Shashika Umayanga 113*, Pasindu Jayath 52, Kavishka Senith 51, Akalanka Peris 2/49, Yohan Kariyawasam 2/90)

BMS emerge Red Bull Campus Cricket Champs
Business Management School of Sri Lanka became the Champions of fifth World-Final of Red Bull Campus Cricket, when they beat University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh by 24 runs in the finals concluded on Sunday the 11th September at Galle International Stadium.
University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh winning the toss put BMS in, allowing their pace-attack to snatch the initiative. BMS were badly hit as far as their batting was concerned since they did not have the services of their top three key-players, Shehan Jayasuriya, Niroshan Dickwella and Bhanuka Rajapaksha in this all important final, but the advent of Dhananjaya de Silva and Dasun Shanaka into the side fresh from their national duties with the Sri Lanka team filled the void created to certain extent.
Though BMS lost their skipper, Geshan Wimaladharma after a short cameo at the top, Dhananjaya pushed BMS past fifty reaching a reasonable power-play score before BMS lost two more wickets in short intervals including the price-wicket of Janith Liyanage, a good-finisher who was unfortunately run-out after scoring just two runs. At a time Dhananjaya was losing his partners he found a partner in Dasun Shanaka to rebuild their innings carrying BMS to 91 for three halfway through their innings. Shanaka chipped in with a 15-ball 19 before both Shanaka and Dhananjaya lost their wickets when BMSs total was 92 handing the second half of their lineup the responsibility of making a sizable total for their bowlers to bowl at. Dhananjaya anchored the innings with a brisk 32 in 24 balls with three sixes, but his dismissal cost Sri Lankan team the momentum required for a match-winning total.
Business Management School : 191/9 in 20 overs (Ranitha Liyanarachchi 52, Dhananjaya de Silva 32, Dasun Shanaka 19, Geshan Wimaladharma 17, Arifur Rahman 3/20, Mohammed Islam 2/22)
University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh : 167/8 in 20 overs (MD Hasanuzzaman 39, Avishek Mitra 28, Maraj Niloy 20, Koshan Jayawickrama 4/27, Chamika Karunarathne 2/17)

Lankan paddlers struggle at group stage
Sri Lankan junior paddlers who are participating at the 22nd Asian Junior & Cadet Table Tennis Championship in Thailand failed to impress in yesterdays Cadet girls and boys singles and Junior mixed doubles group matches, losing all seven encounters of the day.
There were six cadet singles (three boys and three girls) along with the Junior mixed doubles match against Singapore. Only Helitha Hendawitharana won a singles set against his Hong Kong opponent Tsang Tsz after losing the first two sets but conceded victory to Tsz in the following set.
The other two Sri Lankan lads, Thenuka Ubayasena and Harshana Karandawela were defeated in straight set wins by Harimoto (JPN) and Kang Jinho (KOR) respectively.
The Lankan lasses followed the same footsteps and Imasha Sobana won a solitary set over Koh Kai of Singapore which did not change the fate of the match. Imasha lost the fourth set resulting a 3/1 win for Kai. The other two Lankan girls suffered clean sweeps from their Chinese Taipei and Singapore rivals.
Harsha and Chamathsara brought some hope to downhearted Lankans by winning the initial set against their Singaporean counterparts in the Junior mixed doubles match, but soon let fade all hopes losing the following three sets.
A 17-member local contingent including 14 paddlers and three officials are representing Sri Lanka at the championship where the events will be conducted in Cadet and Junior categories. The championship commenced on September 16 and will conclude on September 21

Lankan Women derailed by Aussie pace
Australia Women's bowlers set up the side's crushing win in the first ODI in Dambulla by bowling out Sri Lanka Women for 76 in 24.5 overs.
Australia chased the target in 15.4 overs, before the scheduled innings break, but stuttered towards the end, losing five wickets for 30 runs. Australia took a 1-0 lead in the four-match ODI series.
Having opted to bat, Sri Lanka lost two wickets off successive deliveries in the second over bowled by Megan Schutt. Fast bowler Holly Ferling had captain Chamari Atapattu caught in the next over, before picking up two more in the fifth over. Sri Lanka, by then, had slumped to 3 for 5.
Legspinner Kristen Beams wrecked Sri Lanka's middle order, taking the next three wickets to fall to leave the hosts tottering at 38 for 8 and in danger of posting their lowest ODI score (57). That ignominy was averted by No. 9 Inoka Ranaweera's career-best score of 32 not out. She struck five fours in her 43-ball knock. Offspinner Erin Osborne claimed the last two wickets.
Before the series, Sri Lanka Women coach Lanka de Silva had said he was banking on their left-arm spinners Ranaweera and Sugandika Kumari against Australia's predominantly right-handed batting line-up.
After one over from Eshani Lokusuriyage, in which she had Ellyse Villani lbw off the first ball, Sri Lanka turned to their spinners.
Captain Meg Lanning and Nicole Bolton added a 45-run second-wicket stand off just 44 balls to all but seal Australia's chase. Ranaweera brought the hosts back into the match with three wickets in the space of six balls, but Australia cantered to the target with four wickets in hand and 206 balls to spare. Wicketkeeper Prasadani Weerakkody effected five of the six dismissals.

New Zealand questions merit of All Blacks superiority
CHRISTCHURCH, SUNDAY: The All Blacks easy canter to the Rugby Championship crown has triggered concerns in New Zealand about the state of the international game, amid claims their dominance is unhealthy.
Rugby was the loser, wrote columnist Chris Rattue in the New Zealand Herald on Sunday after the All Blacks beat South Africa 41-13 in Christchurch to wrap up the title with two rounds of the championship still to be played.
There is increasing daylight between them and anyone else in world rugby, said Radio New Zealand's Jamie Wall, a sentiment rugby writer Gregor Paul echoed in the Herald.
It becomes increasingly apparent the All Blacks greatest enemy is themselves, Paul wrote.
Fairfax writer Richard Knowler likened the All Blacks superiority to that of a cruel cat that likes to toy with a bird with a busted wing.
Despite losing more than 800 caps worth of experience after winning the World Cup last October -- including Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, the All Blacks have barely broken a sweat in winning all seven Tests played this year.
In June, they swept the three-Test series against Wales, the Six Nations runners up, and have romped to bonus point wins in all four Rugby Championship matches played so far, racking up 24 tries in the process.
The southern hemisphere championship comprises the four semi-finalists from last year's World Cup -- New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and Argentina.
While the post World Cup months produced the usual welter of retirements from international rugby, New Zealand have managed to bounce back arguably stronger than ever, while the other three appear to have gone backwards.
World rugby is in a parlous state, wrote Rattue.
The All Blacks beat Argentina by about 30 points in a close test, and they have now crushed the hopelessly naive Springboks by a similar margin without even playing well.
The All Blacks, with away matches against Argentina and South Africa still to come, claimed the quadrangular tournament for the fourth time in five years, with Australia taking the crown last year.
The All Blacks have now gone 15 games unbeaten and Gregor Paul said that makes it hard not to think of this team as shaping as one of the best in history. AFP

Iranian Paralympic cyclist dies in race accident: official
Rio de Janeiro, Saturday: An Iranian Paralympic cyclist died Saturday after an accident in the road race on the penultimate day of the Rio Games, officials said.
Bahman Golbarnezhad, 48, fell during the event and died of his injuries despite an attempt to take him to the hospital for treatment, officials said.
"He unfortunately passed away," International Paralympic Committee (IPC) spokesman Craig Spence told AFP.
Golbarnezhad's accident occurred during the more than two-hour C4-5 road race for athletes with varying disabilities but still able to bicycle.
He was in the first section of a mountainous descent when he fell.
"The athlete received treatment at the scene and was in the process of being taken to the athlete hospital when he suffered a cardiac arrest," the IPC said in a statement.
"The ambulance then diverted to the nearby Unimed Rio Hospital in Barra where he passed away soon after arrival."
President Hassan Rouhani in a tweet in Farsi said "the demise of our dear cyclist Bahman Golbarnezhad immersed us all in deep sorrow. Rest in peace."
Paralympic officials said Golbarnezhad's family in Iran had been informed and the Iranian team was also told the news during a meeting at the Athletes' Village.
The cyclist, who wore a prosthesis on his left leg, took up the sport in 2002 and competed at the London 2012 Paralympics.
"This is truly heart-breaking news," IPC president Philip Craven said. "The Paralympic Family is united in grief at this horrendous tragedy, which casts a shadow over what have been great Paralympic Games here in Rio."
Brazil's top official for the Rio Olympics and Paralympics, Carlos Nuzman, called it "very sad news for sport and for the Paralympic movement. Our hearts and prayers are with Bahman's family, his teammates and all the people of Iran."
The Iranian flag was lowered to half-mast in the Paralympic Village, while the Paralympic flag was to be at half-mast during Sunday's sitting volleyball gold-medal match between Iran and Bosnia and Herzegovina.A minute of silence will be held during Sunday's closing ceremony.
"This is a very difficult situation. We hope we can repatriate his body to his family soon," state television website IRIB quoted the head of Iran's Paralympic committee, Masoud Ashrafi, as saying.
Golbarnezhad is survived by a wife and a son, he added.The British Paralympic team tweeted: "We are devastated by the news of Bahman Golbarnezhad's passing. Our thoughts are with our friends and colleagues from NPC Iran." AFP

Trott fires Warwickshire to One-Day Cup glory
LONDON, Saturday: Former England batsman Jonathan Trott scored an unbeaten 82 off 100 balls as Warwickshire crushed Surrey by eight wickets in England's One-Day Cup final at Lord's on Saturday.
Set just 137 to win, Warwickshire cruised to victory with 118 balls to spare for the loss of just two wickets.
Tim Ambrose was also unbeaten at the close on 22, after captain Ian Bell had fallen for 17 and Sam Hain for 12. Rory Burns top-scored for Surrey with 40.
South Africa-born Trott, who retired from international cricket in May 2015, settled the match with a cover drive off the bowling of Sam Curran.
Bell told BBC radio: "Trotty was outstanding. If I could choose one person to knock off a total like that, it would be Jonathan Trott."
Surrey had started steadily, advancing to 99-2, only to collapse, losing eight wickets for 37 runs in just 15 overs.
Three batsmen failed to score, including veteran skipper Gareth Batty, who was handed an England recall on Friday after 11 years in the international wilderness.
Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara was dismissed for 21.
Chris Woakes was Warwickshire's stand-out bowler, but Oliver Hannon-Dalby and spinners Jeetan Patel and Ateeq Javid also took two wickets each. It was a second successive One-Day Cup final loss for Surrey.

World number 11 Cilic bagged the all important point in the first of Sunday's reverse singles, seeing off Gasquet 6-3, 6-2, 7-5.
Gasquet, 17th in the world, was drafted in after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils pulled out with knee injuries.
Croatia had taken command of the tie in Saturday's doubles when Cilic and Ivan Dodig downed top-ranked French pair Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut 7-6 (8/6), 5-7, 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 after the two sides split the opening singles on Friday. AFP
