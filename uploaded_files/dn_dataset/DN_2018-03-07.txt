BBS urges people to remain calm
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) has urged all Sri Lankans to remain calm and peaceful following the Digana incident saying that any more violence at this stage would lead to anarchy in the country.
BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday said at a time when the government is unstable , this kind of incident can lead to a dangerous situation. There are elements who are trying to gain political advantages out this situation and that should not be allowed.
The Prime Minister who is also the Law and Order Minister and the Police should be held responsibility for this incident. If the Police Spokesman announced at the beginning that the youth who assaulted the lorry driver have been taken into the custody, the people in the area would have not been provoked in this manner.
We do not condone this incident and the violence and the provocative acts will not lead to solutions. The victim is a kind individual who have won the hearts of all communities, Ven.Gnanasara Thera said. The victims mother is a paralysed while the father is a diabetic. One of his children is also sick. Now we should look how we can help this family.
We urge the powers that be to come to one table and work for a solution. We should begin an intellectual discourse on this issue with the participation of the Muslim and Sinhala politicians, academics and intellectuals, the BBS General Secretary said. He further said that most of these problems are a result of the instigation of people with vested interests. But,the blame is only put on the Sinhala Buddhist community. We must carefully study this situation, Ven.Gnanasara Thera added.

Fitch Ratings Lanka has assigned Peoples Leasing & Finance PLCs (PLC, B/AA-(lka)/Stable) proposed senior debenture issue of up to Rs 6 billion an expected National Long-Term Rating of AA-(lka)(EXP).
The debentures, which will have tenors of four and five years and carry fixed coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. PLC expects to use the proceeds for working capital purposes and to retire some existing debentures.
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. The proposed debentures are rated in line with PLCs National Long-Term Rating as Fitch expects the issue to rank equally with claims of the companys other senior unsecured creditors.
PLCs Issuer Default Rating and National Long-Term Rating reflect Fitchs view that PLCs parent, the state-owned and systemically important Peoples Bank (Sri Lanka) (PB, AA+(lka)/Stable) would provide PLC with extraordinary support, if required. Peoples Bank s propensity to support PLC stems from its group role as a strategically important subsidiary and the high reputational risk to PB should PLC default, as Peoples Bank owns 75% of PLC and shares a common brand. Peoples Bank s ability to provide support to PLC is limited, and stems from Sri Lankas rating of B+/Stable

Archaeological excavations are in progress at the Anuradhapura Maha Vihara, after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe intervened by providing a grant of Rs. 500 million for the project, Central Cultural Fund's Director General Prof. Prishantha Gunawardana said.
Prof. Gunawardana inspected the ongoing excavation at the Maha Vihara site, recently.
Prof. Gunawardana told the Daily News that the archaeological excavation was suspended nearly a decade ago, mainly due to lack of funds.
But after the present government came into power, Premier Wickremesinghe revived the project at the Maha Vihara premises, which is bounded by Sri Maha Bodhi, Ruwanwelisaya, Thuparama, Mirisawetiya and Lovamahapaya.
Under the revived programme, we have restored the once-dilapidated Wali Maluwa around Maha Saya and the main Buddha shrine in Salapathala Maluwa.
The excavation and restoration of the ancient rampart from Thuparama to Sri Maha Bodhi is about to begin. We also wish to excavate the area between Sri Maha Bodhi and Maha Saya as we believe there Buddhist monks cells here.
The alms hall and the image house opposite Maha Saya is to be restored, while reconstruction of the chapter house of Lovamahapaya is being planned at the request of Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Dr. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera and the Ruwanwali Chethiyaramadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera, the Director General stated further.
A number of archeologists local and foreign have pledged to volunteer to make the programme a success. Renowned archaeologistProfessor Robin Coningham of Durham University in the UK and his assistants are expected in Sri Lanka shortly, to extend their support to the project, Prof. Gunawardena said.
He said that the findings from these excavations would be able to fill many gaps and correct wrong impressions concerning Buddhist history.The ancient pond at Lovamahapaya which is being restored.

Moves well sculpted
The dance originated before sculptures. The dance poses influenced the minds of sculptors. Different nuances of dance including the stances (Ishana position), hand gestures and limb positions influenced the minds of sculptors. Further, these were the guiding and driving factors for the creation of devotional iconography and decorative architectural sculptures.
The rhythmic expression of dance, its beauty and its vibrancy deeply impressed the others who belong to different fields and attracted and induced them to develop their imaginative creativity and skills in their outstanding productions. As a result, they brought out the rhythmic effect, beauty and vibrancy essence of dance in their own artistic creations. Applying numerous beautiful nuances of dance in their own creativity, the sculptors adopted numerous aesthetic nuances and beauty of dance in their creations. The aim of the sculptors is to attract the maximum number of viewers to view their artefacts.
Iconography and iconometry
Traditional sculptors were guided by two theoretical guiding principles. One is iconography and the other is iconometry. The icon is the devotional object. It is identified with a religion or belief. Iconography is a physical description of a God (Deity), or an incident or an action in a sculptural or painting form. But iconometry (Pramana) is the scale and proportion derived as a theoretical base, based on measurements and proportion of human body (human anatomy).
The sculptural artisans were trained and guided by these principles. But their ideological creativity and skills are firmly restricted or subjected to the theoretical framework. In other words, the ideological creativity of the sculptural artisans strongly adhered to the well-defined established principles. Dance iconography is considered as one of the important branches of development in recent dance studies. Yet it is somewhat unclear about its nature and concerns. This is not concerned with a narrative study.
All the dance aspects are well depicted in the solid static sculptural representations. The Indian sculptors produced excellent Hindu temple icons with a perfect theoretical foundation with well-established traditional codes and norms. The sculptors who produced the sculptures were very much impressed by the aesthetic essence of temple dances. The majority of the Indian dances are deeply rooted in Hinduism.
Hindu artefacts
Most of the Indian temple dances originated in Hindu temples. The sculptors before they created their Hindu artefacts studied the Hindu Agama Sastra (established principles or codes of Hinduism) Silpa Sastra (defined traditional codes established by the theoretical concepts of sculptures) and Natya Sastra (Indian Aesthetic theory), well established theoretical traditions and principles related to dance and other dance-related art forms).
Silpa Sastra provides guidelines for forming or creating statues, icons and stone murals. The beauty of the dance and its aesthetic essence attracted and influenced the minds of sculptors and painters. The dancing sculptures provided an aesthetic link between the dance and the sculpture by combined corporeality as a meeting point. This interdisciplinary approach emerged through an emphasis on exploring visual methodologies in dance.
The dance study is an interdisciplinary study. The Indian sculptors considered the human body as the powerful instrument especially to express the moods, Bhava and Rasas (expression and the essence of expression).
The type of Indian dance sculptures could be divided into two main divisions. One set of the sculptures focuses on the interpretation of dance images and the other set of sculptures identifies the dance movements. It should be noted that the movements of dance could be depicted only in a limited way in the plastic art sculptures.
Dance sculptures
The visual art forms such as sculptures and paintings are always influenced by the artists backgrounds, taste, views, ideas, patronage, time and region. The dance performances of the temple dancers might have influenced sculptors and induced them to integrate dance sculptures in the temple architectural structural creations. Presently the sculptures stand as the testimony to the process of reconstruction the classical dance movements.

According to the Minister, the National Space Hub will have a fully-fledged ground-station complex for receiving, processing and distributing earth observation satellite data, received from global earth observation satellites.
We have made arrangements to allocate a 15-acre block of land in Homagama within the Techno City to be developed under the Western Megapolis Development Project for the National Space Hub. It was initially conceptualized by the Arthur C. Clarke Institute during my tenure as the then Technology and Research Minister, said Minister Ranawaka.
Minister Ranawaka added that the GIS, as a technology, is a few decades old. But it had been evolving with time. This evolution had obviously been happening in the technology itself as well as in its applications.
The core concept in Geographic Information Systems is about mapping. Mapping is not at all a technology of modern origin, he said.
The Minister said the GISs are used in an extensive range of activities in many spheres such as urban planning and development. The representation and analysis of geographical, vegetative, demographic and economic characteristics of geographic areas under consideration can only be comprehensively represented in the form of multiple layers in a Geographic Information System. The same goes for several other fields such as agriculture, forestry and wildlife, weather and climate, coastal and maritime studies, environment and ecology, disaster management, and transportation etc.
The list is exhaustive and would naturally extend to accommodate any application requiring representation, analysis and interpretation of spatially distributed information, the Minister added.

Hakeem demands Commission of Inquiry
Food mixed with sterilization tablets
City Planning, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem yesterday, demanded to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate the alleged incident of food mixed with sterilization tablets being served to a customer at a hotel in Amapara on February 26.
The Minister also stated that those affected persons, businessmen and institutions during the clash in Ampara following the very person accused the hotel owner had mixed some pills to make people permanently sterile, should be paid compensation.
Minister Hakeem made these observations yesterday, making a special statement under standing Order 23 (2) and participating in the Adjournment Motion on the recent Sinhala-Muslim riots.
The Minister further said that the country had suffered immensely in a three decade war and everybody should take probable steps to prevent the country from experiencing such a dark era once again.
Making a special statement under Standing Orders 23 (2), Minister Hakeem stated that following the Local Government election incidents related to racial violence, vandalism and assault against Islamic religious places took place in Ampara and Kandy. He added that these were not isolated incidents, but well organized crimes committed against one community with the malicious intention of creating instability in the country to produce a political crisis to facilitate their dreams of usurping power. He also said that their intention was to lead the country on the path towards crisis to tarnish the image of the country among the international community and the UN, while bringing the country into disrepute causing an economic crisis.
He said that the recently related incidents were those that occurred at Digana and Theldeniya in Kandy. He added that when one analyze the incidents clearly, it is clear that those incidents had unleashed violence in an organized manner. He added that a Sinhalese youth had lost his life in an incident at Digana, while four Muslims were arrested in relation to the crime. "But organized groups who participated at the funeral damaged property, Muslim religious places, houses and vehicles. Although Police curfew was imposed, the situation had not been fully controlled.
The Minister also said that when the Ampara incident occurred, three shops and other property were damaged. He added that it was highly questionable as to how the law was enforced in that connection.
He added that it was first reported before the Magistrate that it was matter of racial conflict, but later it was reported as something personal. He added that the Police had covered the fact that this was organized crime against a community and Muslim religious place and also done by way of unlawful assembly.
He added that the Police did not act efficiently act during these incidents, as they exhibited at the incidents at Thambuththegama and Ginigathhena.
Inciting racial hatred a non-bailable offence
Inciting racial hatred is a non-bailable offence under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which Sri Lanka has subscribed, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha told Parliament yesterday. Speaking at the Adjournment Debate, the Minster lamented that no successive government has had the political will to change in terms of the ICCPR Statute.
This country has suffered continuously because of private incidents being used by certain politicians for their political gains. Religious hatred is the easiest political tool for bankrupt politicians to achieve their political ambitions, he said.
Observing that the Government could have acted more swiftly and Police could have acted with more responsibility to control the situation, the Minister urged the President and Prime Minister to enforce law and order and take more meaningful steps to prevent such occurrences. No religious leader or politician should get shelter just because of the race or religion they represent, he stressed.
We need to work with one Sri Lankan identity. Whatever ethnicity it is, wrong is wrong and right is right. People have taken the law into their hands on numerous occasions. Buddhism is a religion that preaches compassion and kindness. I urge the government to appoint an independent Presidential Commission and serve justice to all, he added.
Incidents that bring death and damage to properties are heinous:Dinesh
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, expressed his condolences over the unfortunate deaths that occurred during the recent conflicts in Ampara, Digana and Teldeniya.
He condemned such incidents as heinous activities that brought death and caused damages to properties of the people.
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Adjournment Debate in Parliament that discussed the prevailing tense situation between the communities in the country at the moment. He also said that the responsibility of implementing law was in the hands of the Government and it should take quick measures to bring the situation back to normal. "As Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out, various messages were circulated in the social media," MP Gunawardena said. "It is a grave phenomenon that the society face by now."
He pointed out that these incidents reflect the bankruptcy of law and order and not an issue among Sinhala - Muslim, Tamil - Muslim or Sinhala - Tamil. He added that Kumarasinghe died on March 02, while the commotion took place on March 05. "It should be investigated as to who urged the people," MP Gunawardena said. "The law enforcement bodies should consider both sides."
Enforcement authorities should ensure citizens are treated equally
The recent violent incidents in Ampara and Kandy are indicative of a sense of impunity. People seem to have confidence that they could engage in such acts and that the arm of the law would not reach them, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said in Parliament yesterday.
Seconding the Adjournment Motion moved by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sampanthan urged the law enforcement authorities to pull up their socks and ensure that all citizens of the country are treated equally.
He pointed out despite the fact that the Police station in Ampara was not very far from the eatery where the incident took place, the offenders managed to get away from the scene after damaging the property.
Taking action after the incident is not sufficient. The role of the law the enforcement authorities called into serious question. I also suppose that such incidents happening intermittently and frequently, have a deeper dimension to it than just a law and order matter. We need a change in the system of governance in the country to ensure that all people are treated equally. We need to bring in necessary amendments for that purpose. At present, people of a particular community have the feeling that they are superior and that the other persons are second class citizens. This must be eradicated. I think it is the primary cause of this trouble, he commented.
What is the point of having four-five ministers of a particular community in your government when the people they represent are not safe in this country, he questioned pointing at Muslim ministers.
He pointed out that the country, which was already grappling with so many issues including the human rights allegations and debt ridden economy, needs to stop moving backwards and do the right thing at the right time.
Racism based tribal political culture being developed
A tribal political culture based on racism is being developed in the country, said Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that racism was being sown by those who are in power to remain in power and by the losers to usurp power. He asserted that the brutal tribalism that spread hatred among communities for power, should be defeated.
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Adjournment Debate in Parliament that discussed the prevailing tense situation between communities in the country at the moment.
He also pointed out that the JVP struggled to build national unity. But it has not been able to achieve it. "Instead, racism and tribalism had dominated politics," MP Dissanayake said. "The Sinhala - Muslim conflict would create only two rival communities making neither safe."
He pointed out that these incidents did not take place spontaneously so tribalism should be defeated.
Govt back peddling on its commitments:Sumanthiran
Over 90 percent of those in the majority community are peace lovers and are disgusted by the recent incidents of violence, TNA M A Sumanthiran said.
Speaking at the Adjournment Debate in Parliament yesterday, the MP pointed out that when the people elected a new leader and a new government into office on January 8, 2015, they thought the culture of impunity prevailing in the country would change and that people would be able to live peaceful lives.
This sentiment had been shattered as the Government continues the same attitude as previously held. The government in power has the feeling that they must pander to extremist elements and go soft on them. However, the majority community does not expect this kind of mayhem to continue. The Government is back peddling on its commitments in fear of losing its popularity. After the LG polls results, the Government has gone into a shell. It is not able to stand up and do the right thing. If this goes on like this, there would never be a change. The fundamental belief that one must pander to extremist elements must change if other communities are to be able to live with dignity, he stressed.
I compliment the sentiments expressed by MP Anura Dissanayake in the House today and that kind of spine seems to be lacking in the Government. If you cant stand up for the right thing and for the various communities that are numerically inferior, you have no right to govern the country, he told Government members.
Delimitation Report on Provincial Councils presented to Parliament
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday, presented the Delimitation Report on Provincial Councils in Parliament.
Presenting the report at the outset of sittings, the minister referred it to the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Internal Administration and Public Management.
The report would be put forward for debate at a future date which has to be approved by a two third majority in Parliament.
The Delimitation Committee comprised of Kanagaratnam Thavalingam (Chairman), retired Surveyor General, Dr. Anila Dias Bandaranaike, retired Assistant Governor of the Central Bank, Professor S.H. Hisbullah, Prof. Sangara Wijeyasandiran and retired Assistant Elections Commissioner Premathilaka Siriwardena presented the report to the Minister on February 19.

Police, Armed Forces granted special powers to arrest troublemakers
The Police and Armed Forces on the ground have been granted with special powers to arrest individuals caught promoting or inciting racial violence and hatred under the State of Emergency declared yesterday afternoon.
The Presidential Gazette which brought into effect Section 2 of the Public Security Ordinance, has introduced new crimes under the State of Emergency, said Police Media Spokesperson, ASP Ruwan Gunasekera.
He was addressing a media briefing along with the spokespersons for the three Armed Forces at the Media Centre for National Security last night.
Accordingly, murder, injury, sexual attacks, damage to property, looting and attempts to create communal disharmony through the publication, speech and promotion of inciting material on social media will now come under the Section 2 of the Ordinance; carrying a sentence of 20 years and up to life imprisonment.
Further, individuals attempting or conspiring to commit such acts will also be arrested under the same Ordinance. ASP Gunasekera further explained that under Emergency, both Police as well as the armed forces have been entrusted with powers to arrest suspects. They however have to be handed over to the nearest police station soon after and produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours.
Given the nature of the crime and if the police see a need to further question the suspect, the relevant DIG has been given the power to keep these suspects in remand for no more than 14 days for questioning, said the ASP.
Any suspect remanded thus can only be given bail under special circumstances and they would be kept in remand prison until the case is complete. Relevant government officers have also been empowered to take action against individuals who spread misinformation, fear and hate through social media and promote information harmful to reconciliation.
The President had also informed the security forces that the police, army and other officers have a legal responsibility to ensure that these emergency regulations are not misused.
They are to be implemented with minimum disruption to public life and enforced with genuine intentions and to be enforced impartially regardless of their religious, ethnic or political affiliations, said ASP Gunasekara.
Responding to allegations that the Police did not act soon enough to contain the situation in Teldeniya, the ASP remarked that the police did arrest 24 persons with regard to the clashes but a special police team has been sent to Kandy to investigate into conduct of the police during the whole incident, They will find out if the Police was at fault,he said.
He however believed that through the Police curfew, mobile and foot patrols and the assistance of the army, they have been successful in containing the situation, Not allowing the violence to spread was our main focus, said the ASP.
The public has been asked to inform the nearest Police station of any attempts to arouse communal unrest in their areas.

From the past, our country has experienced internal as well as external struggles.
However, ours is a country where Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher and all other communities have lived with peace, unity and harmony together. If we look at the decade of 1940, we know how we Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim people worked together like brethren to free our country from the grip of colonial masters. It was unfortunate that peace and unity among ethnic groups deteriorated, leaving the country in a situation of protracted war that brought about many a crisis.
You all know that we are a government, that is dedicated to bring about national harmony and reconciliation. During the last few days, losses of lives and destruction of property in the areas of Ampara and Kandy, have given rise to a situation where the normalcy of everyday life of people in the country. I express my profound condolences to the families of the deceased and to those who lost their property. I strongly condemn all criminal activities. I have instructed the Police to take stern legal actions against those people, groups or organizations related in any way to these incidents.
I have also instructed the Police, Special Task Force, Army and public officers as well as regional politicians to act in a manner promoting peace and to contain tensions in order to create an environment where all people can live in harmony.
In a moment like this, it is important that we all work together.
I want to mention here that the government is dedicated to take all actions necessary to strengthen national reconciliation, peace, trust and friendship among ethnic groups, taking cognizance of situations like this. All respectfully request from all Buddhist, Hindu, Islam and Christian religious leaders to advice regional political leadership to promote and foster peace and harmony as well as to intervene to restore concord and amity whenever tensions arise in their areas.
I emphasize the fact the Police, Special Task Force as well as the Army has been deployed round the clock from yesterday to restore normalcy in the affected areas.
These steps were taken in a special meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the prevailing situation and a formal programme has been prepared for future actions after a meeting with Prime Minister and the Cabinet. As such, I request every citizen of this country to act peacefully in this situation.
Na hi verena veranisammantidha kudacanamaverena ca sammantiesa dhammo sanantano
(Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an eternal law).
We know as Buddhists that Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred. Therefore,as a Buddhist country, whatever hatred or violence perpetrated brings shame to our country. At the same time, I request from everybody, including Hindu, Islam and Christian devotees to find peace and harmony within their religious philosophy and to work together to strengthen our freedom and to achieve economic prosperity, in a peaceful manner.
In order to strengthen political stability in the country as well as to restore peace, amity and concord among all ethnic groups in the country, I must mention that the government is committed to take all necessary actions, while taking the strictest legal actions against whatever party perpetrating violence.
At the same time, we observe that some are trying to disturb peace and unleash misinformation and hatred via social media, rumours and telephone calls. We will take stern actions against them.
I consider this an important opportunity to emphasize that I will do everything it takes to restore a free and a peaceful environment in this motherland, which is yours and mine, in order to everybody to live a happy life.
Thank you all!
May Triple Gems Bless You

President declares state of emergency
President Maithripala Sirisena has declared a State of Emergency for one week with effect from mid-night yesterday, to redress the unsatisfactory security situation prevailing over certain parts of the country.
The State of Emergency had been declared, while empowering Section Two of the Public Security Ordinance within a limited scope.
The Presidents Media Unit (PMD) confirmed that the Police and Armed Forces have been suitably empowered to deal with criminal elements in society and urgently restore normalcy.
The Presidents pronouncement came within hours after a Police curfew was re-imposed in Digana and extended to the Pallekele Police division yesterday, following the tense situation on Monday.
The PMD explained that a State of Emergency had to be declared as a result of riotous and unruly acts of violence which had occurred over the last two weeks, causing damage to life and property.
These incidents have caused various tensions and conflicts between religious and ethnic groups with attacks on religious places and vehicles being carried out, they observed further.
The President noted that these acts have not subsided and whilst some of these incidents had taken place as a result of the ongoing commotion, some had been well planned.
As a measure to control this situation, it has been deemed necessary to bring to effect Section 2 of the Public Security Ordinance.
The PMD stated that this would bring back the situation to normalcy, security and ensure the supply of essential services to these areas.
The Police and Army have now been given authority to stabilize the situation within the legal frameworks of the Ordinance.
The President has also directed the Security Forces to take action against any persons creating conflict, regardless of their ethnicity, religious background or party affiliation.
He has also informed them that they should enforce the law in the interest of the people, with least disruption to public life and without violating human rights.

Price regulation for private hospitals in two weeks
The gazette notification on regulating the price of services offered by private hospitals in Sri Lanka will be issued in two weeks, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated.
According to Minister Senaratne, under new regulations, 53 services offered by private hospitals will be regulated out of the total number of 193 services.
The gazette notification will be issued once the private hospitals submit their proposals to the Health Ministry.
Minister Senaratne expressed these views after laying the foundation stone for a new 10 storeyed ward complex to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,600 million at the Balapitiya Base Hospital.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the KPMG - a global network of professional firms providing audit, tax and advisory services - had released a comprehensive scientific report on regulating the services after considering the data of 146 private hospitals in the country. The report had been studied by a committee and the final report had been compiled. The objective of introducing a regulation system for private hospitals is to protect both patients and the private hospital industry. A maximum price control will be imposed, while protecting the industry. Health is not only an industry, but also a service, he added.

Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al-Hussein of Jordan praised Sri Lanka for signing the Ottowa Convention on Anti-Personnel Landmines last December.
Prince Al-Hussein who is the Special Envoy on the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention concluded an official visit to Sri Lanka.
He was speaking at a public lecture Tuesday evening at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo.
He noted that 33 states have not yet joined the Ottowa Convention, and that a significant number of those are in Asia, such as India, Pakistan, and Nepal.
It is here that Sri Lanka could help make a difference, he said. With its accession, Sri Lanka has come to occupy its place amongst state parties, and could help drive international efforts to foster this norm in the region. India and Pakistan are both major manufacturers of land mines.
The Sri Lankan government aims to be land mine free by 2020, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Government and the de-mining organisations have cleared almost 2 billion square meters of ordnance since 2002, Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement statistics show. 84 million sqm remain to be cleared.
164 countries around the world are now party to the treaty, including a majority of countries in Europe, Africa, and South America.
In Asia, (Sri Lanka) stands proudly amongst the few, Al-Hussein said. There is something very noble about standing with the few.

We lost valuable lives of our generation due to the ethnic conflict. People lived with fear. People of this country had to undergo various hardships and insecurity. So we should not put our children in to trouble as well. Our future generation should not face any type of conflict situation. he said.
JVP Leader said that all the people in this country should realise that we all are human beings. People should defeat racism and should not leave any room for such kind of discrimination.
Since its inception, JVP fought against racism. So we are ready to defeat racism without considering any obstacles. Dissanayake assured.
He further said that racism can only divide the people as Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil but there is no any advantage for people.
Racism doesnt develop spontaneously. Some groups with various political agendas create these racial conflicts. But unfortunately, people those who have no idea about the ones who are behind this are also involving in these conflicts. He said.
JVP Leader charged that both two main political parties are entertaining racism in order to fulfill their political objectives.
He stressed the government about the importance of creating no room for any future ethnic conflict in this country and urged media institutions not to give publicity for racism.

Russian military transport plane crashes in Syria, killing all 39 on board

Thirty-nine people, including military personnel, were killed when a Russian transport plane crashed Tuesday while trying to land at Hmeimin air base in northwest Syria, Russian state media reported.
All 33 passengers and six crew members were killed in the crash, state-run RIA-Novosti reported, citing the Defense Ministry.
Earlier, it had been reported that 32 people had died.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed on the incident by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu during a working visit to Russia's Sverdlovsk region, the Kremlin said in a statement.
An Antonov An-26 Russian transport plane, like the one in this file photo, crashed Tuesday in Syria.
The crash occurred as the Antonov-26 transport plane came down 500 meters (about 550 yards) short of the runway, the Defense Ministry said in a statement quoted by the state-run news agency, Tass.
The ministry said it was investigating the crash, adding that "preliminary data suggests it could be a technical malfunction."
It also ruled out the possibility that the plane had been fired upon. Russia's Investigative Committee has launched a criminal case over the crash, committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko told Tass.
Although the identity of a pilot shot down in northwest Syria last month was announced by the government, officials have been reticent to discuss the death and injury in early February of dozens of Russian military contractors in US airstrikes in Syria.
Tuesday's crash was not the deadliest air incident related to Russia's military intervention in Syria. In December 2016, a Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft crashed after taking off from the Adler airport near the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, killing 84 passengers and eight crew members.
The plane was carrying more than 60 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, the Russian army's official dance and choir company, on its way to Syria to give a holiday performance for troops. Hmeimin, which is near Latakia, about 241 kilometers (150 miles) north of Damascus, is Russia's largest air base in Syria.
Putin visited Hmeimin in December, using the opportunity to meet with his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad. Russia is a key ally of Assad, and its intervention -- with troops and weaponry -- in Syria's long civil war has helped tilt the balance in the Syrian regime's favor.

Special Envoy lauds Lankas mine clearance efforts
The Special Envoy on the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Prince Mired Raad Zaed Al- Hussein said he was very impressed by what he saw during his tour to Sri Lanka in terms of measures and efforts taken to eradicate mines from this country.
I was very impressed with my meeting with the President on Sunday and the Minister of Rehabilitation and other officials. They have such a great sense of ownership regarding the landmine issue, while the political will is extremely evident and the Sri Lankan government is very serious in carrying out the mine clearance activities, the Prince said, congratulating Sri Lanka on the work carried out so far to rid the country of landmines and other remnants of explosives left behind by the 30 years of war.
The Special Envoy said this during his visit to Muhamalai yesterday. He is currently on a three-day inspection tour of the country. He was accompanied by Minister D. M. Swaminathan, Jaffna Security Forces Headquarters Commander Major General Dharshana Hettiarachchi and Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Implementation Support Unit (ISU) Director Juan Carlos Ruan.
I am sure if you carry on with this fantastic approach, Sri Lanka will be successful on the landmine issue. So bravo to everybody for doing such a great job, Prince Mired Raad Zaed Al- Hussein said.
Sri Lanka hopes to complete the clearing of all landmines and make the country a mine-free nation by 2020.
When asked about the kind of assistance the international community will render to assist Sri Lanka to achieve this goal, Prince Al- Hussein said: with this serious approach, I am sure that all donor states that can afford to support will rally round Sri Lanka in helping them achieve their noble goal. You are ticking all the boxes correctly and I am sure there will be a lot of support coming to Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the mine clearing target achieved by Sri Lanka, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Prison Reforms Minister D. M. Swaminathan said, The Special Envoy had agreed to provide his support to the efforts taken by Sri Lanka and we have to finish the demining by 2020. We cannot get any further extensions. Prince Mired Raad Zaed Al- Hussein has agreed to give us whatever assistance to fulfill this obligation.
Initially, it was identified that approximately 2,064 sq. km was contaminated with mines and remnants of explosives. Around 640 villages were affected by mines. However, the government commenced its mine clearance activities in 2002. So far, all agencies involved in humanitarian demining have cleared 1,233.368 sq. km by the end of last December. Currently, only around 27 sq. km is left to be cleared, which the government hopes to complete by 2020.

We must act with responsibility - Malwatte and Asgiri Anunayakas
We have to remember now that conflict based on an ethnic or religious foundation destroys all people and we have to act keeping this in mind, state the Anunayakas of the Malwatte and Asgiri Chapters.
The Buddha as well as all religions teachers have preached to establish a just society and we their followers, should not cause divisions among ourselves to create serious problems.
Religious and Political leaders met at the Kandy District Secretariat yesterday to discuss the ethnic clashes which had broken out in Teldeniya and Digana. The Anunayake Theras spoke to the media thereafter.
We may have certain disagreements among ourselves but if we do not control our emotions and act irrationally, there will be disaster in the country and the country will just move backwards, said Malwatte Anunayake Ven. Niyangoda Sri Vijithasiri Thera.
We have come out of a 30-year-war and we have so far tried to maintain that hard won peace and freedom and every ethnicity in this country has the responsibility to safeguard what we have won, he added.
The Thera also explained that it was important to control the tumult at present and have all religious leaders discuss with their people how we can move forward and live in peace in future.
The Asgiri Chapter Ven. Vendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera in the meantime observed that as followers of Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Islam, all lived in this country in peace, all religious leaders should now think of how we can protect this unity and harmony.
As Buddhists we believe in charity, kindness and equality and these pave an ideal path towards reconciliation but if we use our ethnicity to set fire to everything, we will destroy everyone,added the Anunayake Thera.
He said that the country which was built on Buddhist principles, later had other ethnic groups enter its fabric and at present they have developed their own unique culture within the country.
These different groups now have to come together and work towards reconciliation- that was the only way, said the Anunayake.
Ven.Upali Thera also observed that he too had connections with the village in which the murdered Sinhala youth lived and that there Muslim and Sinhala villages lived in peace with each other.
