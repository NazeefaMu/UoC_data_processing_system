Emma Watson private photos stolen in 'hack'

Emma Watson is taking legal action after dozens of private images of her appeared online.
A spokesman for the Beauty and the Beast star confirmed the pictures - which show her trying on various outfits - were stolen.
"Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen," her publicist said.
"They are not nude photographs. Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting further."
News of the theft comes a week after Watson sparked fierce debate overwhether she was anti-feministfor exposing part of her breasts in a Vanity Fair photoshoot.
The actress was previously threatened in 2014 with a leak of nude images, after a speech she gave on gender equality as a UN Ambassador for Women.
Speaking at a Facebook event in 2015, she said: "I knew it was a hoax, I knew the pictures didn't exist.
"The minute I stepped up and talked about women's rights I was immediately threatened - within less than 12 hours I was receiving threats."
Last month, a man in the US was jailed for nine months for hacking into the online accounts of celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence, and stealing private information, including nude videos and photos.

Popular messaging app WhatsApp has decided to withdraw its latest update.
Weeks ago, the messaging applaunched a stories feature whcih replacedtext statuses. The featurebrought WhatsApp in line with Facebooks other major apps, which all now include the stories tool that was once Snapchats most famous feature.
The Stories feature allowed users to post video and picture statuses that lasted for 24 hours before self-destructing.
However, the move resulted in a major backlash from WhatsApp users and has prompted the developers to bring back the original status feature while keeping the image-based replacement.
We heard from our users that people missed the ability to set a persistent text-only update in their profile, so weve integrated this feature into the About section in profile settings. Now, the update will appear next to profile names anytime you view contacts, such as when creating a new chat or looking at Group info. At the same time, were continuing to build on the new Status feature that gives people fun and engaging ways to share photos, videos and GIFs with their friends and family throughout their day, said WhatsApp.
Finally, WhatsApp launches new status update with video, photo feature
The update is expected to be rolled out for Android users next week while iOS users should expect it soon. Users will then be able to set a text based status by opening the About section of their profile and can view those of other people by opening their contact when starting a new chat thread or looking at group chat info.
