Wow Gifts Sure To Please Every Hard-To-Buy-For Teen
Teenagers are frequently the hardest-to-shop-for people on our holiday list. Tired of just giving them a gift card or cash We asked the teens in our lives what they most wanted, besides a car. (**Only one said world peace.) Here are some guaranteed wow ideas:
1. Glide/hover boards:
This is poised to be the gift of the season. Think skateboard meets Segway with a dash of Back to the Future. The GliTek Glide is a teen mode of transportation that every adult will want to try.
These battery-operated self-balancing scooters are poised to make skateboarding seem passe. GliTek has three versions of glide boards that include state-of-the-art Bluetooth speakers and longer-life batteries. They travel at speeds up to 12 miles per hour.
How hot is this new gadget So hot that the New York City police department has banned them from city streets.
We are counting the nanoseconds until that one gets overturned. Expect to see them all over high school and college campuses.
We even spotted a few oldsters testing them out to improve their balance. Not cheap, and there are several manufacturers. But if you want to give the gift of the season, it's this one.
2. Xbox: It is the gaming system that just won't go away, no matter how many Million Mom Marches get planned. Truth is, Xbox has earned its spot in gaming world royalty. While new games come out all the time, if your grandkid is still playing on an Xbox 360, consider upgrading to an Xbox One. The bundles with the most buzz seem to be the Halo 5: Guardians bundle and the iTB Holiday bundle that comes with three games. Not to ignore the little ones, there's the Lego Movie Videogame bundle.
3. Blace Lace skin jewels: Inspired by Game of Thrones, this collection of Swarovski crystal-accented jewels that you wear are seriously cool.
Made from metallics and velvet and inspired by the sumptuousness of TV shows like Game of Thrones and The Tudors, the pieces are reusable and are available in prices ranging from just a few dollars to couture pieces in the $30-$50 range.
Those couture pieces are reusable multiple times. Grandmas don't judge. Unlike tattoos, these come off.
4. Pocket projector: Live streaming Netflix on your phone is great while you are alone, but when friends come over for movie night, teens want a bigger screen. The Brookstone Pocket Projector Micro does the trick. So does the Magnasonic LED Pocket Pico Video Projector, which bills itself as the world's smallest portable DLP projector. This one projects videos and photos up to 60 inches in size. All you need is the blank wall.
5. Sewing machine that embroiders: Crafts are enjoying a resurgence. When it comes to teens, old is always good. Old with a new twist is even better. While sewing may be a lost art, this Brother machine that also embroiders is just plain awesome. It sews, quilts, embroiders. Short of walking the dog for you, what more could you ask for Plus who better than grandma to demonstrate how to operate it
6. Coloring books: Who would have thunk it, right Coloring books are riding a huge wave of popularity at the moment.
Several studies linked coloring to stress reduction in adults. You can't be more on trend this holiday season than to give a teenager an adult coloring book. Maybe even throw in a box of the old Crayola 64s.

Alien: Covenant will be first of three movies linking up to first Alien
Ridley Scott has confirmed that Alien: Covenant will be the first of three films that will then link up to the story from the original 1979 Alien.
The second movie in his Prometheus series is in its pre-production stage in Sydney, Australia, at the moment, where Scott confirmed the plans in a press conference.
He said that the newly-named Covenant and the next two films will answer the very basic questions posed in Alien: why the alien, who might have made it and where did it come from.
Covenant will tell the story of the crew of a colony ship which discovers what it believes to be an uncharted paradise world, but is in fact a dark and dangerous place, inhabited solely by David, Michael Fassbenders android character from the first Prometheus movie.
Its a very complex story. Its an evolution of what I first did with Prometheus One, he said.
Prometheus One was borne out of my frustration that on Alien One in 1979 - I only did one as I dont normally do sequels.
I was amazed that in the three that followed that no-one asked the question why the Alien, who made it and why Very basic questions.
So I came up with the notion of Prometheus One, which starts to indicate who might have made it and where it came from.
So Im now going to the next one, which is the next evolution directly connected with the first one, which was this Shaw, when he replaced Michael Fassbender in two pieces and well kind of pick it up there and it will evolve. When thats finished therell be another one and then another one which will gradually drive into the back entrance of the film in 1979.
So in other words, why was this space jockey there and why did he have an Alien inside him And those questions will be answered. The shoot begins in Sydney in March next year, and will take 16 weeks. He also plans to film all three new movies in Australia.
He added that the shoot will involve monumental forest and monumental rock and the rest will be in the studio with fairly formidable CGI.
Alien: Covenant is due for release on October 6, 2017.

[APPRECIATIONS - (30-11-2015)]
Ven. Sobitha Thera:
He believed in non violence and realised truth of Buddha's noble middle path
The untimely passing away of Most Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera of the Naga Viharaya, Kotte on November 7, 2015 is an irreparable loss to all Buddhists worldwide and all Sri Lankans in particular.
His keen insight, hindsight, foresight and unselfish delivery of Buddhism related topics countrywide to educate the masses led to crucial political changes in the recent past, paving the way to a more peaceful, contented, and truly exceptional island, setting an example to all other countries with similar problems related to greed, corruption, immorality and ignorance mainly of those in power to rule.
My mother Leela who lived to be 100 and six months was a devout Buddhist who was very fortunate to be able to follow the footsteps of Ven. Sobitha and whom we all knew from the year of his ordination at age 11.
His sermons and discussions were of high calibre and were attracted by all citizens of all ages, young and old. His discourses whether they were in the form of conversation, debate, sermons, conference, or discussions taught us good will, loving kindness, sympathetic joy, and an unbiased attitude in our daily lives.
He did not praise those who should be criticised but did attribute lots of commendation and admiration to those rich or poor, who were on the right track and unselfish with a mindset geared to provide healthy actions or words of wisdom for the good of the people.
He believed in non violence and realised the truth of the Buddha's Noble middle path and always respected public opinion and sacrificed his own physical health for the sake of people's harmony and peaceful coexistence.
Let us all honour Ven. Sobitha Thera by following the middle path and always mindful of the footsteps laid by him during his lifetime, and devoid of irresponsible behaviour in all aspects of our lives that could otherwise ruin not only one's own life but also the lives of the kith and kin and neighbours and society in general.
May Ven. Sobitha Thera to attain Nirvana. Richard Dharmay
Kularathne Ganegoda:
A trustful friend
This tribute is not only from me but also from my whole family, the Samarakoon family of my wife of Walbolana as well as G. Athauada, an English Teacher, who is already retired now.
Kularathne Ganegoda became a friend of mine in the mid 1970s through my second elder brother Sarath Chandra Dissanayake of Kukulnape, Pallewela, when he was conducting English Classes for G.C.E. (O/L) students at Wickramasila Vidashna Pirivena at Walbolana, before my brother became a government English teacher in 1977.
Kule and his fiance Ariyawathie (who he married later) also attended classes at that time. Since then, Kule became a good friend of mine until his untimely recent death. In August, 1978, I diverted my way of life doing a job joining to Port (Cargo) Corporation while Kule chose and succeeded his way of life becoming an English tuition master conducting English classes around Kandy, Kurunegala and Pallewela by becoming a famous English tuition master in this area after a few years.
His eternal contribution to the English education to the students of this area was exceptional. Some are now doing well abroad. Kule was very popular and well known and most of the young guys of Borukgomuwa village used to call him Loku Aiya all the time. All villagers respected him, because, he was always humble and generous to the people.
Kule you were a devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother, father in law and a trustful friend to the villagers of Borukgomuwa as well as the adjoining villagers of Borukgomuwa.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Dr. Asoka de Z Gunawardena J:
A man with a human touch
Eleven years have passed since the demise of one of the greatest legal luminaries of this country, Dr. Asoka de Zoysa Gunawardena J whose death anniversary fell on November 26.
He was a renowned academic, a versatile professional and above all a man with a human touch.
To his children he was a father who taught how to face many challenges of life and that is why both his daughter and son have been able to live up to his expectations and are doing well in life.
To his mother and father he was a great caring son. To all his close relations he was a source of inspiration. To all Sri Lankans he was a true achiever who had been elected to serve as judge to represent Sri Lanka at the International Criminal Tribunal for Ruwanda (ICTR) as well as the Joint Appeal Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) where former President Slobodan Milosevic stood trial.
Having enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court in 1967 he joined the Attorney General's Department in 1972. He was promoted as a Senior State Counsel and later as Deputy Solicitor General in 1988.
He was appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1988 and later served as its President. I still remember how sad we felt as close relations when his appointment to the Supreme Court was delayed. However my uncle very soon not only rose to become a Supreme Court Judge but went further bringing fame to his motherland.
As he very correctly said when he was elevated to the highest court of this country the guiding light of his life was his father Richmond De Zoysa Gunawardena JPUM, a renowned legal practitioner of his times.
Justice Gunawardena always dispensed justice in accordance with his conscience, as expected by his father.
Justice Gunawardena had his primary education at Revatha Vidyalaya, Balapitiya a school which had produced many eminent personalities.
Later he had a brilliant academic career at S.Thomas' College Mount Lavinia and Sri Lanka Law College where he became first in order of merit in a batch which consisted of several renowned legal personalities of this country. His academic achievements culminated in his doctorate in International Investment Law from the University of Sydney in 1983.
My uncle was devoted to his religion and was engaged in many meritorious activities throughout his life and certainly had reached the first stage of deliverance from Sansara as a Buddhist.
Gunawardena J was a classic example for the saying where there is a will there is a way. In his private life he was very humble no matter to what great heights he had reached in the official capacity.
I was fortunate to have passed out as a young attorney and law graduate while he was alive and to take my oath wearing the cloak that he gifted. He advised me to continue my studies and enhance my knowledge in law.
Dear uncle I have done that and I am proud to say that I have honoured you by passing the Master of Laws degree, though you are no longer with us to share that joy as was done in the past.
We will fondly remember you forever and follow your footsteps to serve our motherland.

Asylum seeker on Nauru jailed after attempting suicide

Refugee advocates are concerned for a Sri Lankan asylum seeker on Nauru who has been jailed after he attempted to commit suicide at the detention centre there.
The Tamil Refugee Council, based in Australia, says the 30-year-old man climbed up a tree where he stayed for nine hours on Sunday, and was threatening to jump.
The Council's spokesperson, Aran Mylvaganam says his refugee application was rejected recently, after being in detention for two and a half years.
Mr Mylvaganam told Mary Baines detention centre workers told the man he would receive help if he came down, but when he did, the police arrested him.
A 30-year-old Tamil asylum seeker on Nauru climbed up a tree on Sunday at 9am local time and threatened to commit suicide unless his family is released from detention into Australia. The man came with a five year old daughter and his wife. We have received photographs of the incident. While the man was on the tree, there were guards at the bottom of the tree and as part of the onlookers were the wife and the five-year-old child, we were able to see in the photos the five-year-old child was crying looking at her dad threatening to commit suicide. At about 6pm local time the guards convinced the man to come down with the promise that he would get a positive response within 24 hours. As soon as he came down Nauruan police came and arrested him and he is in jail at the moment.

Battle between antibiotics and acne superbugs
Art student Jenny Pearson believes there can be few treatments for acne that she has not tried.
Jenny, 25, has taken almost every antibiotic available to reduce the symptoms of severe acne, which first began when she was 14.
Yet nothing has worked, and her skin remains so bad it affects her social life and confidence.
It feels like everyone is looking at me, she says. Acne is soul-destroying, and no one understands how much it controls your life until you experience it.'
Acne is caused by an overproduction of sebum (or grease) in the skin, which blocks microscopic hair follicles. This, in turn, provides the perfect breeding ground for propionibacteria: the bugs that cause the characteristic white heads, black heads and red cysts.
Antibiotics have been a mainstay treatment of acne for decades and work by killing the propionibacteria.
The problem is they are rapidly losing their curative powers because the bacteria are becoming resistant to them.
According to a recent study by Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust, four out of five sufferers could have acne that is resistant to commonly given antibiotics, such as erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline.
People using antibiotics for too short a course is thought to be to blame, but also treatments that continue for longer periods, regardless of whether they work or not.
One study in the journal Clinical Therapy, in 2002, showed that antibiotic-resistant strains of propionibacteria can emerge after only eight weeks of antibiotic therapy.
They become resistant because not all bacteria may be killed immediately, and random mutations occur that mean the bacteria are protected from the drug onslaught.
Doctors are leaving patients with severe acne on antibiotics for an average of 11 months, according to research in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.
It is clear that long-term over-prescribing of antibiotics allows bugs to build up resistance in some cases, says Professor Nick Lowe, a consultant dermatologist and medical director of the Cranley Clinic in London.
A teenage male was referred to me recently with severe acne, and he had been trying different antibiotics for more than a year which weren't working, he says. It's a trend that's developed over the past 15 years.'
Jenny suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that affects the way women's ovaries work and leads to higher than usual levels of male hormones called androgens.
This hormonal imbalance can lead to an over-stimulation of the sebaceous glands, leading to more greasy skin and higher acne risk.
Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist in Brighton, says antibiotics can keep severe acne at bay in women with PCOS but does not get to the root of the problem. Hormonal imbalance can often be corrected by the contraceptive pill, he adds.
Yet Jenny has been given only two choices by her dermatologist - try yet another antibiotic, or a powerful drug called Roaccutane. The latter can be prescribed only under the supervision of a consultant dermatologist because it can cause damage to babies in the womb and is associated with serious side-effects, such as mood disorders.
Jenny says: I feel I am running out of options. Antibiotics haven't worked and the alternatives could have a knock-on effect on my health.'
Antibiotics should be used only for moderate to severe acne, for no longer than 90 days, says Professor Lowe. Some people may need to take them for longer but this is rare, he adds.
Latest government figures show that 43 million antibiotic prescriptions were written in England in 2012, up 5.4 per cent on the previous year. Antibiotics often become ineffective after three to six months of use and can allow the bacteria to become resistant, so over-prescribing of antibiotics is an issue, says Dr Shergill.
Acne is very common - it is estimated that 80 per cent of teenagers suffer from it at some stage, but it can affect adults, too.
The first cases of antibiotic resistant acne were documented by researchers in 1979, and since then propionibacteria has developed resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline.
Newly diagnosed patients may find that the drugs simply don't work from the outset, or they may work only for a short period of time. In the worst cases, oral antibiotics may have to be abandoned so those affected have to rely on less-effective antiseptic creams or washes.
Professor Lowe says there are other options if the antibiotics stop working. For example, PCOS sufferers can take a pill called spironolactone, which has no effect on propionibacteria but it helps slow down sebum production.
Another option is Isotrex, the gelform of Roaccutane, which works by encouraging regulating skin cell growth. It can cause irritation, redness and increased sensitivity to sunlight, but does not lead to mood disorders. Pregnant women should avoid it in case it leads to birth defects.
Laser and light treatments can also help reduce the appearance of skin lesions. They penetrate the skin and kill bacteria.
However, Dr Neill Hepburn, a consultant dermatologist and a British Skin Foundation spokesperson, says antibiotics still have an important role in clearing up infected cysts, but he would like to see shorter treatment periods and says alternatives should be tried whenever possible.

Beliefs, not so healthy!
If you've ever tried out the latest diet fad only to find yourself gaining weight and feeling awful and wondered what you were doing wrong, scientists now have an explanation for you.
Israeli researchers, writing in the journal Cell this week, have found that different people's bodies respond to eating the same meal very differently  which means that a diet that may work wonders for your best friend may not have the same impact on you.
Lead authors Eran Segal and Eran Elinav of the Weizmann Institute of Science focused on one key component used in creating balanced diet plans like Atkins, Zone or South Beach. Known as the glycemic index or GI for short, it was developed decades ago as a measure of how certain foods impact blood sugar level and has been assumed to be a fixed number.
But it's not. It turns out that it varies widely depending on the individual.
The researchers recruited 800 healthy and pre-diabetic volunteers ages 18 to 70 and collected data through health questionnaires, body measurements, blood tests, glucose monitoring and stool samples. They also had the participants input lifestyle and food intake information into a mobile app that ended up collecting information on a total of 46,898 meals they had.
Each person was asked to eat a standardized breakfast that included things like bread each morning. They found that age and body mass index, as expected, appeared to impact blood glucose level after meals, but so did something else. Different individuals showed vastly different responses to the same food, even though their own responses remained the same day to day.
There are profound differences between individuals  in some cases, individuals have opposite responses to one another, Segal explained. The researchers said the findings show that tailoring meal plans to individuals biology may be the future of dieting and the study yielded many surprises for individuals. One example involves a middle-aged woman who tried and failed with many diets. Tests showed that her blood sugar levels spiked after eating tomatoes  indicating it is a poor diet choice for her since blood sugar has been associated with heart problems, obesity and diabetes  but since she didn't know this, she was eating them as part of her healthy diet plans several times a week.
Elinav said the work really enlightened us on how inaccurate we all were about one of the most basic concepts of our existence, which is how we eat and how we integrate nutrition into our daily life.
To drill down even deeper into the question of why such vast differences exist, the researchers designed another experiment that involved personalized dietary interventions on 26 new volunteers. The goal was to reduce post-meal blood sugar levels. The clinicians designed two sets of specialized meals  breakfast, lunch, dinner and up to two intermediate meals  for each person that were theorized to be a good diet or a bad diet. Every participant followed the diets for a full week. The good diets worked, and not only did they see their blood sugar levels going down, they found alterations in their gut microbiota. One interesting finding was that even though the diets were very personalized, several of the changes in the microbiota were similar for participants. This appears to imply, the researcher said, that we're really conceptually wrong in our thinking about the obesity and diabetes epidemic.
We think we know how to treat these conditions, and it's just that people are not listening and are eating out of control, Segal said, but maybe people are actually compliant and in many cases we were giving them the wrong advice.
By using the information from the study, the researchers were able to come up with the holy grail of dieting: an algorithm that takes hundreds of factors about a person and turns them into a tailor-made meal plan. The results were pretty surprising to both the doctors and participants. It wasn't just salad every day, Segal told The Atlantic. Some people got alcohol, chocolate, and ice-cream, in moderation. Many of the participants were so excited that they spread word of the experiments to their friends and family and now the researchers have more than 4,000 on their waiting list for their next study.

Bringing Conspiracy Theories & Paranoia To The Stage
If youve ever toyed with the idea that the CIA might have killed JFK, that Nasa might have faked the moon landings, or that shape-shifting reptilian Illuminati might rule the world  or if youve simply ever wondered how anyone else could entertain such ideas  Real Enemies, the multimedia production at the Brooklyn Academy of Musics New Wave festival, may stoke your conspiratorial embers.
Writer-director Isaac Butler, composer Darcy James Argue and theatrical designer Peter Nigrini have crafted a show that uses music, video and set design to explore the world of conspiracy theories. (The title is drawn from Kathryn Olmsteds comprehensive history of paranoia in American politics, ranging from the first world war up to 9/11.)
The program, which is divided into 12 chapters, involves very little spoken text. Instead setting, mood and thematic content are conveyed almost entirely through music and visual imagery. When treating the theory that the CIA helped introduce crack cocaine to South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s in order to fund Nicaraguan contras  a notion popularized by the late journalist Gary Webb  Argue establishes a sense of time and place by nodding to LA electrofunk-influenced hip-hop, while footage of Nancy Reagan giving her 1986 Just Say No speech lends a dash of video-driven irony to the proceedings.
Real Enemies is not only about particular conspiracy theories, however. It is also about conspiracy thinking as process; about how  and why  people of all races, classes and creeds invent these (sometimes plausible, often outlandish) narratives.
As such, Darcy says, the show grapples with our fundamental urge to make sense of the world through storytelling, and with the very nature of belief itself; with our genius for finding meaning and order in the universe, and with the comfort that such meaning and order provide.
Its really telling that for so many people, its more terrifying to contemplate a world full of randomness and chaos than of governmental incompetence and long-standing ineptitude, he says.
Real Enemies doesnt just want audiences to understand conspiracy thinking, however. It wants them to engage in it. And it does so by exploiting the same narrative instinct that allows us to connect the dots between seemingly disparate events. This might mean using music that alludes to the unnerving scores of conspiracy thrillers such as The Parallax View, while simultaneously splashing different images on to each of the 15 projection screens arrayed on stage.
Sometimes, admits Nigrini, we intentionally present more information than the audience can digest. That information overload mixes with elements of conspiracy thinking which pervade every aspect of the production.
Nigrini drew visual inspiration from movies like The Parallax View and The Manchurian Candidate, which used filmmaking techniques to engender a sense of paranoia among viewers. (If the picture works, Parallax director Alan J Pakula allegedly told his star, Warren Beatty, the audience will trust the person next to them a little less.) He also looked to the work of Stanley Kubrick, a man who was the subject of more than a few conspiracy theories himself.
We intentionally present more information than the audience can digest. That information overload mixes with elements of conspiracy thinking which pervade every aspect of the production.

Budget at a cursory glance
The Governments budget for 2016 aims at development initiatives by way of allocating funds for the improvement of infrastructure facilities. It also aims at upgrading the existing infrastructure facilities with the aim of promoting industries, tourism sector in addition to transportation sector.
According to analysts, these mega development initiatives, once implemented, will have positive effects on the countrys economy as they provide long awaited solutions in the transportation sector. When making proposals for development projects, the government has not only proposed new projects, but also ensure how the projects could make use of the existing facilities in a more productive manner.
The proposal to create industrial parks along the proposed expressways and expressway exit points, for instance, is commendable. The decision to allocate government lands in Hambantota and Trincomalee to encourage ship building, ship breaking and ship repair activities will pave way to make use of the ports in Hambantota and Trincomalee as employment generating ventures.

A convention hall with state of the art facilities and with a seating capacity of at least 7,000 to be built adjacent to Town Hall in collaboration with the private sector will also make Colombo a hosting centre for mega local and international events. The proposal to the build a monorail system connecting Negombo -Katunayake - Colombo and Colombo Kaduwela as a public and private sector partnership project is a praiseworthy proposal. It was a long awaited project which will ease the traffic congestion.
Commercial activities in Colombo
Allocation of Rs.15,000 million for the expansion of the road network which includes the expansion of the Ruwanpura Expressway, extension of Marine drive up to Panadura, extension of the Pamankada-Ratmalana Road, new bridge construction over the Kelani River, reconstruction of 25 bridges and three flyovers create new hopes about a better road network in the country.
Allocation of Rs.10,000 million for the construction of elevated road from Cotta Road to Kaduwela on BOT basis, the proposal to construct a new access road from the Kelani Bridge to the Colombo Fort improving access to Fort is a step taken to ease heavy traffic congestion in Colombo. This will further boost commercial activities in Colombo.
The decision to expand the Central Expressway to connect Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Mullaitvu and Jaffna under a public private partnership renews the hopes of the public about an expressway network expanded to the North Central and Northern provinces.
Most importantly the allocation of Rs.10,000 million for projects under master plan on the megapolis project will take the country towards a new era of urbanisation in the country. However, it is the expectation of the people to see a development that will not be a burden to the country's economy in a long term basis.
The government's effort revealed in the 2016 Budget to widen the tax net is a commendable move which will help bring in more revenue to the coffers, said tax experts. They said the proposal to net in around 60 percent of the affluent class who evade taxes is praiseworthy move but how it hopes to achieve this feat is yet to be seen.
Tax consultant and Partner Gajma and Co. N R Gajendran said the government has focused on wooing more FDIs to the country by slashing the corporate tax, revising the land lease tax and doing away with the dividend tax for shareholders outside Sri Lanka.
The policymakers should focus on stimulating more FDIs, promoting exports, research and development, encouraging innovation and investment in human resource development if it is to get to the next level of development, Gajendran said.
Foreign investors
With regard to the income tax being increased from 12 percent to 15 percent for value added exports, he said we need see the total picture. Today the cess on exports has been removed and there is a huge advantage of the devalued rupee for exports. No country has a low income tax as in Sri Lanka. An increase from 12 percent to 15 percent will not have a major impact on exports, he said.
Tax experts said the land alienation policy adopted in the past sent a negative signal to foreign investors who were uncomfortable to invest in Sri Lanka. Foreigners could not buy land. There was an upfront cost of 15 percent which meant the cost of commencement of business shot up. The move to revise land lease tax in the budget will attract foreign investors and the space for development.
The reduction in VAT (Value Added Tax) by around three percent will offset the increase of PAL (Ports and Airport Levy) and NBT (Nation Building Tax) which have been increased from 5.0 percent to 7.5 percent and from 2 percent to 4 percent, experts said.
However industrialists said the revision of PAL and NBT will have a adverse impact on capital investment programs. It has also been proposed to introduce the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) in 24 institutions.
Gajendran appreciated the measures to simplify tax system and improve administration. However, the government will have to walk the talk and the private sector will have to keep pace with the rapid changes across the globe.
The budgetary allocations to the education sector represented an all high six percent of the GDP, which the Government Ministers called a victory for general masses. However the joint opposition and the JVP criticized it as a gimmick to hoodwink the people.
The budget has allocated a sum of Rs.1000 million for teacher-training and re-training while quarters and hostels will be built at an amount of Rs 2000 million, next year. Showcasing the commitment of the government to improve basic facilities in state schools Rs. 4000 million has been set aside to develop sanitary and water facilities in all primary and secondary schools in the country by 2016. In addition, a sum of Rs 2000 million has been allocated to supply electricity for schools without power.
All 3577 primary schools in the country will be upgraded at a cost of Rs.10,000 million under a medium term action plan.
At the same time, 1,000 secondary schools are to be provided with activity rooms, laboratories, multimedia facilities, libraries with e-library facility. The Finance Minister allocated Rs.15,000 million for this purpose and another Rs.30,000 million to develop another 1360 neglected schools.
Further, to stress its commitment to develop estate sector education, the government has set aside Rs.250 million to upgrade 25 estate schools as secondary schools. Among other programs envisaged are the improvement of dental facilities in schools and allowing schools to enter into partnership with private sector to utilise their unused property for activities such as farming to generate income.
It also removed import duties on books, journals and magazines to promote education. Other key decisions include the restriction of students in a classroom to 35 and a voucher system for school uniforms.
Higher education sector
The government also increased total budgetary allocation for higher education sector by 30 percent in 2016. Another welcome decision is to provide hostel facilities for all undergraduates by 2018. Local universities will also be encouraged to get accreditation with professional bodies to attract foreign students to their postgraduate courses.
To honour former Education Minister Lalith Athulathmudali a university named Mahapola University will be built at Malabe. This university will focus on teaching ICT, Business Studies, English, Management and other new market oriented subjects. A sum of Rs.3,000 million is allocated for this purpose.
A new engineering and agriculture faculty in Kilinochchi and Vavuniya, Postgraduate Institute for Pali and Buddhist studies are among the other projects envisaged under the 2016 Budget.
The government, in keeping with its vision to produce computer savvy young generation, will also provide free wi-fi zones in all universities and laptops will be provided under interest free three year loan programmes.
To curb the flow of foreign exchange out, the government will support the previous governments policy to set up foreign institutions within Sri Lanka. A point scheme will also benefit those who excel in sports and other extracurricular activities during school.
The budget made concessions for the technical education sector as well. Techno-based campuses and vocational training institutes are being envisaged to bridge the gap in lower and middle level skilled workforce. Within the next two years the intake to German Technical College is to be increased by 200 students.
The emphasis placed on this sector was further highlighted by the fact that it allocated Rs.3000 million to provide foreign training for master trainers in the vocational training sector and introduce standardized English courses with the participation of private sector.

CBKs pension on par with MRs

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister, tabled a resolution in Parliament on Saturday seeking approval to increase the pension entitlement of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 97,500 to bring it on par with that of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The resolution was tabled in terms of Paragraph (1) Article 36 of the Constitution which gives Parliament the power to introduce a resolution to determine the salary, allowances and pension entitlements of Presidents. Parliament determined by a resolution on March 4, 1986 states that the pension entitlement of a President shall be a sum equivalent to the salary the President was entitled to immediately before he ceased to hold such office.
Accordingly, from 1988, the pensions paid to former Presidents J. R. Jayewardene, D. B. Wijetunga, Hema Premadasa, the widow of former President R. Premadasa and to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga were Rs. 25,000 per month which was equivalent to the salary of the President.
With the implementation of the Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 issued on November 23, 2006, Parliament by resolution revised the salary of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 97,500 per month effective July 1, 2006.
Remunerations or allowances paid to ministers and Members of Parliament too were revised at the same time. Coinciding with the revision of remunerations or allowances paid to the ministers and Members of Parliament, pensions of former ministers and Members of Parliament too were revised. However, only the pension paid to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was not revised.
The resolution states: That this Parliament resolves under Paragraph (1) of Article 36 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, in view of the above, it is just and reasonable to rectify this anomaly (a) revising the monthly pension entitlement of the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 97,500; (b) paying a monthly pension equivalent to the two-third out of Rs. 97,500 to Hema Premadasa, widow of former President R. Premadasa; and (c) implementing the aforementioned revisions of pension entitlements with effect from 01.01.2016.

Of cabbages and cucumbers, scarecrows and jars of pickle
For the child in all of us
Ever wondered why rabbits have soft white fur Why cucumbers feel cold when you bite into them What do scarecrows dream of, as they stand in the middle of a vegetable plot all day long
I know, that part of us that grew up and became adults, who are today too engrossed in our smart phones and wall posts on Facebook may not be bothered to find out. But the part that still remains a child would love to know the answers. Guess who can tell us Who else but the legendary author of many acclaimed children's books beginning with the Kuda Hora to Suttara Puncha to the Little Kite, Sybil Wettasinghe, of course.
But the answers to the above questions are found only in her new books (Piduru Pala, Achcharu Muttiya, Sudu Sinidu Thuwaya, Nanna giya Yaluwo) published by M.D Gunasena, that prove to be a beloved addition to children's literature for many decades to come, for many good reasons too. The stories here, in much the same way Appu and Bappu touched our hearts in our own childhood, speak to the heart of every child, even if they happen to be living in the 21st century, playing computer games instead of climbing trees and may never have seen a scarecrow in their lives.
Just as well. For those who have never seen a scarecrow, Piduru Pala is the best scarecrow they could ever meet. With a face as round as the moon, forever smiling, dressed in a blue stripped shirt and shorts, he stands in the middle of Podi Appu Aiya's vegetable garden, till one day he tries to go for a walk.
Wouldn't you love to know what happens to him when he moves away from the pole he is tied to I find it a great pleasure to keep this secret to myself, till you read the book and find out all about it in your own good time.
What about the cucumber and the cabbage who went to the river for a bath What happens to them in Nanna Giya Yaluwo Who can solve the mystery of the crane's white towel which goes missing, in Sudu Sinidu Tuwaya The answers to these questions too, are best left to be found out on your own.
There's no mystery in Achcharu Muttiya, though. In this story you will find yourself traveling back in time to a village where a Mudalali is in the habit of throwing the dirty water after he washes the plates of his customers right onto the road in front of his kade'. In Accharu Muttiya you will meet delightful characters like Ranhami and Kande gedera Ranso Nanda.
Each page on each book bursts with color. The warmth and exuberance of the pictures, so delightfully depicting the emotions the characters are going through, offset by minute details, the purple butterfly who gapes in astonishment at the crane, the squirrel laughing at the cucumber, the crow on the Mudalai's roof - enrich the books poignant themes.
Not only the children, but you too, will enjoy each story because there still is, or was, a child in all of us. What's the bet you will be smiling as you say goodbye to Piduru Pala. He is nolonger as young as he used to be, but we know he is safe and happy as he could ever be.

COP21 - United Nations conference on climate change
On Monday, 30 November, 150 Heads of State are expected in Paris for the first day of COP21. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena too will attend the COP 21.
France was officially appointed host country for the 21st climate conference (2015 Paris Climate Conference  COP21) during the 19th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Warsaw (COP19).
COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, will be one of the largest international conferences ever held in France. In this context, France is facing a two-fold challengeas the host country, it will be responsible for hosting thousands of delegates and observers under the aegis of the United Nations, for two weeks, in the best possible conditionsas the country taking over the COP Presidency, it will need to act as a facilitator among all parties to the negotiations, in order to create an atmosphere of confidence, bring viewpoints together and ensure that an agreement is adopted unanimously.
This Conference is crucial because it must result in an international climate agreement enabling us to limit global warming to below 2C.
It will be necessary to reach a certain number of decisions in December 2015, building on the work carried out at COP20 in Lima.
Firstly, an ambitious, binding agreement on climate change that applies to all countries.
Secondly, intended national determined contributions (iNDC) representing the investment that each country feels able to make. Climate finance will also be a crucial component; in this regard, a milestone has been reached with the initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund, amounting to $9.3 billion, including nearly $1 billion from France. Lastly, local and regional initiatives developed by local governments, civil society organizations and businesses will boost mobilization and supplement the contributions made by states.
In order to organize this United Nations Conference in the best conditions, France has chosen to hold it in Paris, at the Paris-Le Bourget site, from 2015, November 30 to December 11 which is logistically the most suitable in terms of hosting facilities and accessibility for not only the official delegations but also civil society and the media, which are crucial to the success of the Conference.
Lastly, France has chosen to make this Conference exemplary in terms of environmental impact and will implement a programme of action to minimize the impact of the meeting in terms of consumption of natural resources (water, waste, energy) and greenhouse gas emissions.

Curiosity at First Sight!
Call her a workaholic. If you are Stephanie Siriwardhana, there is no idling around. The former Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Universe 2011 and Miss Asia Pacific World Sri Lanka 2013 is a Global Shaper of the World Economic Forum and the founder of the Stephanie Siriwardhana Foundation which aims to empower, inspire and educate women, youth and children.
"I have four or five tasks to juggle on an average day. Everything is planned ahead since I am not good at handling things at the last minute.
I would be lost without a planner. Each day is unique. I hate routine! It is fun to do different things," says the beauty whose heart lies in social activism.
Stephanie has a degree in Journalism, Communications and Political Science from the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.
She had worked as the Senator of the Youth Parliament of Sri Lanka. She is also passionate about dancing, singing, art and kickboxing.
Q: How far has winning the Miss Sri Lanka crown taken you
A: Winning the crown really helped me trampoline into the work I want to do. It creates a great platform where you can vocalize and really stand for things you are passionate about.
It also grants you access to places and people that might have been a little difficult to tap into to get work done. It has helped me a lot in terms of my foundation.
Q: Who is your fashion icon
A: Hmmm, honestly I dress how I feel but if I had to choose I would say Victoria Beckham and Audrey Hepburn as they are both classy and strong women.
Q: What is your motto
A: What is meant to be will be so live everyday to the fullest. And always be yourself! (Flashes a smile)
Q: If you could change one thing about yourself what would it be
A: Honestly I guess I would like to be more patient. I'm very impatient and hate waiting for things to happen (LOL).
I'm someone who wants to execute ideas immediately and do so many things but sometimes I have a hard time pacing them out. So I guess that's what I'd change.
Q: What is the best holiday destination in Sri Lanka
A: I think Sri Lanka has so many wonderful places which can give you any kind of atmosphere you want unlike many other countries where it's only one type. So I'd say it's hard to choose one!
Q: Are you a good cook What is the tastiest dish you prepare
A: Ohh, I LOVE to cook and I'd say I'm a self-proclaimed good cook. Ha ha ha! Well I think I make desserts best. I make a delicious Tiramisu. I've been promising a few people but still haven't found time to make it yet. Answering this question is probably going to get me into trouble. (LOL)
Q: Do you believe in love at first sight
A: Well I'd say I definitely believe in 'Curiosity' at first sight because that's where it all starts. You see someone and find them intriguing and want to know more. That's where the journey begins and then only do I believe that love can blossom.
Q: Three tips you would give contestants vying for the Miss Sri Lanka crown.
A: Be yourself. Have fun. Use the opportunity to really make your dreams a reality as it's a great platform.
Q: What is your favourite song Why do you like it
A: That's a hard one but I guess I've always loved 'Ave Maria' (Bach's version).Lately I've been listening to 'The Lord's Prayer' a lot. These songs are magical.
They are both prayers ('The Hail Mary' and 'Our Father'). They take you to another realm completely where you can connect with a deeper spiritual energy.
Q: If you could be anyone else for a day who would you choose to be and why
A: Gosh, that's a tough one. I can't pick one right now! (Laughs)
Q: What are you involved in right now
A: My foundation is working on setting up the transitional shelter for sexually abused young girls which will be located in Kandy. I'm working on getting all the approvals so that we can start building by December! It's been a long journey to get here so I'm very excited that it's finally realising.
On a less serious note I've been singing quite a bit after playing Christine at 'Phantom' so that's definitely fun. And now it's event season so I'm hosting lots of events.
I was one of the 50 shapers worldwide to be selected and invited to the to the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos in January. There I met individuals like Andrea Bocelli, the Crown Prince and Princess of Norway (I even facilitated a session with the Crown Princess Mette Marit), Arianna Huffington, Will I Am of the 'Black Eyed Peas', the previous CEOs of Google and Yahoo including Bill Gates and many more fabulous people!
Q: What would your tomb stone read
A: I'd say: Here lies Stephanie Siriwardhana beloved daughter, sister, wife and mother. Followed by something which talks about how I've touched and changed the lives of many and made them happy.

## Title: A date with The Dictator

A date with The Dictator
For someone who is going through a bout of flu, Namel Weeramuni sounds surprisingly and reassuringly like his normal, jovial self when I speak with him about his new play, The Dictator which debuted in late October at the Punchi Theatre and will go on the boards again on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of December.
He says when H.C.N. De Lanerolle's son, Prof. Primal de Lanerolle suggested he directs three of his father's plays, he chose The Dictator first as he felt this play had more relevance to the times we are living in today. Apart from the political innuendoes which seem to fit into our recent past so well, in spite of the fact that the play was written in the 1950s, he feels what is most alluring in The Dictator is the universal theme around which the play revolves, a theme that is common to all married men, regardless of time, space, caste or race: The dominance of the wife over her husband. It's an eternal theme, he chuckles.
I'm only too eager to point out, though, that the play ends with the dictator's confident proclamation, I may not be the Dictator of Ceylon. But I am the dictator at home. Namel Weeramuni bursts into laughter again. That's what we think, he grins, but it is never like that in real life. We are all dominated by our wives.
He says it mattered little to him that he had never watched The Dictator when it was first staged in the mid 20th century, because whenever he adopts a play he gives it his own interpretation; his own unique signature. This sense of individuality enhanced by the remarkable stage set designed by Lal Harendranath, the attractive costumes by Senaka de Silva, make-up by Buddhi Galappaththi and music by Jayathissa Alahakoon all add to the enchanting aura that surrounds The Dictator'.
Satire at its best
Among the plays of H.C.N. De Lanerolle that Namel Weeramuni had watched in his student days were, He Came from Jaffna and Well Mudaliyar'. This was during an era in which those who belonged to the so called high class frequented the Lionel Wendt to watch English plays. He recalls those were the days when an evening at the theatre would probably have looked like the scene at the Ascot racetrack in Shaw's Pygmalion when everyone came dressed to the nines, as if they were going to a pageant.
Regardless of when it is staged be it in the 1950s or in the present, The Dictator is undoubtedly satire at its best. As we laugh at the antics of Ralahamy and Mahaththaya we are laughing at ourselves: at the way we translate Sinhala phrases into English, If they ask me I will tell and give, is Ralahamy's favorite phrase, and at our beliefs in the occult sciences as well as the unequal distribution of power between Ralahamy and Hamine, superbly played by Malini Weeramuni. If Hamine, obeys the wishes of Ralahamy, you can rest assured that it happens only in Ralahamy's dreams.
While Pinnya Samarathunga's Stella acts as foil to Hamine's over-reactions, thin, bespectacled, Galpotha (Prabhath Dhevidra) who is the reporter from the Daily News and Nella (Purnima Pilapitiya/Kiruthika Thurairajah) the no-nonsense woman of steel from the Times of Ceylon make those of us who are in the print-media laugh at ourselves. Pradeep Kumara who makes brief appearances as the exorcist effectively conveys the mystery that lurks in the occult sciences and injects a jab of fear into the minds of even the non-believers.
Alright, alright
It is hard not to smile when Mahattaya (Daya Tennekoon) keeps introducing the dictator in such a way that it sounds as though he is calling out to The Director. Specially when we know the relentless perfectionist Namel Weeramuni is as a director. It is a well known fact that he is strict and hot-tempered if the actors do not know their lines or fail to meet the high standards he expects from his cast during rehearsals. Mahattaya is not wrong after all, when he introduces the dictator as the director. I am the real dictator, assures Namel Weeramuni, with the happy laughter of someone who has accomplished his goal in reviving this classic play.
From one dictator to the other. I hear him, before I see him. A cat is meowing in the background and he is saying in a gentle, soothing voice, Alright, alright, you can go out now,. A black and white cat steps into the sitting room, gives me a look that says she is royalty and walks out the front door. In her wake comes Wijerathne Warakagoda.
He peers at me over his glasses, and begins our conversation with those very lines he immortalizes in The Dictator, as the dictator. Hm...let me look and see... I will tell and give...if not things will get worser than useless. Thus, with these fragments from the play, we begin and end act one in his living room in Kalubowila.
Act two is all about his other English play, for, amazingly in his long career as an actor The Dictator is only his second play in English. The first was called The Killer, and was staged in the 1970s. It was a comedy well received at the time. We laugh, when we realize he has moved from being The Killer in the 70s to The Dictator in the 21st century. Wijerathne Warakagoda attributes this lapse between his first English play and the second, to the fact that he never goes behind directors asking for them to give him a role in a play. I wait for them to come to me, and when they offer me a role I agree to do it, no matter what the role is. He insists he is not choosy with the roles he plays but admits he loved being the dictator.
Who would not, as the role gives him the chance to bring laughter into the lives of fellow Sri Lankans. Yet, in real life he is far from being a dictator, he assures me. Unlike Ralahamy, I don't believe in the so called occult sciences, he says. Then he acts out the last few lines of the play. He recalls the dream where there is No one to put the breaks. Everyone is obeying me. Even Hamine. Then, he decides to become a dictator at home. I can't resist asking him if this is true in real life too. Not at all, he smiles. My wife and I are equal when it comes to wielding power at home. There are no dictators here.
Satisfied
He says he is satisfied with his interpretation of Ralahamy even though he had not seen the Dictator when it was first staged. He laughs over the Sri Lankan English in the script and admits memorizing these Singhlish lines was more difficult than it would have been if they were in the normal British English we are used to. Now two times I told. Sit down he roars, waving his index finger at me. Even though he is dressed in a white, long-sleeved shirt and black trousers, as he says the words he turns into the dictator and for the briefest of seconds I see him dressed in the regal garb in which he appears on stage, right in front of me. Then he enacts for me, the best line in the play, which I feel only he could say in that unique Sinhala accent that makes the audience collapse in laughter. Dismissing the Latin term Proforma Hamine uses to explain why they looked at their horoscopes when they got married, he tells her not to talk in Latin with him, because, Latin is Greek to me!
As I leave the two dictators, basking in their glory I realize the real dictator is neither director, Namel Weeramuni nor leading-actor, Wijerathne Warakagoda. Make it to the Punchi Theatre on 2nd, 3rd and 4th December to meet the real dictator and find out all about her.
A warning to all men, before I go. Don't try this at home!

Fear spots!
Many of us think that chickenpox is just another infectious disease that does not require serious treatment. But certain adults may develop complications when infected with the disease, says Consultant Virologist and the Head of the National Influenza Centre of Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha (M.B, B.S. PG Dip in Med. Micro., M.D. (Med. Virology)
Q: What is Chickenpox
A: It is a highly contagious illness characterized by a skin rash caused by a virus called Varicella Zoster. Chickenpox is also called Varicella Infection. It is also known as VZV infection. It is an acute, highly contagious, disease.
In temperate climates most cases occur before the age of 10 years. The epidemiology is less well understood in tropical areas, where a relatively large proportion of adults in some countries are seronegative.
While mostly a mild disorder in childhood, chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults.
It is characterized by an itchy, vesicular rash, usually starting on the scalp and face, initially accompanied by fever and malaise.
As the rash gradually spreads to the trunk and extremities, the first vesicles dry out. It normally takes about seven to 10 days for all crusts to disappear.
Q: How does it spread
A: By small droplets, aerosol or direct contact or indirectly by touching freshly soiled contaminated items. The incubation period is 14 to 21 days.
The patients are entitled for medical leave and it helps prevent the disease from spreading to healthy persons. Patients are usually contagious from a few days before onset of the rash until the rash has crusted over.
Q: Who are at risk
A: Pregnant women, newborns, elderly patients and organ transplant patients are at risk. Those whose immune system is weak such as transplant patients and elderly patients may develop complications when get infected with the disease. They can rarely have pneumonia. The disease may be fatal, especially in neonates and immune compromised individuals.
Complications include VZV-induced pneumonitis or encephalitis and invasive group A streptococcal infections. Immune compromised individuals are at particular risk of severe disease.
Q: What is shingles
A: Following infection, the virus remains dormant (lying in low activity) in neural ganglia; upon subsequent reactivation, VZV may cause zoster (shingles), a disease affecting mainly immune compromised individuals and elderly people.
It is restricted only to a small part of skin unlike widespread rash of chickenpox.
Q: What treatments are available for those infected
A: Antiviral drugs such as Acyclovir (like antibiotics against bacterial infections) are available. Special treatments are available for high risk patients such as Immunoglobulins.
Q: How can Chickenpox be prevented
A: Vaccines are available. It is recommended to children and adults. Two doses have to be taken.
It is advisable to children and teenagers as if they get infected they might miss examinations. Chickenpox leaves life long protection against it.

[WEEDS]
FRIEND or Foe
Remember how George Orwell's Animal Farm ends with the maxim, All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal Sad to say, this is true in a garden too. All plants are equal. But some plants are more equal.
Yes. You guessed right. Today we are going to talk about weeds: those plants that turn up like bad pennies in your garden even though those very plants are admired with great enthusiasm when they are seen in Wilpaththu or the Horton Plains as beautiful wildflowers or exotic shrubs: the kind that inspires the poet in us or brings to mind the poets we love: There is a flower that shall be mine,It is the little Celandine... wrote Wordsworth about the tiny yellow flower with eight petals which is categorized as a wild plant.
Yet, it goes without saying, weeds are pretty high on the list of things that annoy us as gardeners. Specially when they show up in even the most manicured garden: Specially when they don't just look out of place but compete with other plants for nutrients and moisture. Left to their own devices, they will weaken your vegetable or flower beds and choke them out of existence.
There is always the option of commercial weed killing products, of course, but if you really and truly love mother nature you would never even dream of using them in your garden. So what is a gardener to do about weeds
Easy. You weed your weeds away. Weeding might turn out to be quite enjoyable, after all, provided you do it for just a minute or two, every now and then. Attacking gardens full of weeds however, can be a soul destroying task, especially when weeks later, they are back, bigger and stronger than before.
Skill
As Jason Hodges says in Love your Garden: Weeds weeding is a skill and if done incorrectly, will only help stimulate growth. Lots of weeds have tap roots so when you just rip off the foliage, the new plant that grows back has all that energy from the root to draw on, explains Hodges. That means it will grow faster and stronger than the part you removed. Other weeds like onion weed have a bulb and when you pull at it, it releases small seeds from the bulb that increase the amount of weeds you have - pull one onion weed out and you will have released about fifty seeds into the garden.
There is an old saying, See a weed, pull a weed, meaning every time you see one, pull it out. Hodges however, says that as much as he likes this sentiment he disagrees with the technique. Pulling at weeds just removes the foliage, leaving the root system to establish again.
Using hand tools
All experts agree the most time-consuming but potentially the most rewarding way to get rid of your weeds is on your knees using small hand tools. The best time to hand weed is when the soil is damp so wait a day or two after heavy rain or after you have watered the garden. This loosens up the soil and lubricates the root system for easy removal. Two other important tools are, patience and perseverance!
Another way to combat weeds is by mulching. You can use a heavy layer of grass clippings, fallen leaves, and much more to create a barrier against weeds. Other than fighting weeds, mulch has many garden benefits including helping with moisture retention and reducing fungus. If you would rather keep mulching to a minimum, you can do so by using newspapers. Place yesterday's newspaper on your garden bed and follow up with a thin layer of mulch to tell your weeds to keep away. When the time is ready for planting, just punch a hole through the paper where your plant is to go.
Another useful item when it comes to weed prevention is cardboard. But the hitch with cardboard is that even though it does a good job of resisting weed growth, it can be difficult for water to reach the soil through a layer of cardboard. It is also harder to tear holes in for planting purposes, so you might want to make the holes in advance of laying the cardboard down. The good thing about cardboard is that it is plentiful (old milk powder boxes, shoe boxes packages that come whenever you purchase electronic goods etc) and is useful in creating garden walkways as well as stopping weed growth.
If you have them, old shower curtains too can be used as barriers against weeds. Spreading these useless items in garden paths or between rows will keeps weeds from showing their unwanted heads.
A substance that lacks the commercial chemicals but, still kills weeds is vinegar. The problem with this, however, is vinegar will also kill any other plants it comes in contact with, as well. To use it, put some in a spray bottle and spray only the target weeds you wish to eradicate. Be sure to use caution not to get it on any plants you wish to keep or else they, too, will be departing in a hurry.
Using boiling water
In much the same manner as vinegar, you can use boiling water, too. Simply pour the water where you wish it to go, to work on killing weeds. Boiling water will cook and kill the target plant, making it no longer a presence in your garden. However, in addition to killing weeds, boiling water can also take out the plants you wish to keep, not to mention severely burning you if you are not careful.
You can also use your plants themselves as a defense against weeds by planting in a pattern that chokes out weeds. Since weeds need sunlight to thrive as other plants do, avoid row planting and instead plant in blocks. This will make sunlight less available to weeds, and force them to grow in the shade which will greatly reduce both weed numbers and weed health.
Just like births, deaths, irresponsible three-wheel drivers and places of worship with blaring loudspeakers, weeds are a part of life you can't avoid.
But the good news is, there are many things you can do to heavily impact their growth. Give one or more of the methods above a try and chances are you will be happily eating from a garden that is in large part, weed free.
Or else, give the weeds too, a chance to live. Turn your backyard into a weed garden as I did in these past three weeks of incessant rain.
As the saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them. It will be worth it. You will be feeding all the wildlife around you and if your weeds are the kind that doubles as wildflowers, you will still end up having a beautiful garden, too.
After all, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, a weed is a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.

Grow your own meadow
Planning your meadow garden
No garden is too small for a beautiful wildflower meadow, so don't be put off if you do not have acres of space. Meadows can be used to great effect sown in pots or flowerbeds and look especially striking mown into distinct shapes on a lawn. Consider the following tips for planning your meadow garden.
Focal points
When creating a wildflower meadow, you should consider how it will affect the rest of the garden and how it can be used to enhance other areas. Patches of wildflowers can be focal points in their own right, but they can also be used as backdrops or foils to lead the eye to other features, such as seating or the white trunk of a silver birch tree.
Shapes, paths and edging
Patches of meadow planting are eye-catching, especially when used to punctuate formal settings; they look particularly striking when cut into shapes or given neat edges, in contrast to their naturally informal look. In a larger garden a mown path through a wildflower meadow creates a lovely feature, enticing people to walk among the flowers.
Wildlife benefits
There are many wild creatures that will benefit from the longer grass and wide range of plants that a wildflower meadow provides. Bees and butterflies will be attracted to the nectar-rich plants, while animals from hedgehogs to harvest mice and swallows will be able to find a home among the diverse plants.
Pick a sunny site
Most wildflowers will thrive on a sunny site such as this south-facing slope. Wildflowers make great groundcover on banwks that are tricky to mow.
Assessing your site
The ideal site for a meadow is an area of grass, free from vigorous weeds, that can be left to grow long and which has an existing population of native wildflowers that will flower and set seed year after year. Sadly, most home gardens haven't inherited a perfect wildflower meadow and will at the very least have to be introduced to new plants.
Soil fertility
As a rule of thumb wildflower meadows prefer poor, impoverished soil. This is mainly because it prevents coarser grasses such as Yorkshire fog and rye grass from competing with and swamping the flowers. If the proposed patch of ground has nettles growing on it, then this is a good indication that the ground is nutrient-rich and the fertility needs reducing; similarly if the ground has been enriched over the years with the use of fertilizer and organic matter such as garden compost. One possible option is to remove 4 to 6 inches of topsoil to expose the poorer subsoil underneath. However this is only really practical over a small area of the garden. Another option is to sow yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor) into the existing meadow in early fall. This semi-parasitic plant attaches to the roots of competing grasses, reducing their vigor.
Drainage
Excess moisture can also improve the soil's fertility. If your site is damp, drainage can be improved in small areas by digging sharp sand into the soil. However in large spaces it may be more practical to choose moisture-loving species such as snake's head fritillaries, which will thrive in damp meadow situations.
Perennial weeds
It is essential that persistent perennial weeds such as nettles and thistles are removed at the time of sowing or planting, or otherwise they may prove difficult to deal with later on.

How and when to water the garden
Many people ponder over how to water a garden. They may struggle over questions such as how much water should I give my garden or how often should I water a garden. Its really not as complicated as it seems, but there are some things that should be considered.
These include the type of soil you have, what your climate or weather is like, and the types of plants you are growing.
When to Water Gardens
When and how often should I water a garden While the general rule of thumb is about an inch or two of water each week with deep, infrequent watering as opposed to the more frequent shallow watering, this really depends on a number of factors.
First, consider your soil. Sandy soil is going to hold less water than heavier clay soil. Therefore, its going to dry out faster while the clay-like soil will hold moisture longer (and is more susceptible to over watering). This is why amending the soil with compost is so important. Healthier soil drains better but allows for some water retention too. Applying mulch is also a good idea, reducing watering needs.
Weather conditions determine when to water garden plants as well. If it is hot and dry, for example, youll have to water more often. Of course, in rainy conditions, little watering is needed.
Plants, too, dictate when and how often to water. Different plants have different watering needs. Larger plants need more water as do newly planted ones. Vegetables, bedding plants and many perennials have more shallow roots systems and also require more frequent watering, some dailyespecially in temps over 85 F. (29 C.). Most container plants need watering on a daily basis in hot, dry conditions  sometimes twice or even three times a day.
When to water gardens also includes the time of day. The most suitable time for watering is morning, which reduces evaporation, but late afternoon is okay as well provided you keep the foliage from getting wet, which can lead to fungal issues.
How Much Water needed
Deep watering encourages deeper and stronger root growth. Therefore, watering gardens about 2 inches or so once a week is preferable. Watering more often, but less deep, only leads to weaker root growth and evaporation.
Overhead sprinklers are often frowned upon, with exception to lawns, as these also lose more water to evaporation. Soaker hoses or drip irrigation is always better, going straight to the roots while keeping foliage dry. Of course, theres also the old standbyhand wateringbut since this is more time consuming, its best left for smaller garden areas and container plants.
Knowing when and how to water a garden correctly can ensure a healthy growing season with lush plants.

Improved, efficient train transport system: A distant reality
As the new budget slaps on even more taxes on vehicle imports, especially the smaller, economical vehicles, serious questions have been raised about the alternative transport options available for the public.
The two incidents connected to railway employees was a rude awakening for the authorities. For years regular commuters have been complaining about overcrowded trains, delays and the necessity to improve standards in bus and train services.
An improved and efficient transport system however seems a distant reality. Short staffed and underfunded, the railway system has a long way to go before many voluntarily opt to travel by train. It was only this year the Railway Department recruited 30 engine drivers, a much-needed addition.
Its a chicken an egg situation, if the Department is to improve, revenue has to go up, claims Transport Ministry Secretary, Nihal Samaraweera. But to increase revenue, more people have to use the service.
To attract more people, facilities need to be upgraded. Many are not willing to use the railway system because of the dilapidated condition of the service.
The government needs to improve the public transport system said Harsha Rodrigo, a regular train commuter.
Rodrigo, a government servant travels to Colombo for work from Polgahawela every day.
One frustrated commuter asked the government, which is proposing monorails to ease City traffic, to dream on.
After taking 26 train rides on two different lines in the last two and a half months, Akhry Ameer has experienced train delays on all his train rides. Twelve have been at least 20 minutes to 80 minutes behind schedule at the point of boarding, while arrival at final destinations on all train rides have been at least 10 minutes late. "I could write a PhD thesis based on common sense as to what ails our bus and train services, and why we avoid them, a rather annoyed Ameer claimed. We travel in overcrowded trains with hardly any air to breathe, he complained pointing out that commuters have been demanding for a long time, necessary changes to improve the standard of the transport services.
According to Samaraweera, increase in the tax imposed on vehicles is one of the initiatives taken by the government to control the vehicle congestion. That has no relation to the public transport system, he claims.
Often delays in the railway lines are caused by signal failure and technical issues, at times causing accidents. The spate of accidents last year, including the Pothuhera incident, which was widely believed to have been caused by signal failure, set off alarm bells regarding lack of safety measures and the need to upgrade the current system set up during the colonial period.
Samaraweera was quick to admit that there are issues pertaining to signal and engine failures. These are technical defects, he claimed. He said the ministry has recently submitted a Cabinet paper to upgrade facilities. The Railway Department needs nearly 15 locomotives to improve the system and added that it will take another one or two years to complete the process.
The initiatives taken by the Transport Ministry to improve services will take at least another two years to materialize. Several attempts to talk to Chief Controller, Ceylon Government Railways failed.
Samaraweera further said the government has allocated Rs. 1,500 million to improve the Kelani Valley Railway Line next year.
The ministry will focus on improving train facilities in the urban area. However, Samaraweera said the ministry has worked out a plan for a park and ride project in Colombo. Where the people can come in their private vehicles, park them and travel in luxurious buses within the city, he said. It will control congestion, stating it will be done with the participation of the private sector as well, adding that the government has allocated Rs. 1,000 million for the project.
It can be completed within a year, he said. It is with the mutual cooperation of the administrators and the public, that the optimum use of services and development of the country can be achieved, emphasized Samaraweera.

Govt's Duty To Provide alternate transport
If the government is imposing a tax on private vehicles, it is their responsibility to provide an alternative solution to the people, claimed Harsha Rodrigo, a government servant from Polgahawala.
K. A. Ajith
Measures should be taken to meet the demands of the people who face various issues in trains. People will choose to travel in their private vehicles rather than getting sandwiched in a huge crowd, he said. Stating that the inefficiency and irregularities of the public transport system have become an accepted norm. He claimed the government should increase the number of trains and train lines.
"The government must show some concern over the facilities provided to the people through public transport system. Trains are very convenient for the people to travel every day therefore it should be improved," claimed K. A. Ajith, a train commuter travelling from Matara. The trains always overcrowded and there is not enough space even to stand, he laments.
There are no signs allocating seats for clergy, pregnant women or disabled people, he claims. I had to get up and give a seat to a pregnant mother as I did not see any seats allocated separately for them. I was standing for more than one hour, he said.
Many blame the authorities for not taking proper action. The relevant authorities who are responsible to maintain the quality of the transport system do not come to check it. Sometimes, people smoke and play cards inside the trains causing inconvenience to the fellow passengers, claimed Nadeesha Ranasinghe, a private sector employee from Panadura.
Poor maintenance record of the train carriages and lethargic attitude of the train station employees inconvenience the passengers every day. Windows are broken, some cannot be opened and some others cannot be closed properly. When the crowd in the train increases, there is hardly any air to breath, said Ranasinghe.
Pointing out the defects in the railways, she said the toilets are dirty and the doors never lock. When the train jerks the doors automatically opens. Slow trains scheduled before express trains, Ranasinghe highlighted that lack of a proper system often results in chaos in the Fort Railway station. People run here and there pushing each other when the officials fail to announce the particular platform on time creating confusion.
There are access issues also, not all can climb staircases - specially elders, the sick and pregnant mothers are inconvenienced, Ranasinghe observed.
Beggars in the trains is another problem passengers face. They shout in filth at the passengers if they fail to give them money. A person who is traveling in a train will be mentally disturbed when facing similar incidents, she claimed adding that previous government promised to speed up coastal line but the speed was increased only by few minutes.
Samanmalee Senanayake, a private sector employee, is often forced to stand for over two hours on her daily train ride from Ambalangoda to Colombo. She takes the train to work every day in an overcrowded train, she claims.
If I don't get one I will have to stand for more than two hours, Senanayake claimed. She added that there are no toilet facilities in the long distance trains with power sets. Senanayake said women are sometimes harassed by men when traveling in the overcrowded trains adding that it is a serious problem for women travelling daily in trains.

'Assaulted driver not under influence of liquor but sick'
W. N. Gunawardene
A passenger has been arrested in connection with the assault of an engine driver at the Ragama railway station recently.
The Police Department revealed that a court order will also be taken to obtain the unedited video clips of the incident from private television channels. According to Police, the passengers on board a train bound for Rambukkana staged a protest after the engine driver refused to proceed beyond the Ragama station. They alleged that the driver was under the influence of liquor. However, Ragama Police and Transport Ministry confirmed that the driver was not under the influence of liquor.
Train services on the main line were restored after the train in question was taken back to the Fort Railway station by another driver who came from the Dematagoda yard. Passengers of other trains bound to Kandy and Anuradhapura were also stranded for over three hours due to the protest.
Police sources said the passengers dispersed after they assured the passengers that the driver in question had not been under the influence of liquor. Transport Ministry Secretary Nihal Samaraweera said he had called for a report from the Railways General Manager regarding the tense situation which erupted at the Ragama Railway station. However, Railways General Manager Vijaya Amaratunga denied that a separate report was to be submitted. Amaratunga said commuters had assaulted the train driver under the impression that he was under the influence of liquor. The doctor who examined the driver, had reported that the driver was incapacitated due to high blood pressure.
He emphasized that commuters had acted in a violent and provocative manner assaulting the driver. In addition, a spokesman for the Engine Drivers' Association, K. A. U. Kothasinghe also said the driver was sick and not under the influence of liquor and condemned the commuters for assaulting a railway employee.
The situation further deteriorated when the train was stopped, without moving from the station, said Samaraweera.
Emphasizing that halting the train at Ragama was timely, engine driver W. N. Gunawardene said if the driver had halted the train in some other station before Ragama, there would have been a huge block.
The Ragama Railway station is a large one and alternative solutions could be taken to avoid inconvenience, Samaraweera said. Stating that he was not fully aware of the incident and added that decisions will be taken after the report is submitted in two days.
An engine driver who wished to remain anonymous said the driver had informed the control office from Kelaniya about his condition.
Driving a train is not a one-man show, it is a chain and several people are involved in it. One person cannot be blamed for inconvenience caused to the people, he said condemning the action of the commuters who assaulted the driver. According to Kothasinghe the driver had retired and was now employed on a contract basis. When Samaraweera was questioned why a retired driver was employed on contract, he said the railways authority faced a shortage of drivers.
Samaraweera said nearly 30 drivers were recently recruited after 10 years and more people will be recruited in the near future, adding that the newly recruited drivers have to be given a minimum of a year's training.
Responding as to why train drivers were not recruited for the past 10 years, he said the Railways union expressed displeasure over recruiting new drivers demanding that they should undergo a minimum training of five years.
He pointed out that nowhere in the world a train driver trained for five years and said even pilots are trained only for one year.
Gunawardene explained that drivers were taken on contract as there was a shortage of train drivers.
As they have to undergo five years training, which is a long process, has necessitated the need to recruit drivers who were still able to drive. Samaraweera assured that delays were not common occurrences.

Incredible SANGAM
India can well speak of an age-old cultural tradition. Their culture has evolved centuries. That was well proven recently at Nelum Pokuna Theatre when Indian High Commission and Cultural Affairs Ministry jointly presented Sangam, Festival of India.
What unfolded at the Nelum Pokuna was the first in the series of events held to celebrate the cultural liaison between Sri Lanka and India. Termed as 'Nrityarupa,' the festival offered a mosaic of Indian dance forms.
Nrityarupa was a collective effort of Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. Six dance forms, which stand for India's cultural diversity, had been specially chosen for the festival: Bharatanatyam from southern India, Kathak, previously the dance form of the north, Odissi, from Odisha in eastern India, Manipuri from the north-eastern state of Manipur, Kathakali from Kerala at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula, and Chhau covering a wide area of India's eastern states.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga handed awards of merit to the artistes of the performance. Indian High Commissioner Y K Sinha accompanied the former President to hand over the awards. A number of diplomats also graced the occasion.
Other events for Festival of India include the participation of Indian authors and a performance by singer Sonam Kalra and her brainchild, Sonam Kalra and the Sufi Gospel Project, at the Galle Literary Festival in January 2016.
A musical performance will also be held in January 2016 to celebrate the Republic Day of India. Two exhibitions, 'Digital India' and 'Cricket Connects' will be held in February 2016. (SM)

Interfaith climate pilgrims hand petition to UN ahead of COP21
FRANCE: Hundreds of people from around the world gathered in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, on Saturday to give a climate justice petition signed by over a million to the UN climate chief ahead of the COP21 conference.
The so-called climate pilgrims included Catholics, Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Protestants -- representing the world's major religions and their call for action to save the Earth from the devastating effects of climate change.
The petition signed by 1,780,528 citizens worldwide was given to Christiana Figueres, in charge of climate issues at the United Nations, along with Nicolas Hulot, French President Francois Hollande's special envoy for the planet.
In their name, we call for a drastic reduction of carbon emissions and for the rich countries to help the poorer ones facing climatic changes, said Brazilian cardinal Claudio Hummes.
The time has come. Let us pray and act for climate justice, he said to huge applause from the crowd.
An emotional Figueres thanked the climate pilgrims, saying that despite differences, we can all unite as human beings to respond together to this challenge, which world leaders will address at the COP21 conference that opens Monday near Paris.
The goal is to limit average global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), perhaps less, over pre-Industrial Revolution levels by curbing fossil fuel emissions blamed for climate change.

A Life Of Dance & Drama
As the founder of nATANDA Dance Company and as a successful dancer, what does dancing mean to you
Dance is my whole life. It allows me to be myself. As I was teaching Russian and German at the Kelaniya University, I felt I was missing something in my life and then I said good bye to that career and started dancing again. I think I made the right decision for me to do what I love to do. Dance has changed my whole life and it has helped me in so many ways to engage in the community to make my life more meaningful. I feel that I am doing something for others who have the same dream as me. Dance allows me to change my perspective in life and it teaches me how to have a balance life.
What would you say to a young person interested in learning to dance
I would say discipline, commitment, respect, will make your great dancer. First do not think about how much you earn, first think about how much you can learn first. And commit yourself to do what you love to do. And also learn to work on time.
Could you tell us about how people of Colombo, Jaffna, Batticoloa, of different regions and races, and from different countries, came together to perform at nATFEST 2015
nATANDA has done so many contemporary dance workshops around the Island and mostly out of Colombo for last couple of years. These workshops gave us so much experiences to work with so many different people of different social backgrounds, especially youngsters. And for us to learn from them was so enriching. We made unforgettable memories and our workshop created great bonds with people, because our primary language was dance and it is non-verbal. So the whole point of nATFEST was to bring different ethnic groups and religious groups together. And simply to reconnect and engage with everybody, to learn how to make a better world with arts and culture, where every person is accepted for who they are. Contemporary dance is a great way of enjoying this freedom of expression.
What do you think is the future of dance in Sri Lanka
I think Sri Lanka is now waiting to see a new generation come up with new talent for dance. And I believe that we have so much talent in this country. As the founder of Sri Lanka's first professional contemporary dance company, I am so happy that we have come a long way with our work and we have got mostly international recognition. And now nATANDA is reaching out more towards the community and we see great potential from new rising dancers in nATANDA. I am also very proud to say that we have created a different dimension in the dance field in Sri Lanka. I am pretty sure that nATFEST will hoist our flag in other parts of the world with contemporary dance. I'm glad to say you'll see more surprises at nATFEST 2016 and I hope everyone will join us on that journey.

Life returns to Syrian town after IS ousted
SYRIA: Outside her home in a town of northeast Syria, four-year-old Baydaa scribbles on a leaflet of religious rules left behind by the Islamic State group as they fled earlier this month.
Her face is adorned with make-up of the sort banned by the jihadist group, which was expelled from Al-Hol by a new US-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab forces that overran the area on November 12.
The town was once a key waystation for IS between the territory it holds in Iraq and Syria, and its capture was a strategic victory for the new Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) coalition.
But it is also a chance for residents to breathe easy again.
My little daughter Baydaa has put kohl on her eyes and make-up on her face, which was forbidden when the organisation was here, said Baydaa's father, Hamdan Ahmed, referring to IS.
I'm so happy not to see them in our village anymore, the 39-year-old told AFP.
When IS seized Al-Hol two years earlier, Ahmed refused to leave his home in the Al-Shallal suburb of the town.
As a result, he was forced to abide by the group's strict rules based on their harsh interpretation of Islam.
Women were forced to cover up completely, and men to keep their faces unshaved.
Parents were ordered to send children under the age of 12 to religious schools run by IS to avoid punishment or being whipped, the father-of-nine told AFP.
Elsewhere in the suburb, on the dusty sandy outskirts of the town, 42-year-old Mariam fed a small herd of sheep by a row of mud houses, including her own modest home.
We left the village during the fighting after shells landed in our food store. We lost grain for the sheep, lentils and flour and were left with nothing to eat, she said.
Even though the jihadist group is now far from her home, Mariam is still afraid they may return and covers her face with her headscarf when speaking to strangers.
She wears a long colourful dress that is traditional in the conservative region, but would not have met the strictures of IS.
When IS was here, any woman who left home without a face veil and black robes would face whipping, she said.
With IS gone, local residents who survive mostly on agriculture and livestock, are trickling back to check on their homes and their land.
For two years, I couldn't sow my land because Daesh prevented us from leaving the areas under its control to get what we needed, like seeds and oil for agricultural machinery, said 44-year-old Hamid Nasser, using the Arabic acronym for IS.
The capture of Al-Hol and the surrounding villages was the first major victory for the SDF, an alliance of the powerful Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and Arab and Christian armed opposition groups.
The alliance is backed by the US-led coalition fighting IS, and has received air drops of American weapons to support its fight against the jihadists.
Al-Hol in particular was considered a strategic win for the group, severing a key route used by IS between its territories in Iraq and Syria.
In the town, IS's slogans and strictures can still be seen, particularly those encouraging religious practice and the wearing of the veil.
Sister in niqab, how wonderful and beautiful you are in your chastity, reads one.
On barber's shops, signs still hang reading Dear brothers, shaving or trimming the beard is forbidden.
And on walls are slogans including: In the Caliphate, there are no bribes, no corruption and no nepotism.
For the SDF, the challenge now is to secure the approximately 200 towns and villages, some of them home to no more than a dozen people, that it has captured from IS in recent weeks and set up a new local administration.
While the SDF is dominated by Kurdish fighters, the region where the force is advancing is majority-Arab, raising potential sensitivities.
Elsewhere, the YPG has faced charges of discrimination against Arab residents, with Amnesty International last month accusing it of war crimes in north and northeast Syria.
The rights group claimed Kurdish forces had carried out a deliberate, coordinated campaign of collective punishment of civilians in villages previously captured by IS.
The YPG dismissed those claims and has pointed to its strong ties with some Arab militias to ridicule allegations of discrimination.
SDF spokesman Talal Ali Sello told AFP that civilians were being allowed to return to captured areas after they were cleared of explosives, which IS frequently sows in areas before it retreats.
He said his forces are working on the creation of a political body tied to a military entity that will oversee the liberated areas in the coming period.

[COURTESY CORNER] When the world shows empathy and fights doggedly for childrens rights
Looking after our little ones!
Friday November 20 was United Nations Universal Childrens Day. It was first established in 1954 to promote international unity and awareness amongst and about children worldwide.
UNICEF, the United Nations Childrens Fund, promotes and coordinates this special day, which also works towards improving childrens welfare. On December 14, 1954, the resolution 836 (IX) of the General Assembly encouraged the establishment of this day across many countries, in order to promote the ideals and objectives of the Charter and the welfare of the children of the world. The date chosen (20th of November) marks two important events in terms of establishing childrens rights. The first event was when the Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959, and the second event was the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989. This year it was celebrated under the theme: A Benevolent Land that Dazzles the World with Child Friendly Environment.
Issuing a message for World Childrens Day, President Maithripala Sirisena said the unconditional responsibility for the protection of children lies with the entire nation. In his hard-hitting statement the president lamented that recently reported incidents show that the responsibility of protecting children has been shirked by society. He said that the problem should be rectified immediately and provisions must be made to implement laws and introduce new laws, or amend existing laws.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes communiqu on the occasion stressed that it behoved all society to protect and shield children by understanding their mindset. He reiterated that treating them with loving care, buffering them against suffering and pressure directed from society and family and strengthening them to face challenges of life was a primary consideration. He added that sheltering children against disasters and abuse has become a grave responsibility cast on parents and elders.
The occasion also allows the discussion of children's rights in conjunction with the sustainable development goals. Goals such as poverty reduction, health, education, sanitation and equality are all important not only for sustainable development but also for children's rights and well-being.
True, not all of us can look back on our childhood as the most joyous time of our lives. The more privileged among us are perhaps unaware that millions of children in our own nation as well as in many undeveloped countries elsewhere are subjected to untold hardships from the time they come squealing into the world. Their parents too in many parts of the universe struggle with their own problems such as lack of health care, financial insecurity and abuse. The idea of a Universal Childrens Day was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1954 to protect children working long hours in dangerous circumstances and provide all of them with access to an education.
Nearly 25 years ago, the world made a promise to children. That we would do everything in our power to protect and promote their rights to survive and thrive, to learn and grow, to make their voices heard and to reach their full potential. In spite of the overall gains, there are many children who have fallen even further behind. Old challenges have combined with new problems to deprive many children of their rights and the benefits of development. To meet these challenges, and to reach those children and helpless elders in society who are hardest to reach, we need new ways of thinking and new innovative strategies. There is much to celebrate as we mark the 25th anniversary of the Convention, from declining infant mortality to rising school enrolment, but this historic milestone must also serve as an urgent reminder that much remains to be done.
And what about the children we have sworn to nurture and protect Are we focusing enough on child labour, which refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful Forced labour in general takes different forms, including debt bondage, human trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. The most vulnerable victims are young women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage and sweatshop or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing. Children everywhere hold the key to the future of a country. It is the responsibility of every single person to safeguard children.
UNICEF estimates that over half of the 30,000 child sex workers in Sri Lanka are boys. Does this not sound the alarm that we are increasingly on the way to earning the shameful reputation of becoming a nation of perverts, pederasts and paedophiles It is because of our silence that these depravities will continue.
All Sri Lankan voices should be heard to boom with outrage against such abuse of our children. Remember that our children should be considered more precious resources than the nations gold reserves.
Here in Sri Lanka a senseless conflict which raged for nearly 30 years has taken a devastating toll on thousands of families.
Now with the war six years behind us there must be a concerted effort to help this unfortunate segment of the population to ensure their basic survival.
Have we given a single thought to the orphans of war and the victims of natural disasters who have never felt the touch of a mothers love Or of a family which has lost its breadwinner father and protector and is struggling to survive
Everyone, regardless of their sundry spiritual beliefs, should reflect on the needs of these dispossessed widows, children and the old and infirm from both sides of the ethnic divide.
That is because they have all been pursued by the remorseless furies of terror, bereavement, bloodshed and brutality.
Among them are the swarms of orphaned children, those forsaken waifs and strays of war whose predicament should inflame the empathy and heartfelt emotions of every decent soul.

Megacities and urbanization in South Asia
This essay is prepared on behalf of the General Research Committee (GRC) of Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science (SLAAS) based on an Address delivered on October 15 organized by National Academy of Sciences Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Economic Association and the Institute of Town Planners Sri Lanka.
The last quarter of the Twentieth Century brought into prominence three important global realities. The first was about the severity and worsening state of the earth's bio-physical environment. The second concerned a process which is now generally referred to as globalization. The third reality had to do with the rapidity of urbanization currently taking place with particular intensity in the Third World Countries (TWCs). Thus it has come about that current and future development work in these countries should take cognizance of these realities. Most of the TWCs have little control over the first two realities.
The scale and pace of current urbanization is recognized as being unprecedented in human history. Urbanization and its consequences are most prominently manifest today in the TWCs. The Global Network of Science Academies recently placed population growth coupled with unplanned urbanization among the ten most serious global concerns. That important apex body of worldwide scientific institutions identified the necessity to develop and implement urban planning policies that internalize consumption needs and demographic trends to reap the benefits of sustainable urban living (IAP, 2012).
The gravity of urbanization and its impact on human habitat in the Third World had been anticipated even in the 1960s by a few eminent scholars and a landmark book was published on the subject (Abrams, 1964). On a call from a South Asian Prime Minister (Premadasa, 1980), the UN declared 1986 as the Year of Shelter and then went further to launch a global campaign under the slogan Shelter for all by the year 2000'. A UN agency subsequently predicted that during the period 1990-2020 the bulk of the world's population will be urbanized; that Asian cities alone will contain more than half that population; and this will mean that 1.5 billion people will be added to the urban centers of Asia (ESCAP, 1993). Despite considerable efforts to confront the adversities of urbanization, the TWCs have seen no breakthroughs.
This paper is based on a review of the planning literature covering the origins, growth and development of those concepts and theories which have already had, or could have influence in dealing with urbanization in the Third World. Its main purpose is to discuss the need to anticipate rapid urbanization and holistically deal with the attendant problems that are likely to be caused in the country of prime concern here, namely, that of Sri Lanka.
The nature of the problem
The rapid growth of urban populations in the TWCs is the result of natural increase and also, importantly, rural migrations to cities. These migrations are a consequence of extreme rural poverty coupled with the very poor access that most of these rural folk have to basic needs and social infrastructure in most TWCs. The entire urbanization process is seen by some scholars as one that helps the emancipation of under-privileged rural migrants and also supports economic growth through the provision of labour for industrial production.
Bustees in Bangladesh, Dhaka
The migratory targets of urbanization in these countries are usually those larger urban areas all of which already are, or likely to become megacities'. The fact however is that rural migrants also face serious problems even in their eventual urban destinations. These include the inadequacy of shelter and access to basic services and appropriate employment opportunities. They, by their increasingly large urban presence cause severe and unabated stresses on the limited infrastructure facilities available to other city dwellers. Consequent to this type of urbanization, substantial and seemingly insoluble problems must be anticipated within these cities, if not already present in considerable measure.
Many planners grappling with urbanization issues in the TWCs do not confront the subject directly and in its entirety. They focus their attention only on its resultant urban impacts which are within the affected cities themselves. Some of the typical theoretical writings which support such limited actions tend to lay stress upon the urgent need for radical planning to support participation by often large, disenfranchised segments of urban and urbanizing populations. This focus was seen, for example, in the discussions: on squatter settlements in Latin America (Turner and Fichter, 1972); more recently on anti-eviction campaigns within the Western Cape in South Africa (Miraftab, 2009); and, still more recently on the stubborn realities of informal settlements in the global south (Watson, 2012). Even when dealing directly with urbanization, reliance is invariably placed on intra-urban interventions through the various professional disciplines concerned with urban planning. The solutions are consequently and inevitably based upon guiding the expansion of impacted cities in one way or other, often involving the planning and building of satellite towns in the vicinity of those cities. The predominant intellectual material which underpins the attempts to manage urbanization in this particular manner originated in the West a century ago.
Slums in Pakistan, Orangi, Karachi
Slums in Pakistan, Orangi, Karachi
Rural out-migration impacts not only upon cities that receive the migrants but also upon the rural hinterlands they left behind. It does so quite adversely in that agriculture is increasingly deprived of manpower and thus subject to continuing neglect. There are also studies which strive to predict the consequences of horizontal urban expansions due to rapid urbanization and their likely spatial impact on rural land.
The main prediction in one such recent study which was based on the assumption of continuing current trends, suggests the tripling of urban land cover worldwide within the next three decades with a notably adverse impact upon biodiversity (Seto et al, 2012). That study also indicated that the main biodiversity hotspots likely to be affected by these trends are in the Third World with many being in South Asia.
Urbanization and South Asia
There were 23 very large cities worldwide in 2011, each with more than 10 million people. Asia had 12 with South Asia alone having 5 of these megacities'. Three of them were in India, one in Pakistan and one in Bangladesh. The South Asian total is predicted to increase from 5 to 8 megacities by 2025 (UN, 2012). The urban populations and urbanization rates may be gleaned from Table presented above.
Shanties in Sri Lanka, Colombo
According to these estimates, Sri Lanka and Nepal have low proportions of urban populations, these being respectively 15.1% and 16.2%, as compared to 31.3% in India. The Real GDP Growth in 2012 of Sri Lanka was relatively high, estimated at 6.4%, while in Nepal it was estimated at a relatively low figure of 4.6% (World Bank, 2012). Urbanization, though not an immediately pressing problem within Sri Lanka, could indeed become so in the near future.
Indigenous South Asian coverage of urbanization in its demographic aspects and urban socio-economic impacts is extensive and very competent. These studies reveal that the larger urban areas receive far more rural migrants, with the largest cities gaining the bulk. The South Asian megacities experience immense difficulties. Many scholars are seriously concerned that the often illiterate and unskilled rural families who gravitate to large cities to escape rural poverty, eventually become trapped in squalid and insanitary urban environments of deprivation, malnutrition and endemic disease; that their sheer numbers cause un-relievable stresses on scarce urban infrastructure and services; and, that those cities cannot generate employment opportunities to sustain the massive and continuing influx of migrants. Thus, these megacities with their inevitable slums are becoming increasingly unmanageable and unsustainable.
Urbanization and Sri Lanka
With low urbanization, most scholars in Sri Lanka have hitherto not seen the subject as worthy of much attention in our context. Consequently, there are some important misconceptions found in the media, both favorable and unfavorable to urbanization. It seems necessary therefore to clarify at least one important misconception. It concerns the relationship between urbanization and economic growth. Although high growth in per capita GDP is associated with high urbanization in many TWCs, it is incorrect to assume a very direct causal relationship between them. For, it is far more likely that the comparatively high levels of poverty and inadequate access to social infrastructure facilities, prevalent realities in the rural sectors of most TWCs, are perhaps the real causes of rural-urban migration. Urbanization needs to be seen as the result of sharp differentials in living standards, income levels and the availability of opportunities for the youth that often exist between the rural and urban sectors. The mistaken view that urbanization can become a driver of growth has to be clarified and contradicted. The blinkered pursuit of economic growth by increasing GDP per capita without at least an equal concern for inclusive growth, equity and distributive social justice, may be seen as the main driver of high urbanization.
Urbanization and Colombo
The statistics indicate that in most TWCs urbanization is directed mainly to the larger urban centres. In each of the smaller TWCs, only one city, usually the capital, is impacted by urbanization. Historically, it is Colombo that has grown by urbanization although for many decades that growth has been slow. Nevertheless, Colombo already has its share of slums. With the military victory over the separatist terrorists in mid-2009 which brought to an end the 30-year war, the circumstances may have begun to change. The recent investments in Colombo's infrastructure, the beautification of the city and recent ongoing concerns to prepare and implement a comprehensive plan for the city are indeed welcome. These and the proposal to make a massive investment on a plan to extend the central business district of Colombo into the sea will, if successfully implemented bring about higher economic growth. However, these efforts may very well cause the city of Colombo to be impacted by urbanization on a scale hitherto unknown.
It would be appropriate at this point to quote an extract from my article entitled Our Urban Future published in the centre page of the Daily News newspaper on the first day of the new millennium (15 years ago). The quotation anticipates the possibility of rapid urbanization in our country, and runs as follows:
We in Sri Lanka have been insulated from the problem. For this we must thank the wisdom of our political leadership of the 1930s. The impetus they gave to domestic food production, dry zone colonization and rural development have helped us immensely. However, our unique situation in relation to Asian urbanization is predicted (here) to change very soon for many reasonsWe now have to awaken from the dream of a predominantly rural Sri Lanka continuing into the future.
The spatial impact of globalization on Sri Lanka needs also to be anticipated. Transnational corporations and other foreign enterprises that we want desperately to invest here will mostly opt to locate in and around Colombo, for many reasons. Thus an agglomeration in this region of businesses and industries may be expected on an unprecedented scale in the near future, regardless of our personal likes and dislikes. Rural migrations to Colombo will inadvertently but definitely be encounteredthe full impact of urbanization will have to be taken by Colombo...The end to the on-going war, which we all seek, will seriously aggravate the problem
Without timely and concerted efforts based on a comprehensive plan, the past growth of Colombo has consistently outstripped all the sectoral and ad hoc attempts to upgrade its physical infrastructure. Needless to say, the first four of the five plans prepared for Colombo with the best of intentions over the past Century, but not implemented, have become obsolete. This has happened with urban growth mainly by natural increase in population. Compounded by migration estimated even at optimistically low rates, the future scenario for the unplanned growth of Colombo is indeed gloomy. The steady spread of shanties over vacant private and public land including reservations, parks and playgrounds; low density suburban sprawl and the filling of eco-sensitive low-lying land and the denudation of upland tree cover in the urban periphery; water shortages, sewer system failures, frequent floods and epidemics; worsening traffic jams; increased pollution of the air and water bodies; mounds and fields of rotting garbage; and increasing lawlessness and crimes both petty and violent are likely to be common features in the urban life of Colombo, as they are in some other Third World cities. If this ugly vision is not to become a reality we shall have to act wisely and fast.
The theories
The study being presented here is based upon an earlier review of planning literature about the origins and development of the concepts and theories which have influenced or are relevant to urbanization in the TWCs (Gunaratna, 2014). It will not be within the scope of this article to discuss in detail these theories except to briefly mention those that are irrelevant to us and those that are more relevant.
That review revealed that there are basically two very different sets of theories: a set of utopian concepts from the late 19thcentury Britain and early 20thcentury Continental Europe which forms the base of most current planning approaches adopted in South Asia; and,a set of more scientifically rigorous theories some of which could underlie a far more relevant approach to the problems of urbanization in the TWCs. The latter theories, also of Western origin, are an integral part of the sub-discipline generally known as Spatial Economics.
The Utopian concepts
The particular solutions based on utopian concepts are intended to guide the expansion of impacted cities. The intellectual underpinnings are British from a century ago. The resulting models are still being used to deal with urbanization in the South Asian region. There is an obvious question of their relevance. The scale of current urbanization in the Indian sub-continent is of a different order of magnitude from its manifestation in Britain where the popular utopian concept was first envisioned. This is clear when one notes that the total urban population of England and Wales in 1901 was 25.1 million (Hicks and Allen, 1999). The current urban population of India grows by double that figure every five years.
A serious researcher discussing the development of Navi Mumbai (New Bombay )which is the latest of Mumbai's satellite towns, observed that:
In the 1960s and 1970s, Asian urban development policies centered on slowing down the rate of urbanization. Satellite towns and greenbelts have been among the most widely adopted means to achieve this. However,(they) have proved to be ineffectualThe development of New Bombay is a reflection of many of the problems that have beset satellite-town building in Asia. (Shaw, 1995)

[PARLIAMENT - (30-11-2015)]
Dullas hails proposal to grant land to the deprived
PM praised for always being in Parliament:
The proposal to grant plots of land to deprived people is a commendable move in the budget proposals, opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma said.
"Nobody can criticise such a move," Alahapperuma said. "The proposal to construct housing schemes for the estate sector is also equally commendable."
He made these observations joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals on Saturday. Alahapperuma brought to the notice of the Chair that relevant ministers are not present in Parliament at a time when the budget proposal is being debated.
He also appreciated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for always being present in Parliament.
However this budget has more negative aspects than constructive ones, the MP said.
He added that although the government stated that allocations made for the education and health sectors are 5.4 percent and three percent from the GDP, the actual allocations are very less.
"The allocations for recurrent expenditure in each heads are included in the buildings owned by those ministries," MP Alahapperuma said. " The actual allocation for education is 0.05 percent from the GDP."
This budget has proposed to collect a non tax revenue. It is 378 billion, the MP said.
He added that the government has to privatise many institutions to collect non tax revenue.
"There is a rumour that there is a move to sell Lanka Hospitals and Hilton Hotel," the MP said.
Immediate action to fill Education Administrative Service vacancies - Akila
Immediate measures will be taken to fill the vacancies in the Education Administrative Service, said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
The minister made these observations responding to a question by UPFA Matara district MP Dullas Alahapperuma on Saturday.
There are more than 850 vacancies in the country's education administrative service and we are waiting for the recommendation of the Public Service Commission to fill these vacancies. Measures will be taken to fill these vacancies after recommendations from the Public Services Commission, Kariyawasam said.
He said the vacancies were prevailing since the previous regime.
Budget allocated funds for development of all sectors - Palitha
Power and Energy Deputy Minister Palitha Range Bandara told Parliament on Saturday that Budget 2016 has allocated funds for the development of all sectors.
He made these comments joining in the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the sixth allotted day.
State income has reduced due to the absence of profit making institutions. From this Budget, the government has taken measures to make tax revisions. A digital card system has also been introduced for tax payers to make it easy to recognise people who do not pay taxes. Measure have also been taken to reduce the price of infant milk powder and protect children, he said.
Budget 2016 has also provided relief for the people to uplift their living standards. Provisions have also been made to create a better market opportunity for local producers as well as to attract foreign investors, the deputy minister said.
He also appreciated the measures proposed in the budget for the establishment of investment zones as it will help find a solution for the unemployment problem of the country.
Budget proposals 2016 has been made without any class discrimination. This has been proved by the abolition of vehicle permits granted under different schemes including Parliamentarians, he said.
IUSF reps did not accept govt invitation for talks - Kiriella
Inter University Students' Federation representatives did not accept the government invitation for discussions but continued their protest on Friday evening, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament on Saturday.
The minister said he invited several representatives of the protesters to meet him and waited until 6.30 p.m. on Friday.
"But nobody came to meet me," the minister said.
He made these observations in Parliament after the round of questions for oral answers.
Kiriella said the government was ready to discuss issues with students.
He added that students are allowed to engage in peaceful marches.
Large sum allocated for education sector - Chandrani
This government has allocated a large sum for the education sector since the President and the Prime Minister genuinely love the children of the country, Child and Women's Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said on Saturday.
The minister made this observation in Parliament joining the second reading debate on the budget proposal.
She said a budget cannot be formulated to please everybody.
Bandara said if the government needed only to please the people, it could have designed one with false pledges like during previous governments.
This government genuinely needs to develop the country to bring benefits to the people on the long run, the minister said. The allocations made for the education sector is vehemently criticised by the opposition.
She said allocations have been made for teacher training, infrastructure facilities for schools and to construct teachers' quarters in distant schools.
Bandara said as there are no teachers' quarters, teachers are reluctant to go to distant schools.
Rs. 7,500 million has been allocated to provide a nutritional pack for pregnant mothers,
the minister said.
During the previous regime seeds were provided to people but it was a failure, she said.
Budget has positive and negative aspects - Srisneshan
Tamil National Alliance Parliamentarian Gnanamuttu Srisneshan told Parliament on Saturday that the Budget 2016 has both positive and negative aspects.
He made these comments participating in the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the sixth allotted day.
Srisneshan appreciated the Budget proposals 2016 to reduce the prices of essential food items, build 1,000 houses in each electorate, increase the liquor manufacturing license fee, increase private sector salaries by Rs. 2,500, strengthening child protection activities of the country, giving a certified price for paddy, etc.
The MP also said the government should take measures to protect the rice produced by farmers by enhancing storage facilities.
He said the government should take measures to encourage local producers before taking measures to attract foreign investors.
The people in the North and East expected relief as well as solutions for the problems faced by them. But the Budget proposals 2016 has not addressed these issues. Measures should be taken by the government to develop infrastructure facilities of the North and East and provide a permanent solution to the human  elephant conflict. People in our area voted for this government hoping for a better change in their lives, the MP said.
He said the government should take prompt action to solve the unemployment problem of the North and East youth.
The MP said as a solution to unemployed graduates, the education authorities should take measures to change the school curriculum to produce qualified youths for job opportunities available in the country.
He also added that the Tamil people in the country expect good governance.
Political party supporters' attitude should be changed - Lakshman
Badulla district Parliamentarian Lakshman Seneviratne told Parliament on Saturday that the attitude of grassroots level supporters of political parties should be changed to avoid conflicts among them.
He made these comments participating in the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the sixth allotted day.
All parliamentarians of the present National Unity government work in a friendly manner. We should send that message to the village level to avoid political conflicts among our supporters, Seneviratne said.
He said the government cannot present a budget that satisfies each and every citizen of the country.
"There could be some shortcomings in the budget," the MP said.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime could not introduce a pension scheme for the private sector. The majority of the people in this country wanted to find state sector jobs mainly because of the pension. This attitude of the people will change with the introduction of a pension scheme for the private sector, he said.
Seneviratne added that the introduction of the school uniform material voucher will enable to avoid financial corruption.
"But it is necessary to monitor whether these vouchers will be used only to purchase the uniform material. Large scale corruption relating to school uniform material distribution occurred during the previous regime."
He also proposed that the tax imposed on electric vehicles should be reduced as they are environment friendly vehicles.
Masses benefit under national government - Amaraweera
The people in the country have benefitted due to the national government, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He made this observation joining the second reading debate on the budget proposal for next year in Parliament on Saturday.
The minister said the GSP plus facility and fisheries export were banned during the reign of the previous government.
"Due to the change of the government on January 8 and August 17, the situation has changed," Amaraweera said. "We expect we would be able to get these two facilities by the end of this year."
Minister Amaraweera said this government as well as the budget is a novel experience. "We accept that is not the perfect proposal but it has more constructive features," he said. "But the opposition never sees the constructive features."
He said a country needs foreign investments for development.
Amaraweera said the budget has proposals to encourage foreign investments.
New laws should be drafted to eradicate wastage, corruption - Opp Leader
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said in Parliament Friday, that Budget 2016 presented by the Finance Minister aimed at addressing the economic crisis of the country, but new laws should be drafted to eradicate wastage and corruption.
Corruption needs to be eliminated with a firm hand and need special laws to deal with this menace, the Opposition Leader said.
He made this observation at the commencement of the Second Reading Debate on the Budget Proposals for the fifth allotted day.
This country was ruled by one family for a period of time and a family member of that family took all the decisions. But today, both the UNP and the SLFP has formed a strong government," he said.
The Opposition Leader also said the countrys exports should be enhanced.
Ceylon tea was the best in the world and Ceylon tea had a wide market in Europe and Arab countries.
Sri Lankan Missions abroad should play a pivotal role in finding market opportunities. We should not find market opportunities in the European market only, but should also address market opportunities in nearby countries, specially in India. India has a 300 million population and local production in India was not enough to fulfill the countrys requirements.
Market opportunities available in India would be helpful to attract investments to our country, he said.
He also said that the Rajapaksa regime was not interested in enhancing the living conditions of people in the North and East. So they expect the present government to fulfill their needs.
The attitudes and thinking of the preset government is different from the previous government. But there has been no change in the lives of the people. They continuously suffer severe hardships even after six years after the ending of the war. They want to live with dignity and self respect in a united and undivided country. They like to contribute to the development of the country.
So there is a comprehensive need for an urgent action to uplift the living standards of people in the North and the East by giving them opportunities to made their contribution towards the development of the country. He said.
Paying his condolence to the family, relatives and friends of the 17 year-old-boy from Jaffna who committed suicide by jumping in front of a moving train, he said that this act demonstrated the frustration of the people in the North and the East undergo.
The government should think deeply about the message of this young boy.

Queen Elizabeth II thanks Trudeau for making her Feel Old
MALTA: Queen Elizabeth II on Saturday wrapped up a nostalgic visit to Malta, her one-time home, where she joked that Canadas youthful new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had made her feel old.
The British monarch has close ties to the Mediterranean island, where she lived between 1949 and 1951 while her husband, Prince Philip, was in the Royal Navy. On Friday the monarch opened a summit of the 53-nation Commonwealth of Britain and many of its former colonies.
She was toasted at a banquet by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose father Pierre governed Canada for more than a decade from 1968. Trudeau recalled the monarchs many visits to his country, saying she had seen more of Canada than most Canadians.
The queen thanked 43-year-old Trudeau for making me feel so old. At 89, the queen has given up long-haul travel so is unlikely to attend the next biennial Commonwealth gathering, which is held in a different nation each time.
Her stature and enthusiasm have helped unite a diverse, diffuse organization whose member nations are home to more than 2 million people on five continents. The Commonwealth espouses good governance, economic growth and human rights but has often struggled to define its role in the world. Commonwealth leaders also selected British politician Patricia Scotland as the organizations next secretary-general. Scotland, who was born in the Caribbean nation of Dominica, was Attorney General under British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and is now a member of the House of Lords.

Three dead in rocket attack on UN Mali base
MALI: Two United Nations peacekeepers and a civilian contractor were killed Saturday in a rocket attack on a UN base in northern Mali claimed by the jihadist Ansar Dine group, which the Security Council warned could be a war crime.
Some 20 people were also wounded in the pre-dawn attack on the camp in Kidal, four of them seriously, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali (MINUSMA) said.
The attack comes a week after a deadly siege at a Bamako hotel, and at a time of heightened global concern about terrorism after killings in Paris and the downing of the Russian jet, both claimed by Islamic State jihadists.
Our camp in Kidal was attacked early this morning by terrorists using rockets, a MINUSMA official told AFP.
The dead included two Guinean peacekeepers and a contractor from Burkina Faso, the UN said. The terrorists fired shots and then fled, another UN source added.
The UN Security Council's 15 members urged the Malian government to investigate and stressed that those responsible for the attack should be held accountable.
The members of the Security Council underlined that attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law, they said in a unanimous declaration.
An outraged UN chief Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and wished the wounded a speedy recovery.
A senior Ansar Dine (Defenders of the Faith) figure, Hamadou Ag Khallini, told AFP that the attack was in response to the violation of our lands by the enemies of Islam.
We claim the attack in the name of all the mujahedeen, he said. The Ansar Dine group is allied to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Macina Liberation Front, the latter of which claimed responsibility for the November 20 attack on the luxury Radisson Blu hotel in Mali's capital during which 20 people died, including 14 foreigners.
In a siege that last around nine hours, armed men held around 170 guests and staff hostage before Malian, French and US forces stormed the hotel to free the captives, killing two assailants.
Two separate jihadist groups claimed responsibility for that assault: the Al-Murabitoun group, an Al-Qaeda affiliate led by notorious one-eyed Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar, and the Macina Liberation Front from central Mali.
Four days later, a UN employee was killed in an attack on a peacekeeping convoy near the historic desert town of Timbuktu.
MINUSMA chief Mongi Hamdi said in a statement Saturday that the attacks would not dent the determination of the UN to support the Malian people and the peace process.
Mali has been plagued by unrest since the north of the vast west African state fell under the control of Tuareg rebels and jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda in 2012.
The Islamists soon sidelined the Tuareg to take sole control of Timbuktu, Kidal and other northern towns but lost most of the ground they had captured in a French-led military intervention in January 2013. Nearly three years later, large swathes of Mali still remain lawless despite a June peace deal between the government and Tuareg rebels seen as crucial to ending decades of instability in the north that left it vulnerable to extremism.
Some splinter groups had opposed the agreement, including the Tuareg head of the Ansar Dine group, Iyad Ag Ghaly, who called in an October recording for further attacks, including against France.
France has more than 1,000 troops in Mali, a former colony and a key battleground of its Barkhane counter-terror mission spanning five countries in Africa's restive Sahel region.
The UN mission in Mali comprises around 10,200 peacekeepers, who have come under frequent attack.
With more than 50 fatalities so far, MINUSMA has been one of the deadliest UN missions in recent years.
This year has seen the violence spread to the centre and south of Mali, which had previously been largely spared by the extremists.

Tiny Dog Survives Brutal Torture
Teenagers tortured a beloved family dog in what an RSPCA inspector has described as the worst ever unprovoked attack.
Tiny Chihuahua-cross Chunky had his neck broken and was set on fire before being dumped in a rubbish tip when he was less than one year old. He was stolen from his owner by four teenagers on February 24. Three of the teens, aged 16 and 15 at the time, admitted to punching and kicking Chunky before breaking his neck and leg, then setting fire to his face by lighting an aerosol deodorant can. They then fed him drugs before dumping him at the tip in Margate, Kent, where a passer-by found him the following evening and called the RSPCA
Investigations by the RSPCA revealed that he was taken onFebruary 24 and tortured over a period of several hours before being dumping him the next day. Its a miracle he survived, RSPCA inspector Caroline Doe said. This was the most disturbing case I have ever dealt with - by an absolute mile. The whole thing sends shivers down my spine. The defendants may have been young and confessed to being under the influence of drugs but the cruelty they inflicted on this poor dog was extreme, barbaric and inexcusable.
The trio, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty in October to cruelly ill-treating the animal in a way which they knew would cause him to suffer unnecessarily.
They were all disqualified from keeping all animals for five years, given a referral order for 12 months and ordered to pay costs. A fourth youth, aged 16 at the time of the offence, pleaded guilty to the same offences under the Animal Welfare Act, at a trial at Folkestone Youth Court on Tuesday.
He was also disqualified from keeping animals for five years and given a referral order for twelve months, plus his father was made to pay costs of 5,800.
I will never forget how terrified and depressed he was when I first saw him, Doe added.
Thankfully he has now been restored to health and returned to his loving owners, though I fear he will always be timid and nervous as a result of his ordeal, and imagine the owners will never quite be able to come to terms with what was senseless and needlessly inflicted on their beautiful family pet.

Tom Cruise Hasnt Seen Suri For More Than Two Years
It has been reported that Hollywood actor, Tom Cruise, hasnt seen his nine-year-old daughter, Suri, for more than two years.
It is believed that the stars involvement with the controversial Scientology religion has prevented him from seeing his child with ex-wife Katie Holmes for 800 days.
Speaking to The National Enquirer, a source explained: He doesnt seem interested in being part of Suris day-to-day life. Katie does her best to be a hands-on mum but theres no replacing her father.
He hasnt been seen in public with his daughter in over two long years  thats a fifth of her lifetime.

A former member of Scientology, Marc Headley, also confirmed that this is not unusual behaviour for a member of the church, as Tom might have concerns that his former in-laws have been bad-mouthing his religion.
He told the publication: Its possible Tom wont see Suri because he thinks Katie and her family are speaking negatively about him and Scientology.
It is also thought that the actor is too busy with his work commitments to make the time for Suri, with Tom working on several movies back-to-back in recent years. Meanwhile, the Church of Scientology has come under scrutiny over the last few weeks thanks to a sensational book released by former member, Leah Remini. In the piece, Leah claims to expose secrets about Tom and the religious group, alleging that Tom and Katie had left Suri to cry on the bathroom floor when she was just a baby, and also maintaining that itd be tough for Tom to keep in contact with his daughter.
She said during a TV appearance: The policy with the church is you cant be connected to someone who has committed a suppressive act - which I have, Katie has. So far, the church has denied all of Leahs claims in her book, telling E! Online: It comes as no surprise that someone as self-absorbed as Leah Remini with an insatiable craving for attention would exploit her former faith as a publicity stunt by rewriting her history with it, including omitting that she was participating in a programme to remain a Scientologist by her own choice, as she was on the verge of being expelled for her ethical lapses.
After divorcing Tom in 2012, Katie Holmes left the Church of Scientology because she wanedt to protect her daughter.
Tom has not yet commented on any of the claims.
