Ending bribery and corruption
Addressing a number of rallies for the Local Government Election, both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe have pledged to take action regarding the bond issue and other cases of corruption. They repeated this bold statement during separate addresses to the Nation as well.
As Prime Minister Wickremesinghe explained in his address, no attempt was made to cover up this issue at any stage. This is significant, given that the previous regime did not take steps to investigate any of the brazen acts of corruption reported at that time. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself once admitted that he shaped (hushed up) an investigation as the alleged culprit was an apey miniha (our man). A presidential Commission to probe an act of corruption would have been unthinkable in such a context.
On the other hand, this Government went ahead with several probes into the bond issue, knowing very well that names associated with the Government could come out. And for the first time in local history, a sitting Prime Minister was called to give evidence by a Presidential Commission. He was well within his rights not to attend  but he did and gave evidence for several hours. The Presidents decision to appoint a Commission to investigate the bond transaction was a historic one. Many things happened even before its report was published, including the resignation of a minister.
The bond issue was a manna from heaven for the Joint Opposition, which was looking for a straw to hang on. They argued that the loss cited in the Bond Commission Report could never be recovered. Now it has been revealed that no financial loss will be caused to the government on account of the Central Bank Bond issue since the Government will recover the Rs 9.2 billion involved from Perpetual Treasures Ltd. according to the procedure recommended by the Presidential Commission.
The Central Bank functioning under the Ministry of National Policy has already blocked and retained a fund of Rs 12 billion belonging to the Perpetual Treasures Ltd from which this money could be obtained, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said in his special address to the nation.
As the Prime Minister stated, it must not be forgotten that the Yahapalana (Good Governance) Government came to power on a mandate to eradicate bribery and corruption. The voting public was overwhelmingly in favour of probing into and punishing the culprits behind the massive acts of corruption that had occurred during the previous regime. Their message to the incoming Government was that the Government should not also tolerate any acts of corruption by its own members or public officials. The Government understood this message perfectly  hence endeavours such as the Bond Commission.
It must be noted that in the past the President of the committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) was a member of the Government in power. But the Presidents post in COPE was given to an opposition member for the first time in the present Parliament. COPE investigated the issuing of Central Bank bonds and tabled its report in Parliament which debated it. This report was sent to the Attorney General on October 31, 2016 for necessary action. At party level, the UNP has appointed a committee chaired by Minister Tilak Marapane to conduct investigations on any party member(s) against whom any allegations had been made by the Bond report and recommend suitable action against them.
These are all positive steps that will gain the confidence of local voters as well as foreign investors. After all, no foreign investor will come to Sri Lanka if corruption becomes rampant. The onus is now on the Government to expedite the investigations into the massive acts of corruption that had taken place from 2005-2014, including those at the Central Bank itself. Many citizens are frustrated by the seemingly slow progress of these probes, which should be expedited to regain their trust.
The President has already promised to take additional steps in this regard. Special courts have also been proposed, as some cases could drag on for years in normal courts. He has also proposed a Presidential Commission to investigate alleged acts of corruption and malpractices at SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka, the latter being an egoistic project of the former President. Both airlines had faced colossal losses over the years. There is an ongoing search for a strategic partner for SriLankan, whose former partner Emirates was kicked out by the former President over a purely personal dispute. During that period, the airline was a profitable venture, but it went into a nosedive after Emirates exit.
Bribery and corruption is a cancer that can consume an entire nation. Recognising this stark reality, the Government is mulling an action plan aimed at ensuring sustainable development through the elimination of bribery and corruption. Strengthening public institutions such as the Police and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption is vital in this respect. With Sri Lanka on the cusp of the 70th Independence anniversary, we look forward to a brighter future sans bribery and corruption.

EU commends Sri Lanka for re-engaging world in HR dialogue
The European Commission in an assessment of Sri Lanka's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)+ has commended the country for its "impressive commitments to national reconciliation".
The report also notes the slow progress in implementing the UNHRC Resolution which it says has been "disappointing."
The report cites that "Sri Lanka has re-engaged with the international community and made a series of impressive commitments to national reconciliation, as articulated in its co-sponsorship of Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1 (2015) on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka."
The report commends the government for entering into human rights dialogue with the EU, a first in the history of EU-Sri Lanka Relations. The Commission adds that EU- Sri Lanka relations have been rejuvenated with annual meets of the Joint Commission and its working group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights.
Detailing some of the progress made on human rights in the past two years, the commission finds that the government has restored independence of key oversight institutions. "There has been a significant opening of democratic and civil society space. A process of constitutional reform, including a Bill of Rights, has started, and action is underway towards accountability for enforced disappearances. A national human rights action plan has been prepared. Furthermore, women will have a larger stake in local governments. A National Plan of Action for Children has been adopted, and reform of the juvenile justice system is being prepared."
The Commission however adds that the Government has to urgently deliver on a number of important reforms that are of direct relevance for the effective implementation of the human rights conventions listed in the GSP+ Regulation.
This includes the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) which it cites must be repealed and if needed replaced by legislation in line with international human rights law, including CCPR and CAT. The amendment of Code of Criminal Procedures Act to ensure fundamental legal safeguards. Ensuring that all alleged torture by the police and security forces comes to an end, that perpetrators are brought to justice and that its policy of zero tolerance is implemented.
Elaborating on the country's economy, the Commission says that for Sri Lanka to reach the status of an Upper Middle-Income Country, which it is currently aspiring to, it will have to strengthen its economy's competitiveness and ability to pursue an export-led growth model.

First University Rover Scout Unit of Sri Lanka to be formed
While the World Rover Scouting celebrates the centenary this year, the Sri Lanka Scout Association (SLSA) together with the Student Counseling Office of the University of Colombo is promoting Rover Scouting among the undergraduates in the University of Colombo.
The SLSA announced that both parties will launch the first-ever University Rover Unit of Sri Lanka jointly at the University of Colombo Arts Faculty premises on January 24 at 12 noon.
In mid-2017, with the inception of the idea of popularizing Rover Scouting among the students of the University of Colombo, the then Chief Commissioner Prof. Nimal de Silva, the present Chief Commissioner for Rover Scouts Merrill Goonetillake, Assistant Chief Commissioner for Rover Scouts Srilath de Silva among others launched a programme for them.
Scouting is an educational and personality development, service and activity based programme engaging young people from all over the world. World Scouting today, is a confederation of 162 countries where their National Scout Organizations have over 42 million members in more than 1 million Scout and Rover Units. The Colombo Campus Rover Crew will add another unit to this movement.
Rover Scouting or Rovering is for young people, male and female, in the age group of 18 to 24. A group of Rovers is called a Rover Crew. Rovering provides support in facing future challenges and enhances leadership qualities. The youths can fulfill their future aspirations through scouting.
A Rover Crew governs itself but has a warranted leader as Rover Scout Master to guide them in their activities. A capable person of over 25 years of age could become RSM warranted by the National Scout Headquarters.
The Rover programme originated in the United Kingdom in 1918 to provide a programme for young people. It was quickly adopted by many other national scout organizations. The Founder Father of World Scouting Lord Baden Powell called a Rovering a brotherhood of open air and service and said Rover Scouting is a preparation for life and also a pursuit for life.
Scouting for youth has been promoted by the World Organization of Scout Movement to create a platform for the young scouts to get together and meet new friends, share experiences and views on scouting and contribute new ideas to the movement on how to enrich educational programmes for youths.
The Sri Lanka Scout Association became one of the first member countries of the World Organisation of Scout Movement in 1912. In 1957, the Sri Lanka Scout Association was incorporated as a National Voluntary Organization by a Parliamentary Act. The Scout Movement was restructured recently to produce innovative youth for the 21st century.
The programme for the official formation of the University of Colombo Rover Unit will include an introduction to Rover Scouting, youth programme and a brief presentation of projects carried out by Rovers in the country.
All students of the University of Colombo are invited.

Former champs Australia, India storm into super league quarter finals
Left-arm spinner Anukul Roy took four for 20 and Shubman Gill scored an unbeaten 90 to help India fashion a 10-wicket victory over Zimbabwe, while opener Nathan McSweeney slammed 156 and fast bowler Jason Ralston produced a record haul of seven for 15 as Australia thumped Papua New Guinea by 311 runs as the two former champions progressed to the Super League quarterfinals from Group B on the seventh day of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2018 on Friday.
Also joining in the Super League quarterfinals were former champions Pakistan who defeated Sri Lanka by three wickets in a Group D match. Pakistan will now wait for the outcome of the Afghanistan versus Ireland match on Saturday in Whangarei to find out if they will top the group or finish runners-up.

Roy, who had finished with five wickets in the previous match against PNG, bowled an immaculate line and length as India dismissed the opposition for only 154 and got to the target in quick time with openers Shubman Gill and Aveet Desai returning unbeaten on 90 and 56, respectively. The three-time champions finished with three wins, including a 100-run victory over Australia earlier in the league, which proved decisive in the final standings.
For Australia, who finished behind India in the group stage, Ralston ripped through the PNG batting, his seven for 15 the best-ever to date in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup and second best at the U19 level.

Half of Southern Expressway extension work complete
About 50 percent of the construction work on the Southern Expressway extension from Matara to Hambantota, with a length of 96 km, has been completed. It will be vested with the public next year.
A Highways Ministry Spokesperson said the rest of the work is progressing expeditiously. We are on schedule to complete in early 2019, he added.
The Southern Expressway extension from Matara to Hambantota comprises four main sections including Section 1 - a 30 km stretch from Matara to Belliatta; Section 2 - a 26 km stretch from Beliatta to Wetiya; Section 3 - a 15 km stretch from Wetiya to Andarawewa and Section 4  a 25km section from Hambantota to Mattala via Andarawewa.
He said about 50 percent of the construction work of the first section and third section had been completed while there is around 65 percent progress in the construction work of the fourth section.
He said about 30 percent of the construction work on the second section is already completed.
The estimated cost of the project is Rs. 103.2 billion. The government has signed four loan agreements with the EXIM Bank of China to finance civil work contracts and the construction work of all four sections are ongoing without any significant hindrance.
Project Director for Section four A. P. K. Abeydeera said there are eight interchanges in the Southern Expressway extension which are Godagama interchange, Aparekka interchange, Beliatta interchange, Kahagalla interchange, Angunukolapalassa interchange, Wetiya interchange, Suriyawewa interchange and Andarawewa interchange.
The extension initially with four-lane carriageways will be developed as a six-lane expressway later, he added. The project will provide massive benefits as it will link with the country's major economic centres such as the Hambantota Sea Port and Mattala Mahinda Rajapaksa International Airport in Southern Province with the Colombo City and the Northern part of the country through the Outer Circular Highway, Colombo - Katunayake Expressway and the proposed Northern Expressway.

How the umpires for the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup are picked
My role is to look after match officiating globally. Thats the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires who officiate in Test, ODI and T20I matches in addition to major global tournaments. The Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires' primary role is to officiate bilateral limited-overs games which their member board hosts, and the ICC Development Panel of International Umpires that is made up of umpires from our associates' members and female umpires.
We use tournaments such as the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup to have a look at the umpires from the international panel that weve identified as possibly able to get to the elite level one day, while also bearing in mind what responsibilities we have to a tournament like this to provide good officiators. We marry those two goals together.
We conduct workshops prior to all tournaments to go through the specific tournament playing conditions and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. We conduct team briefings, so the teams are aware of what we expect and we examine any interpretations we need to go through. These umpires are not on the elite panel, but they go through exactly the same preparation that the elite guys do, which is tremendous for their development.
We always identify the best umpires we can to appoint to our tournaments. In a tournament such as this we have identified those umpires at the international level who demonstrate the necessary competencies, and we have two objectives when selecting:
1) To see how they perform at this level
2) To give the tournament a level of umpiring it deserves
However, through it all, we make sure that we choose umpires on merit and that we give the tournament, players, fans and the game itself the level of officiating that it deserves and expects. There are a number of things that go into being a good umpire. We look at how they interact with the players, how they control the game and how the game moves forward because of their presence, communication, interventions when required and decision making.
In addition to their on-field skills, we also assess how they work together with their teammates, because like players they have to work in partnership with each other. We also see how well they know the playing conditions, how well they prepare and how well they use the resources provided to better their skills.
Its a holistic approach: we look at the entire person, not just in terms of outs and not outs, but how they prepare themselves and how they get themselves ready to do their job. Our referees and umpire coaches see them as they work and we collate the reports submitted and get a sense of who our better umpires are.
The reports give us an opportunity to highlight areas the umpires do well in and also identify any areas to work on.
Ive never umpired, so Ive never experienced the pressures that an umpire goes through. However, having been an international cricketer you do have an appreciation for the pressure that being within the top level does have, so it gives you that empathy and understanding for what an umpire might be going through. We try to look at things from their point of view and try to help them along the way and make sure that the umpires are in the best position to do their jobs.  ICC

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Kandy SC geared for eleventh win
Kandy Sports Club will host fourth placed CH & FC in the eleventh second round league rugby game at Nittawela today. Both coaches Kandy SCs Sean Wijesinghe and CH & FCs Tavita Tulagaese who is affectionately called Laga, a former Kandy SC player and coach, have still not announced their squads. In the first round game Kandy SC gave a good display to beat CH. Kandy SC head into this clash with an unbeaten record so far.
They have won all the ten matches they played and CH & FC in their ten games have won five, drawn one and lost four. Since Laga took over CH coaching he has worked hard at getting the best out of his players, and their president Shammi Silva too has given them a lot of support.
The Maitland Crescent team have shown signs of improvement under the guidance of head coach Laga, but their attacking play has not been at its best as they have only scored five wins this season. In the last outing they beat Air Force 28-12, and Kandy SC beat CR & FC 50-15. So, today can CH & FC go toe-to-toe with the KSC in a skill-based contest Kandy must go for tries from every opportunity and keep belief with that plan even under pressure.
Their back line looks to be stronger than their pack. They have built this side around a desire to play open rugby and have moved the game on as a result. CH can be at full strength, this would be the best chance to present a good game of rugby but winning is not possible with a team like Kandy. In this game they will come with a backline that could be the best in terms of threat, pace and power. CH in the last few games have come out with a competitive pack and have tried to make contests a dogfight by scrapping and spoiling, but their back line was limited and lifeless.
Kesara Senanayake trophy cricket
Mahaiyawa Cricket lovers will organize an invitation six-a-side softball cricket tournament at the P.T. Rajan playgrounds at Mahaiyawa.

Antonians in thrilling sixth win
St Anthonys Colleges beat Sri Jayawardenapura MV to record their sixth win of the inter school cricket season. After a couple of seasons, Antonians are back on track at cricket. A big hand should go to their coach Sampath Perera for guiding them to do well. This is a school which has been a major force in school cricket at one time, but in the last few years they failed to keep up to those traditions and were demoted to Division II a couple of years back. Last season they had a good chance of getting promoted but the losses to St. Benedict's College and Vidyarhta College deprived them of promotion. They have started the season with a loss to St. Sebastian's College Katuneriya and later won six games.

Garbage recycling in the Kirinda-Puhulwella Pradeshiya Sabha has progressed significantly at present, residents in the area said.
The Pradeshiya Sabha collects the garbage accumulating in the Kirinda, Puhulwella towns and suburbs. The collected garbage was then transported to the centre and recycled.
Farmers in the area prefer using compost manure to chemical fertiliser since they have to spend less on them. Their cultivations yield good harvest when compost fertiliser is used in them.
The procedure also preserves the environment while providing direct and indirect employments for the unemployed, officials said.

## Title: Microbes, our unseen friends

Microbes, our unseen friends
Microbes are tiny little creatures that are not visible to the naked eye. They should be observed with the help of a microscope. Microorganisms can belong to different categories. They are bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae and viruses.
Microorganisms are the natural decomposers. These decomposers include bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. They are the creatures who degrade the complicated organic substances into simple inorganic substances, releasing energy and nutrients, hence, facilitating plants to uptake the nutrients and involve in nutrient recycling in the environment.
Certain steps in the biogeochemical cycle such as Nitrogen cycle, Sulphur cycle and Carbon cycle involve several types of microorganisms. Some examples are Rhizobium involving in nitrogen fixation. Nitrosomonas involve in the nitrification process. Thiobacillus and Green Sulphur bacteria involve in Sulphur oxidation process and etc. In the Carbon cycle, microbes mainly act as decomposers, helping to decompose dead plant and animal material.
Their next important activity is the Bioleaching. It is the process described as the dissolution of metals from their mineral sources by certain naturally occurring microorganisms or the use of microorganisms to transform elements so that the elements can be extracted from the original sample. Fe and Cu are such two metals that are extracted from bioleaching procedure. If we take the use of chemical and physical methods, a lot of gases and harmful chemical substances will be released into the environment, causing environmental pollution. However, by using the microorganisms and providing suitable conditions to them, we are able to leach out the element we need without causing many environmental impacts. The exposure of economically important plants to various pests and insect attacks is a critical problem faced in the field of agriculture. When engaging in mass cultivation, there will be a lot of economic disadvantages. So to stop those attacks, there is the use of insecticides. But one of the major problems when using these chemicals is that the insects create a resistance within them by exposure to such chemicals. So to overcome this problem, now we use bioinsecticides.
These bioinsecticides contain live bacteria that produce toxins which cause stomach poison in the insect and kill them. But those are not poisonous to the plants. And also to supply nutrients to the plants, the microorganisms are taken. These are named as biofertilizers. They produce essential nutrients like nitrogen, sulphur, phosphate over chemical fertilizers because chemicals decrease the quality of soil and create health issues in humans as well as animals. So the use of biocontrol agents and biofertilizers which are composed of microorganisms is a more effective technique to be used in agriculture.
Another use of microorganisms is to treat the wastewater. Secondary treatment microorganisms are added and they are allowed to grow. They use the organic matter and decompose them so that degraded compounds are deposited. Then the water can be separated from the deposited matter.
Bioremediation is another important process when talking about microorganisms. Remediate means to solve a problem and bioremediation means use biological organisms to solve an environmental problem such as contaminated soil or groundwater. Contaminants treated using bioremediation include oil and other petroleum products. If we see how it works, some types of microbes are capable of eating and digesting those contaminants. They usually change those contaminants into a small amount of water and gases such as carbon dioxide, hence cleaning the environment from pollution. The bioremediation relies on microbes that live naturally in soil and groundwater. And they create no threat to humans. So the bioremediation process is a much safer process to make use of to clean contaminants from the environment.
The field of medicine also incorporates the use of microorganisms a lot. The vaccines we use for various diseases are made of microbes that are dead or inactivated so that they are unable to cause the disease. The antigen in the vaccine is the same as the antigen on the surface of the disease-causing organism. The vaccine stimulates the body to produce antibodies against the antigen in the vaccine. When the vaccinated person comes into contact with the disease-causing microbe, the immune system remembers the antibodies and makes them faster. So the person is protected against that microorganism. And also certain antibiotics such as penicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin are extracted from microorganisms. These antibiotics either help to prevent microbe cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis hence protecting the person against infections.
Also, microbes are used in the field of recombinant technology to make various proteins. Human growth hormone and insulin are two such hormones produced using recombinant microorganisms.
Some microorganisms keep us healthy. Those microorganisms are in large numbers inside our body and they stop the development of disease-causing organisms. One example is our gut microbial population. And now there are commercially available products named as probiotics. These are the supplements made of beneficial friendly lactic acid bacteria formulated to reflect the composition of healthy gut microorganisms. These help to increased tolerance to infections, control diarrhea and etc.
Microorganisms are also used in the field of food and beverages such as wine industry, the beer industry, edible microorganisms and etc. For the production of wine grapes, the grape pulp is kept for fermentation. The yeast used for the fermentation grow a film on the fruit or in the environment. And also some cultivated strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are added in order to improve the quality of our wine products.
Beer is also an alcoholic beverage made from the fermentation of starch sources such as rice. The process includes the microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum. Brandy and whiskey are some other beverages produced from the fermentation activity of microorganisms. Fermented milk and dairy products also make the use of microbial activity. This fermentation is done by the lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus are some lactic acid bacterial groups. Lactic acid bacteria ferments the carbohydrates such as lactose in milk into lactic acid. Because of this lactic acid, proteins are precipitated and it gives a thicker consistency to our dairy product. Microbes are also taken as food supplements such as single-celled proteins. These are dried cells of microorganisms such as algae, bacteria and fungi. Spirulina is one such example of those food supplements.
Microorganisms are tiny organisms. So apart from above mentioned activities they may possess many more uses. It is true that certain types cause diseases. But we can not neglect microbes as disease-causing organisms because without them much of ecosystem and human activities will be interrupted. So we cannot consider them only as our enemies.

Navy goes out firm favourites against CR
Can dejected CR & FC survive Navys onslaught The answer to this question will be found only this evening when these two teams clash in their Dialog A Division League rugby second round match at Navy grounds in Welisara, due to kick off at 4.00pm.
The Sailors are in a buoyant mood after three smashing wins over CH and FC (27-24), Army SC (28-10) and Police SC (45-26) and should give the underperforming CR & FC a run for their money.
The lads from Longden Place were thrashed by formidable Kandy Sc outfit by 15 points to 50 in their last outing at Nittawela, so they will have to come up with a much better display if they hope to overcome the vastly improved Navy and notch up their sixth win for the season.
The power-packed Navy eight which is laden with national players have outplayed their counterparts in the loose with skipper Danushka Gertha
Perera leading from the front ably supported by Adeesha Weerathunga, Lahiru Wishvajith, Steffan Gregory, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Raveen De silva and Roshan Ranasinghe, but today they will be confronted by the marauding CR forwards spearheaded by former Royal college number eight and rolling maul expert Supun Warnakulasuriya who has been a source of inspiration to his
team-mates with his fiery loose play along with granite hardnumber eight Omalka Gunarathne, fierce tackler cum flanker Shawqat Lahir, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Shemal Weeraekara, Hafiz Adahan and cracking second row forward Charana Chamikara giving of their best hence a terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected.
CRs hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya should get the better of Navys experience hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe in the set scrums while in the line outs the Navys duo of Supun Peiris and Adeesha Weerathunga have the edge over the Red shirts solitary jumper Shemal Weerasekara.
The lads from Longden Place have been let down by their three quarters with diminutive Chamod Fernando and Chanaka Chandimal being the biggest disappointment.
They will hope that their entire three quarter line will make amends by unleashing their powerful runs through Kavindu De Costa, Tharinda Ratwatte, co-centres Kushan Indunil and Sashan Mohammed which would help them to pierce the Sailors defence as they have the services of that hard running skipper and national player Kavindu Perera along with speedy national player Reeza Rafaideen on the wing in addition to an attacking full back in Rehan Silva.
Navys three quarters have shown a marked improvement in the last three matches with the halves combination of Heshan Maduranga and Mohamad Abzal having clicked with wingers Saliya Handapangoda and young Buddhima Piyaratne who have made some daring runs and a repeat performance by them should help them to give CR & FC another thrashing.
CR & FC (Probable XV) Hafiz Adahan, Supun Warnakulasooriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Gayan Jayamanna, Charana Chamikara, Shawqat Lahir, Shemal Weerasekara, Omalka Gunaratne, Kavindu De Costha or Avishka Heenpalla and Tharinda Ratwatte, Reeza Rafaideen, Sashan Mohammed, Kushan Indunil, Kavindu Perera (Captain), Rehan Silva Navy SC (Probable XV ) Roshan Ranasinghe, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Stefan Greogary, Lahiru Wishvajith, Supun Peiris, Adeesha Weerathunga , Danushka Gertha  Perera(Captain), Ravin De Silva, Heshan Maduranga and Mohamad Abzal, Budhdhima Piyaratne, Lahiru Herath, Musheen Falleel, Saliya Handapangoda, Thilina Weerasinghe

New laws, High Courts will expedite corruption cases - PM
The government will formulate new laws and rid the loopholes in the process of bringing persons involved in fraud and corruption into justice, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said.
Wickremesinghe said a cabinet paper is already tabled by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale for a special high court which will expedite case hearings from 5 to 6 years to six months.
The PM made these observations at UNP election campaign rallies held at Godakawela, Elpitiya and Homagama.
I thanked Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale for taking action to remove obstacles in the way of bringing corrupt persons to book. Now there is a proper setting to punish these corrupt people. Many ask us as to when we are going to catch these thieves. Catching thieves is one thing. Punishing is another. Prolonging court cases for three to four months has become a part of the normal procedure. Some cases are prolonged for six months or even a year. In such a scenario, it will take about five years to give a judgment for a case. PM Wickremesinghe pointed out.
When the cases are taken to the Appeal Court it will take another two or so years. Then these cases are taken to the Supreme Court as well. If it takes five years for proceedings, the witnesses will even forget their evidence. Police officers who are working on those cases may retire. Sometimes, we fail to give a proper judgment to the case, he said.
Wickremesinghe also said that police officers have pointed out that if it takes five years to give a judgment, there is no point in filing cases in the first place. They told us that witnesses might pass away during course of the proceedings, or they might leave the country. Thus they pointed out that cases should be immediately heard, PM Wickremesinghe said.
He further said that there were several discussions on the said matter with Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale. The government has set down new laws taking above issues into consideration, PM Wickremesinghe also said. According to this new law, the Attorney General can forward certain cases directly to the special High Court. Those cases will be heard by three judges. The hearings will not be prolonged and we should be able to receive the judgment of a case within six months. The maximum it should take is one or two years, he added.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that with the new laws no one will have to wait for ten years to bring offenders to justice. The whole process of bringing offenders to justice will be accelerated with these new laws. There are number of obstacles in the process of catching the offenders and filing cases against them. Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera has proposed to establish a new unit for case productions. Justice Minister Athukorale has taken this proposal into consideration and established a new division for case productions, with the consultation of the Attorney General. This will also expedite in closing cases soon, he also pointed out.

Niece dies in brawl mishap, uncle commits suicide
An argument which broke out between a mother and son at a house in Pottuvil, Jaffna has resulted in the death of a four year old girl, Kopay Police said.
The girl was the mothers younger sons daughter and had come in between the two arguing adults when it turned violent. The uncle under whose knife, the niece was killed with had suffered such guilt and sorrow that he had committed suicide soon after.

The Olympican who skied on toothbrushes
In skiing terms, Dave Ryding is something of an anomaly.
While most pros were raised in Alpine countries, or Scandinavia or North America, Britain's Ryding first found his skiing legs on a dry, plastic slope in northwest England.
Forget groomed pistes and cozy alpine huts -- you're unlikely to see even a smattering of snow at the Pendle Ski Club in Lancashire.
But, from these humble beginnings, Ryding has worked his way onto the international circuit and is already making history for Britain.
The slalom racer enjoyed a major breakthrough at the start of 2017 when he finished second in one of skiing's most prestigious World Cup events -- the Kitzbuhel slalom in Austria.
"My life changed in Austria after that, people started to recognize me which was a different stress because you're trying to train and people are coming up for photos," Ryding tells CNN Alpine Edge.
"But it's what you dream of as a kid.
"All the good guys were coming up to me and congratulating me and telling me what a great journey I've had. They were appreciative of where I've come from."
OLYMPIC DREAM
Ryding returns to Kitzbuhel this week with hopes of replicating, or even bettering, last year's blistering run. There's an added incentive of performing this year with an Olympic Games just around the corner.
"I only ever dreamed of competing at the Olympics when I was a kid. I never dreamed of a medal," he says.
"It would mean the world to me ... I try not to think too much about it. I'll start dreaming coming up to it and try and live it on the day."
He may be 31, but Ryding has produced some of his best ever performances this season, finishing in the top 10 at World Cup slalom events in Zagreb, Croatia and Madonna di Campiglio, Italy. That race in Kitzbuhel was the best World Cup finish in 36 years for a British athlete, and Ryding came agonizingly close to going one better earlier this season when a crash on his second run cost him his comfortable lead in Levi, Finland.
FRICTION BURNS
His recent form is helping put his country on the skiing map, "debunking the myth," according to one British Ski and Snowboarding Association official, that Great Britain can't be competitive alongside the traditional heavyweights of the skiing world.
Ryding admits that transitioning onto snow, which he first did at the age of 12, takes some getting used to after years of skiing on the same dry slope.
"It's slightly different. You can transfer it to snow and, OK, you have to learn the rolls, the steeps, the ice, the slush -- the variables that come with snow," he says.
Having started his skiing career on what's essentially a stretch of carpet -- or, in his own words, "a lot of toothbrushes" that give "a hell of a friction burn if you crash" -- Ryding is reluctant to stray too far from what he knows best during the off-season as he heads indoors to practice.
"People laugh at me for going indoors because [the runs are] short, it's in like a fridge, and it's not the nice surroundings we have in the mountains," he says.
"But I like it, I was brought up on 120 meters of ski slope and making it work. So I go there and do the same thing."

Operation Unity amidst Bond issue rivalries
It is a week of major political upheaval. A week when the very existence of the coalition of national unity has been questioned, and the leaders of the key coalition parties had to make fresh commitments to keep alive the government of unity; amidst the rising swell of the local government poll campaign making new demands from the political leadership of the government.
The impact of the Treasury Bond issue, the details of which have now been revealed by the Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI), remains the kernel of political issues and rivalry, and gives the local poll campaign what some consider as a referendum on the yahapalana government, as well as the Joint Opposition that is making every effort to drive the public mind in its favour, against the policies that saw the election of President Maithripala Sirisena in January 2015, and the victory of a UNP-led coalition with the SLFP in August that year.
The rising criticism and open attacks on President Sirisena by several back bench and also some front line members of the UNP did cause a major crisis, which led the President to even move away from the Cabinet meeting earlier this week. The subsequent move by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to assure the President that the UNP members would be controlled, did help in bringing about some political reconciliation between the President and the UNP. But the heat of the poll campaign remains a threat to the unity of government, requiring determined moves to maintain the coalition unity, in the midst of major divisions and contradictions on government policy.
While the Prime Minister has cautioned his MPs against attacks on the President, what action would the President take against leading SLFP members, ministers too, openly attacking the PM
Operations
President Sirisena did have the better week, following all that rowdyism seen on Parliament the previous week, with his declaration of Two Operations, in the fight against corruption. The first was the appointment of the PCoI which revealed what is clearly the biggest fraud in public affairs and funds in the country. Next was his move to initiate legal action against those involved in the Bond issue, in keeping with the findings of the Commission Report.
Commission Report is available to the public, being on the Internet and easily accessible, it has brought out many aspects of a convoluted fraud involving public funds, and has clearly identified four persons as the key villains of the piece, namely, Arjuna Mahendran the then Governor of the Central Bank, Arjun Aloysius, the key operator of Perpetual Treasuries, Kasun Palisena the CEO of Perpetual Treasuries, and the former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Although Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe about whom there are many public allegations of involvement in his fraud, but has not been found to be such by the PCoI, the Commission does make this important observation: We consider that, the confidence which the Hon. Prime Minister states he placed in the assurances given to him by Mr. Mahendran, was misplaced. We are of the view that, the more prudent course of action would have been for the Hon. Prime Minister to have independently verified whether Mr. Mahendran was, in fact, honouring the assurances he gave the Hon. Prime Minister. We regret that, the Hon. Prime Minister did not take that course of action. This is certainly a situation which the Prime Minister will have to face up to in the coming weeks and months, as the debate of the Bond issue gets even hotter. It is the stuff of politics; he must be used to in his 40 years in Parliament and politics.
He made an address to the nation on Thursday evening, emphasizing the UNPs commitment to continue the fight against corruption, was of the view the many millions lost through the Perpetual Treasuries frauds, could be recovered with no loss to the country, from the millions of that companys funds already been held back by the Central Bank. He stated the party had appointed a three-member committee headed by Minister Tilak Marapana, to go into areas where action may be needed with regard to the Commission findings. There is little doubt that as the poll campaign moves on, with more public discussion of the findings in the Report, the Prime Minister and the UNP will certainly have to face more comment, criticism and censure, which will be the stuff of a highly strained coalition; the future of which may be decided after the local government polls.
Much credit
Despite the heavy criticism directed at the government by the JO on the Bond issue, the manner in which this probe has been carried out by the PCoI, the very substantial report that has been produced, and the fact that it has already been presented to Parliament (which will decide when it will be debated), and that it has already been put on the Internet, certainly gives much credit to the government. It underscores President Sirisenas repeated statements in campaign rallies that the government remains committed to its pledge to fight corruption, of the past and the present.
In fact, the government draws much credit from the fact that this is the first time in the past several decades that a government, and a coalition, has carried out a timely and thorough probe into a major fraud in the country; has released the report, and has taken steps to bring those involved in the fraud to justice, with the least delay.
This is certainly not the stuff seen in this country in the years of the previous Rajapaksa Regime, and earlier administrations of both the SLFP and UNP. It stands out as a beacon of the commitment to fight corruption at the core of the campaign for the Common Candidate in January 2015, and gives strength to the forces of civil society that continue the call to fight corruption. There is little that the JO, the SLPP and Rajapaksa supporters could seriously draw from this record of fighting corruption, and is likely to help push for more of such action against those corrupt in the past, and now trying to cover up their offences with the scum of the Bond issue.
More to follow
While that Bond issue is the highlight of the stuff of politics today, there is also the report submitted to the President on the probes into more than 30 matters relating to fraud, corruption, and violation of administrative practice by the Presidential Commission on Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC). This report too has been submitted to Parliament, and hopefully will be the subject of an early debate.
The PRECIFAC reports cover a considerable amount of corruption under the previous Rajapaksa Regime, and is in fact a direct follow up of the policies of the coalition of National Unity formed in 2015. The material from these reports will certainly affect the members of the JO and SLPP, and could well involve some members of the SLFP who are in government today. It is, therefore, a matter of importance that the focus on the Bond issue findings should not by any means lead to covering up the frauds of the previous administration. The Presidents instructions to the Attorney General, the Bribery Commission, and other institutions involved in probing and fighting corruption, must ensure that action on PRECIFAC issues must move with the same speed with intended action on the Bond issue.
Presidential term
The decision of the Supreme Court on the Presidents own request to find out whether the term of the Executive Presidency would be five or six years, according to the 19th Amendment, where the Court was unanimously clear that it is five years, did negatively affect the Presidents image, while he said it was only a clarification sought in view of contradictory positions. There was the clear suspicion in the mind of the public that this was a move to go back to a six year presidency, with the approval of the Supreme Court, and certainly went against the many statements the President had made in public, from the day he took office as President on January 9, 2015.
It is regrettable that the legal advisors to the government, particularly the Attorney General, was supportive of the six year term, when the explanatory comments in the Constitution left little room for any doubt about five years. The declaration of the five year presidency has now given rise to other issues, with leading members of the SLFP in government stating that President Sirisena would be the SLFPs candidate for the next Presidential Election. This certainly contradicts what President Sirisena has said from the time he was sworn in, and it is best if the matter is clarified with speed, before it adds to the simmering divisions that exist between the UNP and SLFP.

ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup:
Pakistan hold off spirited Lanka to secure quater final berth
WHANGAREI, Friday - Sri Lanka put up a fine fight, but Pakistan had simply done too much damage in the first innings of their must-win Group C clash. They sealed their spot in the quarter-finals of the 2018 ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup, along with Afghanistan, with a three-wicket victory at the Cobham Oval on Friday (19 January).
Hasan Khan, the Pakistan captain, called right at the toss and opted to bowl, wanting to restrict Sri Lanka to a low score and allow his batsmen to chase without scoreboard pressure. The first part of it went to plan, his bowlers trundling out Sri Lanka for 188 in 48.2 overs. However, Sri Lanka emerged for the second innings with supreme spirit, and it needed a watchful half-century from Ali Zaryab (59), and a supportive 45-ball unbeaten 24 from Hasan himself to sneak Pakistan across the line. They did so in 43.3 overs, ending at 190/7.
The fight Sri Lanka put up was lovely to see though. They emerged for the second innings with a war cry, and they put in a display that would have stirred even the most ardent Pakistan fan. Their fielders cheered their bowlers every move, and complimented them well in the field. And the bowlers delivered under a searing New Zealand sun. Thisaru Rashmika  who was Sri Lankas best bowler with 3/47  had Rohail Nazir bowled for nought early on, and followed it up with the scalp of Ammad Alam (12).
A brief stand between Zaid Alam and Zaryab helped Pakistan recover from 25/2 and breach the 50-run mark, but Dhananjaya Lakshan induced an edge off Alam and Pakistan were nervy at 57/3. It could have led to a slide, but Mohammad Taha offered good support to Zaryab, and the two staged a recovery. There was no time pressure  there were plenty of overs remaining, and their target was small, allowing them to pick the singles.
Their 61-run stand was crucial in pegging Sri Lanka back, but when Taha (24) was adjudged caught behind  he didnt think so, but the umpire did  he was followed back to the dressing room by Saad Khan (1) as well. Pakistan were a bit jittery at this point  they were losing wickets in a huff, and there was still a way to go. And Sri Lanka were buzzing.
Hasan came in and played a crucial captains knock. He took charge, taking almost no time to settle in, and with his captain batting with such ease, Zaryab could play his game. He soon brought up his half-century, as the two added 33 runs for the sixth wicket. Unfortunately for Pakistan, there was another mini-slide, with Zaryab nicking one to the keeper and Shaheen Afridi (4) holing out shortly thereafter.
Captain Hasan was visibly displeased with his partners lack of staying power. The wickets raised the tension that much more, but Pakistan found an unlikely hero in Muhammad Musa. He rotated strike commendably, and hammered an 18-ball unbeaten 23, finishing things off in style with two consecutive sixes. Pakistans joy knew no bounds.
In the morning, the Pakistan opening bowlers Arshad Iqbal and Musa had Sri Lanka in trouble early on. They induced an edge off Nipun Perera (4) in the third over, and had Dhananjaya Lakshan and Krishan Sanjula back in the stands to stifle Sri Lanka at 48/3.
The most sickening blow, however, was still to come. Kamindu Mendis, the Sri Lanka captain, is a capable batsman, but his dismissal was disastrous  a run-out after an unfortunate miscommunication with Jehan Daniel. When Nuwanidu Fernando holed out shortly thereafter, Sri Lanka were five down and in dire straits.
It was then that Bandara and Daniel got together. They frustrated Pakistan, stonewalling as much as they could in the early stages. After settling in, they began playing their shots as well, with Daniel in particularly vengeful mood. There were some meaty blows off his willow, including a lofted six over long on. The Pakistan fielders were pushed back, the singles came easily, and their partnership burgeoned.
However, with the death overs approaching, they needed to up the scoring rate.
It ended in their falls. Daniel notched up his half-century, but then holed out off Hasan, while Bandara was clean bowled in the very next over. The tail attempted to wag, but Pakistan snuffed them out.
A dejected Sri Lanka captain Mendis proud of his teams efforts said: We fought back nicely. We gave a good fight. Were looking to do well in the Plate matches. Well try to learn from our mistakes and do well there. When it comes to fielding and bowling, we did well. We should work on a few mistakes (with the bat). We collapsed for 188, but our coaches told us not to be let down, to go and put up a fight. It was a good game. Pakistan also bowled very well, it was a good game (to play in).

Rejection of Maharagama UC nomination papers:
Pohottuwa writ petition dismissed
The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed a writ petition filed by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or Pohottuwa which challenged the Election Commissions decision to reject the nomination papers for the Maharagama Urban Council.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Nalin Perera dismissed the petition citing that there is no reason to grant relief on merits.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP in respect of Maharagama Urban Council were rejected on the grounds that it did not contain the total number of female candidates in terms of subsection (2A) of Section 28 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The SLPP was also seeking an Interim Order restraining the Elections Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Maharagama Urban Council.
Six petitioners had cited, Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Colombo District), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and two other members of Election Commission, SLFP General Secretary Dumminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim,JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva and several others as respondents.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena appeared for the Elections Commission.

Politicians, journalists have lost public trust - Media Minister
A research in the United States of America last year had showed that it was journalists and politicians who were the least trusted by the public, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
He said the most trusted were the nursing staff and teachers."I believe that the results would be the same if a similar research was conducted in Sri Lanka, Samaraweera said addressing Communication and Media Studies teachers in schools in the southern province.
The workshop was organised by the Sri Lanka Press Council.
I dont need to explain why politicians are at the bottom the list of the professions trusted by the public but I was wondering why journalists were in the same boat! It is my thinking that journalists lost public trust because through the years more and more journalists have been twisting news items as well as producing fake news.
When people realise that the news item they see or read is not the real truth there will be stage at which they will not trust journalists and media
A few years ago it was revealed that it was Sri Lankans that had searched the word sex on Google the most.
It is not possible to block any website completely as they can be viewed through proxy sites. As teachers you have a great responsibility to educate our younger generation to accept what is right and reject what is wrong and also develop self-regulation.
MP Buddika Pathirana, Government Information Director General Sudarshana Gunawardena, Sri Lanka Press Council Chairman Bandula Wellala and other officials attended the launch of the workshop held at Pearl Cliff Hotel in Matara.

Stricken Turkish plane lifted from cliff
TURKEY: Turkish engineers using two cranes on Thursday successfully lifted back to the runway a passenger plane which skidded onto a muddy embankment metres from the sea and languished there for over half a week.
The Pegasus Airlines Boeing 737-800 plane had landed normally at Trabzon airport late on Saturday on a flight from Ankara but then went off the runway just metres (feet) from the waters of the Black Sea with its wheels stuck in mud.
Since then, it has remained on the steep slope that descends from the airport apron into the sea for four days, its nose pointing down and managing to defy gravity by being stuck in thick mud.
The Turkish aviation authorities closed Trabzon airport to all air traffic so that the salvage operation could take place, with flights diverted to the nearby Ordu-Giresun airport, also on the Black Sea.
The authorities sent two cranes from Ankara and Samsun to carry out the operation which lasted for a total of 11 hours, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.
Engineers began by tying cables around the wing area of the plane in cradle fashion and also around the nose area.
Its nose pointing down and tail in the air, it was then lifted by the cranes in a hugely-delicate two hour operation before being set to rest in a horizontal position with no apparent further damage.
Crowds of locals enjoyed the spectacular and unusual event by watching outside the fence of the airport perimeter or even from boats in the sea, reports said.
It should now be emptied of the remaining fuel and taken to a hanger, where the baggage and personal possessions of the passengers will finally be removed.
All 162 passenger and six crew were safely evacuated but witnesses said at the time it was miracle there had been no casualties and the plane did not slip into the sea.
The pilot told prosecutors investigating the incident that the plane had undergone a sudden surge of power from one of the engines while taxiing on the runway.
The cause of the technical issue has yet to be made clear although images showed one of the engines had broken off and fallen into the sea. - AFP

Students should be prepared for a changing job market- Akila
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday appealed to education providers to prepare students towards a changing and varied job market.
Speaking at the opening of the Edex Expo; career and job fair organised by the Royal College Union at the BMICH, Minister Kariyawasam said, Our duty as education providers is to equip our youth to deal with this constantly changing job field and develop their skills for a varied job market.
We should also instil in children good working habits, desire and flexibility to learn new things, added the Minister quoting research which showed that by 2030, almost 10 percent of the workforce would be employed in occupations which do not exist today and typical jobs which will no longer consist of 9-5 work hours but would be based on output.
The Expo which is to be held from January 19-21 has the participation of universities and higher education institutions from 20 countries.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attended as Chief Guest and handed over the Guinness World Record certificate to the Student Association of Royal College for breaking the record for the most number of water rockets launched simultaneously.
The government on its party has identified education and skills training as one of the key factors for social and economic growth, the Education Minister said.
He stressed that their two key programmes of making 13 years of schooling compulsory for all and the introduction of technical streams to schools, will have a positive impact on getting youth involved in the countrys development.
After Grade 11, all students will be absorbed into the Advanced level class irrespective of their O/L results. These students can choose from seven career based paths if they are unwilling to pursue an academic path. Those who choose career based subjects will be given vocational and industrial training,the Minister said.

T o p e a r n i n g cricketers from across the globe
The dynamics and importance of money in cricket is an ever-changing entity. Now with an abundance of T20 leagues and franchises, players manage to pocket extravagant amounts of money from such tournaments, with IPL handing out one of the most lucrative offers to contemporary cricketers.
According to reports published after a thorough study by ESPNCricinfo, a number of questions on the financial workings of the game have been answered. While the average Indian player is perceived to earn more than his counterparts from around the globe (courtesy the hullabaloo around BCCI being money-minting lords), the reality is a little different:
The reports stated, At $23,380 per game, India's Test cricketers are the most well-rewarded across the world, earning almost twice of what an Australian cricketer gets for a home Test (Australia has different fees for home and away Tests).
It added, The figures are based on international cricket, and do not take into account player earnings from T20 leagues, other domestic engagements or endorsements.
Australian skipper Steven Smith earns the most, when it comes to annual retainer amounts and match fees alone, standing proudly at the top with the $1.47m that he is set to receive this year. The classy English cricketer Joe Root comes in next, sitting pretty on the second spot with $1.38m. And before you go pondering, Virat Kohli walks in, third on the list with a massive earning of 1m.
Smith, considered as the world's best Test batsman, earns $1.469 million per year. His Indian counterpart Kohli on the other hand also been on a record-breaking streak himself. On the field, as well as off-the-field with his humongous endorsement deals. Reportedly, Kohli has a net worth of $ 22 million.
With a staggering brand value of $144 million, and he overtook Shah Rukh Khan as the country's top-ranking celebrity brand recently. Interestingly still, Kohli has quipped that he feels like Cristiano Ronaldo.
The Portuguese earn about 40 times (ahem) of what Kohli pockets, despite the Delhite being the richest Indian athlete.

THOSE WHO STOLE PUBLIC PROPERTY WILL BE PUNISHED - PRESIDENT
The public will not be deceived by persons who are requesting them to turn back, in order to evade the governments process of bringing persons involved in stealing public property to justice, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
He made this observation at a rally held in support of Sri Lanka Freedom Party candidates competing for the up coming Local Government election in Wellawaya.
These persons are saying to the public, that their decision on January 8, 2015, was a wrong one. They are trying to deceive the people by saying this.They are requesting people to vote for them at the election on February 10, to rectify this. This is a downright lie. This country did not make a mistake that day.
It is just that everything went wrong for these thieves and burglars. President Sirisena said.
If thieves come back into power, no one will be brought to justice.We will not be able to punish anyone of them.They will destroy evidence against them. So make sure not to elect them back again,the President said.
They misused their power when they had it.The damage they did to this country is immense. I will punish those involved in the Treasury bond issue as well as the thieves involved in the questionable Treasury bond issuances from 2008 to 2014, President Sirisena also said.
Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena, Minister Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni Soyza, Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, Wellawaya SLFP Organiser Jagath Pushpakumara, former JVP MP Anuruddha Polgampola and Provincial Council member Chandana Weliwita also spoke.Maha Sangha, other religious leaders, Minister S.B.

Thierry Henry struggled at Juventus before becoming a sensation at Arsenal
When we see the countless legends the beautiful game has churned out, we always fall for their stardom. However, there is just a handful of us that try to delve into their past and learn about the hurdles they have overcome before earning a name for themselves.
Also, their fame and limelight come at a heavy price. As much as they are adored during their best days, they receive equally brutal criticism while not performing to the expected standards.
It takes a strong gut to swallow the criticism that players are often subject to, and not everyone succeeds in fighting and proving their haters wrong. It takes a combination of hard work, courage and a never-say-die attitude to silence your critics and thats what earns you loads of respect.
Here are 5 such footballers who went to become indispensable for their respective clubs after being branded as failures in the early stages of their respective careers:

The US government will award over Rs.183 million rupees ($1.2 million) to counter human trafficking in Sri Lanka over the next three years.
The US Department of States Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs will award the new project Equipping Sri Lanka to Counter Trafficking in Persons (EQUIP) to the International Labor Organization (ILO) Country Office for Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap applauded the effort, saying, The United States has a strong commitment to working with international partners to tackle the root causes of modern slavery and protect victims and vulnerable populations.
Through the EQUIP project, we will continue to support the government of Sri Lanka in combating the scourge of human trafficking,Ambassador Keshap said. This is a very timely opportunity for the ILO to step up efforts to combat human trafficking, ILO Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Simrin Singh said. Well-known ILO tools on Fair Recruitment and the application of recommendations of ILO Conventions and Protocols on Forced Labor will make a positive dent in tackling the challenges at national and grass root levels, Singh said.
EQUIP will directly assist Sri Lankan men, women, and children who are at risk and those who are victims of human trafficking.
The project will work closely with agents of change policy makers, law enforcement, recruitment agents, trade unions, as well as business  to amplify the impact of interventions and achieve lasting change.

## Title: US-Israel-India strategic alliance in the making

US-Israel-India strategic alliance in the making
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited India from January 14-18. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi went to the airport to personally greet him. Netanyahus visit reciprocated the visit of Modi to Israel last year.
The reception Netanyahu received in New Delhi is also exceptionally warm as the one Modi received in Tel Aviv. This shows the importance attached by both countries to their mutual relations. The Bharatiya Janata Party has been agitating for full diplomatic relations between India and Israel since 1991. The Congress Government subsequently established full diplomatic relations in 1992. It is a consequence of India embracing neo-liberal ideology under which it sought investments from Israeli corporate interests.
It is no secret that the United States was pressurizing India to do so. The fact that it was during the visit of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to the United States that he announced Indias decision to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel, cannot be a mere coincidence.
Israel has strong economic relations with India, especially in the fields of agriculture and defense. Nearly 300 Israeli corporations are active in India at present. Israel is the third largest seller of arms to India after Russia and the United States. India has the largest fleet of Israeli drones, even larger than that of Israel itself. Netanyahu was pressing for a speedy finalization of an FTA with India besides promoting further arms deals.
However, the significance of the visit is more political than economic. Politically, the purpose and result of the visit is to consolidate a new strategic Axis comprising the United States, Israel and India in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in its maritime space. Needless to say that such an axis would be a threat to peace (perhaps an Axis of Evil!) in the littoral states in the Indian and Pacific oceans as well as to security of navigation in international waters.
Washington has never denied its intention of forming a strategic alliance to counter China which it considers its rival and challenger. It has been supporting India and pushing it to become the regional super power to counter China. While Israel has been a traditional US ally, India has not yet been fully accommodated in the United States partnership. There is no doubt that the warming up of Indo-Israel ties has Uncle Sams blessings. With all its military and economic strength Israel cannot advance without the assistance and protection of the United States. The latter has always defended Israel saved it in many a crisis. The United States has vetoed almost all (perhaps barring one) UN Security Council resolutions that either criticized Israel or tried to impose sanctions on it.
Earth faces existential threat
A three-year streak of record hot years (2015-17), each above 1 Celsius, combined with record-breaking economic losses from disasters in 2017 should tell us all that we are facing an existential threat to the planet which requires a drastic response, according to the United Nations Secretary-Generals Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Robert Glasser.
Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said that Seventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century, and the degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional.
Warming has consequences that are even more harmful high temperatures. They include adverse weather conditions such as cyclones, floods, melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice causing rise in sea-levels and ocean acidifications.
Experts cast doubt whether the Paris Climate Accord goal of reducing global temperature by 1.50 C could be achieved at all. The decision of the United States to withdraw from the Accord is also seen as a negative development contributing to such failure.
US strangle Palestine refugees
United States Department of State announced on Tuesday that it was withholding $65m out of a $125m aid package earmarked for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). Earlier on January 3rd President Trump had threatened to cut aid to Palestinians.
For nearly 70 years, UNRWA has been the lifeline to the more than five million registered Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. It offers support in food supply, access to education, healthcare, social services and employment.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his deep "concern" about the move.
Meanwhile, Belgium has pledged to donate 19 m euro ($23m) to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees, after the US government announced it would slash its funding to the agency by half.
UNRWA was established in 1949 in order to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees, who in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War numbered about 700,000.
The agency now offers support to approximately five million Palestinians in education, healthcare and housing.

V o t e thoughtfully
I left the former government showing my opposition to fraud and corruption, and formed a new government. Is it to continue the same frauds and corruption I ask you It is true that UNP supporters voted for me, and I owe my gratitude to them. Are the UNP members attacking me to frighten me Or to chase me out I do not know whether they are doing these things with a purpose or others leading them to do such things. I walked out that day ignoring the risks I would have to face. Therefore this type of criticisms is not something new to me. Some UNP members are going round saying that the Bond Commission was appointed in order to attack the UNP. I appointed the Bond Commission in order to probe the Bond issue. I have no personal issues with anyone ... so said President Maithripala Sirisena recently.
I am sure there is a basis for his anger. However, any misappropriation of state funds becoming corruption depends on what purpose the money was used for. Throughout history we have seen political leaders illicitly using states funds, but using such money for implementation of radical political projects had never been approved by any democratic assembly; yet history had given positive verdicts.
That established the rule - end justifies the means. That is why we caution any over determination on the findings of Bond Commission. Just because the operation is illicit it does not become a crime. In politics such actions become crimes, if money is used for personnel and private family purpose or kept secretly hidden for such purpose. In the period 2008 to 2014 that happened very prominently; state funds were used not only for private purposes, but also for fascistic murders and cruel repression. The general appeal today is, not to use present Bond Commission report for political campaigns.
Lankans manipulated by racist politicians, have taken to the rule of the jungle and survival of the fittest has become the norm; what all such rulers could do was to suppress the masses who make protests, resulting in two uprisings from the economic minorities in the South and a bloody civil-war in the North that extended to East between the national and social minorities, all against the state. Today, a new mindset is needed to move away from the present extremely selfish, a deadbeat education system where students are tutored only to get through exams.
Instead we must create a holistic generation that is encouraged to think outside the box. Not only should they depend on the internet but also by absorbing the world around them to look and learn. Some suggest achieving this by changing the school curriculum to follow the Yala and Maha crop cycles, instead of the unrelated school holidays, that would give youth the chance to feel and smell the richness of the earth! Their future for Lanka lays solely in a high-tech, scientifically confirmed, chemical fertilisers free, bio-sustainable food production from agricultural science applied farming methods.
According to them, another area not well exploited by the people is the resources around them in the sea and below in the island nation. For generations Lankans have allowed other countries, particularly India to pouch into this unlimited ocean wealth while poverty has increased in the land over the same period, having missed golden opportunities to explore the ocean resources to their benefit. The fishing sector is in need of proper management for country is still importing fish for consumption. They say these are the things that should be discussed in this island-wide Local Government election.
Local Government election
The Local Governments election campaigns are on and voting is close by. This time without preferences and ward orientation compulsory, no doubt eager political and social elements will enter politics from all parties.
As political parties have fielded their candidates in a hurry, there is a chance that many fools or unfit candidates too would have received nominations to get elected to this bottom level of power. But by nominating such persons as candidates, the parties are doing a disservice to the people for they cannot put an end to the corruption, money rackets and even nepotism present in politics today and will not get the voters to breakout of the trapped incompetent backward feeling. Much worse; it is such fools and unfits who are easily moved into racist, fascist political tendencies.
They become famous politicians by shouting against minority communities. On the other hand, take the cases of the people in the northeast; for example the presence of excess Sinhala soldiers, the failure to free more Tamil land held by the military and the failure to abolish the Prevention of Terrorism Act. These are all particularly detrimental to the restoration of normalcy in this region.
However, this grievance of being trapped in impotent feeling, as shown above is not specific to the northeast or to the Tamil people, although they are the most vocal about the failings of the government to deliver on its promises. Clearly the complaint regarding the slowness of the government is more widespread.
Good governance
In Lanka all those who voted for the government to ensure that there would be good governance, expansion of democracy with a constitution acceptable to all communities and economic prosperity from all over the country are dissatisfied with the progress that has been made so far. They see the failure of the government to take those accused of corruption, abuse of power and racist fascistic oppression to trial and to prison, as indications of infirmity of those who may do the same in the future. On the other hand, the less political, larger population whose main priority is to improve their standard of living and get out of the poverty traps they are in, are disappointed that the government has patently failed to jump start the economy.
Some bourgeoisie economists demand that Lankans must accept the reality that the country as a whole is not generating enough wealth and it had been the main cause for disintegration of them into smaller groups divided by regions based on nationality and religions; while the majority dominating the minorities due to the folly of the past leaders who were stupidly hero- worshipped by the people. This is putting the cart before the horse. It is the development under Capitalism that created nationalist consciousness that was misdirected by parochial political leaders.
There were vulgar racists in the past who advised people to boycott elections as it happened at the first Provincial Council election in 1987 and later years at the 2004 general election and the whole world knows the consequences. In 88-89 the JVP led the racist campaign against devolution, parity of languages and citizenship for upcountry Tamils. They killed many people and in the end bourgeoisie state carried out a repression where nearly 40,000 disappeared. In 2005 election boycott by Tamils gave the opportunity to Mahinda Rajapaksa to win.
He destroyed the Tamil liberation and finally established a fascist regime. Today too there are theoreticians who advise people to go to polls and spoil their votes at the oncoming Local Government elections. To any sensible person it should be clear that there is no sense in wasting votes; but time is ripe now for Lankan people to shatter this barrier in their mind and break out of the trapped in feeling of incompetence, to select the right candidate to represent them at this lowest level of power, in the journey for national unity and democracy.

Vehicle imports without safety standards banned from July 1
The importation of vehicles without seat belts, air bags and anti-locking breaking system (ABS) would be prohibited from July 1 as per the budget proposals for this year.
Finance and Mass Media Ministry sources said although this measure had to be implemented since January 1 this year. It was decided to postpone the date of implementation on the request of the motor vehicle importers and manufacturers.
The Finance and Mass Media Ministry said the importers and manufacturers asked for a considerable period of time to make required adjustments to comply with the proposed emission standards and safety measures.
Accordingly, importation of motor vehicles, which are below emission standards of the Euro IV or its equivalent and not compiled with the required safety standards, would totally be prohibited.
According to the standards, the vehicles which do not carry air bags for driver and front seat passenger,Anti-locking Breaking System (ABS) and threepoint seat belts for driver and passengers traveling front and rear seats, except for the middle seat would not be allowed to be imported.
The Finance Ministry also said that since rescheduling of the implementation has been made based on the industry representations, the dealers, importers and manufacturers are strictly advised to refrain from establishing any Letter of Credit (LC) for import of motor vehicles, which would not comply with the specified standards and safety standards with an estimated arrival date after July 1, 2018.
Ministry sources also said that further details on the implementation of the new standards for vehicles, including the types of vehicles will be notified by the respective implementation agencies shortly.

Army wont have it easy against Airmen
Army Sports Club will face stiff resistance from the Sri Lanka Air Force sports Club in their Dialog A Division League rugby second round match at Air Force grounds in Rathmalana today. Kick off will be at 4.00pm.
The Airmen went down fighting to CH and FC by 12-28 in the Dialog A Division League rugby second round match at Race Course grounds last week.
This year they scored only a solitary win over the Police sports Club in the first Leg of the ongoing league tournerment and should give the soldiers a close run in todays match.
Air Force have been bolstered by the inclusion of several talented ruggerites from Kandy schools. Former Vidyartha player Radeesha Seneviratne will bind down in the third row with Dimithri Patabandi and Saraka Weralla, while another Kandy school players in Medagedara brothers (Kingswood) and Thilina Bandara will play alongside each other in the pack. In the back division former Vidyartha and Sri Lanka player Charith Seneviratne will occupy the pivotal centres berth most probably with Anthonian Jehan Seelagama while the wings will be probably manned by Isipathanian Ranindu Padmasanka and Ishara Madushan.
Army SC played a somewhat of a dejected game against Havelock Sports Club in their last game at Havelock Park thus losing the game by 8-27 after a close fight in the first half where the score read 10 points to 8 in favour of Havies at half time. Hence they will have to carry out an improved performance if they hope to beat the Air Force outfit.
Incidentally the Army SC side that turn tables on Air Force SC in their first round outing winning by a stunning 33 points to 32 at Race Course grounds, their by will go all out to get an all important victory in this game as well.
Air Force (Probable XV):
Pushpakumara Samarahewa (Captain), Lahiru Udayanga, Prasad Medagedara, Thilina Bandara, Ranil Medagedara, Dimithri Patabandi, Radeesha Ranjan, Saraka Waralla, Isuru Jayaratne and Gayantha Iddamalgoda, Kaushal Manupriya, Jehan Seelagama, Charith Seneviratne, Ishara Madushan, Nuwan Perera Army SC (Probable XV) Ashoka Jayalal , Sameera Wickramanayaka, Dillepa Niroshan, Nalaka Maduranga, Sampath Rosa, Upul Abeynayaka, Chameera Silva, Manoj Silva,Manjula Weerasinghe and Ashan Bandara, Thusitha Senanayake (Captain), Imanka Ariyapala, Madusanka Chandrasekara, Sanjeewa Hapugaskanda or Sudaraka Dikkumbura, Gayan Salinda

Bangladesh thrash Sri Lanka for biggest one day win
DHAKA, Friday - Tamim Iqbal smashed 84 as Bangladesh hit 320 and then inflicted further misery on Sri Lanka to claim their biggest win in one-day cricket on Friday.
Sri Lanka, under new coach Chandika Hathurusingha, were skittled out for 157 and the performance will set new alarm bells ringing after they lost to Zimbabwe in their previous match in the three-nation contest. But Bangladesh celebrated their victory.
If you look at (the) recent past, it is one of our best wins, said captain Mashrafe Mortaza. I think Tamim could have got a hundred. Shakib also could have gone on.
The 28-year-old left hander Tamim plundered two sixes and seven fours as Bangladesh came within four runs of their record one-day score against Sri Lanka.
He was given strong support by Shakib Al Hasan who made 67, and took three for 47 to claim man of the match honours, and Mushfiqur Rahim on 62. Tamim put on a scintillating 99 for the second wicket with Shakib before wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella successfully reviewed a not-out decision to end his 102-ball innings.
Sri Lanka, rebuilding under Hathurusingha after their worst year in international cricket, never posed a serious threat as they lost by 163 runs.
With captain Angelo Mathews missing due to injury, Thisara Perera hit the top score of 29 while wickets regularly tumbled at the other end. Hathurusingha saw his side collapse in 32.2 overs.
Perera, who took three for 60, was also his side's most effective bowler. But nothing could stop Tamim, Shakib and Rahim setting up their side's triumph.
Only some excellent bowling by Perera at the end of the Bangladesh innings prevented an even bigger defeat.
Bangladesh's win beat the 160-run victory made over West Indies in 2012. They defeated Zimbabwe by eight wickets in the first match of this tournament.
Sri Lanka play Zimbabwe in the next match on Sunday.
Mathews ruled out of two matches
Sri Lanka teams white-ball captain Angelo Mathews who suffered a right hamstring tightness, while he was batting during the Sri LankaZimbabwe game, will be out for the next two games. He missed the match against Bangladesh that Sri Lanka lost yesterday and also the return match against Zimbabwe on January 21 at Dhaka.
Dinesh Chandimal will lead the team in the absence of Mathews.
