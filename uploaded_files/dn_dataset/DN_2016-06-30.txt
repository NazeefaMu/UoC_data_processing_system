Bolt: gears up for Olympic trials

KINGSTON, WEDNESDAY: Usain Bolt will embark on the first major test of what he plans to be a triumphant swansong here Thursday as the Jamaican Olympic athletics trials get under way.
With less than 40 days to go before the Olympics, the sprint superstar will aim to seal his ticket to Rio as he targets a defence of his 100 metres, 200m and 4x100m crowns.
Bolt, who completed an unprecedented second consecutive set of victories in all three events at the London 2012 Games, is hoping to complete a remarkable Triple Triple.
So far this season, the signs have been encouraging that Bolt is firmly on track, with the 29-year-old clocking a blistering 9.88 seconds at a meeting in Kingston on June 11, the second-fastest time in the world this year.
Only France's Jimmy Vicaut, who clocked a wind-assisted 9.86sec earlier in June, has run faster this season.
Unlike the IAAF world Championships, there are no byes to the Olympics and under the rules of the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA) rules every athlete seeking to be chosen for Rio Games must compete at the trials.
Bolt's main challenge is likely to come from Yohan Blake and Nickel Ashmeade, both of whom have clocked under 10 seconds this season at 9.94sec.
Blake committed the cardinal sin of defeating Bolt at the trials for London four years ago but ultimately finished behind his training partner at the Games themselves.
With Bolt and Blake favored to take two of the 100m berths, Ashmeade will likely face competition from Asafa Powell and Kemar Bailey-Cole for the third spot.
Heats begin Thursday at Kingston's National Stadium with the final set for Friday.
While Bolt has yet to run a 200m so far this year, he will start as favorite to win over the longer distance with Ashmeade, the fastest Jamaican so far this year with 20.07sec, Julian Forte, Warren Weir and Commonwealth Games champion Rasheed Dwyer all in the mix.
In the women's events, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce will aim to book her place for Rio after a season which has been disrupted by an injury to a big toe. AFP

## Title: Rugby refereeing  standards must improve
## Supertitle:

Rugby refereeing  standards must improve

Its easy to become a referee and start refereeing! Officiating as a referee in rugby football games is largely a responsible job. There are a whole host of reasons why one might take up the whistle, to remain active in the sport following injury or retirement, to make new and lasting friends within the game, or to gain a sense of achievement by providing an invaluable service to players, coaches and spectators alike. But according to statistics rugby players who have retired from rugby are not contributing towards the advancement of the game globally.
These players should take up rugby refereeing with their knowledge and experience after hanging up their boots. Why Learning to referee rugby football games is largely a trial by fire. There is only a single referee on the field and that referee cannot change a decision once it is made, and no-one else can help although they can complain.
As far as rugby is concerned, it is a part and parcel of our culture and lifestyle that will never diminish. What is happening now is that the game is fast developing with most of the schools playing at the highest level and encouraging their players. Schools in the urban and rural areas too have taken up the game.
Rugby will go on regardless but it will also gain a great deal from the new facilities provided by the schools and their old boys rugby wing, exposing rugby at grass root level and the sponsors showing great interest to support the game.
The drawback of this fine game that is going from strength to strength is the unprofessionalism and poor quality of refereeing by some of them who control the game. It is unfortunate that although the Sri Lank Rugby Referees Society is well over 60 years in existence it is sad to say today that the referees governing body do not check the standard of refereeing in the domestic front and that is disappointing. This was very clearly evident in some of the school matches. Therefore, the Referees Society must improve in this area and lift the standard of refereeing so that referees and ruggerites enjoy the game. The present Referees boss was one of the top class referees that rugby has produced in Sri Lanka -Nizam Jamaldeen. He and his team should be given the necessary backing by the controlling body.
In some instances players and spectators have abused and threatened to assault the referee or the linesmen. Also today, touch judges seem to be interfering too much. Referee handles the whistle, and then the touch judges do their job from the side lines. Then there is a match commissioner and a citing officer, now they have TMO, to accept that referees make errors but often the TMO can change the referees opinion even though the referee can see the replay footage on the screen just as the TMO sees. TMO should be mostly treated  as a replay technician with no input to on-field decision-making.
Today rugby has had a rapid growth in our country, both in terms of number of participants and status over the past two decades is being reflected by the ever increasing spectators and media interest. All this progress and development will halt if the standard of referees does not improve with immediate effect. Today what referees need are fitness, speed and a wide knowledge of the game. The areas where our referees have to improve, is the knowledge of the advantage rule, especially in defence inside the twenty-two meter mark. There is no need to play the penalty advantage. Today referees, show that they are not relaxed in the field when they officiate in a game of rugby. Thats because they are inexperienced and do not have much exposure to handle a game of rugby.
The laws of the game of rugby are complicated because its more a game of chess than a game of draughts. Its Test cricket versus One-Day or T 20. With the complexities of the game come the complicated rules, and so the many and varied ways of interpreting them. Its the complexities that make rugby great.
It is important for the referee to establish control of the match early on. This does not mean blowing up for ten penalties in the first five minutes, but it does mean that you must establish your parameters for the game early, ignore the sideline advice, and enjoy the game.
In the good old days it was questioned whether football can learn from rugby unions attitude to referees

The prestigious Queens Club of Colombo, a 150 years old hallmark of Colonial Ceylon has undertaken the privilege of organizing this event to showcase the iconic past tennis greats and the illustrious present stars together in action.
JAT Holdings, one of the top conglomerate brands in Sri Lanka has undertaken the mantel of title sponsor for the event while Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), Cargills, National Savings Bank (NSB) and Crown Paints will sponsor the competing teams.
The teams are SLT Tuskers, Cargills Eagles, NSB Jaguars, and Crown Sharks. JAT and Queens Club have collaborated to create an event which will greatly facilitate the sport of tennis to develop to International levels while paving a platform for players to showcase their skills.
It has always given JAT great pleasure in nurturing sportsmen and women who can successfully appear in world sporting arenas. A great sportsman himself who has represented his Alma Mater in many sports, Aelian Gunawardene, Managing Director JAT Holdings said he is both proud and privileged to extend his sponsorship to Tennis as much as he has done with cricket, basketball and hockey.
Among the luminaries participating in the tournament will be leading Sri Lankan mens players such as the reigning national champion Dineshkanthan Thangarajah, the leading womens player and six-time national champion Amritha Muttiah and the current womens top seed Nethmi Waduge. The competition will also be participated by other stalwarts of Sri Lankas tennis scene such Yasitha De Silva, Nishangan Nadaraja, Sankha Athukorala Anika Seneviratne, Hasindhi Lokuge to name a few.
JATs commitment to grassroot levels sport developments will be showcased by junior players of the caliber of Avindra Perera, Vibudha Wijebandara, Archana Lokuge and Innthujan Selverathnarajah. Their youthful vim, vigour and vitality will challenge the experience of tennis greats of yester years such as Arjun Fernando, Jayendra Wijesekera, Chammika De Silva, Aasiri Iddamalgoda and Ganendran Subramaniam. This clash of stamina verses proficiency is certain to produce a contest of keen tension and spectacle.
The games will be played in a round robin format in which the top two teams will face off in the final on July 3. Each team will consist of a manager, a captain, a mens player, 2 womens players, 2 veteran players, a corporate player and a tie will consist of five (5) sets; a mens singles set, a womens singles set, an open doubles set, a junior boys singles set and a veteran doubles set. The unique nature of this tournament is the change of tennis traditional scoring format to single-set no-add scoring, which will speed up the ties and enable the fans to experience the same exhilaration and nail-biting anticipation as limited over cricket.
In its capacity as the title sponsor, JAT has helped in uplifting the standards of the club by aiding in the complete overhaul of the show courts for the event.
Adding another element of interest to the tournament will be a special competition feature called JAT PowerPoint. This feature will allow each receiving team to call for a JAT PowerPoint once in each single-set. Upon winning the point, the receiving team would get two points while losing the point the serving team will get only one point. For an example if the receiving team is trailing 15-0, it will directly get to 15-30 by winning the JAT Power Point and lose a point upon losing the Power Point.
Sri Lanka Telecoms exclusive TV platform PEO TV has undertaken the task of broadcasting the event live for the fans who will be watching with interest from the comfort of their own homes. Anilana Hotels will be the official hospitality partner supporting the competition.
Asanga Senevirathna, the tennis convener of Queens Club stated, This is a great prospect to bring the whole tennis community together and give our young players and also the fans an exciting opportunity to witness something incredible.

Thikkam Distilleries to be revived

Sangakkara names his All Time XI

NEW DELHI: Iconic batsman Sachin Tendulkar did not find a place in Kumar Sangakkara's list of all-time XI while Rahul Dravid was the lone Indian in the team selected by the former Sri Lankan skipper.
Sangakkara believes Dravid, who is currently India A coach, will be the best to complement former Australian batsman Mathews Hayden in the opening slot in the squad led by former Lankan batsman Aravinda de Silva.
"Mathew Hayden will be at the top of the order facing the first ball and to complement him, I have got Rahul Dravid," said Sangakkara in a video published on social media by the Lord's Cricket Ground.
In the batting line up, the regal left-handed batsman picked his 'all time favourite batsman' Brian Lara along with former Aussie captain Ricky Ponting.
Top all-rounder Jacques Kallis will complete the line up and erstwhile Australian wicket keeper Adam Gilchrist will be donning the gloves behind the wickets. The 46-year-old Sangakkara believes Shane Warne and Muthiah Muralitharan are the two specialist spinners who are the best he has ever seen as they can bowl well in any condition.
The fast bowling department will have legendary Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaasalong with former Pakistan pacer Wasim Akram as Sangakkara viewed him as an 'unbelievable challenge' to face.
The former Sri Lankan skipper opted for players that he had played with and against. Hence there was no mention of Donald Bradman and Viv Richards in the line-up.
Interestingly, the stylish left-hander omitted batting legend Sachin Tendulkar from his XI. In fact, no Indian other than Dravid made the cut in his elite team.
Baffled by Sanga's decision to leave out the 'God of Cricket', Indians fans questioned the reason behind the former's strange decision.
The 38-year-old informed his Twitter followers that it was hard not just to omit Sachin but also former India opener Virender Sehwag. He also added that India's current Test skipper Virat Kohli may go on to become better than all batting greats in the near future. Hence fitting all these players was not possible.
Despite Sanga's clarification, Indians fans found it hard to digest the fact a batsman with 100 international hundreds did not make it to a list of this sort.
The list in total has four Australian and three Lankan while a lone spot for Indian, Pakistan, South African and West Indian players.

Gunathilaka and Mendis were well set to take Sri Lanka to a massive total when rain interrupted play with the score on 123-1 in 18 overs. Mendis delighted the massive crowd with a superb display of stroke play and was looking good to reach his maiden ODI hundred when the rains came.
The break gave England a chance to regroup and when play resumed Mendis lost his wicket with his score on 77 scored off 64 balls with 13 fours.
Adel Rashid who picked up his wicket also dismissed Gunathilaka for 62 scored off 64 balls with seven fours. The pair added 131 for the second wicket.
Their dismissals brought the captain and vice-captain together in another fruitful stand that produced 87 for the fourth wicket.
Chandimal made 63 off 51 balls with one four and three sixes, but Mathews despite losing Seekkuge Prasanna cheaply for nine continued to attack the England bowling to reach his half century and when the innings closed had hit six fours and one six in his 54-ball innings.

Sensational teenage rider Aaron burns the track at Coimbatore

Thirteen-year-old Aaron Gunawardena riding his semi modified Suzuki Gixxer 150 stunned Indian riders when he posted the fastest timing at practice and qualifying in the under 24 one make event at the Kari Speedway Circuit in Coimbatore. Most of the Indian riders were amazed as Aaron has never seen or ridden the circuit before and never had a go on a Suzuki Gixxer.
The young pacesetter not only ended up winning both his events but helped many Indian riders improve by using his racing lines to corner and exit faster. Suzuki India has their eyes glued on the young Lankan and fervently hopes he would be able to participate at their championships in future, as most of the under 24 riders ended up bettering their all-time lap records, and beating all riders from the open event too.
Aarons performance has not only secured a slot for him in the Indian Championships, it has also opened doors for elder brother Jaden to run in the higher capacity events in India.
