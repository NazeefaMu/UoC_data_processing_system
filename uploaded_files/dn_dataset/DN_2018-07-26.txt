SC acts on police brutality:
Batti paid compensation
The Supreme Court yesterday ruled that the Fundamental Rights of a woman who police claimed as a commercial sexual worker have been infringed by police following the brutal assault at the Ratnapura Bus Stand in 2014, after she refused to provide sexual services free.
The Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundera and Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya ordered a police sergeant who was then attached to the Ratnapura Police Station to pay a compensation of Rs.55,000 as damages to the victim before December 31 this year.
The State was also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.5,000 as damages to the victim before the above mentioned date.
The petitioner W.A.Kanthilatha alias Batti (38), had filed a fundamental rights petition against police brutality at the Ratnapura bus area seeking Rs. 50 million as compensation.
The petitioner had cited Ratnapura Police Station OIC, SSP and the Police Spokesperson and the IGP as respondents.
In her petition, Kanthilatha said she was approached by a Police Sergeant stationed at the Bus Stand area and requested for sexual services free.
When she refused his advances, he had then requested half a bottle of arrack which request also she refused. Then the said police personnel told her, You will see what I can do, the petitioner said.
The petitioner said when she was roaming around the bus stand on September 6, 2014 she had a commotion with another commercial sex worker, who was good with police officers in the waiting area and there was a heated exchange of words. Suddenly she had found the said police officer behind her demanding why she came to the area she was told not to come.
Then the police officer had started assaulting her with a thick cane in public and he had caught her by her hair and beat her on the ground and kicked her in the back which had been videoed and uploaded in the Internet by someone, the petitioner further stated.
The petitioner further said she was approached by another police officer who offered her Rs 3,000 to settle the dispute.
She also sought a declaration from court that her fundamental rights to freedom from torture, right to equality and equal protection of the law, freedom from arbitrary arrest had been violated by the respondents.
Counsel Lakshan Dias with Niranga Pushpakumara and Udul Premaratne appeared for the petitioner.

I will not go quietly, says Paisley in face of by-election threat
Ian Paisley will not go quietly into the night following his failure to declare two luxury family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, the Irish Independent reported.
Paisley has been suspended by the Democratic Unionist Party and will also be excluded from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days from September 4 following a major breach of parliamentary rules.
Electoral authorities in Northern Ireland are to begin drawing up measures which could see him face a by-election if enough constituents demand it.
But the North Antrim MP has vowed to fight for his seat if he faces the electorate. If 10pc of his constituents sign a petition, an election will be called.
Paisley told his local paper, the Ballymena Guardian, he deeply regretted his actions.
He said: There are also some who would have me booted out of parliament and a by-election called to fill that vacancy.
They are opportunists, some with questionable motives, and I can tell them that I have no intention of going quietly into the night. If a petition leads to a by-election, make no mistake about it, I will seek re-election as I have never run away from an election in my life and dont intend to do so now.
Paisley has denied having any ulterior motive for the genuine mistake in 2013, adding that he accepted his total failure and offered an unreserved apology to the House of Commons.
The Commons Standards Committee report said the cost of the hospitality may have been significantly more than Paisleys 50,000 (56,000) estimate, with the holidays including business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels and more for him and his wider family. Paisley is one of 10 pro-Brexit Democratic Unionists currently helping to prop up Theresa Mays minority Government.
A DUP statement said it took the matter very seriously.
The party officers have decided to suspend Ian Paisley MP from membership of the party pending further investigation into his conduct, it said.

The enduring lesson of July 1983, after 35 years:
Never again
July 23 marked the 35th anniversary of one of post-independent Sri Lankas darkest chapters, the July 1983 pogrom against Tamil civilians throughout the country. The pogrom was sparked by an ambush of an Army patrol in Jaffna, by the LTTE, then one of several militant groups operating in the North, in which the entire platoon of 13 soldiers was wiped out.
A couple of days later, as the bodies of many of the soldiers were brought to the General Cemetery in Colombo for burial with full military honours, an anti-Tamil pogrom commenced. Several thousand Tamil people were murdered throughout Sri Lanka and many more were displaced. Thirty-five years later and 10 years after the war which it sparked has ended, we can look back now at this shameful chapter in Sri Lankas history and learn some lessons for our slowly progressing post-war reconciliation process.
Current and prior responses
Thirty-five years after the fact, the response of the Sri Lankan state to July 83 has been more thoughtful and meaningful. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera were in Jaffna on the occasion and engaged in a series of measures including the launch of Enterprise Sri Lanka in the North, laying out a vision for a future of hope, engaging with the people, and very importantly, for womens issues, cancelling micro credit loans up to Rs.100,000, mostly for the single-women-headed households, among other measures. Prior to that, in July 2004, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had issued a national apology for the July 83 riots as an interim reconciliation measure and appointed a special commission to pay compensation to victims who lodged claims with the Commission.
The initial response, however, by the Sri Lankan state and the political establishment in 1983 was a disaster and weakened democratic and pluralist Sri Lanka and strengthened extremism, the direct beneficiaries of which were the LTTE in the North and the JVP in the South, the latter which launched its own second insurrection several years later, in 1988.
Basically, the Sri Lankan state failed to protect her Tamil citizens from gross violence and accordingly demonstrated a significant state failure in that the most fundamental of state responsibilities, the protection of life (of persons) and property. The name of a then well-known Cabinet minister was often mentioned as an instigator, organiser and patron of the anti-Tamil violence, which, as is often the case with political violence, is not spontaneous but organised. President J.R. Jayewardene was silent for several days as Sri Lanka burned and only emerged later to express his empathy with the just outrage of the majority community, thereby transforming the discourse on Tamil militancy, as an attack on a pluralist Sri Lanka to a Sinhala-verses-Tamil conflict. Sri Lanka burned for nearly 25 years thereafter, and now, a decade after the end of the war, there are lessons to be learnt from those failures of July 1983.
Delegitimisation of democratic Tamil politics
The anti-Tamil riots of 1983 were not without consequences. The Tamil militancy movement which was still very much on the fringes of Tamil politics was vastly strengthened as the democratic Tamil political leadership lost legitimacy in the light of their inability to get the Sri Lankan state machinery to ensure the basic physical and economic security of the Tamil people. Further, the Sri Lankan state lost legitimacy in the eyes of the Tamil community, as articulated best by former TULF Member of Parliament, the late Neelan Tiruchelvam, who described it as the anomaly of imposing a mono-ethnic state on a multiethnic polity. The Sri Lankan state began to be increasingly seen, and perhaps also acting, as a Sinhala state rather than a pluralistic, multiethnic and inclusive state.
With the escalation of the armed conflict following July 83, any accountability for the gross violations of human rights which occurred, including that most basic human right - the right to life, was never ensured by the state, until perhaps President Kumaratungas Commission, 21 years later. However, the low-key nature and relative lack of publicity given to the initiative due to naysayers even within her own Cabinet meant that many victims as well as the general public were generally unaware of the same.
The recent lesson
It is to the credit of Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans that July 1983 was never repeated though the LTTE escalated violence thereafter. However, the mentality, the politics and rhetoric which enabled and created July83 has sadly not entirely left our public discourse. When the LTTE attacked the Army, the countermeasures should have been solely a state response against the perpetrators and not rampaging mobs against innocents. To our collective shame, an entire ethnic minority countrywide were targetted, innocent men, women and children.
Worryingly, the same rhetoric is emanating from the self-proclaimed saviours of the Sinhala people today in relation to the Muslim community. We, and democratic Sri Lanka, need to be protected from these protectors. As the Maha Nayaka Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, the Most Venerable Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera observed after the anti-Muslim violence in Kandy, there is no need for Balsenas and Balakayas when we have a democratic state and security structures. In the post-war decade since 2009, imaginary and perceived threats from the Muslim community are being bandied about to instigate mini-pogroms from Dharga Town to Ampara and Digana.
Today terrorist groups like ISIS are household names and claim to wage their war on Islamic principles and for Muslim objectives. However, we cannot concede to a self-appointed violent few, the mantle and leadership of the whole. ISIS never represents Muslims, while 969 in Myanmar cannot be considered as representing the Bamar people of Myanmar nor indeed did the LTTE during the war years, legitimise its self-appointed claim to represent the Tamil people. Most interestingly, the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) which contested the 2015 general elections basically lost their deposits with a few hundred votes per electoral division in the Sinhala constituencies. Perhaps the most enduring lesson of July 83 should be never again and violent extremism should always be challenged and not allowed to flourish.

Action plan to protect Yala National Park
Yala, as an internationally renowned wildlife park, has attracted a large number of international and national visitors annually. The majestic leopard endemic to Sri Lanka is one of the main tourist attractions of this wild life park.
While this interest in wildlife is remarkable and certainly positive for revenue collection, the increasing effects of over-visitation is posing a great threat of damage to the park and to its wildlife.
Numerically, visitation has increased from 43,368 visitors in 2008 to 545,007 visitors in 2015. This is an increase of over 1000 percent in 7 years. This has resulted in an average of 250 vehicles entering Yala Block 1 per day with increased numbers during holiday seasons, often exceeding 700 vehicles per day.
To curb this over visitation, the Yala Sub-committee of the Prime Ministers office has formulated to create a path towards a more sustainable management of the Yala national park. Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and the Tourist Board are the main stake holders of this sub-committee while the Policy Development Office (PDO) of the Prime Ministers Office act as the monitoring organization of this Sub-committee.
An action plan for improving the overall wildlife tourism experience in Yala national park was initially compiled by the Department of Wildlife Conservation in March, 2017. The progress of the action plan for the period from January to June 2018 has been recently sent to the PDO by the DWC.
The action plan is divided into three sections namely, Short-term, Medium-term and Long-term actions. As for the progress report of the action plan, the following actions have been already implemented/partially implemented so far.
Short term actions - Patrolling of at least two DWC vehicles in the park between 6am-10am and 2pm-6pm daily; DWC to permit entry and exit times to be decided on dawn and dusk timing; introducing rotational closure of Yala Block 1,3,4 and 5 for three months periods beginning with Yala Block 1.
Medium-term actions - Yet to be implemented.
Long-term actions  Introducing a phased programme to gradually limit the number of vehicles entering Yala Block 1 in conjunction with the improvement of wildlife sightings in Yala Blocks 3,4,5 and other developments in adjacent national parks.
Yala wildlife park is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka. As a valuable tourist attraction, it is important to protect this national heritage site of Sri Lanka. The initial step taken in this regard by the relevant authorities should be greatly appreciated.

Akila warns of conspiracy to cripple school education system
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam on Tuesday warned of a conspiracy by certain trade unions which are trying to cripple the school education system by making unfair demands.
Minister Kariyawasam while requesting the trade unions in the education sector not to use school children as a cats paw to achieve their narrow political objectives, stressed that an investigation would be initiated against those who are attempting to cripple the school education sector.
The Minister was speaking at a press conference at the Ministry premises yesterday. He condemned the Trade Unions attempt to go for a strike on July 26, obstructing the school examinations.
Kariyawasam added that the Ministry has received a number of complaints against educational authorities who have intimidated principals,teachers and students with the backing of certain trade unions.
The Minister added that the trade unions in the education sector have degenerated to such levels that they have resorted to threaten the teachers and principals who are prepared to report for duty on July 26 .
The Ministry is making arrangements to provide delayed promotions, increments to officials in the education sector who were penalised due to political and other reasons during the previous regime, Minister Kariyawasam added.
He added that this process is implemented in a transparent manner and no such officers have been granted posts.
Only those who were proved to have been political victimised during the last regime have been granted grade promotions and the relevant salary increments.
The Education Minister added that trade unions can go before courts, if Ministry has granted grades or promotions to unqualified officials.

Anil Kapoor   plays a singer after   three decades
Even though we have seen Anil Kapoor in some intriguing roles in the past, in Fanney Khan, he will be playing a singer. Incidentally, Anil played a similar role almost three decades ago and if you dont remember the film, let us remind you that it is for Woh 7 Din. The film also featured Padmini Kolhapure and Naseeruddin Shah.
The unconventional love story, which released in 1983, featured Anil Kapoor as a struggling musician who is trying to find a foothold in the city. On the other hand, Fanney Khan features Anil as a die-hard fan of Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammad Rafi and he also plays a musician and vocalist in an orchestra with a magical voice.
Although his dreams of becoming a popular singer are shattered, Anil harbors dreams of making his daughter, Lata Sharma as a star singer. Played by Pihu Sand, the film also touches upon issues like body-shaming. In order to help support his family, Anil Kapoor takes up taxi driving in the film and yet he tries every possible way to get his daughter on stage and make her a popular singer.
Starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as the star singer and Rajkummar Rao who essays the role of Anils partner-in-crime and Aishwaryas love interest, Fanney Khan marks the directorial debut of Atul Manjrekar.
The film is inspired by the popular Dutch film Everybodys Famous! and is adapted to suit the Indian sensibilities. The film, produced under banners of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and T-Series, is slated to release on August 3.

Chocolate milk for breakfast
Adding a glass of milk, with high-quality protein, on the side is an easy, delicious way to get closer to all the energy you need for the day. Most of the children prefer chocolate milk compared to white milk. No doubt, this is confusing for parents as they wonder whether chocolate milk is good enough for their growing child
White and chocolate milk both contain a unique combination of 16 nutrients, including bone-building calcium and vitamin D. Chocolate milks appealing taste, wide availability and excellent nutritional profile make it a good choice over less nutritious sweet drinks such as soft drinks and artificial fruit drinks.
Enjoying some chocolate milk and other flavoured milk, as part of a healthy diet, can help all members of the family meet their recommendations for milk and alternatives.
Heres a list of nutrients found in chocolate milk and what they can do, if you get enough:
Protein: Helps build and repair body tissues, including bones and muscles, and builds antibodies that fight infection.
Vitamin A: Aids bone and tooth development. Also aids in the maintenance of night vision and healthy skin.
Vitamin B12: Aids in red blood cell formation.
Vitamin B6: A factor in energy metabolism and tissue formation, including bones.
Riboflavin: A factor in energy metabolism and tissue formation.
Niacin: Aids in normal growth. A factor in energy metabolism and tissue formation, including bones.
Thiamine: Releases energy from carbohydrate and aids normal growth.
Pantothenic Acid: A factor in energy metabolism and tissue formation, including bones.
Folate: Also known as folic acid and folacin, aids in red blood cell formation.
Vitamin D: Enhances calcium and phosphorus absorption, on which strong bones and teeth depend.
Calcium: Aids in the formation and maintenance of strong bones and healthy teeth.
Magnesium: A factor in the health of bones and teeth, energy metabolism and tissue formation.
Phosphorus: A factor in the formation and maintenance of strong bones and healthy teeth.
Potassium: Aids in the correct functioning of nerves and muscles.
Zinc: A factor in tissue formation, including bones, and energy metabolism.
Selenium: An antioxidant involved in the formation of protein.

Chocolate milk generally contains no more sugar than unsweetened apple juice, and a good portion of that is the naturally occurring sugar, lactose, which is also found in white milk. Studies show that the diets of children who drink chocolate or other flavoured milks contain no more added sugar than those who consume no chocolate milk.
AN IDEAL POST-RECOVERY DRINK 
A growing body of research suggests that chocolate milk may be an ideal post workout recovery drink, especially when consumed within 30 minutes of intense physical activity.
About 85 per cent water and low in fat, chocolate milk rehydrates while providing a unique carbohydrate-protein combination that aids in the quick recovery of muscle tissue and replenishes electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, lost through sweating.

Alternative measure to death penalty
The European Union is opposing the re-introduction of the Death Penalty although our serious crime rates like the rate for murder and child abuse are a world record. Although this is an unwarranted interference in our domestic policies we are not in a position to say boo to a goose. We may have to comply.
What alternative measures can we take to reduce the serious crimes rate We may have to streamline our punishments. Are our prisoners treated with a kid glove Do we treat them too softly in prison Should we not work to death those murderers who have been given the death penalty Should not all benefits and concessions be withdrawn from them since they cannot be hanged Where is the deterrent effect in our present treatment of convicted prisoners
Isn't it necessary to review the present concessions given to those who have been given the death penalty since it cannot be carried out now

President urges international community:
Close anti-corruption loopholes
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday called for the closing of loopholes in global anti-corruption laws and greater international cooperation to expedite action against corruption.
Addressing a forum of anti-corruption experts from around the world in Colombo, President Sirisena said the lack of cooperation from other countries has hampered the Governments efforts to investigate the corrupt dealings of several Sri Lankans hiding in overseas locations.
Pointing out that there are several shortcomings in international laws and regulations used for anti-corruption drives, the President said: Several local persons responsible for mega scale fraud and corruption are hiding in other countries. But certain regulations of those countries including immigration and emigration laws, visa rules, residential laws and regulations have become a challenge and a great hindrance to work against them. Our investigation bodies face difficulties when conducting investigations into those suspects as we do not receive the due support of those countries.
The President was addressing a meeting of the UN Expert Group on Jakarta Principles which began in Colombo as the Chief Guest yesterday morning. Adapted by experts and practitioners at a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2012, the Jakarta Principles aim to strengthen the effectiveness and independence of anti-corruption authorities around the world.
As a result of not having proper international assistance, the process of launching investigations into fraud and corruption and apprehending suspects is hampered.
In this regard, the President highlighted the need for coming to a common platform to act against fraud and corruption with the assistance of other countries.
However, we will not be daunted by these challenges. Sri Lanka will be elevated to the top ranking among countries fighting corruption, the President asserted. The President said Sri Lanka is being converted to a corruption free country aiming to achieve the highest place in the Anti-corruption Index. He was determined to achieve this feat during his period in office to drive the country towards prosperity sans bribery and corruption. The President highlighted the steps that will be taken to ensure a corruption free country. Qualified professionals will be recruited to fight corruption. He pointed out the need to work with all national and international stakeholders that work against bribery and corruption to reach a common goal.
The President said as he promised at the 2015 Presidential Election, most of the executive powers vested with the Executive Presidency could be removed with the assistance of Constitutional Council.
It is a move to strengthen democracy, freedom and fundamental rights and as a whole and a victory for the people of the country. We have strengthened the judiciary while removing political interference. No telephone calls change the freedom of judges now. The Bribery or Corruption Commission has also been empowered through necessary changes in Parliament to fight against misconduct and ensure freedom to work without any political interference, he explained.
The parley is co-hosted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery of Corruption (CIABOC) in Sri Lanka, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
Present and former heads of anti-corruption authorities from over 30 countries and international anti-corruption experts are attending the three day meeting at the Taj Samudra hotel in Colombo.
Attorney General, Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, Bribery Commission Chairman, former Supreme Court Judge Justice T.B. Weerasooriya, Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC and other commissioners and Candice Weisch, Head of Anti Corruption Economics Crimes branch of the United Nations, Programme Manager of the UNDPs Global Anti-corruption Initiative, Commissioner of the Anti-Corruption program of Indonesia Laode M.Syarif, Malaysias Attorney-General and Anti - Corruption Chief, Abu Kassim bin Mahomed, Secretary to the President Udaya R.Senaviratne, former Secretary to the President Austin Fernando and representatives of civil society were present.
[NEW ANTI-GRAFT LAWS IN LINE WITH JAKARTA PRINCIPLES - DG]
The new anti-graft legislation being drafted will be in line with the Jakarta Statement on Principles for Anti Corruption Agencies, Bribery Commission Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC said.
He was speaking at the inauguration of the Global Expert Group Meeting (GEGM) on the Jakarta Principles held in Colombo yesterday.
The commission is currently in the process of drafting a new Bribery Act and amending the current Declaration of Assets and Liabilities law.
Speaking in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena, the DG committed to bring in these imminent reforms to anti-graft legislation in conformity with the Jakarta Principles.
Adopted by experts and practitioners at a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2012, the Jakarta Principles aim to strengthen the effectiveness and independence of anti-corruption authorities around the world. The GEGM was co-hosted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery of Corruption (CIABOC) in Sri Lanka and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Complete a degree whilst still in school at ESOFT
ESOFT, a premier private sector higher education network in Sri Lanka with over 40 branches islandwide, offers qualifications from various esteemed international partners who are mostly from the UK and is an institution offering a wide range of demand-driven qualifications.
Having recognised the need for young individuals to possess a degree as a basic qualification for job application, ESOFT has decided to launch the all-new Teen Graduate Program. Designed for gifted youngsters studying in grade 7, 8 or 9, this program ensures that teens are armed with a valid degree while they study for their A/L exams. The Teen Graduate Program would also act as a boost for students that learn IT in school. When a student in grade 7, 8 or 9 joins the Teen Graduate Program at ESOFT, they first go through a foundation program with selected components from one or more of ESOFTs Pearson assured Diploma Programs. The foundation level focuses on improving English and IT skills to improve the childs capability and maturity to a level that allows them to study a First Year Degree curriculum.
The First Year is the Certificate level awarded by BCS HEQ, which is a professional qualification awarded by the British Computer Society, the Chartered Institute for IT. The Certificate course which is the equivalent of Year 01 of a University Honours Degree in England (UK NQF level 4) covers the essential core subjects of ICT with 3 mandatory modules.
The Second Year, which is the Diploma level, is also awarded by BCS HEQ. It covers a mandatory core module - Professional Issues in IS practice, and a choice of 3 modules out of a total of 9, depending on the students selected career path. The qualification is equivalent to Year 02 of a University Honours Degree in England (UK NQF level 5).
The BCS HEQ is accessible to anyone regardless of entry qualifications and allows children to be channelled towards a clear path to an IT degree.
The Third Year is a Top-Up Degree awarded by London Metropolitan University UK, a public research university that dates back to 1848. Renowned for their graduates employability, the university offers about 160 academic programmes ranging from undergraduate to postgraduate qualifications.

Death penalty for drug traffickers, regardless of GSP Plus
Co-cabinet spokesperson, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the Government would forge ahead with the death penalty directive given by President Maithripala Sirisena even if it leads to the loss of GSP Plus.
He was responding to criticism levelled by the European Union and other countries over the Governments decision to enforce the death penalty for drug traffickers.
Speaking at the Cabinet press conference yesterday, the Minister clarified that the death penalty would be implemented on those who were already convicted on drug related offences and who continue to trade drugs while being behind bars.
A list 19 such individuals drafted by the intelligence services have been forwarded to the Justice Ministry so that the government can carry out the death sentence, he said.
The Minister stated that the Presidents directive is to mainly address the issues Sri Lanka is having with previously convicted drug traffickers who continue to engage in the trade.
Investigations by Police Narcotics Bureau revealed some suspects arrested for the possession of heroin had been acting on the orders of an inmate at Welikada who is already serving a life sentence for drug related offences. A concurrent investigation by the PNB over the arrest of another individual with 103 kg of heroin revealed that the suspect had been in touch with eight prison officials. Referring to this incident, the Minister said these prison officers will be severely dealt with under the law for aiding drug traffickers.

Death penalty will be implemented - SLFP Media Spokesman
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Media Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisena has assured that there is no second word on the death penalty which has been approved unanimously by the Cabinet of Ministers for convicted drug traffickers who are still engaging in drug dealings from inside the prisons.
Although there is pressure from several countries and organisations not to implement the death penalty, the President has been very firm in his decision and the death penalty would be implemented Minister Samarasinghe said.
We are ready to go anywhere and explain why it was necessary to impose the death penalty for drug traffickers who are on deathrow as the entire country is adversaly affected by the drug menace, the Minister said.
If we do not take urgent measures to address this issue by now, the future of our next generation would be in danger, he added.
He said that intelligence units have already informed the President that convicted drug traffickers on deathrow are engaged in the drug dealings.Since the entire Cabinet of Ministers have agreed to this decision, it is the bounden duty of all to support this effort, Minister Samarasinghe said.
A total of 54 countries retain the death penalty in law while 105 countries have abolished it for all crimes, with an additional 29 countries abolishing the death penalty in practice.
Commenting on the loan repayment for the Hambantota Harbour, the Minister said that loan installments of the harbour will be paid by the Treasury and not the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Minister Samarasinghe said that the Treasury has received US974 million from China and another US$ 146 million will be received in the future. This money will be utilised for the direct investment in the harbour on the agreement between China and Sri Lanka, the Minister said.

Fisheries: Forex lost through post-harvest losses
The annual post-harvest loss in the fisheries sector is around 40 percent, according to the surveys conducted by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Department.
A spokesman revealed that the fish that has to be discarded is not even good for producing dry fish. The fisheries community unions have pointed out that since the ban imposed on fish exporting has been lifted by the EU, valuable foreign exchange which could be earned is lost through post-harvest losses.
It has been estimated that if the present post-harvest loss is avoided, the contribution of this sector to the GDP could be increased from 1.4 percent to 5 percent.
The department is launching a programme to reduce the post-harvest loss by conducting awareness programmes for fishermen, modernising fishing boats, introducing high-tech fisheries machinery, and advising farmers to use quality ice and water to keep fish fresh, using modern fish unloading systems, and upgrading freezing facilities at fishery harbors.
It is hoped to make the fishery industry the third-largest contributor towards the GDP. The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry gets substantial technical advice and financial aid from major fish producing and processing countries including Norway.

All hail the end of a busy and match specific month on planet Sri Rugby.
Schoolboy rugby particularly fabulous and really a great potential of winning new hearts, plus a new generation of adoring fans, who will follow these young gladiators, to the ends of our remarkable earth..rain or shine.
Sri islanders rugby certainly glamorous enough and defiantly making a comeback as the islands most successful and popular sport.
Naturally Sri cricket...and only international limited overs format, command the fans and fanatical following.
Domestically rugby is miles ahead both at school and club levels...with the singular exception of the traditional big match phenomenon.
This season club rugby was a Kandy story and sincere graft from Havelocks, CR, Navy, plus a resurgent CH.
But Kandy were bottom line ...professional, consistent and oozing with talent from prop to full back.
The Kandy bench depth too strong and hard to match all through the intense, unforgiving Dialog league and knockouts.
All told, bar a few errors, the team to beat led by the upcountry champ the much chastised, but still sharp Gayan Weeraratne was Kandy all season long.
Looking forward to that performance pendulum swinging between CR, Havies and CH for sure.
Sri Lanka Rugby, former SLRFU, carries our resilient elephant forward, contemplating a massive integrated pro active team buzzing with ideas and plenty of inherited rugby acumen.
Lasitha Bonsa Gunaratne, definitely has some XXXL shoes to fill after Asanga really set our island code on the right path.
Investment and brand partnerships breaking and breathing a new lease of life from the ground up.
This formidable rugby union edifice has to be acknowledged as the future and sustainability at all costs.
The new era demands maximum from administration and players alike.
Expectations bubbling past phenomenal, whichever angle you approach it from.
Time for our spanking new rugby executive to set the bar at a maximum unheard of in Sri Paradise.
Achievement and high performance the significant signature tune at Independence Square. My belief is a simple ambition to be the most competitive, most dynamic and biggest heart in Asia.
With that defined silk route...we must harness all the rugby Intel and IQ possible...Priyantha E, Rohan G, Rizly I, Nazeem M, Dilroy F, Tony A, Michael Jaya, Rohan Abey, Rohantha P, Hisham Abd, Nalin de S, Marso H, Duminda de S, Saman Jaya, Jamaldeen, Marikkar Imt, plus pure adrenaline experience in the middle for Sri Lanka the best qualifying status going.

Germany-SL Trade Grow by 40% in 3 Years  Ambassador Rohde
Bilateral trade between Germany and Sri Lanka has grown steadily by 40% during the last three years and Germany was optimistic of Sri Lankas further potential, Ambassador of Germany to Sri Lanka Jrn Rohde said recently.
We are not here to connect only the governments but also its people. Key areas are increasing business relations between Germany and Sri Lanka. Last few years trade between Germany and Sri Lanka grew by 40%. Last year alone German exports to Sri Lanka grew by eight per cent, said Ambassador Rohde who was the chief guest at an annual event of one of Germanys foremost global manufacturers in the field of electrical and building installation technology  OBO Bettermann Holding GmbH & Co. KG.
This year in March we opened a German trade delegation in Sri Lanka. The opening of this trade will ensure that trade between the two countries will boom. In fact, this year Germany and Sri Lanka celebrated 65 years of diplomatic relations. We are hopeful of greater ties between the two countries, he added.
I am extremely happy to be here. I wont relate too much on OBO Bettermann because I dont know too much about its line of business. But when I saw the motto  Thinking connected, I guess we are in the same line of business as we are trying to do the same things. My line of business is connecting Germany with Sri Lanka, not only governments but also its peoples, iterated the Ambassador.
OBO Bettermann which globally has over 4,000 employees, is spread across 60 countries and 40 subsidiaries in Europe and overseas. The brand has been in Sri Lanka since the mid nineties, and started its own office in 2011.
It is a great honour and privilege for me to be in Sri Lanka for this momentous occasion. We build connections through devices and equipment that conduct electricity, route data and control energy, Ralf Hennemann Director of Sales and strategy for Sri Lanka, Middle-East and North Africa said addressing the gathering.
Hardi Jabir, Director of Sales and Marketing for Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Maldives iterated that the Company strives for the greatest-possible transparency for its employees and customers and towards this end, all of the Companys objectives, processes and data are continuously measured, depicted and, wherever possible, improved on.(AK)

Govt. to write-off loans given to women in drought-affected districts
This scheme of relief initially will be limited to women who have obtained micro finance loans for non-consumption purposes in the drought-affected districts. The 12 districts that were affected by the recent drought are Trincomalee, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa where cultivations were affected consecutively for five seasons.
Accordingly, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that women who obtained such loan amounting to Rs 100,000.00 and below can apply for complete write off of the interest and the capital payment.
The General Treasury will reimburse the loss incurred by the micro finance companies for having written off the capital component.
The government has allocated Rs.500 million for this year to initiate the reimbursement programme. The micro finance companies will have to absorb the interest component of the loan written off.
The persons who are benefitted by this debt relief programme will be included on a priority basis to provide new loan facilities from interest subsidy loan scheme launched under the Enterprise Sri 201807-24 Lanka programme with a maximum of two year grace period. Further, they will also be given priority under Governments subsidised programmes and other rural livelihood schemes implemented through co-operative societies as envisaged in the Budget -2018 proposal.
Micro finance institutions are currently providing micro loans without collateral through a door-to-door strategy of high interest rate loans amounting to 40 percent to 220 percent per annum for women seeking economic activities and income generation sources. When multiple loans are obtained under micro finance scheme, people have to pay much higher interest than the initial loan amount due to higher interest premium. Therefore, the government has taken the timely action to protect the rural women from falling in to a debt trap by imposing an interest rate cap of 30 percent on future loans.

Hygge in  Copenhagen
Denmarks capital city, Copenhagen, is known as the happiest city in the world. For world-renowned Danish author, the late Hans Christian Anderson, it was a wonderful city. Today, the tourists who flock to Copenhagen cant help falling in love with this happy and wonderful city for its rich culture and ambience coupled with vast entertainment activities. A statue of Anderson, best known for his fairy tales, sits alongside the main Municipal Council hall of the city centre - as if he is still enjoying the wonderful feeling of the city. These were my first impressions of Copenhagen as a first-time traveller to the city.
The day I visited the city centre along with a group of Asian journalists, there was a carnival atmosphere everywhere with hundreds of football fans and seasonal tourists enjoying the sports spirit.
Danes often use the word hygge (pronounced hoo-geh) in Danish to express the feeling of this good social atmosphere and happiness  which we too enjoyed for a moment.
One of the most exciting things we noticed as novice travellers to Copenhagen was its bicycle culture. Our host, Dorte Maach (Manager, Group Communications of Grundfos Denmark) told us Danes love their bikes - it is one of Europes most bicycle-friendly cities where half the people pedal to work. There seem to be special bike lanes everywhere. Dorte often reminded us about the cycle lanes and to make way for cyclists. There are also plenty of places where visitors can hire bikes to explore the city if not rickshaws are also a common facility of the city. Most of us preferred to walk because it was one of the best ways to see the city and experience its vibrancy.
Since the city area is flat and built around waterways, it is also convenient to walk around the city covering some of the key points of interest such as City Hall Square, the Central Station and shopping and restaurant lanes. Besides, visitors are also interested in its royal palaces, Viking history, colourful houses along the Nyhavn canal and waterfront.
Nyhans glamour
We were told, around this time of the year, the city transforms into a magical metropolis with thousands of visitors and pleasant weather. Moreover, picturesque Copenhagen is a photographers dream. One of the best ways to see the city is to take a boat ride; the boats depart from Nyhavn, the old harbour and also one of the biggest attractions of the city. Along the waterfront are some of the most photographed colourful buildings of Copenhagen. Boats from Nyhavn drift past landmarks such as the Amalienborg Palace, home of Denmarks royal family, Copenhagen Opera House, the Black Diamond library and student accommodation made from freight containers and the famous Little Mermaid statue. Our host Dorte organized a lovely boat tour for us and the fellow journalists with a photographic-eye took the advantage of this tour to capture some of the best shots of the city on that sunny afternoon.
We also got the opportunity to visit Copenhagens famous amusement park known as Tivoli. It is the worlds second-oldest amusement park opened in 1843. Tivoli is open in summer from April to September. Theres no euro in Denmark; their currency, the Danish Krone is quite strong and one Krone is equivalent to Rs. 25.
Dining
Dining in Copenhagen is a delightful experience with restaurants serving an array of food - from open sandwiches and salmon delicacies to organic chocolates. However, the city is one of the most expensive places in Europe. Our host Dorte was keen to introduce us to original Danish cuisines and took us through some of the memorable, celebratory meal experiences at famous restaurants such as Flammen or Hereford Beefstouw. Flammen is an ideal place for foodies; it offers a large array of dishes that are almost works of art.
For a quick bite or an open sandwich (Danes love their open sandwiches), Tivoli Food Hall would be the best. The issue that the visitors often encounter in Copenhagen is the competition for tables and the poor service.
Danes love recycling. They have clean harbours and shops selling clothes made of organic bamboo. Most food served in public institutions is organic. By 2025, Copenhagen plans to be the worlds first carbon-neutral capital.
During a short stay in Copenhagen recently, we experienced some memorable moments which are better seen than explained.

Innovative initiation for road-management
Our roads are getting dead slow and deadlier by the year. Road trauma, road congestion and road indiscipline have not been adequately addressed by successive governments, highway authorities and the Police over the years.
It is now a herculean task and needs a more dynamic, holistic and an integrated approach by all stakeholders in traffic and highway management to minimize road fatalities, congestion and prevalent road transport conflicts. To execute such an action plan a stronger political will is fundamental and with a higher order commitment by the Police and highway authorities to create a measurable impact on prevalent dangers and hazards in road travel.
Road accidents to a great extent are avoidable and preventable as they are caused by human errors. They could be overcome or prevented by providing a road environment devoid of conflicts or at best minimizing conflicts among users. This is achievable through road engineering features, more importantly backed with dynamic traffic law enforcement strategies.
The enacting of more rigid laws in vogue in other motorized countries such as Driver Improvement Point System (DIPS) will also be effective. The habitual offenders are likely to get their driving licenses revoked or suspended based on infringements committed. This law has had a salutary effect in almost all motorized countries. But this regulation although proposed in the late 1990s is yet to be implemented needless to say all this at the cost of valuable lives. How many more lives will be lost before such regulations are implemented
Traffic Law enforcement
It is imperative that traffic law enforcement should receive a higher priority and due diligence of the Sri Lanka Police. Traffic Division of the Police needs to be revamped and restructured to meet challenges at hand perhaps working in three shifts giving adequate coverage both by day and night based on demands in Police divisions.
The present enforcement measurers which are in vogue is more of a routine in nature such as static law enforcement at selective locations is totally ineffective, perhaps they cater more for the needs of periodical police inspections. Law Enforcement should be re-modelled with state of the art law enforcement strategies with overt and covert Police operations in a uniform and effective manner, backed by state of the art technology of the present century which are widely in vogue in all motorized countries.
The primary objective of traffic law enforcement is to make road use safer and more efficient. Traffic regulations and penalties only serve as a deterrent for drivers from committing offences towards the overall objective and perhaps to strike a balance between the necessity for mobility and the greater necessity to provide safety in mobility.
Road accidents and traffic congestion today cost the country nearly 2% of the GDP which is a staggering amount. So providing a safe road atmosphere, optimizing the traffic flow and functionality of urban cities must receive a higher status in the policies of the state, police and relevant authorities.
Law Enforcement officers should also be mindful and vigilant to the prevailing road environment and road conflicts which tend some motorists to drive in an inconsiderate or in an impulsive manner disregarding road rules to endanger the movement of traffic and irritate other drivers. They even express their inner feelings with offensive gestures and verbal insults on other users.
This aspect of road behaviour should receive higher order focus and attention of the Police. They should be scrutinized and dealt with driving in an inconsiderate manner so as to endanger other traffic. These offences could be best detected by deploying unmarked police vehicles mingling in traffic, through CCTV cameras or videoing road scenes at random.
There is also an urgent and a pressing need for closer coordination and collaboration using a holistic approach amongst all stakeholders in traffic and highway management to solve this volatile problem. Perhaps forming a Traffic & Transport Authority similar to the Land Transport Authority of Singapore is timely and necessary for a unified and a coordinated action plan.
Role of the insurance industry
Funding for road safety is the primary responsibility of the State; however, insurance companies and allied organisations should be more pro-active in accident prevention as they will be the greatest beneficiaries in the reduction of road accidents. Presently most insurance companies are directing their resources in post-accident follows up whereas they should work hand in hand with law enforcement authorities in accident reduction strategies.
A more pro-active role by the insurance industry is the need of the hour and they will be the greatest beneficiaries in accident reduction.
The culture of road use
Our driving attitudes and the happy go lucky, uncaring and uncanny road behaviour is an index of our respect for the rule of law and our road culture. Roads are high visibility public places where citizens can be judged at their best or worst, therefore fostering discipline on roads should be a key political priority of the government and not an undue priority for state vehicles on roads.

Its a wrap for  Housefull 4!
Its been long since Sajid Nadiadwala announced the fourth instalment of the comic caper Housefull. Yet again, shot against the Britain backdrop, the film went on floor a few weeks ago. And now we hear that the film has already wrapped up its first schedule in London.
It is a known fact that the Sajid Nadiadwala production Housefull series has always found London at its heart as the earlier films were shot there as well. Wrapping up the first schedule of 25 days in London, the team celebrated the wrap of the first schedule by cutting two cakes. Announcing the wrap, the makers Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment took to Twitter to share, And its a wrap for the 1st schedule of #SajidNadiadwalas #Housefull4 #LondonDiaries.
Sajid Khan, who had directed the first two films in the Housefull franchise, has returned to direct the fourth installment in the series. Interestingly, his sister Farah Khan was roped in to choreograph a song, pictures of which had been making the rounds of the internet piquing the interests of the audience. It was a full house with Akshay Kumar, Kriti Sanon, Bobby Deol, Pooja Hegde, Riteish Deshmukh and Kriti Kharbanda grooving to Farahs cues. But what gave the song its twist were doppelgangers of the royal family.
Revolving around the theme of reincarnation, the film follows a non-linear narrative and all the flashback sequences will be shot in Rajasthan. After the said London schedule, the team will next fly down to Rajasthan for the next schedule. Besides that, a lavishly mounted set is also being built in Mumbai for the finale. Besides the lead characters, the franchise regulars like Chunky Panday, Johnny Lever, Boman Irani will also be playing prominent roles in the comedy film.

JETWING LAKE WINS PATA GOLD AWARD FOR SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS
Jetwing Hotels, the largest resort brand in the island was recently honoured with the PATA (Pacific Asia Travel Association) Gold Award 2018 for the best corporate environmental programme titled The Essence of Our Being- focusing on the sustainability efforts undertaken at Jetwing Lake, Dambulla. This is a great testament to Jetwings commitment to the environment and community for over 45 years.
Long before sustainable tourism was recognized in the industry, Jetwing explored ways to minimize its effect upon the environment and maintain a close relationship with all stakeholders. Initially under the Eternal Earth Project, Jetwing focused on community outreach initiatives, sustainability, eco projects and humanitarian programmes.
To sharpen its focus and accelerate efforts in key impact areas, Jetwing recently restructured its sustainability strategy with six key focus areas- energy and carbon, water and waste, biodiversity, community and culture, family and sourcing and production.
Jetwing Lake hosts one of the largest solar installations in a Sri Lankan hotel. The 300kW installation features bifacial panels- the first commercial project in the country to do so - which generates electricity from both sides of the panel increasing yield by 15%.
This enables the resort to generate more than 40% of the hotels daily electricity requirement. An onsite biomass boiler that utilizes on average 2,300kg of cinnamon wood per day generates steam to power a vapour absorption chiller which in turn provides 100% of the hotels air conditioning requirement.
In addition, no organic waste is taken outside the property - instead treated on-site to ensure 100% recycling and used as organic fertilizer for the hotel gardens. Waste water is also treated on-site, through an effluent treatment plant and reused to irrigate the gardens, as flushing water in cisterns and for cooling towers.
People are increasingly concerned about how food ultimately gets to their plates so at Jetwing Lake a 1 acre land organically grows a wide selection of regional fruits, vegetables and herbs free of herbicides or pesticides.
To avoid contributing to the prevalent plastic pollution crisis around the world, Jetwing Lake offers only reusable glass bottles for guests during their stay. The bottles are assembled at an onsite water purification plant in order to also reduce the emissions in transporting from source to end user.
Hiran Cooray, Chairman, Jetwing Hotels commenting on this recognition said, Sustainability and maintaining the highest ethical standards is at the forefront of our operations and is a key value we encourage in our associates at all levels. From inception, Jetwing has been responsible in giving back to the communities in which we operate, ensuring our hotels have minimal environmental impact. To be recognized and winning the Gold Award speaks volumes about our efforts, and proves that we as a country and a company are on the right path.
This years awards attracted 200 entries from 87 organisations and individuals worldwide.

Kaushal Silva keen to regain Test spot
Kaushal Silva is keen to use the four-day two-match series between the Emerging teams of Sri Lanka and South Africa starting at Chilaw Marians grounds, Katunayake today to regain his Test spot.
This is a great platform for players to perform well and get back in the national squad. I dont see myself playing for the Emerging team as strange. It doesnt matter what team I play for if I get those runs against my name, eventually Ill be back in the national squad, said Silva who will be leading the Sri Lanka Emerging team in the series.
Silva who has played in 37 Tests has been out of favour with the national selectors since October 2017 and made it clear that its a matter of getting those runs and that he would be using the occasion as a challenge to do so.
Avishka Gunawardene, coach of the Sri Lanka Emerging team said: In these Emerging tours there are certain objectives that may concern senior players like Kaushal who is trying to get back into the national team. Whilst giving opportunities to youngsters it is also important to have seniors to guide them.

Local canned fish manufacturers can meet market demand
The Canned Fish Manufacturers Association (CFMASL) says they are able meet the demand for canned fish in the local market with a little encouragement from the government. Hence theres no rationale for inviting foreign manufacturers to enter the canned fish manufacturing market, they stressed.
CFMASL President Shiran Fernando at a press briefing said with a little encouragement from the government they could produce the daily requirement of approximately 175,000 tins. In such backdrop he questioned the need in inviting foreign manufactures to the country. Fernando said the State already has to spend US$64 million annually on canned fish imports and these colossal sums could be saved by encouraging local producers.
The reduction of import duty on canned fish from Rs 102 to Rs 50 per kilo and Rs 26 on a tin of imported canned fish in 2015 has had a very negative impact on the local canned fish industry and the government should take necessary action to redress this situation and protect the local manufacturer.
Local can fish producers are facing a huge crisis, said CFMASL Secretary Kamal Addara Arachchi. The situation was alarming because local can fish producers make a huge contribution to the local fisheries industry and the countrys GDP. Addara Arachchi said local producers found it difficult to compete with the prices of imported can fish from the beginning and the government had levied a Rs 102 per kilo tax on imported fish to remedy the situation. With this tax the local producers were able to compete with can fish importers and remain in the industry. However with the relaxing of this tax on imported canned fish local producers have been facing a dilemma and the imbalance created was jeopardizing the local fish can industry. He however said that the Government had earlier agreed to purchase their products and sell them through the Sathosa network granting a Rs 20 concession for each can. Although they promised to purchase a million cans a month it did not happen and they were only able to sell around 600,000 to 700,000 cans to Sathosa. He therefore requested the government to increase the concession given by Sathosa by a further Rs 20 in the wake of the rise in fish prices and introduce a price mechanism for canned fish too.

Minimum room rate for city hotels should remain - Shangri-La GM
Minimum room rates (MRR) enforced for Colombo city hotels sector should remain further, said Timothy Wright, assistant Vice President and General Manager, Shangri-La Colombo.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said that minimum room rates have helped the hotels in Colombo to maintain healthy room rate and it has helped the hoteliers to have bargaining power. The moment the MRR is removed there would be under cutting and it would be travel agents who would be calling the shots.
He said that that currently the tax structure for the hotel are not attractive and the government must review it. High tax eats in to the bottom line of hotels and this in turn will result in hoteliers having second thoughts on re investing and also new players coming in to Sri Lanka will have second thoughts as they see tax shaving down their profit margin.
Tim who is also looking after the Shangri-La properties in Hambantota and New Delhi said that Sri Lanka badly needs a good destination marketing drive which needs a professional approach. One off and haphazard short term marketing campaigns wont bring in good results and focus destination long term marketing campaign is the need of the hour. There are so many positives in Sri Lanka that can be positively marketed. This destination marketing gray area should be addressed soon.
Commenting on their first property in Hambantota he said that the business for it is now picking up. With the Hambantota harbor operations picking up we also see a growing corporate business and we also think the local market too would pick up towards the mid-year.
The appetite for the Golf course too is increasing and we may plan for a major international tournament next year with the support from Sri Lanka Tourism and other stake holders.
He however said that it was a major disappointment see the neglecting of the Mattala International airport which is a major plus point to market Deep South Tourism. We also expect the highway extension to Hambantota soon which in turn will further help to pick up business.
In contract Colombo June month was quiet in terms of occupancy for all hotels. It is surprising to note that though the month on month tourist arrival figures are increasing we dont see the high numbers coming to Colombo.
He also said that the benefits for the hotel sector from the Port City Development project would take more time as construction of the buildings are yet to take shape.
Commenting on their ongoing Apartment, office spaces and mall he said over 70% of apartments have been sold out. We believe that keys for the apartments are now being handed over and by November people would be physically living there opening out a new living space in Sri Lanka.
He said that Co-nnect is Shangri-La Hotel, Colombos swanky, new co-working space soon to open, offers a versatile working environment to meet, work and create. The exclusive spaces include meeting rooms, working pods; individual work stations, a caf and more, and is an inspired alternative to a traditional office.
The first of its kind, Co-nnect is ideal for the new-age, digitally connected corporate citizen for whom working on the move is an essential skill in a fast paced culture.
Timothy Wright brings with him over 30 years experience in the hospitality industry, including senior management positions within Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts. He joined the Hong Kong based group in 1993, as part of the events team, before joining the Food and Beverage department, and becoming Hotel Manager for Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore. While serving in many properties Wright as one of the Groups most trusted leaders, was then appointed Group Director of Human Resources in January 2014, joining Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts corporate team in Hong Kong.
In Sri Lanka he is responsible for the management of the 500-room property and 41 serviced apartments, and oversee all the operations within the hotel. His remit also includes overlooking the operations for sister property, Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa, Sri Lanka as well as Shangri-Las two properties in India.
He also said that HR is a concern and they also do lot of training to enhance the quality of HR. It is also a unique opportunity to help develop a new generation of tourism talent in Sri Lanka as our hotels are fully integrated into the local community from the very beginning, offering development programmes and employment opportunities.

Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga Irrigation Development Project, a major success - Minister
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Media Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday that the provision of water to the Eastern Province and Vavuniya in the North through the recently launched Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga Irrigation Development Project signifies the governments commitment for strengthening the reconciliation among the communities.
Addressing a media briefing held in SLFP Headquarters yesterday, the Minister said the project can be described as an excellent example of sustainable development, providing multiple benefits that strengthen all three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) of the sustainable development triangle.
The economic benefits of the project include 25 megawatts added to the national electricity Grid, and the provision of irrigation water to about 87,000 farmers in the Matale, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee districts, during both, the Yala and Maha seasons.
The project will irrigate 82,000 hectares of existing dry land and another 5.000 hectares of new land. Annual inland fishing will rise by another 4,500 metric tons. Altogether, nearly 132,000 families will directly benefit from the project.
The project was stagnant for last five years without any progress during the previous government. It is due to the personal intervention and direct commitment of the President that this project, one of the biggest after the Mahaweli scheme became a reality.
The reservoir has a water capacity of 570 million cubic meters. More than 3,000 families will be resettled with all facilities providing along with cultivation of nearly 5,000 hectares of lands.
He further said that the reservoir is four times bigger thanthe gigantic ParakramaSamudraya in Polonnaruwa. The total investment for both Kaluganga and Moragahakanda projects are around USD 700 million. He said, the construction work of the Moragahakanda project has been completed by 75 percent and it will be vested with the public by end of this year. The Kalu ganga project will be commissioned by next year, he added.

## Title: Oily Woes!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C

Oily Woes!
Come summer and our skin gets prone to developing blackheads, pimples, enlarged pores and other such problems. If you have oily skin, you can definitely relate to this. Oily skin deserves proper care, if you want to look good. If you are fed up with your skin complications, read on for these skincare tips that work.

Combination skin 
Of all the different skin types, combination skin is one of the more confusing and prevalent ones. Characterized as having a mix of oily and dry skin, combination skin is more common and persistent.
Combination skin type is neither dry nor oily, its generally a mixture of both. If you have a combination skin type, most of the time you will notice more oil on your forehead, nose and chin area. The other parts would be normal or dry and varies from person to person.

Treatment for pigmented skin 
This skin discoloration, commonly known as skin pigmentation is often a result of sun exposure (UV rays), hormonal changes, genetics, medications (such as birth control pills), pregnancy, skin aging or the wrong use of skin care products, just to name a few.
Many think that pigmentation simply refers to the dark spots on the face. However, there is, in fact, more than one type of skin pigmentation and depending on its type, its appearance differs. For example:
* Sun spots
* Melasma
* Freckles
* Computer Radiation Spots
* Post-Acne Pigmentation
* Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation
For deep pigmentation such as melasma, ActiveFX Laser Resurfacing is the skin pigmentation treatment of choice which can remove up to 80 percent of melanin in one treatment.
If you have minimal darkness, try microdermabrasion. During microdermabrasion, the uppermost layer of skin is gently removed to get rid of sunspots, darkness and other types of superficial and minimal discoloration. There are some versions of microdermabrasion, like DermaSweep, that offer a secondary step where specialized anti-pigment ingredients are infused into the skin to further brighten it.
If you have more stubborn spots, try a chemical peel. Salicylic acid, glycolic acid and TCA chemical peels are often recommended to banish discolouration. Beverly Hills, CA, dermatologist Zein Obagi, MD, says that chemical peels are powerful at speeding up results and removing deeper pigment. Their potency can be manipulated to suit the type and depth of pigment. However, not every skin colour is suitable for a peel, and if you have a history of scarring, you may want to find another option.
If you have discolouration from the sun, try intense pulsed light (IPL). A popular choice for targeting sun-induced discolouration, IPL involves light-based energy pulsed onto the skin while simultaneously targeting blood vessels. The light seeks out the discolouration in the skin to lift it up and out. Expect for the treated areas to turn dark and flake off in a few days. We sometimes do an IPL treatment following two laser treatments to really clean up the skin.

Home remedies for oily skin

Egg whites 
High in vitamin A, egg whites can effectively dry out skin blemishes as well as tone and tighten up oily skin. Whip one egg white until stiff and spread it on your skin. Allow it to dry and then wash it off with warm water. Do this twice a week.
Whip one egg white, add the juice from half a lemon and mix it well. Apply the mixture on your face, leave it on for 15 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. This will tighten the skin and soak up excess oil.
Lemon juice 
Lemon juice is a good source of citric acid that works like an astringent. It also has antiseptic properties that can lighten skin discolorations and restore the skins pH balance.
Mix one teaspoon of fresh lemon juice with one-half teaspoon of distilled water. Apply it on your skin using a cotton ball. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then wash your face with warm water. Lemon juice can dry out your skin, so apply some oil-free moisturizer afterward. Do this once daily.
Mix one tablespoon of lemon juice, one-half tablespoon of honey and one tablespoon of milk. Apply this paste on your face and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes before washing it off with cold water. If done once daily, this remedy will give you positive results within a week.
Yogurt 
Yogurt contains lactic acid that helps gently exfoliate the skin and absorbs excess oil from the face.
Apply one tablespoon of plain yogurt thoroughly over your face and leave it on for 15 minutes. Then rinse it off with cool water. Do this once daily.
Alternatively, mix one tablespoon each of organic yogurt and finely ground oatmeal. Then stir in one teaspoon of warm honey. Apply the mixture on your face. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes and then rinse with warm water.
Tomatoes 
Tomatoes are great for oily skin due to their cooling, clarifying and astringent properties. The high vitamin C content in tomatoes is very helpful for acne-prone skin. Plus, the natural oil-absorbing acids in tomatoes help get rid of excess oil.

Face masks for oily skin 
Baking soda and lemon
Baking soda is an excellent ingredient for oily and clogged skin. It helps maintain the pH balance of your skin and thus prevent breakouts. Lemon works as an antibacterial agent, preventing skin troubles and also controls oil secretion. Lemon also works as a bleaching agent to lighten skin tone.
Do not use baking soda more than once a week as it can turn your skin dry. Also, if you have a sensitive skin, do a patch test before applying it on your face.
Lemon and turmeric
This mask can be used as a natural exfoliating scrub for oily skin. The mask uses gram flour that helps slough off dead skin cells, accumulated oil, and grime from the pores. The turmeric adds antibacterial and anti-acne properties to the mask and also helps take away tanning. The milk, containing lactic acid, acts as a cleanser, and the lemon helps control oil secretion.
Banana
Bananas are not just essential for the morning energy kick but also give you healthy skin. The fruit contains vitamins A, B, E, and potassium that fight blemishes, even out skin tone, moisturize skin, and combat free radicals causing early aging. Mixed with some lemon and honey, bananas can also prevent acne by controlling natural oil secretion of your skin.
Cucumber
Cucumbers are the most inexpensive way of treating oily skin and its related troubles. Its astringent properties help tighten skin pores and remove sebum, dirt, and dead skin cells from the skin surface.
Cucumbers also contain Vitamin C that helps maintain the oil balance of your skin. Adding some lemon juice increases the oil-controlling properties of the mask.
This face pack contains Fullers earth clay, which works as an oil-absorbing agent. Additionally, it helps tighten the skin pores and improve the overall appearance of your face.

An old Typewriter and a Big Idea
All things, good or bad, must come to an end. So ends this series today. Its time to say thank you to all of you who were with me these seven months, encouraging me with your phone calls, emails and chat messages. You are now family.
Let me conclude the conversation we began seven months ago discussing Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro with the wealthiest novelist in history, J.K Rowling. Its safe to say I know a lot about J.K Rowling. Dont we all We know she wrote the first of her amazing books in cafes while being a single, jobless mother living on charity. Yet, sadly, I confess I know little about her books. I tried ever so hard to complete the first Harry Potter book, but could not go beyond the first few pages (I gave up reading when Harry jumped on a broomstick and began to fly). It is amply clear, and regretfully too, that I belong to the rare species who failed to be lured by Harry-Potter-magic when the rest of the world swooned at the mere mention of his name.
Thankfully so. Because Harry Potter brought fame and much needed wealth to J.K Rowling. According to the London Sunday Times, by 2012, Rowling was worth nine hundred million dollars. Before that, in 2004, Forbes reported that Rowling was the first person to become a billionaire by writing books. (Later, she dropped off the list because she gave so much money to charity).
Today she lives in a seventeenth-century house in Edinburgh, with conifer hedges said to be about twenty feet tall, they reach higher than the street lamps in front of them. According to Ian Parker who interviewed her for the New Yorker, the entrance to her house evokes the spiteful maze in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The huge living-wall and the old fashioned house in which she lives with her second husband, Neil Murray, a doctor, and their children might symbolize Rowlings reputation for reserve: for being likable but shy and thin-skinned, and not at all comfortable with the personal impact of having created a modern myth, sold four hundred and fifty million books, and inspired more than six hundred thousand pieces of Harry Potter fan fiction, a total that increases by at least a thousand stories a week.
Growing up, Rowling was constantly writing and telling stories to her younger sister, Dianne. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit, she said in a 1998 interview. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee. And ever since Rabbit and Miss Bee, I have wanted to be a writer, though I rarely told anyone so.
Her parents, Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant married when they were 20, and neither attended college: Her father, an aircraft engineer at Rolls Royce and her mother, a high school science technician failed to see writing as a promising career for their eldest daughter. In her 2008 Harvard University commencement speech, Rowling recalled, I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension. 
And so in 1982, she took the entrance exams for Oxford but was not accepted, and instead studied French at Exeter, a university with a reputation for being frantically posh, as Rowling put it. She was suddenly among privately educated girls, in pearls and turned-up shirt collars. Paraphrasing Fitzgerald, she said that she reacted to Exeter not with the rage of the revolutionary but the smoldering hatred of the peasant.
After graduating, in 1986, she worked for a while at Amnesty International, in London, on the research desk for Francophone Africa. In 1990, she had her Harry Potter inspiration, on a delayed train from Manchester to Londons Kings Cross station. Over the next five years, she outlined the plots for seven books in the series, writing in longhand and amassing scraps of notes written on different papers.
To quote Parker, that year, her mother died and in 1991, she took a job as an English teacher in Portugal. It was total fight or flight, she says. Id had a terrible time. Several things happened at once. My mother died, which was obviously the huge one. A long relationship Id been in endedand a couple of other things, including being made redundant from an office job in Manchester. In Porto, she met and married Jorge Arantes, a journalist. She taught at night, and during the day she wrote and listened to Tchaikovskys Violin Concerto. Jessica was born in the summer of 1993, and the relationship with Arantes ended soon afterward.
At the end of 1993, she returned to Britain with Jessica, and spent Christmas in Edinburgh with her sister, who was working there as a nurse. She had three chapters of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone in her suitcase.
Rowling has sad memories of her arrival in Edinburgh. I was very depressed, she says. I felt life was a train wreck. Id carried this baby out of it, and I was in this place that was very alien and cold, and quite grim. She decided to stay, with the intention of becoming a schoolteacher; she would need to complete a one-year training course but chose to delay enrollment until shed finished her book.
She signed up for welfare benefits, and found an unappealing apartment, where she lived for a few months. She was so depressed that she sought therapy and pressed on with the book, until things came together. In my head, at least, says Rowling. She finished Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone in 1995, shortly before starting her teacher-training course.
Twelve publishers rejected the first Harry Potter manuscript. Finally, the book was accepted by Christopher Little, an obscure London literary agent. Little made a deal to print 500 copies with Bloomsbury, a relatively young publishing company, and secured her a 2,500 advance.
The publishers anticipated that boys may not want to read books written by a woman, so they suggested she pick a pen name with two initials. The J stands for Joanne, her real name. She has no middle name, so she picked K for Kathleen, which was the name of her paternal grandmother.
Philosophers Stone won the Childrens Book of the Year at the British Book Awards, and a gold award in the Nestl Smarties Book Prize, which is voted for by children. The book also sold to Scholastic, in New York, for more than a hundred thousand dollars. With the money, Rowling bought a new apartment and continued to write. She published the second novel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, in 1998.
Since then, the seven books in the series changed the lives of those who read them showing that each book possessed a magic of their own. As Rowling said in conversation with Parker, Very recently, I met a girl in a shop. She was in her early twenties, and she came up to me and said, May I hug you And I said yes, and we hugged. And she said, You were my childhood. Thats an amazing thing to hear.
Its amazing to hear what Rowling said at her Harvard commencement speech too. It is fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale, she said addressing the young graduates in the audience. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.
That period of my life was a dark one, I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time, any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality...Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realized, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea...You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable.

## Title: The Paisley affair
## Supertitle:

The Paisley affair
Former Minister and pohottuwa chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris has defended the Rajapaksa government for inviting British parliamentarian Ian Paisley for holidaying in Sri Lanka at tax payers money. He says that Paisley's invitation was in the context of the campaign carried out by the Tamil diaspora against the country and its use of British politicians in this exercise. Paisley was invited so that he could see for himself the real picture and lobby the British government against supporting the UNHRC resolution that was pending in Geneva.
Peiris also recalled the visits of former British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner in April 2009 to force President Mahinda Rajapaksa to halt the war when the security forces were closing in on Prabhakaran, to illustrate the influence exerted on British politicians by the Tamil diaspora to act against the interests of Sri Lanka. The invitation to Paisley came against this backdrop, so that he could form his own judgement on the ground situation in the country, according to Peiris.
Well, the Miliband - Kouchner visit came in 2009 and the invitation to Paisley was made in 2013, a good four years apart. The Rajapaksa government could certainly have done better to get down top British politicians in the intervening period and certainly MPs who carried clout with the British Government, instead of an ordinary back bencher like the DUP MP, to lobby Sri Lanka's case.
The fact remained that few, if any, foreign dignitaries of note visited the country at the time due to the government's dismal human rights record, with the murder and abduction of journalists making international news and the government was only too eager to rid itself of this embarrassment. Hence, all comers were welcome to the country, never mind what it cost the Sri Lankan tax payer.
Not that the tax payers money was of any concern to Mahinda Rajapaksa. Several millions of rupees of tax payers money was busted on a futile trip to the Caribean by a jumbo delegation headed by the former Central Bank Governor and that which included Rajapaksa progeny, film actresses and ex-cricketers, to bid for Hambantota as the venue for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Not only that. Tax payers money running into hundreds of millions of rupees was spent on PR firms in the US to lobby Sri Lanka's interests with the State Department at a time the country was ostracized by the international community, while we had a paid ambassador (a Rajapaksa relative) to perform this task.
That Rajapaksa was liberal with tax payers money of the ordinary citizens of this country was amply demonstrate by the sil redi case and other freebies dished out during his third bid for the presidency.
Be that as it may, the Paisley affair, which has now being internationalized, no doubt, will put Sri Lanka in the spotlight again and not for the right reasons. Any future attempt to engage foreign dignitaries to advance the cause of this country is bound to be viewed with suspicion. Sri Lanka will be treated as a country which bribes politicians to be treated with favour. The Paisely affair could just be the tip of the iceberg. There is no knowing to how many visiting politicians of insignificance had the Rajapaksas bribed in this fashion, with tax payers money, to boost the image of the country.
Peiris also recalls an instance when Anton Balasingham, a British citizen, and LTTE's ideologue, was provided an opportunity to meet Norwegian politicians in the UK in the aftermath of the assassination of former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, thus betraying a sense of revulsion.
This was the self same individual, who, as the head of the government delegation for the peace talks held in world capitals, thought nothing of sitting at the same table not only to negotiate peace but also to sup with the Tiger delegation led by the self same Anton Balasingham.
This was, no doubt, with the full knowledge that the LTTE was responsible for the massacre of 600 policemen, the hacking to death of 18 samaneras in Aranthalawa and the bombing of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the citadel of Buddhist worship.
Peiris, who is today accusing the government of pandering to the Tamil diaspora and taking the country to federal rule, it was, who, in cahoots with the likes of Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam carved out a draft constitution (pakejaya) that was meant to divide the country into federal units. The attempt was thwarted, with the UNP making a bonfire of the draft document, in parliament.
The former law professor, who, today, in holier than thou vein is accusing the government of betraying the country, maintained a deafening silence when the LTTE set up their heavy guns directed at Manirasakulam, in Trincomalee and kept mum when the Long Rangers safe house at the Millinium City was compromised, resulting in the killing of several intelligence sleuths, by the LTTE.
The patriotism in Peiris surfaced only after he, together with 18 other UNPers, joined the Rajapaksa government, in 2008, to strengthen the hands deth shakthimath karanda, of the former President.

Presidents former Chief of Staff, STC Chairman  further remanded
The Presidents former Chief of Staff I.H.K.Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake who were in remand custody on bribery charges, were further remanded until August 07 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake on Tuesday.
While rejecting the bail application submitted by the defendants counsel, the Magistrate observed that there was no special circumstance where bail could be grant to the two suspects.
The investigations initiated with the complaint that I. H. K. Mahanama had demanded a bribe of Rs. 540 million from an Indian Investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale Sugar Factory. Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction some time ago, while he was the Land Ministry Secretary. However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was too high and demanded it be reduced.
Within several weeks, they had allegedly agreed to accept Rs 100 million. The two were arrested at a car park of a luxury hotel in Colombo, on May 3, by the officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption while accepting a bribe of Rs. 20 million.
The Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the suspects pleaded that leave be grant to his clients, considering it as a special matter since the trial of the case had been long delayed.
The Magistrate observed that the time taken for this case was not a special circumstance to grant bail and refused the plea.

The President took this decision after a meeting with education sector Trade Union representatives yesterday. The Education sector Trade Union action scheduled for today was called off after the meeting.
Eleven Trade Unions representing school teachers, principals and administration officers were to launch a one day token strike in protest of the Education Ministry decision to appoint 280 teachers who claimed to be politically victimized. The TUs charged that these appointments were not fair.
However, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the politically victimised individuals who were deprived their due salary increments, promotions and other entitlements were identified after a screening process and were meted out justice in a legitimate and transparent manner irrespective of party differences. He also said that none of them are given any positions under this initiative.
The President met the TU representatives at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. Following the talks the TUs decided to call off their strike.

Proteas rest Imran Tahir for Sri Lankan ODIs
Cricket South Africa took the next step in broadening the talent pool for Vision 2019 when it named the Standard Bank Proteas squad for the ODI series in Sri Lanka.
The series is extremely an important part of Vision 2019 as we plan for next years ICC World Cup in England and Wales, commented CSA National Selection Panel (NSP) convener Linda Zondi.
As far as the Proteas ODI squad is concerned we have taken the strategic decision to rest Imran Tahir so that we can get a clearer picture as to who our best second spinner is to back him up at the World Cup, explained Zondi.
Imran will be our first- choice spinner at the World Cup but, if we play him against Sri Lanka, it is unlikely that we will be able to play both Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj.
By taking this route, we will be able to play the two of them together. Tabraiz has been the outstanding bowler in franchise white ball cricket this past season. Keshav has been outstanding for us in red ball cricket and we need to give him the opportunity to show us what he can do at international level in the ODI format.
There are two new caps in bizhub Highveld Lions batsman Reeza Hendricks and Multiply Titans fast bowler Junior Dala, who have both represented the Proteas in the T20 format. Young bizhub Highveld Lions all-rounder Wiaan Mulder also returns to the squad after missing the previous series against India.
The ODI squad will also do duty in the one-off T20 International match against Sri Lanka.
Chris Morris was not considered for any of the squads because of injury.
The five-match ODI series starts in Dambulla on Sunday.
SOUTH AFRICA ODI squad: Faf du Plessis (captain), Hashim Amla, Junior Dala, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Reeza Hendricks, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Lungisani Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi.

## Title: PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE, SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND DEVELOPMENT
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, July 26, 2018 - 01:00
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE, SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND DEVELOPMENT
When many developing countries had very low levels of literacy, international institutions like UNESCO articulated the need to improve literacy levels in these countries. In more recent years, most developing countries have achieved high rates of literacy. On the other hand, persisting challenges of social and economic development coupled with rapid scientific and technological advancements in the world, many countries have recognised the need for their general populations to go beyond simple reading and writing ability to embrace a range of other aptitudes in order to be able to function more effectively in a more challenging environment. These include scientific, environmental and computer literacy.
Scientific literacy denotes peoples knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes necessary for making rational decisions in their daily lives and participation in informed public discourses. In other words, a general familiarity with matters of modern science helps them understand the world around them in a more factual manner. As is well know, the growing environmental challenges demand the general population to be conversant with matters connected with the environment so that they can contribute to addressing emerging issues more effectively. So, is the case with the fast-changing communication technologies. A familiarity with digital technology helps people to deal with challenges and opportunities they present.
Risks and benefits of modern technology
Evidence of modern scientific advancement is ubiquitous in almost all parts of the world today. Use of technological gadgets is common even in less developed societies as is evident from the widespread use of mobile technologies. While the benefits are often obvious to many people, the fact that there are also risks associated with modern technology is not so obvious and known to many people. These include issues of cybersecurity, threats to personal well-being and safety, increasing sense of social isolation, relational problems, addiction to and dependence on technology, etc. The risks involved can vary across countries depending on diverse factors. New research can shed more light on the above and other issues and educate the public accordingly.
What is equally important to note is that, in many developing countries including Sri Lanka, the connection of most people to modern science is mostly through their passive relationship to useful products of scientific research such as mobile phones and household gadgets rather than due to any internalization of values, methods and ethos of modern science. This is partly due to the kind of general education that they are exposed to and partly due to the dominance of non-scientific discourses in society in the mass media, religious institutions and even politics. In fact, early and sustained exposure to religious rituals undermines critical and analytical skills in children and youth. Surveys have shown consistently that, unlike youth in the developed world, the vast majority of youth in Sri Lanka have a strong religious rather than a scientific orientation, not to mentions the adult population.
The lack of critical thinking and analytical skills is a major hindrance to innovation which is considered as a precondition for finding practical solutions to the myriad of problems that human societies face today. As is well known, our education system does not promote innovation but encourages rote learning and is based on memory testing examinations leading to paper qualifications.
The lack of critical thinking and analytical skills among school leavers and others has wide-ranging implications. Firstly, it prevents them from playing a constructive role in society as they by and large become blind followers of populist politicians, religious leaders and demagogues. Secondly, school leavers and even university graduates without such skills look for less demanding and less challenging jobs in the state sector, often making them dependent on political patronage or leave the country for unskilled jobs. And, finally, the lack of highly skilled workers makes it difficult for the country to make the transition from labour intensive to the technology-intensive production of commodities and services.
The lack of educational reforms to improve the quality of education to make it more skill oriented and the persisting neglect of Research and Development by successive governments over several decades have made the situation worse. As is well known, Sri Lanka has one of the lowest rates of R&D investments in the world today. The result is that the country remains dependent on a few traditional exports for earning much needed foreign exchange and almost all technology-intensive intermediate and consumer products are imported from other countries. The outcome is the widening trade gap which is mostly filled by remittances sent by workers employed overseas and foreign borrowings.
Development challenges
Any perceptive observer of Sri Lankas development scene would realize that the country is trapped in a vicious cycle. I.e. Predominance of low-value traditional exports, chronic dependence on high-value technology-intensive product imports, consequent widening trade gap, increasing export of labour, wage inflation, the high cost of production and living, foreign borrowings, accumulating debts, low investment in education and research, low skilled labour force, and so on. Countrys development challenges are hardly discussed in terms of the above vicious cycle and almost all politicians talk about other things and carry on regardless.
No leader seems to be prepared to challenge the hegemony of the religious establishment in public affairs and point out the need to restore modern science to its due place in education and public life. This is so in spite of the fact that almost everyone, including the most ignorant, wants modern scientific medicine, modern communications, modern transport, modern comforts based on all sorts of technology products, etc. While we continue to innovate in novel religious rituals and persist with archaic ideas due to poor education, we want to export unskilled labour to East Asian countries where the political leaders know that their countries can be competitive in the world not by resorting to and promoting religious rituals but by investing in modern education and research.
As is well known, most of these countries have some of the highest rates of public investment in these areas in comparison to the rest of the world. Universities and research institutes in these countries not only train scientific personnel needed by industry but also come up with new products and processes for industrial and other sectors. By contrast, Sri Lankan institutions have lagged far behind and even the long-standing research institutes in diverse areas have been neglected over the years. There are many factors that have contributed to this situation.
So far in this article, I have discussed some of the consequences of our failure to revamp the education system in line with the imperatives of a fast-changing world and strengthen the scientific orientation of people in general and younger generations in particular.
What has also been noted is the neglect of research and innovation in the country, preventing us from benefiting from scientific applications in not only new product development but also improving all sectors of the economy in keeping with the demands of a globalized world economy.
Citizens in modern democracies need to be equipped with new life skills and orientations so that they can play a constructive role in public affairs but our education has not been able to help citizens to acquire such skills and orientations.

Science is the secret to development - Minister Amunugama
The importance of scientific innovation in facilitating development and furthering progress in Sri Lanka was stressed by Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr.Sarath Amunugama.
The Minister was speaking to an audience of researchers, technologists and innovators at the National Science Foundations (NSF) National Awards Ceremony on Wednesday.
If you look at all the progress of developing countries, the secret of their success is the role of science, he said.
The minister noted that a large number of scientists and engineers that serve in leading political bodies in China and Singapore have helped these countries achieve rapid growth.
Minister Amunugama mentioned Sri Lankas outdated agriculture system and problems with flooding of paddy fields as two key areas where scientific knowledge could offer solutions.
He called on scientists to showcase their work to the real world by showing the public, the pragmatic applications of their research, which is often only discussed in academic circles.
You are heroes of this country. You have devoted your life to painstaking work The country must know what you do, and said in lighter vein that Sri Lanka has the worlds most curious public. Theyll be very interested in knowing what you are doing, Minister Amunugama added.
In order to advance sciences in Sri Lanka, Minister Amunugama said there needs to be a shift in cultural attitudes toward science.
What we need in Sri Lanka is a scientific attitude, a scientific way of thinking, a way of absorbing scientific phenomena, he said.
Dr.Sanjiva Weerawardena, computer scientist and founder of open source technology company, WSO2, echoed the Ministers sentiment adding that there is economic value to sharing your work with the public.
People have to feel the results of scientific work, he said.
Writing papers and going to conferences... thats not enough for a poor country.
Dr.Weerawardena also highlighted the way in which technology is changing and how it is crucial for scientists to think across disciplines.
We need to try to bring more of the creative side into the sciences and try to create an environment where people are motivated to do research that is more creative and has more human factors, he said.
For Dr. Weerawardena, at the heart of it science is passion. I am not someone who believes in awards, he said.
Life is too long to worry about working for an award. You should work because you love doing what youre doing, he said.
NSF Director General Professor Ananda Jayawardene while congratulating the recipients of awards,added that there is still work to be done. Sri Lankas scientific investment rate stands at 106% of GDP, lagging behind every other nation in the region.
NSF Chairperson Sirimali Fernando said they hope to increase the number of researchers in Sri Lanka to 2,000 over the next 10 years.
Acknowledging students and academics in a variety of scientific disciplines, the NSF presented awards in four categories: Research, Technology, The World Academy of Scientists/NSF Young Scientist Award, and Support Scheme for Supervision of Research Degrees. Founded in 1968, NSF celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.

Simple beauty tips for hands
Since our hands are used to carry out most of the chores, they need the pampering and relaxing to look nice and smooth! Listed are ten sure shot ways to get those beautiful looking hands.
1. Moisturise your hands:
Use a good quality hand moisturiser and apply on hands at least thrice a day after you have washed it thoroughly. In the summers use a light non greasy moisturiser and in the winters opt for something heavier like body butter. Winters tend to dry out the skin, so you can do with the extra moisturising.
2. Pamper the hands:
Indulge in a manicure at least once a month. With a manicure you hands get cleaned, exfoliated and massaged. Its thorough nourishment that your hands get.
3. Wash your hands:
When you wash your hands, ensure that you wash your hands in lukewarm water all year round. Too hot water or too cold water tends to damage the skin. Never use normal dish soap because it is harsh on the skin and it also dries the skin easily.
4. Scrub:
Scrub your hands at least once a week with a good exfoliating agent to get rid of any dead skin. No time to buy one Make one at home. Take a teaspoon each of fine sugar and olive oil and mix it well with the juice of half a lime. If you want to try something different, add one drop of your favourite EO and you are done! You have your home made exfoliating scrub ready.
Tip: You can use this scrub without the olive oil too. If youve used the oil, wash your hands with a mild soap and lukewarm water. If youve used it without the olive oil, just rinse your hands in lukewarm water and pat dry.
5. Massage:
Massage your hands at night for at least five minutes to let the goodness of the moisturiser soak in. For very rough hands, mix your moisturiser with a bit of Vaseline so that they are protected all through the night.
6. Protect your hands:
When you are washing dishes, gardening or carrying out any chore that allows your hand to interact with chemicals, grease or dirt, ensure that you are wearing rubber gloves to protect your hands.
7. File and Trim:
When you file your nails, file them in one direction rather than a seesaw action. A seesaw action can separate the layers of the nail and if water finds its way between those nail layers, it can lead to nail peeling. Trim your nails at least once in two weeks or as required.
8. Paint your nails:
When you paint your nails, always use a base coat so that your nails are not stained. Using a base-coat will also help the nail-polish last longer.
9. Protect your cuticles:
Use a good quality cuticle cream or oil to prevent the cuticles from roughing out or drying. Looking for an alternative you can do at home Apply a few drops of glycerine to your hands overnight at least twice a week and wash off with lukewarm water in the morning. You will wake up with softer hands.
10. Eat right:
What you eat is very important. Proteins, Vitamin B, Vitamin E supplements should be a part of your diet to get healthy, strong nails and to keep your hands supple and soft. -Stylecraze

SL on the back foot after India rattle up 613/8d

Shah, who stands second in the list of highest scorers in Youth Tests, scored 282 off 332 balls, including 33 fours and one six, against Sri Lanka Under-19 on the second day of Indias U-19 final four-day game at Sooriyawewa, Hambantota.
Australian Clinton Peake holds the record for the highest score, an unbeaten 304, which he scored against India at Melbourne in March 1995.
Shah, who ended day one on 177, reached his double hundred in the 18th over of the day by hitting Kalana Perera for a boundary.
Shah was on 257 when Nehal Wadhera was dismissed on 64 by Kalana Perera. Shah and Wadhera had stitched together a 160-run partnership for the fifth wicket.
With this score, Shah became the second Indian to score a double-century after Tanmay Srivastava, who had scored 220 against Pakistan in Peshawar in September 2006.
That game also featured Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Piyush Chawla and Ishant Sharma.
Earlier, India had resumed day 2 with an overnight score of 428 for 4 and declared on 613/8 when Shah was run out for 282.
Indias score of 613/8 declared is the third-highest total in Youth Tests. South Africa lead the list with 646/9 declared against England in August 2003, followed by Englands 620/9 declared against the West Indies in August 2001.
At stumps, Sri Lanka were 140/4, trailing India by 473 runs. For India, Mohit Jangra ended the day with the figures of 3/34 off 7.4 overs.

Sri Lankans with forged visas jailed for 8 months
Three Sri Lankan men were convicted and sentenced last Friday to eight months jail for possessing forged Malaysian visas in their passports, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in Malaysia said.
They were arrested by ICA officers on June 27 after anomalies were detected in their visas during checks at Woodlands Checkpoint, The Straits Times reported.
Nalliah Selvamany Rohan, 26, Kanthanadan Jasitharan, 23, and Roopan Diasrepinsan, 20, were looking for employment outside of Sri Lanka.
The first two approached an agent in Sri Lanka, Rajanikanth, to make arrangements for a trip to Malaysia for Rs. 305,000 each. The third approached another agent to make the same trip for Rs. 500,000.
Rohan and Jasitharan arrived in Singapore on June 18, and the forged Malaysian visas were attached to their passports. Roopan arrived on June 26 and had the same done.
On June 27, Rajanikanth arranged for a Malaysian taxi to take the three men to Malaysia at about 8pm.
ICA officers nabbed the trio at about 9.20pm. Rajanikanth had left Singapore before investigations started, and the Malaysian taxi driver was found to be uninvolved in the scam. Under the Passports Act, Section 47(6), a person convicted of knowingly possessing false foreign travel documents may be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.

STROKE TO SUCCESS
He is not content on simply being a fringe player, but is determined to complement the chance that seems to be round the corner with some creditable performances. Indeed he took the world by storm with his record breaking knock of 191 runs. It is the highest individual U19 ODI score in cricket history. With winds of change sweeping across the Sri Lankan cricket squad, a season of hope has dawned for gifted young cricketers like Hasitha Boyagoda.
Known as the one of the most successful young cricketers that Trinity College, Kandy, has ever produced, Hasitha enthralled cricket enthusiasts with some scintillating knocks at the first big platform which offers young cricketers to exhibit their talents to the world. The 19 year olds swashbuckling performance not only helped the Sri Lankan team crush Kenya in the U19 World Cup held early this year in New Zealand but it also brought a glimmer of hope of garnering potential cricketers for the national team at an early age. Hasitha was also the only Sri Lankan batsman to score two centuries (191 and 116) in an U19 World Cup.
Representing Srilanka under 19 in theAsia Cup 2017
The complexity and the competitively of the game lured Hasitha to cricket. He finds the everyday challenges linked with the sport exciting.
The game is ever changing and there is something new to learn every day. No matter how much you practice you still have space to better yourself. Experience enhances your skills. There are new challenges every time you face an opponent. This excitement adds beauty to the game. It is a sport that thrives with life, Hasitha enthused.
A right hand top order batsman, Hasitha is even able to bowl right arm off spin when required. He has been an opener in limited over games and batted in the top order in test matches.
I was into cricket from childhood. My father, Sanjaya Boyagoda, motivated me to take up cricket because he saw my potential from an early age and realized that I had a liking for the sport. He had played in the junior cricket team for his school. I started playing hard ball cricket when I was seven years in an academy conducted by Harold Ranasinghe and Bernard Perera, Hasitha recalled his entrance to cricket.
The first match was an under 13 division two match against Vidyartha College, Kandy, at the Police Grounds in Kandy. He scored around 20 runs. He was 11 years old then, playing against 13 year olds. It has been a nerve-racking experience for the youth.
Later Lasith Randunu, the junior coach at Trinity College took the youth under his wing. Sampath Perera, Kavinda Jayasuriya and Rushan Jaleel too coached the young lad. He captained the Trinity cricket team in 2017/18. Roy Dias, Ravindra Pushpakumara, Chaminda Vaas, Upul Chandana and Ajith Ekanayake were his under 19 national coaches.
Speaking about the qualities which make a successful cricketer Hasitha says that hard work and discipline not only helps a player excel in cricket but helps an individual succeed in all aspects in life.
Being crowned the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the year 2018
Without discipline, I believe hard work would account for nothing. Concentration, skill, and physical fitness play a huge role as well, he opined.
Recalling the greatest moment in his cricketing career Hasitha says that the Sri Lankan team batted first and scored over 400 runs. The match was the Plate quarterfinal held at Christchurch.
Getting 191 runs and smashing a world record in one of the World Cup matches made it more valuable for me. The previous U19 ODI record was 180. When I reached about 150 runs, I focused on getting to that milestone. It was indeed a very special and career changing moment for me, he enthused with a smile.
Hasitha notes that the ability to concentrate and work hard are his greatest strengths. Reflecting on the toughest stint he has faced so far Hasitha says that the finger injury he suffered from while playing under 17 cricket was a painful experience.
I found it very difficult to recover and regain my touch. Gradually I got back to my rhythm through heaps of training and hard work. I also stopped playing cricket for three months because of my Advanced Level examination. I gained a lot of weight during that period. I had to train double as hard to get back to my initial self. That was before two of the most important under 19 national tours: the Asia Cup and the World Cup. Therefore it was crucial to be in top form, he expressed.
His favourite sportsman is Kumar Sangakkara. He says Sangakkaras cricketing skills as well awesome personality mesmerizes him. The greatest words of wisdom offered to him were by Sri Lankas batting legend Sanath Jayasuriya.
He said that luck plays a huge part in cricket and that luck is a thing that is received by a person equivalent to how much he trains. Bottom line, youre lucky if you work hard, Hasitha quipped.

Though cricket is his passion and forte, Hasitha firmly believes that academics and sports are interconnected. Cricket taught him discipline and time management. It also improved his physical, mental and social skills. All these features rolled together helped him excel in studies. He passed his G C E Advanced Levels with flying colours by getting fours As and ranking second place in the district and 62nd place all island.
Hasithas father is a Consultant Physician working at Matale Hospital. His mother, Supipi Boyagoda, is a Consultant Pediatrician employed at Peradeniya Childrens Hospital. He has two siblings: Sajini and Anuja who are still schooling.
His ambition is to make it big in the Sri Lankan cricket field and become a world class cricketer. He will be touring South Africa at the end of the month.
Believe in yourself and what you can do. Your competition is not with anyone but yourself. You could be a bad starter but you always have the opportunity to finish better than how you have started. Its all about not giving up and believing in your dreams, is his advice to all those who wish to excel in their talents.

SURETIES TO FACE LEGAL ACTION
A decision has been taken to prosecute University lecturers who fail to return after completing their post graduate degrees, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministry Secretary J.J. Rathnasiri said yesterday.
The decision has been reached at a Vice Chancellors meeting held recently.
The Ministry Secretary said they will prosecute the sureties of the bond that the university lecturers entered into with the UGC provided that the whereabouts of the lecturers could not be traced. University lecturers agree to serve four years in the country following the completion of the government funded overseas post graduate degrees.
He said such a measure is required since an enormous amount of public funds is spent on such scholars for their overseas studies. They are being paid during the years the lecturers stay overseas for such studies, Secretary Rathnasiri said. Not only that the government spends lakhs of rupees in public funds for their education until they complete their degrees.
He said that during the meeting it was decided that the university lecturers who go abroad for further studies should return or pay the amounts that was spent on them.

Systematic plan to develop Mannar city like Dubai
Mannar town and the five Pradesheeya Sabha areas in Mannar district will be developed under a systematic plan which has already been formulated, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawake said. The work will be undertaken in consultation with all peoples representatives of the political divide, he added.
Minister Ranawake said this at a meeting which followed the launching of construction work on the proposed new bus stand recently. The project costing Rs 180 million will be undertaken by the UDA under its Sukhitha Purawara (Happy City) programme.
Minister Ranawake said in the ancient past there had been a major commercial hub centered on the Port of Calicut in India, and Mantota and Beruwala in Sri Lanka. Mannar was world renowned for its oyster reef. During the British colonial period more than 4,000 foreigners had arrived in Mannar for pearl fishing. Two other resources more valuable than pearls had now been discovered in the Mannar region. They are the two gas and oil wells named Barrycuda and Devide discovered in the sea 32 kilometres off the Mannar coast found in September 2011.
Minister Ranawake said that when he held the Power and Energy portfolio, he was instrumental in extending the main electricity grid upto Mannar with the conclusion of the war. He was able to set up a CEB provincial centre and provide electricity supplies to each and every village in Mannar. Mannar also had immense potential to provide electricity through wind power. If these resources were properly utilised and managed, Mannar could be easily developed into a city similar to Dubai.
He said an esplanade had been built in Alfatar area. Steps would be taken to provide electricity supplies to the esplanade in response to the request made by the MP of the area. He said more than Rs 250 million had been allocated in the last budget for the development of Mannar.
He said people in the Mannar region had given unstinted support towards bringing the government led by the President and Prime Minister to power. They were committed to develop the region with the support of all peoples representatives irrespective of their political differences. He said Mannar which had ancient places or religious worship belonging to all denominations was a symbol of communal and religious amity.
Among them was a Hindu Kovil, Mantota Raja Maha Viharaya, Madhu Church and several Mosques dotting the area.
Ministers Mangala Samaraweera and Rishad Bathiudeen and State Minister Eran Wickramaratne were also present on the occasion.

Regular A team tours a must for sustainability of national team :
Thirimanne is on top of the world in confidence - Avishka
The importance of A team tours was emphasized with Sri Lankas tour to Bangladesh serving its purpose in more ways than one.
From a national teams perspective the tour enabled Dimuth Karunaratne and Lakshan Sandakan to prepare themselves for the recently concluded Test series against South Africa.
In every A tour there are a few objectives that we look at before we go, one was getting Dimuth back in form and getting Sandakans rhythm back. In terms of that we achieved both, said Avishka Gunawardene, the Sri Lanka A team coach.
Sandakan started bowling well he took a five-for in the game he played. Dimuth got a 150 plus and he took that form into the series against South Africa. In that context we achieved our objectives.
The other plus point on the tour was the return to form of Lahiru Thirimanne who scored back to back hundreds in the four-day unofficial test series against Bangladesh A. Thirimannes scores in the series were: 168 and 67 (n.o.), 100 (n.o.), and 12.
We have been looking at Thiri for years and in the last three months I have seen the best of him. Even in the provincial tournament he got a couple of hundreds and went to Bangladesh and got back to back hundreds. Taking those performances into consideration I am pretty happy how things have worked out for him, said Gunawardene.
Its all to do with confidence. He is on top of the world when it comes to confidence now having got two back to back hundreds. He only needs to keep the confidence going. When it comes to this elite level it is very rarely that you get a technical error its more a mental game. At the age of 28-29 you cant drastically change someones technique. It is totally the mental aspect. The provincial tournament he played for my team in Colombo basically he was under pressure to score runs. My job was to take his pressure off.
Even for Sandakan the moment you took his pressure off and get them to relax and do what they want to do in the middle sometimes thats how you can get the best out of a player. Basically we do a team plan and I just tell them whether they are in the team plan or out. If you are not in then go out there and do what you like. I am not giving you a target. The moment you do that the pressure is off, he said.
Fast bowler Shehan Madushanka is another player who benefitted from the A tour to Bangladesh.
Shehan was coming back after injury (torn hamstring) and we were asked to manage him and get him back. We managed him well and he started improving by the time we returned to Colombo. From where he started the tour I saw a massive improvement in his match fitness and overall rhythm, said Gunawardene.
Two other young players who have made it to the national ODI squad for the forthcoming five-match series against South Africa are the Jayusuriyas (no relation) Shehan and Prabath.
Shehan has been performing in the last 3-4 months and it was just a matter of time that he got the nod and Prabath has also been in the radar for some time. From a coachs point of view from the A team it is satisfactory for us to give two boys to the senior team, said Gunawardene. My goal as head coach is at least to try and give two players from the A team to the national team. In terms of that we can be satisfied.
The Bangladesh A side according to Gunawardene comprised of at least six national team players two of whom left to join the team in the West Indies soon after the unofficial test series.
Gunawardene, a former Sri Lanka opening batsman has been a successful coach with the A team for nearly three years. Not only has he produced players to the national team but whatever series they have played Sri Lanka A have come up with a win.
The recent tour to Bangladesh saw Sri Lanka A win the three-match 4-day unofficial test series 1-0 (2 drawn) and draw the unofficial ODI series 1-all (1 no- result).
Gunawardenes coaching policy is simple. I have been a coach for the past 12 years and been in the coaching system for two years, club system for eight years, head coach in seven provincial tournaments. I have been working with the boys for the last so many years and basically I know in an out what these boys do. It is very easy for me to manage them because I have been in the system. It is basically how you manage them.
Every coach has his own way of treating players and my message to the players is that I am not going to be like a principal I will treat them as professionals as long as they conduct themselves, behave and play the game. I want them to take responsibility and want them to make decisions rather than me making them. At the end of the day when they go to the middle it is they who have to make the decisions. They have to handle the pressure. All we can do is guide them, train them and get them ready for the game. That is my style of coaching.
Gunawardene said that more than achieving winning results providing players to the national team was his priority. My goal is to produce as many players to the national team from A team results to me is the second most important thing. Looking back in the last 2 years I can be happy that I have provided 8-9 players to the national side and results have also followed.
Sri Lanka does not have an A tour for the next 3-4 months and Gunawardene stressed on the importance of having continuous tours.
I have been talking to Sri Lanka Cricket and stressed on the need for at least three A tours a year its very important for the national team.
We really need to look into this. There is a gap between our domestic cricket and international cricket.
You bridge the gap with the A team tours. Its very important for players to come through the system to play A team cricket and get selected to the national side, Gunawardene said.

Tough measures to be taken against university ragging
At a recent media conference that was held in Kurunegala Higher Education and Culture Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakse said that in order to overcome unfortunate trends in state universities in Sri Lanka of brutal ragging, the Ministry of Higher Education and Culture would take tough and meaningful measures very soon to offer better and disciplined, quality higher educational opportunities to the Sri Lankan undergraduates of state universities.
The Minister said, due to brutal ragging and other types of tortures caused to the new students of state universities in Sri Lanka constantly by senior undergraduates every year, there is an upward trend in students and parents to turn to private universities for higher educational opportunities nowadays.
Specially, female students and their parents are reluctant to undergo brutal and inhuman ragging at state universities.
Certain Students organizations purposely launch inhuman ragging activities for new comers who attend the state universities to cripple the higher education in Sri Lanka.
Their sole objective is to deprive higher educational opportunities for the less privileged but talented student population of this country.

## Title: Who wants to be the next President

Who wants to be the next President
The contours of Sri Lankas next presidential contest, due in 2020, are yet to emerge. An air of glorious uncertainty hangs over the political firmament and, with less than eighteen months to go for the election, there is much back-room manoeuvring in the corridors of power these days.
Unlike in previous elections, where the major candidates in the running were from coalitions led by the countrys two major parties, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the next poll is extremely likely to see a third player, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) emerge, unless there is an eleventh-hour rapprochement with the SLFP, a possibility that appears increasingly remote.
It is also in the SLPP that there has been the most speculation about presidential candidates, despite former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being perceived as the front-runner. In what appeared to be an amusing twist to Rajapaksas potential candidacy, a letter purportedly issued from the office of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa announcing his younger sibling as the candidate was circulated in social media last week, only for both Rajapaksas to promptly disown it as fake news.
While Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has significant hurdles to clear to run for President- including renouncing his United States citizenship, which he is yet to do- he would first have to overcome emerging resistance from within his own party.
Two SLPP stalwarts, veteran trade unionist, leader of Democratic Left Front and Ratnapura district parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara and former minister and Kalutara District parliamentarian Kumara Welgama have already hinted that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is not the best bet for the SLPP and their sentiments cannot be disregarded easily.
Potential contenders
Nanayakkara has always been a staunch ally of former President Rajapaksa. While seen as a maverick politician who speaks his mind often to his own detriment, his integrity has not been in question. As such, although Nanayakkara does not represent a political huge following, his opinions do count within the SLPP.
Nanayakkara has not directly opposed Gotabhaya Rajapaksas candidacy. Instead, he proposes the eldest Rajapaksa sibling, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa as the candidate. I propose Chamal Rajapaksa as a candidate that the Joint Opposition (JO) should choose. That is because his performance and his function as the Speaker of the House was excellent and his character is very soft and open to any group for negotiations, Nanayakkara told a newspaper.
In another interview with the media, Nanayakkara has said that no one from the JO other than Chamal Rajapaksa will be able to win the presidential election, a thinly veiled reference to other potential contenders.
Kumara Welgama, on the other hand has been more critical in his comments. Again, while not attacking Gotabhaya Rajapaksa directly, he has publicly stated that the JO candidate should be democratic and not a person who governs in a military style, in an obvious reference to Rajapaksas military credentials.
Welgama too is a loyal SLFPer and is a popular politician in the Kalutara district. However, he has always been outspoken, with scant regard for decorum. Whether he will be a dissenting voice in the event Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is nominated to run from SLPP or whether he will accept the partys choice remains to be seen.
To add to the pronouncements of these two stalwarts from the SLPP, yet another dissenting voice emerged this week. That was of political commentator Dayan Jayatilleka, whose observations have been unabashedly supportive of Mahinda Rajapaksa, even after his election defeat.
Writing in a national newspaper, Jayatilleka makes a case for Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader Dinesh Gunawardena as a presidential candidate.
As the Parliamentary leader of the JO who has led the struggle day in day out in parliament, it is unthinkable, even inappropriate, that the JO Parliamentary Group should turn to anyone but their own Parliamentary leader as the Presidential candidate in a situation that Mahinda cannot contest, Jayatilleka notes and quotes Mahinda Rajapaksa himself saying dan Dinesh thamai inne!, (or, now it is up to Dinesh), after his election defeat in January 2015.
It appears that the only issue on which the JO is totally in agreement is that Mahinda Rajapaksa will decide on who the JOs presidential candidate would be. Critics will question why a single individual- rather than the party collectively- should make that decision, but it can also be argued that on an issue as divisive as this, only Mahinda Rajapaksa has the charisma to rally the diverse parties that constitute the JO.
It is however not only the JO that has issues with its presidential candidate, even the UNP appears affected. Although the party is yet to formally announce its candidate, it was a foregone conclusion that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would do the honours.
Wickremesinghe has run for President twice and lost but on both occasions, he could be considered unlucky. In 1999, Wickremesinghe lost to Chandrika Kumaratunga but there was a substantial sympathy vote for Kumaratunga who survived a bomb blast at her last election rally at the Colombo Town Hall.
In 2005, Wickremesinghe lost to Mahinda Rajapaksa by the wafer-thin margin of 180,000 votes after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) engineered a boycott of the election in the North and East which cost the UNP an estimated 700,000 votes.
UNP leadership
Since then, the UNP has not contested presidential elections, supporting former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka in 2010 and Maithripala Sirisena in 2015. The party will be contesting its first presidential election in fifteen years and already, there has been dissent.
It comes from the outspoken State Minister of Foreign Affairs Wasantha Senanayake. The only way forward for the UNP is to field a new candidate next time. We have competent ministers. If we field one of them as the candidate, we can win. I am not going to mention their names, as otherwise they will be politically victimised, Senanayake said in what appears to be a broadside against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
Senanayake, the great-grandson of the founder of the UNP and first Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake has been an outspoken critic of the partys leadership for some time now but whether his views will be endorsed by a larger section of the party remains to be seen.
Ironically, the only major party not quarrelling over who its presidential candidate would be is the SLFP where President Maithripala Sirisena has a ready endorsement. However, the bigger question for the President is whether he should contest at all.
That question arises for two reasons. Firstly, at the last election campaign and even after assuming office, President Sirisena pledged not to run for office again. If he does contest, his rivals are likely to use this against him to project him as a person who does not honour his pledges.
Secondly, and possibly more importantly, the SLFP will need to weigh its chances of victory at an election carefully, in light of its poor performance at the local government elections in February this year, more so because, since then, a further group of SLFP parliamentarians have joined the ranks of the JO.
With 2018 now past its halfway mark and nominations for the presidential election due to be called late next year, the stakes are getting higher. The political drama that accompanies a presidential election in this country can only escalate as the contest draws closer by the day.

World Bank aid of US$100 mn to modernise education
Sri Lanka signed a $100 million credit agreement with the World Bank tosupport its efforts to strengthen and modernise the education system in the country.
The General Education Modernisation Project (GEM) will modernise and diversify the curriculum of general education in keeping with the transformation taking place in Sri Lankas society and economy.
Greater emphasis will be on strategic subjects that are key for economic development such as English and Mathematics. The project will help broaden choices for the GCE A Level so that students have the flexibility to select subjects from among the arts, management, science, technology, and vocational streams. Learning material for the English language and Mathematics will be developed digitally and the focus will be on children from schools located in more disadvantaged regions.
World Bank Country Director Dr. IdahPswarayi-Riddihough and Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga signed the agreement at the Finance Ministry yesterday, on behalf of the World Bank and the Sri Lankan government respectively.
Sri Lanka has made impressive progress in expanding access to education. However, to reach the status of an upper middle-income country, it needs to further improve the overall learning outcomes. Sri Lankas education policy makers recognise that a high-quality general education system will enable students to meet the demands of 21st century jobs, said Pswarayi-Riddihough. We are happy to partner with the government to ensure that all children have the opportunity to gain foundational skills, especially in Mathematics and English, needed to participate in Sri Lankas economic growth.
The project will benefit school students both at the primary (Grades 1-5) and at the secondary (Grades 6-13) levels. Technical education and vocational training institutes, academic and managerial staff of the schools will also benefit from this project.
The World Bank has been a long-standing partner of Sri Lanka in the education sector. The Transforming School Education System Project (TSEP),supported by the World Bank, has helped the country increase the rate of children attending school from Grades 111 (ages 616) to over 87 percent; introduced a regular cycle of national assessments of learning outcomes, and started school-based management (SBM) to support the administration of schools in all zones. In addition, TSEP helped in strengthening the capacity of the decentralised tiers of education administration.
GEM will support the government to modernise the primary and secondary education system in line with international standards established in middle-income and high-income education systems, said World Banks Task Team Leader for the project and Lead Economist Harsha Aturupane. Successful implementation of the overall general education reform programme and the key priorities supported by GEM should lead to improved learning outcomes and higher socio-emotional skills among students.
The GEM project will build on the experience and lessons learned from TSEP and strengthen the World Banks support to the general education sector.
