Manager of Sri Lanka soccer team Ramees resigns
The manager of Sri Lanka soccer team which took part in the Asian Solidarity Soccer Tournament in Malaysia M.M. Ramees has resigned from his post at the Executive Committee Meeting of the Sri Lanka Football Federation held on Saturday. He said he is disgusted with the performance of the Sri Lanka team at the tournament due to mistakes made by some players.
At this meeting some Executive Committee members have blamed the manager regarding the selection of Sujan Perera as captain as he has returned only recently from Maldives and lacks experience as a captain.
Ramees has pointed out that residential training for the players is a waste of money.
He has toured with the Sri Lanka soccer teams 14 times and has played for the National Team from 1976 to 1980. He has also represented Blackswear SC and the Colombo Municipal Sports Club and has served as the Secretary and President of the City League and Colombo Football League.
Dudley Steinwall will remain as the National Coach till the 2017 South Asian Football Tournament.
Meanwhile, Nepal and Macau have qualified for the finals of the Asian Solidarity Soccer Tournament by beating Laos (3-0) and Brunei (4-3) respectively. The final will be played on November 15.

Howley hails restored pride as Welsh edge Pumas
CARDIFF, United Kingdom, Sunday Interim coach Rob Howley insists Wales restored pride with their 24-20 victory over Argentina in Cardiff, a week after their 32-8 mauling at the hands of Australia. Liam Williams and Gareth Davies scored second-half tries as Wales dominated possession with a rejuvenated display following their heavy home defeat to the Wallabies.
It has been a tough week so it's important that we celebrate a win, said Howley.
This game was all about putting some pride back in the national jersey. I never question the attitude of the players.
Last week's first half display was something we had never experienced before but in fairness, the players rolled up their sleeves, had the right edge and deserve the accolades. It was good to get a win against a side above us in the world rankings but more important to win at home because that's where we want to improve our success rate.
Yet it was not until Leigh Halfpenny kicked two late penalties that victory was finally secured after Argentina twice came back to within a point through tries by Juan-Martin Hernandez and Martin Landajo.
However, Wales will care little if this was hardly a convincing display as they claimed their first victory since beating Italy in the Six Nations back in March.
Howley said: A win gives you confidence that you are doing things right. There are moments in that game that we need to work on and learn from.
It gives the players a lot of confidence and self-belief going forward because we have won against a very good Argentinian side. AFP

Battle on in youngest ever world chess championship
NEW YORK, Saturday  Reigning world chess champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Russian grandmaster Sergei Karyakin went head to head on Friday in the first game of a battle to determine the world's top player.
Carlsen -- who has held the title since 2014 -- made the opening move as the first of 12 games got under way in New York.
After 42 moves, the game ended in a draw. The world championship battle is billed as the youngest ever in terms of the players cumulative ages: Carlsen is 25 and Karyakin is 26.
It is also the first between players who came of age in the computer era, representing a generational shift in the game.
In another first, the world championship will be broadcast from its trendy Manhattan venue using virtual reality, organizers said.
The two players will split the $1.1-million (one million euros) prize, with the winner getting three-fifths of the purse and the loser taking home the rest.
The two players know each other well: They occasionally chat on Skype, although they kept contact to a minimum in the run-up to the game.
Carlsen is the bookmakers favorite but Karyakin -- who practices at least six hours a day -- is seen as having every chance of causing an upset.
The tournament has prompted comparisons with the iconic 1972 showdown between American Bobby Fischer and the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky, two rivals in the Cold War-era whose showdown was dubbed the Match of the Century.
This match comes as Moscow and Washington's relations have plunged to their lowest point since the Cold War due to disagreements on Syria and Ukraine.
The Russian president of the World Chess Federation (FIDE), Kirsan Ilyumzhinov is unable to attend the championship after being denied a visa, possibly because he has been on a US Treasury blacklist since 2015 over financial ties to the Syrian government.
This is the first time in the history of the world championships that the (FIDE) president is not at the match, Ilyumzhinov told journalists in Moscow on Thursday. Carlsen has been called the Mozart of Chess, and has inspired wide interest in the game in Norway since first winning the world title in 2013. He has picked up endorsements and deals that earn him some $2 million a year. AFP
