Kandy SC looking for another win
The defending Dialog League champions Kandy Sports Club could look for another win when they confront their arch rivals CR & FC in their second round match of the Dialog League Championship to be played at the Nittawela Rugby Stadium, Kandy this Sunday February 14th with the kick off at 4 pm.
When these two teams met in Colombo in their first round match, the Kandy team put up .......... performance and the Red Shirts were leading towards the end and an upset victory for CR and FC appeared to be on the cards. A try in the dying stages of the match saw Kandy Sports Club pull off a very close win.
But Kandy Sports Club is unlikely to repeat the some mistakes they made in that match and they will be also playing before their home crowd in familiar terrain of Nittawela and all these factors point out in favour of the Kandy team.
But the clash between Kandy Sports Club and CR and FC has always produced fiery rugby and ever since more than half of the Longden Place team crossed over to Kandy.
These playes included Priyantha Ekanayake, Lakshman Ekanayake, Shyam Siddeek, Imthison Marikkar, Leroy Fonseka, and many others in 1992. When these two teams met for the first time after the cross over. Kandy Sports Club posted a half a century of points. Apart from the national players in the side Kandy's win was powered by two Fijians in Kitioni Ratrudradra and Beti Pania who virtually carried a huffing and puffing flanker over the try line to touch down. This may the only occasion in the hills where one player had carried another over the line.
That year the return game played in Colombo produced red hot rugby and the red shirts made amends to draw the match.
Kandy Sports Club with an unbeaten record head the table of points and a win in this match should assure them of the league title come what may be the results of the remaining matches.

Malinga taught me how to use yorkers: Jasprit Bumrah
Jasprit Bumrah wouldn't have made his India debut if Mohammed Shami stayed fit for the Australia series. But the 22-year-old Gujarat pacer made best use of the opportunity that came his way and now he is an integral part of the Indian set up for the ICC World T20 2016.
In an exclusive chat with TOI, Bumrah, who has made a name for himself with his unorthodox action and ability to bowl yorkers, says he is ready to prove that he is not a one-series wonder. Excerpts:
Did you expect to be so successful in your first series for India
Jasprit Bumrah in action.
JB: I knew if I bowl to my strengths I will make an impact. But at the same time, it was crucial for me to hold my nerves and not be over-enthusiastic. I won't deny that there was pressure but I enjoyed myself and fortunately I contributed in India's win.
You got very little time to prepare for the tour as you were called in as a replacement for Shami...
JB: I was in the India 'A' side when we toured Australia in 2014 and had bowled to a lot of their Test batsmen. That experience stood me in good stead. The pitches in Australia have also changed and are no longer pacy.They are conducive to batting. So my mind set was to bowl line and length effectively like the way I would perform for Gujarat.
You are one of the rare Indian pacers who can bowl yorkers at will. How did you develop this art
JB: I used to bowl yorker from an early stage with tennis balls. But it was at Mumbai Indians (MI) nets where I learnt to develop it as a lethal weapon. Lasith Malinga is a proponent of the art and was impressed with me. He taught me how and when to use orker . He would tell me how to vary the pace of the yorker and not to be predictable. In fact, I learnt to bowl the slow yorker from him.
For a fast bowler, you have a very unorthodox action. Do you think that gives you an advantage
JB: It certainly does because the batsmen remain confused and they take some time to figure out my release. It gives me the freedom to catch batsmen by surprise and bowl anywhere. But the action also has its own weakness. With this action, I need to focus a lot on my fitness because it puts a lot of stress on my knees.
Biomechanic tests have proved that if you use your left arm more to generate more pace...
JB: See, I never received proper training as such and learnt my cricket by watching TV. This action came to me naturally and as long as it is giving me results, I am happy. I also feel if I can bowl accurately, the pace is not mandatory.
Do you fear that one day the batsmen might pick read your action and play you easier
JB: Back in 2014, I injured my left knee badly. I feared I will never be able to bowl fast. But I made a strong comeback.That phase made me mentally tough. I know that there might be a day when batsmen would figure out my action. So then, I will be ready to make adjustments. But now, I am not thinking much about the future.
With you making a name for yourself, focus will be on you in the upcoming series against Sri Lanka and ICC World T20. Have you started your preparations
JB: By playing in the IPL, I have a fair idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the batsmen. So I will be ready to prove myself. Playing in India will be a different challenge and there will be pressure on me. So the aim is to cement my place in the side by performing to my strengths. I am only going to let the ball do the talking. - TNN

Novak Djokovic: names his 2016 goal the Djoker Slam
MELBOURNE: Novak Djokovic has a new goal for the year. He calls it the Djoker Slam.
The No. 1-ranked player has one thing missing from his fast-growing collection of 11 Grand Slam trophies.
"The French Open. It's the one I never won," Djokovic said after winning his record sixth Australian Open, but already casting an eye toward Paris. "I'll try to put myself in a position to get that trophy."
Djokovic's relentless desire for tennis perfection has pushed him to a brilliant level, one that was too high for Andy Murray who lost Sunday's final 6-1, 7-5, 7-6 (3). The straight-sets win highlighted Djokovic's dominance and Murray's shortcomings: the No. 2-ranked Murray has now played five finals in Melbourne and lost them all -- including four to Djokovic.
It also stamped Djokovic's imprint on the tournament, tying him with Roy Emerson for the most singles titles in the event's long history. Emerson played in the 1960s and won his Australian titles in the amateur era.
Djokovic's strong start to the season comes after a year that has been described as one of the finest in tennis history. He finished 2015 at No. 1 for the fourth time in five years. He won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
He reached the final at the French Open, but lost to Stan Wawrinka. It was his third runner-up trophy at Roland Garros.
"Each year when I go back I feel like I'm a step closer," Djokovic said during a TV interview after the final. He was asked, if he does win at the French and manage to capture four consecutive major championships, would he give it a name On the women's side, Serena Williams has done it before and her feat was called the "Serena Slam."
"Djoker Slam. Not bad, I like that one," said the 28-year-old Serbian, referring to his nickname, the Djoker.
"No doubt that I'm playing the best tennis of my life in the last 15 months," Djokovic said. "The results are showing that. I'm just trying to keep it up." With his 11th major title, Djokovic is steadily gaining on Rafael Nadal's 14 and Roger Federer's record 17.
The so-called Big Four of men's tennis -- Federer, Nadal, Murray and Djokovic -- has been looking more lopsided with Djokovic's winning record. He now leads the pack with head-to-head wins over them all -- Federer (23-22), Murray (22-9), Nadal (24-23).
In Melbourne, Djokovic beat Federer in straight sets in the semifinals before moving on to Murray. Nadal lost in the first-round, raising more questions about whether his Grand Slam winning days have passed. Last year was the first season since 2004 that Nadal did not win a major title.
Throughout the tournament, Djokovic was repeatedly asked about the increasingly wide gulf between him at No. 1 and the rest of the players. At his final news conference, Djokovic answered the question with a metaphor.
The wolf that is running up the hill is much hungrier than the wolf standing at the top of the hill, Djokovic said.
"I believe that all the guys that are out there fighting each week to get to No. 1 are very hungry to get to No. 1," he said. "I want to enjoy, and I will, but it's not going to go for more than a few days.
After that, I'm already thinking about how can I continue playing well through the rest of the season at each tournament."Returning to the metaphor, how hungry is the wolf for Paris, he was asked.
"Very hungry," Djokovic smiled.
"But the wolf needs to eat a lot of different meals to get to Paris. aris is a dessert."

Perera's hat-trick in vain - India win and level series
RANCHI: Sri Lanka's fast bowling all-rounder Thisara Perera produced the fourth hat-trick in Twenty20 international history but could not prevent India from winning the second T20I by 69 runs and leveling the three-match series 1-all at Ranchi on Friday.
India put into bat first raced to 196-6 powered by an opening stand of 75 off seven overs by Rohit Sharma (43) and Sikhar Dhawan (51) and it was only Perera's hat-trick in the penultimate over that prevented the home team from crossing the 200-run mark.
Sri Lanka were restricted to 127-9 with four batsmen being dismissed without scoring.
Perera dismissed Hardik Pandya (27), Suresh Raina (30) and Yuvraj Singh (0) off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of the 19th over to somewhat pull back the Indian run scoring but a total close to 200 was good enough for India to defend on a wicket that helped the spinners.
Sri Lanka never recovered from losing Tillakaratne Dilshan to a first ball duck, Danushka Gunathilaka (2) and Seekkuge Prasanna (1) to be 16-3 in the fourth over.
Dinesh Chandimal (31) and Chamara Kapugedera (32) tried to regain the momentum in the Lankan innings with a half-century partnership but once they were dismissed off successive deliveries by left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, the Lankan batting simply didn't have enough left in the tank to threaten the Indian total.
Milinda Siriwardana (28 n.o.) and Dasun Shanaka (27) tried valiantly to maintain the run chase but the effort proved too big a task against an Indian team who was fuelled up after their defeat in the first T20 at Pune three days ago.
Dhawan took the man of the match award for his 25-ball half century that set India heading towards a match winning total.
The third and decisive T20I will be played on Sunday at Visakhapatnam.

Royal Turf Club promises horse races at its best
"Horse racing, the gentleman's sport will be restored to its former glory with the formation of the Royal Turf Club" (RTC), promised Wayne Wood, inaugural Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Stipendiary Stewards of the RTC, addressing the packed media briefing, held to officially launch the RTC.
Woods was vehement in his affirmation of the fact that the manipulation of horse racing rules and misconduct on the race course, where doping of horses and other unethical practices held sway, were now a thing of the past.
Sinclair Marshall who takes up the position of Thoroughbred Riding Instructor and Stipendiary Steward of the RTC said he was delighted to be in Sri Lanka and be part of the team responsible for establishing Sri Lanka as a regional hub for horse racing.
Marshall has ridden 8 Derby winners, while he was champion jockey on several occasions in the Bombay, Pune, Madras and Mysore Turf Clubs.
Headed by equestrian Suranjith Premadasa who is the President of the Royal Turf Club who needs no introduction, the other office bearers of the RTC are, Secretary Lucille Dahanayake and Treasurer Nishitha Rupasinghe. The committee comprises Ranjith Dahanayake, Nihara Jayatilleke and Sudarshana Deshapriya.
Horse racing was first introduced to Sri Lanka in the 1840's by John Baker with the inaugural race taking place at the Nuwara Eliya Race Course in 1875. In 1910, the then Governor of Ceylon, Sir Henry Edward McCallum, inaugurated the prestigious Governor's Cup as well as the Queen's Cup. During the early 1950's Ceylon horse racing was at its peak and in fact took pride of place in the entire region.
In 2000 the Ministry of Sports took over the ownership of the Nuwara Eliya Race Course and thereafter to date it has been managed by the the Sugathadasa National Sports Complex Authority, under the Ministry of Sports. The Nuwara Eliya Race Course has a circumference of 1800 metres and is situated at 1868 metres above sea level in what has proven to be one of the most scenic tracks in the entire region.
It is the mandate of the RTC to restore the sport of horse racing to its former traditions of gentlemanly conduct and establish it not merely as a sporting activity in Sri Lanka, but to make the Nuwara Eliya Race course the hub of regional horse racing activity, hence promoting Sports Tourism.
The RTC has made all the necessary arrangements to establish horse racing as one of the country's premier sports, adhering to international norms and standards. RTC goes with the motto of "Horse racing at the highest level" which demonstrates the altitude and also has the meaning of the highest integrity. The forthcoming 2016 season in Nuwara Eliya will see the first race being held on March 20.
The Royal Turf Club have to date made a sizeable investment to develop the infrastructure which includes renovating the track and replacing the track railings, renovating the Grand Stand, Steward Room, Jockey's Rooms, as well as all other Race Course buildings which were in need of extensive repairs. The RTC intends to continue with its program of development by investing over the next two years, in partnership with foreign investors, to make Sri Lanka and Nuwara Eliya a racing hub for the region.
The RTC, under the guidance of these two renowned names in the global world of horse racing, will herald back the splendour that was once horse racing in Sri Lanka, whilst adding to the long list of tourist attractions that Sri Lanka has to offer.

Sri Lanka willing for international probe on war crimes :PM
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil S Wickremesinghe on Friday made it clear that his government was not averse to international participation in investigating the alleged war crimes in his country, but said "final judgment will be made by the internal judicial system."

Wickremesinghe who was in Guruvayur to offer prayers at the famous Sree Krishna Temple made these observations while talking to reporters.

The Sri Lankan prime minister said representatives of the neighbouring countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan as well as that of the US and human rights organisations can participate in the discussions on the war crimes in Sri Lanka.

He said Sri Lanka wanted to ensure that those responsible to the death of the civilians whether they were military personnel or the organizations like the LTTE, adding, a UN investigation had earlier said it was possible up to 40,000 people had been killed in the final five months alone.

"It was not clear how many of them were killed by the (Lankan) army or whether the LTTE had moved the people to the war zones which led to the death of some of them. We may not have the full expertise to identify the exact factors that led to those casualties. So international participation is welcome for determining such causes," the Sri Lankan prime minister said.

"But the right to make the final judgment who was responsible for the deaths and on the nature of punishment should rest with the judicial system of Sri Lanka. The judicial system in Sri Lanka was in shambles earlier, but now it is returning to normal. The sovereignty of each country must be respected in such issues," he added.

Replying to questions, he said civil war-ravaged economy of Sri Lanka is limping back to normal. But the economic crisis being faced by several countries in the backdrop of the falling oil process is affecting Sri Lanka as well.
Wickremesinghe was accompanied by his wife Maitree Wickremasinghe. They also offered prayers at the neighbouring Mammiyur temple as well.

Elaborate security arrangements were been made in connection with his visit. About 1,000 policemen have been deployed for providing security cover to the visiting VIP. He is expected to fly back to Sri Lanka from Cochin by about 4pm on Friday. (timesofindia)

'Statistics don't do Brendon McCullum justice'
One of cricket's most beguiling and brash careers will end soon. Well, kinda.
Inspirational New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, who has been the catalyst for the Kiwis' ascension into prominence, will retire from international cricket after the test series against Australia in February. He will not play in the upcoming T20 World Cup.
Of course, he will not be lost to cricket. McCullum will cash in on the lucrative T20 scene, joining the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Chris Gayle on cricket's cashed-up carnival.
It was a decision that caught many by surprise, considering McCullum is still a relatively tender 34 years old - certainly not a geriatric in cricket terms.
We've been so used to seeing players trudge on well into their 30s, and even post 40, that retiring at the relatively modest age of 34 seems a tad early. And perhaps it is. But, importantly, McCullum wants to finish on top.
Unlike other athletes, who become a depressing shadow by the end of their careers, McCullum won't finish on that ignominy.
When he finishes up against Australia, he would have played 101 tests - all consecutive since his debut, an incredible feat that may stand the test of time (pardon the pun).
McCullum said of his decision: "I would have preferred to wait until the ANZ International Series in Christchurch to make this news public."
But he needed to accelerate the decision because of the potentially destabilising impact it may have on the team, ahead of an arduous period for the Black Caps.
Aggresive Leadership
McCullum will forever endure because of his ability to propel New Zealand into a powerhouse side. Since 2013, they have remained unbeaten at home in test series, and also memorably reached the ODI World Cup final earlier this year for the first time. Statistics don't do McCullum justice.
He doesn't average more than 40 in any of the three formats. From 99 tests, he has scored a modest 11 centuries and averages 38 - a lowish figure considering the batting-dominated era he has been part of.
He once scored a triple hundred, demonstrating he could play the long haul, but it was not a characteristic he showed often enough.
But he's so much more than mere stats.
McCullum resonates because of his brutish batting and aggressive leadership, which transformed a previously plucky but limited New Zealand outfit.
His leadership has been dynamic, even though some - notably Ian Chappell during the recent test series in Australia - criticised him for being too audacious at times. McCullum's batting was always risky, but the sound of his bat hitting the leather ball was incredibly satisfying, and awe-inspiring seeing it smashed out of the ground.
Sublime
Small in height, but built like a boxer, the pocket-sized dynamo has been an attraction due to his performance and courage.
Being bold was something innate in McCullum. The smasher, dasher and chaser adopted a kind of madcap, reckless approach very much in the Gilchrist and Sehwag mode, although he was not as good as those modern master blasters.
