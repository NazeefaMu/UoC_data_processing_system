Alfred Dias passes away
The sweet taste of success by the Old Bens soccer rites suddenly turned to tears when their team mate Alfred Dias suddenly collapsed and died in the dressing room moments after receiving the EdawardJayawardena Memorial Trophy after beating Old Mazenodians 5-1 in the inaugural soccer match played at Kandana last Sunday before an appreciative gathering of Old Bens and Old Mazenodians.
It is said that death comes like a thief in the night and that in life we are in death. And these sayings rang true of Dias who played his heart out in steering the Old Bens to victory over their rivals suddenly departed from this world much to the shock and grief of his team mates who stood dumbfounded.
At the inquest held at the Ragama Hospital it was revealed that Dias died after suffering a massive heart attack.
Dias Malli as he was fondly called by his numerous friends was just 53 at the time he was called by his creator.
Dias started and learnt his fundamentals in the game under that coach par excellence the late Edward Jayawardena at the green, white and green school at Kotahena in the late 1970s.
Incidentally the game on Sunday where Dias bid good bye was played for the Edward Jayawardena Memorial Trophy. Jayawardena who coached St. Benedicts and De Mazenod Colleges passed away last year.
Dias served notice of his prowess as a defendant. He captained the school in 1980 when Bens won the Brazil Cup. He was like a rock in defense and not many opposing strikers would get past him. He sported Old Bens colours and later played for the glamour boys of Sri Lanka soccer Saunders that won many F.A. Cups under the coaching of the great striker P. D. Sirisena. He played for the national team for many years. He also coached many Clubs.
After his retirement from serious soccer he turned out for the Old Bens in the veterans tournament and in the recently held tournament sponsored by another former Benedictine captain ThilakPeeris helped them emerge champions beating the Kurunegala team.
Dias was a lively and loveable character and would always stand up for what is right. He would not fear to call a spade a spade and not some other implement.
Sporting a crew cut and with his bonhomie was a stand out in any company. His team mates are still unable to believe that Dias who was a bundle of energy at the game he loved has passed away without a murmur. That is life. He was too young to die.
He leaves his wife Prasanthi and daughters Natasha and Theekshana.
Cortege will leave his Goonesinghepura residence at 4.00 p.m. today for burial at the General Cemetery, Borella at 5.00 p.m.
May His Soul Rest In Peace.(MGV)

Another No Confidence Motion against Ravi

The Joint Opposition in Parliament is now in the process of collecting signatures for another No-Confidence Motion to be tabled in Parliament next week against
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene.
Addressing a press conference at the Rajagiriya Dr. N. M. Perera memorial Hall yesterday, Gunewardene said the country's foreign exchange reserves had ominously dropped within one year in an unprecedented manner causing a severe devaluation of the rupee. The US Dollar which amounted to Rs 127 in exchange value in 2012, Rs. 129 in 2013 and 131 in 2014 had risen to Rs 147 today.
The petroleum prices in the world market has dropped sharply. One wonders whether the dollar savings made through the issue of sovereign bonds at high interest, Sri Lanka Development Bonds and the Indian loan facility had been gobbled up by some one.
Gunewardene said Sri Lanka was today at a perilous state financially in its entire history.Almost 2 billion dollars invested in Sri Lanka had been withdrawn. It was in the context of the most dangerous financial crisis facing the country that the Prime Minister was trying to change the Budget Proposals by introducing a mini budget.
He said the Common Opposition had asked for a seven day debate on the Mini Budget.

THE DAY THAT JOES RECTOR TOOK THE CANE
March 5, 2016 on the final day of the 82nd Battle of the Saints cricket match played at the P.Sara Oval Stadium, the Rector of St. Josephs College (SJC) Rev.Fr. Travis Gabriel on conclusion of the game which came to an abrupt end made a magnanimous gesture by awarding the game to the rival school St. Peters College (SPC) who was robbed and denied their victory by seven runs due to the following facts. There were two factions who should take responsibility of this unwanted, ugly and unsporting acts that took place on the grounds tarnishing their rich school values to zero levels.
JOSEPHIAN CRICKET TEAM
Unsporty behavior of the Joes players who took 65 minutes to bowl 56 balls (9.2 overs) when the target was 66 runs to get in 12 overs in the Peterite second innings. One of the Joes fast bowlers almost took 15 minutes to complete his over in fading light. This particular bowler gave away 5 wides during his brief spell.
Rev. Fr. Travis Gabriel
I understand that no school wishes to get defeated at their annual big match. In todays context any school will use DELAYING TACTICS to avoid a defeat. Understood. But, it cannot be to the extent the way the eleven Josephian players used dirty tactics.
(a) Wicket-keeper walking up from his stumps keeping position (for a fast bowler) to the other end - bowling mark to give instructions to the bowler (when he is not the skipper). Spectators understood those instructions, it was to bowl wide out of the off stump or leg stump where the batsmen could not reach the ball which resulted out of the 59 runs scored by the Peterites there were 7 wides to prove the negative bowling approach of the Joes fast bowlers.
(b) Time duration taken for the field placing and for the constant changing of fielding positions with players which made it very ugly.
(c) When throwing the dead ball back to the bowler and all those fielders not holding it, after dropping the ball to fetch it (at one point ball went rolling up to the fence) with all these acts it proved beyond doubt their intentions.
(d) After the fall of every SPC wicket (4 wickets went down) during their run chase, spectators witnessed some Joes players inviting their supporters to invade the ground and the saddest part was when these players posed for Selfie pictures along with their supporters during the ground invasion.
JOSEPHIAN UNRULY SUPPORTERS
Now let me mention about the unruly Joes supporters, to indicate how they Supported their college players with their delaying tactics
(a) These Time Consuming incidents that I mentioned was during the Peterite run chase. Prior to this, during the Joes second innings when they were fighting for survival at the fall of each Josephian wicket and each time when their hero batsmen scored a boundary (at the last stages of his great innings) this unruly Joes supporters invaded the ground.
(b) There was an incident during the last stages of the Peterite run chase when these hooligan supporters ran to the wickets they poured some liquid (should be alcohol) on the danger area of the wicket. When the umpires wanted to repair it the Peterite batsmen wanted to continue their task without wasting any more time.
(c) With all these antics of the unruly Joes supporters light was fading. As per the agreed playing conditions it permits to continue the 15 mandatory overs till 6.15 p.m. Except for the two overs bowled by a spinner (one of the opening bowlers} rest of the 7.2 overs were bowled by the fast bowlers.
When the match ended finally the stumps were taken away by the unruly Joes supporters the ONLY WAY and the ONLY PERSON who could prevail justice and fair play was none other than the Head of that leading Catholic educational Institute that existed over a century producing some of the finest gentlemen and sportsmen in this country. Rev. Fr. Travis Gabriel not only gave the much deserved victory to the Peterites, he also safe guarded the respect that both colleges and the general public have towards the late Rev. Fr. Maurice Le Goc (a great Rector of SJC and founder of SPC) under whose name a trophy is presented to the winners of this match. It was presented to the Peterites by Mr. Chithampalam Gardiner.
When I think over of this noble decision taken by the Rector of SJC, my memory goes back to the year 1971 when a Royal and Trinity rugby match was played NOT for that famous Bradby Shield, just only one leg (due to the youth up rise in the South - 1971 April insurgency). Then Trinity College, Kandy principal late Mr. Lionel Fernando decided to award the prestigious shield to Royal College. (These two episodes may not be the same but the net result was same). It is great to have in this era too the calibre of SJC Rector when most of the values are decaying day by day in this society.
LESSONS THAT SHOULD BE LEARNT FROM THIS INCIDENT
1) This Big Match encounter should be played at a venue where the crowd control is an easy task. (Ex: Joe-Pete Limited over encounter played at the R. Premadasa Stadium). No wonder with these kinds of incidents genuine spectators keep away from this annual event despite it being played for over 80 years)
2) On every match ticket it should be printed that any spectator with unruly behavior, invading grounds and damaging property will be removed from the stadium by the Security Staff.
At the very inception of an incident this action should be taken. (It can be mentioned in the souvenir too under playing conditions.) During the match at regular intervals these conditions should be announced through the Public System.
3) With all these precautions if similar incident/s takes place in the future, rectors of the respective colleges should address through the Public System at the early stages to caution the unruly supporters or to unsporty players that the match will be awarded to the side that is facing injustice due to the acts.
4) It is of NO USE having JOINT COMMITTEES, JOINT LOGOS, T-Shirts etc. if these officials cannot bring such situations under control.
Let us hope sanity will prevail between these two leading Educational Institutions in the island and I pray going forward old boys, school authorities and players will take necessary action to avoid tarnishing the good name of these two colleges.
Three Cheers to Rector of St. Josephs College.

THE FASCINATION .. THE DEDICATION .. AND TRANSFORMATION!
It is a documented fact that rugby is now one of the fastest growing sport disciplines in the world. The facts speak loudly for themselves. 2015's Rugby world cup the biggest spectacle in sporting history ...as the NZ all blacks created their own unique history ..beating the fortunate path of the Australians in all departments,. to grab the William Webb Ellis trophy for another 4 years and spark months of wild celebrations!
Millions watched on television and passed out as Scotland came 2nd on a flash incident, that shouldn't have been a penalty ... and millions crowded across the English channel to create unprecedented profits and fascinate the experts that crunch numbers for a living!
Twickenham so geared up for the multi cultural experience ...it forgot those peculiar English pleasantries at the cock and bull inn of much happiness, - especially the steak and kidney pie ... as England limped out, to utter dismay!
The shudder was celebrated around the world ..and southern hemisphere rugby handed yet another triumph on a silver platter..
National rugby is in the process of transforming ..to a fully professional structure based on player welfare, high performance platforms, and central contracts for core rep players.
The new hopefuls need a career pathway ..so we can cast the net for talent island wide. I need to see kids in Batticaloa aware of the opportunities, same for Jaffna, Arugam Bay, kalpitiya and Anuradhapura
University rugby has to be a major entity within this rugby family ..the inter university champions Moratuwa university winning both 15s and 7s back to back in 2015...well done Mora rugby and the continuous pressure to maintain their squad numbers and performance levels, despite the players leaving to pursue careers as graduates.
The Singer schools season kicks off with its usual gusto at their annual awards for 2015 .All will be rewarded for participation at the BMICH next Tues 15th March. The 2016 season launched at a post awards press conference and sponsorship handover to the Sri Lanka schools rugby football association - SLSRFA.
The Singer partnership supports not only the games fundament..but it creates a more competitive culture at school level ..driven on pride and passion among the big traditional institutions of learning.
If there is a shred of doubt...toodle along to Patana playing Royal and absorb the electric atmosphere that transforms kids and parents into marauding cheering partisan armies ..the green Havelock Park warriors vs. the blue and gold Reid avenue gladiators.
It is undoubtedly an imposing sight and makes the investment from each school plus the fans at each match ....the richest and biggest local spectator sport in Sri ..the no 1 in popularity and the most fascinating, once the Bradby and other trophy matches are lined up .
Heartwarming to see the Royal Thomian De Saram shield under lights with a full house @ Havelock park. What a spectacle indeed !!
National 7s is the career we propose ..an Olympic dream for former wingers like myself ..how fabulous the chance to fight for qualification ...2020 Olympics, realistically a decent shot. The men are currently no 3 in Asia ..the women were 5th but fell back to 8th in 2016.....great stats to build on. The 7s format is a mesmerizing factor and my blood twin ..the buccaneer years for Sri Lanka, in every known corner ;
...taught me how to survive in the middle against the best and the hardest -.Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, New Zealand, England, South Africa , France, Australia...a job to mark my opposite warrior, and an adrenaline driven hunger, to score tries, that simply defied logic.
Watching the game, as they kick off, in comfy shorts and beach slippers (designer of course )..still wires the heart with the twitch hitting the hamstring in anticipation of the rush !!! Long may it prosper!
The greatest achievement in sport is to graduate to play for your country ..the singular honour to represent our island nation ..despite the odds, has had me transfixed. What pushes us to put our bodies on the line What deep animal instinct drives us to confront and challenge human digits double our bodyweight .. What is it Ponder that prospect and what you would do, thrust into that Colosseum It's a mesmerizing fact that makes rugby the toughest game .. and rugby 7s the hardest sport in the world that humans play.
Bula bula to those island hearts that embrace the code, are still the proudest warriors, and certainly inspire the next !!!

Malinga's absence is a big hole in our line-up - Ford

Lasith Malinga's absence from the Sri Lankan team has been described as "a big hole in our line-up" by head coach Graham Ford.
"It is unfortunate that Malinga's injury is a huge blow to Sri Lanka cricket. He is an absolute match winner, brilliant player and from a tactical point of view he is fantastic," said Ford. "Unfortunately the injury is a real problem. Hopefully we will have him fit and ready to bowl when we need him but that is a big hole in our line-up."
The champion fast bowler who is considered one of the best in one-day cricket is recuperating in Sri Lanka from a knee injury.
The Lankan team left for India on Wednesday night without Malinga who stayed back to receive treatment to his injured knee.
"Lasith is taking a course of injections and he is being treated by a panel of three specialist doctors," said Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Mohan de Silva.
"They are monitoring Lasith's progress carefully and will certify before March 15 whether he will be fit to fly to India for the first World T20 match in Kolkata," he said.
De Silva said that Malinga will undergo a fitness test on March 15 to assess his condition.
Malinga the appointed captain for the World T20 tournament stepped down from the position in order to get himself fit.
The new selection committee that was appointed on Monday night picked Angelo Mathews as captain to replace Malinga for the tournament in addition to making two changes by including batsman Lahiru Thirimanne and fast bowler Suranga Lakmal.
They also retained Malinga in the squad of 15.
"I am happy with the squad. You've got to be realistic and accept that it is tough times for Sri Lankan cricket," said Ford.
"But on the other side of it there are very exciting times. They (the team) are inexperienced and it's about trying to get players to adapt and for the players need to get consistent messages from the captain. The make-up of the team can differ depending on the opposition," he said.

Govt allocated Rs. 9,055 m to stabilize tea, rubber prices
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that the government had allocated Rs. 9,055 million to stabilize the prices of tea and rubber in 2015.
He was responding to question raised by UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene during the Prime Minister's question time.
The Prime Minister said the government would initiate a systematic programme to improve tea and rubber cultivations in the near future.
Commodity prices have come down throughout the world and subsequently tea and rubber prices too had come down. The Middle East is a biggest buyer for Sri Lankan tea. Russia and Ukraine which used to be the biggest buyers of Sri Lanka tea, are not buying our tea at the moment.
The present fertilizer requirement of the country is 870,000 tones. We will convene both state and private stakeholders to take a decision on fertilizer shortly. A new programme too would be implemented to revive the tea industry. Some relief had to be provided to this industry and we are looking into to exactly which section of the tea industry should get this relief. We have also paid attention to protect tea small holders.

Responding to an oral question raised by UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila, the Minister said the report on the investigations being carried out by the CID into this incident, had already been forwarded to the Attorney General. The process was delayed due to the delay caused by the previous Attorney General.

Country needs constitution that recognises rights of Sri Lankans
Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa told Parliament yesterday, that what Sri Lanka needed now was a profound multi ethnic, multi religious and multi language Constitution that recognizes the rights of all Sri Lankans to live in peaceful and coexistence in this island.
The minister commencing the debate on the Resolution to appoint a Constitutional Assembly for the second allocated day, said that no one likes to be controlled by another one. All the people however, like to be treated equally under the law. The people also expects the law makers and rulers should also respect the same law.
Earlier, it was the ruler of the country who was the most powerful under the existing Constitution. The 1978 Constitution did not create a stable and strong government as former President J.R. Jayawardene envisaged. It was formulated without obtaining public views and ideas.
This made the Executive Presidency stronger and the powers of Parliament weaker. When the Executive Presidency turned into dictatorship, those powers could not be curbed by Parliament or by the Judiciary. Only the people force could topple the powers of the Executive Presidency. That was the change which took place on January 8 in this country.
After the new government came into the power, it had been able to curtail most of the powers of the Executive Presidency by bringing 19th Amendment. No party claimed ownership of the proposed new Constitution, as it was a joint effort of all political parties, based on the opinions and views of the general public.

Only Finance Companies pay 15 percent interest'
Only finance companies provide 15 percent interest rate on senior citizens' deposits upto Rs. 1.5 million, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake. The minister explaining the matter, said this budgetary proposal was not operative in state banks or private banks. He noted the said budgetary proposal had been implemented by the Government only through licensed finance companies registered under the Central Bank.
The minister said the Government accepted the responsibility on the safety of these deposits, adding that the Central Bank would streamline and restructure the finance companies in the country.
"The interest rates in finance companies stand at 11-12 percent, while these rates in private banks are only 7-8 percent. When this scheme is implemented through finance companies, the amount the Government has to pay becomes less," he said. However, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MP Bimal Rathnayake, questioned as to how the Government could guarantee the safety of deposits in these private financial institutions, as there were past experiences on the collapse of some of these institutions, which had been recognized by the Central Bank.
They also pointed out that it was unfair that the Government limited this proposal to the deposits in finance companies, as those companies did not have islandwide branches. "This inconveniences senior citizens. We urge the Government to include state and private banks too in this scheme.
"The people have much faith in state banks and private banks," they said.
However, the minister said that 65 percent of the deposits in the country are in finance companies, adding that this shows that there is no credibility issue in them. He said there are 54 finance companies in the country and the Government would lift up the credibility of finance companies in par with state banks.

Parliament approves resolution to appoint Constitutional Assembly

Parliament unanimously adopted the 'Resolution for the Appointment of the Constitutional Assembly' with amendments yesterday evening. The Resolution was presented to the House by
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 9 to start off with the Constitutional drafting exercise. It was debated in the House for four days on January 12, February 23 and 24 and yesterday.
Leader of the House and Minster Lakshman Kiriella moved the amendments to the Resolution followed by the winding up speech by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and the House adopted the Resolution without a vote as nobody called for a division.
The JVP and TNA MPs, and UPFA MPs Douglas Devananda, Lakshman Seneviratne, Chandrasiri Gajadeera and Manusha Nanayakkara were present in the House representing the Opposition, while the other Joint Opposition members were absent at the time of the adoption of the Resolution.
The Prime Minister wrapping up the debate called for a collective effort to bring in a new Constitution suitable to the country and the modern age. He reiterated that the new Constitution would essentially represent the people's aspirations.
The Prime Minister observed if the National Government in power today fails to introduce a new Constitution, there is hardly any chance for it even in the future. "Therefore let us grasp this moment and make a genuine effort.
"The adoption of the resolution is a positive sign in this regard," he said.
He stressed the need to come to an agreement on the electoral reforms soon, adding that if this attempt fails the entire Constitutional making exercise may not succeed.
"Now we have about 50 percent agreement on the electoral reforms. The agreement between the two main parties is insufficient in this regard. What we propose should be agreeable to small parties as well. Their representation in the House should be ensured, but at the same time, we also have to ensure a stable Parliament," he said.
Intervening at this point, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake queried whether the electoral reforms be presented as part of the new Constitution or as the 20th Amendment. The Premier replied that the electoral reforms would be drafted as part of the new Constitution.
The Prime Minister also expressed the need to further strengthen the fundamental rights of the people and the need to improve the relationship of the central Government with the Provincial Councils.
"The legislative power will lie with the central Government, and there is no need to change it. We will consider the proposals of the Chief Ministers. As at present, the wastage of money is high because the central Government, provincial councils as well as local government bodies attempt to involve in the
affairs of the village. These issues must be discussed," he said.
The Prime Minister said Parliamentary powers and Parliamentary democracy would be further strengthened from the Constitutional reforms.
"The people kept confidence on us and they are watching our work. We must deliver what we promised" he noted.
The Prime Minister, referring to President Maithripala Sirisena's opinion expressed on the Constitutional reforms, said the House should come to a middle position when formulating the Constitution giving up the extreme views in communal lines.

Struggling Sri Lanka to play with freedom

Bombay,Wednesday: Newly-appointed Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said Wednesday the struggling islanders would benefit at the World Twenty20 from being free of the burden of expectation that usually surrounds the side.
The defending champions have slumped to eighth in the T20 rankings and come into the World T20 in India following a disastrous showing at the Asia Cup in Bangladesh. Few commentators have given them much hope of successfully defending their title in the sixth edition of the shortest form of the games world championship and thats something Mathews welcomes.
From the outside no one is really giving us a chance and thats a good thing, he told reporters in Mumbai at Sri Lankas opening press conference of the 16-team tournament.
We can play with a lot of freedom and thats what I expect from the team. Im sure if we do play with a lot of freedom then well beat most teams, the skipper added. Mathews replaced the injured Lasith Malinga as captain earlier this week, just hours before the Sri Lankans were due to leave for India. Malinga presided over a dismal showing in the Asia Cup where Sri Lanka were beaten by the hosts, little-fancied Bangladesh, and only just scraped past the United Arab Emirates.
Sri Lanka are due to begin their defence of the World Twenty20 trophy on Wednesday, March 17, when they play one of the two minnows who are taking part in a preliminary round taking place this week.
Mathews said he hoped the 32-year-old Malinga, who has been struggling with a knee injury, would be fit for that game. While Sri Lanka won the last World Twenty20 in Bangladesh in 2014, the team has been badly weakened by the retirements of star batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene and have struggled to fill the void they left.
Sri Lankas sports minister sacked the panel of selectors on Tuesday and appointed a new team who immediately made two changes to the squad, replacing Jeffrey Vandersay and Niroshan Dickwella with Lahiru Thirimanne and Suranga Lakmal.
The morale in the team is quite good. We cant say we are all depressed or moaning about the Asia Cup. Its done and dusted, said Mathews.
Now its a matter of going out there and expressing ourselves.

## Title: Thomians have edge over Royal in 137th Battle of the Blues

Thomians have edge over Royal in 137th Battle of the Blues

S. Thomas should have a thin edge over their traditional rivals Royal in their 137th Battle of the Blues three-day cricket encounter which starts at the SSC grounds today.
Both teams look almost equal on paper, though the unbeaten Thomians have won more matches than their opponents this season. That would put S. Thomas on a psychologically advantageous position than their big match rivals from Reid Avenue. The match is sponsored by Dialog Axiata.
Never in the long history of Thomian cricket have they registered so many wins during a single season. Sachitha Jayatilleke and his boys from Mount Lavinia will march to the big match as the most successful Thomian team ever, having won seven matches outright. They would have well extended this record to over ten wins if rain had not interfered in at least five matches which the Mount Lavinia boys had dominated. Royal too have played an equal number of matches (21) this season but have three wins to their credit while losing the last game to Trinity.
Royal captain Geeshanth Panditharatne expressed confidence in his team and said that they would go all out to make their presence felt. We are strong both in batting and bowling. We have two batsmen who have aggregated over 1,000 runs each and a bowler who has captured over 100 wickets this season. They would spearhead the Royal attack, with the help of the others in the team, he said.
Asked about their defeat against Trinity which spoilt their unbeaten record, Panditharatne said it was one bad day in which his boys were off-colour. That was an eye-opener and we are fully focused now, he said. But the Royal captain said that the Reid Avenue boys may even opt to field first if they win the toss, although the SSC wicket looks good for batting. If we could make use of early life in the wicket, our pacies could come on top, he added.
S. Thomas coach Dinesh Kumarasinghe looked a confident man as his team completed their final work out. We have a good chance, going by the form the team has shown during the season. I am not underestimating the Royal side. But when we compare the two teams, Royal have mainly depended on a few individuals who have completed 1,000 runs or 100 wickets. In contrast, almost every member of the Thomian team has contributed to the teams success, Kumarasinghe said.
Thomian skipper Jayatilleke, while endorsing his coachs views, said that his team should hold the key to the latest edition of the Battle of the Blues. We are confident. At the same time, we will not underestimate our opponents in any way. We will make our presence felt, a determined S. Thomas captain said.
Royal coach Suranga Wijenayake said the team which makes the least number of mistakes could win the match. It all depends on what you dish out in the big match, making the least amount of mistakes. If we bat first, we target a total of around 350 runs. If we field first, we must restrict the Thomian innings below 200 runs. Those are our initial targets, he said.
It will be a tough task for Thomian bowlers to stop Royal batsmen from going for their favourite strokes. Royal batsmen are in cracking from with skipper Panditharatne (1,039 runs), deputy Thiran Dhanapala (1,107), opener NaveenVidanapathirana (853), Ronuka Jayawardena (694) and Pasindu Sooriyabandara (648) often making their willows to do the talking.
Undoubtedly, the cynosure of all eyes will be Royals left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya - the leading wicket taker in school cricket for the season with 118 scalps. With support coming from Ganith Sandeepa and Himesh Ramanayake, the Thomian batsmen may not have a smooth sailing.
S.Thomas too have a strong batting line up which could turn dangerous if they bat first and survive the early life on the wicket. Rashmika Opatha (832), vice-captain Yohan Mendis (770), skipper Jayatilleke (758), Ravindu Kodituwakku (704) and Dilendra Gunatilleke (691) have lavishly contributed with the bat. Sri Lanka U-19 player Ravindu Tillekaratne, son of former Sri Lanka captain Hashan Tillakaratne, will add more power to the Thomian line-up.
Since its inception way back in 1879, the two teams have met in 136 uninterrupted encounters and have 34 wins each with the rest drawn. Whatever the result one thing is guaranteed  that the great game of cricket would be played in an exemplary manner, in its true spirit.
The teams:
ROYAL: (from) Geeshath Panditharatne (captain), Thiran Dhanapala, (vice-captain), Lasith Embuldeniya, Naveen Widanapathirana, Himesh Ramanayake, Helitha Vithanage, Shan Tennakoon, Roanuka Jayawardane, Ganith Sandeepa, Duvindu Hettiarachchi, Pasindu Sooriyabandara, Kavindu Madarasinghe, Charuka Hatharasinghe, Gayan Dissanayake, Abishek Perera, Malith Kariyawasam.
S. THOMAS: (from) Sachitha Jayatilleke (captain), Yohan Mendis (vice-captain), Ravindu Kodituwakku, Rashmika Opatha, Dilendra Gunatilleke, Romesh Nallaperuma, Ravindu Tillekaratne, Senal de Silva, Dellon Peiris, Yohan Perera, Hansaka Liyanarachchi, Kanishka Perera, Ishen Perera, Sithara Hapuhinna, Dineth Kannangara, Dulith Gunaratne.
