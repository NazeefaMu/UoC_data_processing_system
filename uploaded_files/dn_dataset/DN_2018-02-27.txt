Shooters Academy...!
My neighbour, who sees me leaving so often for America, and knows I have the US Presidents ear, called out to me from his window, You think you can talk to Trump, Bob
Whats it about this time I asked wearily.
American universities dont have my daughters course anymore! he said, She plans to do architecture!
Theyve got that in every alley in America! I said, Each kid there wants to be a Frank Lloyd Wright!
No architecture courses anymore! said my neighbours pretty daughter, popping her head out of her window.
I know America I said firmly.
Like the back of your hand, right winked my neighbor, But looks like the back of your hand isnt like it used to be, because theres no college of architecture anymore, for that matter, theres no college or school for any subject in the US except..
What I shouted.
Except gun fighting, pistol shooting, revolver training, nothing else! whispered my neighbor, Ask Trump, why hes converted America into a shooters academy!
I was a worried man as I left on the flight to New York. Trumps private car was outside the plane, and I saw my fellow passengers looking at me with envy as I got into his limo and shook hands with the President inside, My neighbor I said.
Wants his child to get into a school, but finds there are only shooter schools here! completed Trump.
How did you know I asked surprised.
Every call I get outside this country is about that Bob! said Trump excitedly, But in one move Ive been able to stop this influx of students coming in from sh..hole countries, by offering only one course..
Shooting! I whispered.
Yep, said Trump grinning at his driver in the rearview mirror, And now every Merican kid wants to go back to school and learn bout dem guns! We have water pistol learning in kindergarten, air rifles in primary and straight into rifles and stuff in high school! 
We passed an NYU college campus where students were wheeling out a huge cannon, Thats actually a missile loader, said a pleased Trump, and today two city colleges, are gonna do a battle unto death!
You started all this, after that shooter kid gunned down students last week I asked incredulously.
Yeah, that lad actually helped me, said Trump as a missile flew in the air, hit his car and we crawled out bleeding from the wreck, make America great again!
We ducked again as a gun roared a few feet away, and I scrambled into a taxi I knew would take me to the airport and back to my gunless country where simple problems like my neighbours pretty daughters admission only existed. Whats happened to the back of your hand asked my neighbor staring at my gunshot wound next day.
Like you said, it isnt like it used to be! I whispered, looking towards the US with a shudder.

SLCSP condemns Jerusalem city authorities moves
The Sri Lanka Committee for the Solidarity with Palestine (SLCSP) expresses deep concern over moves by the Jerusalem city authorities to tax Christian church properties and confiscate church-owned properties.
While expressing our solidarity with Palestinian Christians and church leaders who are the guardians of the Holy Sepulchre and other Holy Land places sacred to the Christians, we condemn the city authorities' moves, as they amount to religious persecution.
We point out that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, one of Christianity's holiest sites, is located in East Jerusalem's Old City that is illegally occupied by Israel against international law for half a century.
We see these moves as another step towards consolidating Israel as a racist state in keeping with Zionism's declared objectives of establishing a state exclusively to the Jews. We also note with a sense of apprehension that Israel has been emboldened to undertake measures aimed at undermining the religious freedom of the Palestinian Muslims and the Christians after the United States President Donald Trump last year declared Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.
While we stand by Palestinian church leaders who closed this week the Holy Sepulchre in protest against the new tax and proposed legislation to confiscate church-owned property, we call upon the Jerusalem city authorities to respect the age old traditions that govern the Christian churches in the holy city and abandon efforts to impose taxes on church properties and seize church lands," the committee says.

Social dignity, her right
The land is a source of livelihood and the land rights are increasingly recognised as a fundamental factor to the social and economic well-being of the people. Nowadays, land issues are of particular concern when population growth and high food prices have an impact on climate changes. Moreover, womens land rights tend to be restricted. Women are traditionally at a distinct disadvantage in terms of economic affluence because they earn lesser than men and tend to own fewer assets. Empowering women to help her reach financial independence is important. It is also essential to improve women's land security.
The rural primary responsibility is childcare, preparing food with extra burdens such as collecting firewood. Womens employment and economic prospects are limited. Anaemia is widespread among female plantation workers in Sri Lanka. Generally, the plantation women eat whatever remained after the men and children had been fed even during her pregnancy. This means that they are undernourished, thus producing weak and underweight children.
Education for women
Until the recent times, education for women was considered unnecessary and undesirable for female children in plantations, because the girls future was seen to be limited to plantation work as either tea plucker or rubber tapper.
Education is a key to change the womens lifestyle. It is important to provide girls with the quality education and equal economic opportunities. Health and nutrition should also be considered as important factors which affect the education of plantation women.
The estate population of Sri Lanka are the descendants of Indian migrants brought down by the British Colonials in the 19th century. Now they have formed a minority community constituting (Estate Sector) about 4.4 percent of the countrys population.
The estate population working contributes to the economy of the country by earning nearly 24% of the foreign revenue and, sharing nearly 10% of the total labour force and 4.0% the GDP of the country. They are also identified as Indian origin Tamils and Malaiyaga Tamils. They are defined as labour community living in the plantations under a regimented system of labour management and they had been denied the right to mobility and labour rights.
The plantation management made responsible for their welfare, including health and education and for the supply of goods needed until nationalization of the British owned plantations in 1972. This system was gone through some changes with the nationalization of the plantations, and the subsequent privatization in 1992. The emergence of Trade Unions in 1940s and 1950s resulted in changing the system of plantation management and rights of the labour force.
Plantation sector
Women contribute more than 65% of the labour force of the plantation sector in the Sri Lanka. Although, the plantation women, have been continuously discriminated than from male counterpart and also subjected to various kinds of oppression when concerning their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and the right to development. This desk review and field research attempts to highlight the Status of Plantation Women on Land Rights, Higher Education and Employable Skills for Livelihood situation of plantation women. However, available policies addressing the plantation women, challenges and action needed for womens participation in a sustainable economy growth.
Women have struggled for their right, livelihood, social status. Historically they have fought for equal treatment and social status all over the world. In the early part of this century, the right of the plantation women to receive an education, obtain paid employment and skills, enter professions, access to ownership of land was a highly contested issue in Sri Lanka. Thus, the employment options for plantation women were confined to labour within the tea production system. The education they received in estate schools and guidance from parents, elders, and management prepared them for no other work.
Women are considered to be the main drivers of both household and the plantation economy. They are mainly engaged in labour tasks such as plucking tea leaves and tapping rubber. Some women in the estate sector working in the garment factories and migrated overseas mainly as domestic workers. However, women tend to be supplementary earners and dependent wives. They are affected by socio-cultural factors especially by the traditional restrictions of patriarchal gender relations, social norms, lack of health and nutrition, poverty, sexual harassment, poor education, severely limited employment prospect, restriction in land rights.
What do existing laws and policies say
Provisions concerning women access to economic rights and natural resources are embodied in the international human rights law and in international human rights instruments which are highly recognised at international and national levels. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and International conventions on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and International Convention on Social Economic and Cultural Rights (ICSECR) of 1966 women have all the rights as their male counterpart enjoy without any discrimination. Article 2 and 17 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Article 15 of Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Article 14 (2.g) of CEDAW equality in agrarian reform, Article 16 of CEDAW are ensures equal rights of women in the ownership, acquisition, management of property within the family. This review proposes to explore and analyse the status of the existing policies and policy gaps in the Sri Lanka on the aspects of land rights, access to higher education and skill development for livelihood for plantation women in Sri Lanka.
It is necessary to reinforce the rights-based approach for creating an environment in which women can enjoy their legal rights and equality by freedom from violence and discrimination on economic and social status.
It is an important task and a responsibility for the states policymakers to eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and empower them in all aspects that make them an equal citizen of the country. Developing and empowering of women belong to vulnerable and marginalized groups and improving their family living standards will lead to overall economic prosperity of the country and social harmony in the world.
Proposed solutions
a. Creating an environment where the plantation women can successfully face the challenges in relation to land rights and, access to higher education and employable skills, and to integrate them into the decision making process.
b. Establishing a society in which women attain their full potential and are able to participate as equal partners in all spheres of life and influence in the process of social change.
c. Eliminating of all forms of violence against women through the strengthening of policies and legislation programmes.
d. Empowering women in economic, social and political aspects at grass root level through training on leadership and decision-making process.

Struggle for knowledge and unity
There is an increasing emphasis on the importance of the involvement of university administrators in the quality assurance process of higher education around the world. Ministers of Education of the Bologna signatory states have underlined the importance of partnership between higher education institutions, their staff and students in order to achieve the goals set for the European Higher Education area.
Only very few universities have introduced capacity development training programmes for administrators.
According to the qualifications they hold, vary from basic degree to PhDs same as academics, though their career issues in universities have not addressed appropriately, rather they face occupational inequalities in many of the South Asian countries.
Many of the international summits which need to be attended by the administrators are attended by academics and role of administrators have been neglected.
Therefore, best practices in university administration cannot be shared globally.
Knowledge sharing
They need to be updated with the knowledge in the global landscape of higher education. At present universities are competing with their rankings. In such a situation university administrator cannot be set aside. University development process is a collective process in moulding future generations. They need to be part and parcel of discussions on challenges, opportunities and common goals in higher education. Higher education is a goal to be achieved collectively in a qualitative manner.
Guidelines for national reviews of ENQA member agencies include students, alongside quality assurance experts, representatives of higher education institutions and other stakeholders as the proposed members of the panels which should evaluate the quality of the quality assurance agencies. University administrators need to be part and parcel of each institutional review conducted in universities to strengthen the quality assurance process.
A new bold partnership in higher education
A new partnership between the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) and the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) will see the two organisations joining forces to support new multinational initiatives in teaching, training, leadership development, and research collaborations. TWO largest and oldest university networks  the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) and Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU)  have joined hands to work for the development of higher education in India and the Commonwealth.
One of the first things they wanted to work on together is a joint funding proposal to establish a leadership training and capacity-building programme for senior administrators in Indian universities. Such bold initiatives need much appreciation and recognition.
Universities cannot run without administrators. We need to share experiences of different best practices in a diverse environment in order to quality assured in University administration. The outcome of this process will be beneficial to the students at large. There is a necessity to convene a forum internationally to share the best practices in administration in University Grants Commissions and Universities around the world. University Administrators need to be part and parcel of institutional reviews as they have a role to play in governance, maintaining financial viability and maintaining ethics and code of practices in human resource development. Further through internal quality assurance units in universities, University administrators could facilitate the quality assurance process.
Universities are made for community
Universities are catering to the community and their employees need to be community leaders in sharing the knowledge with the public at large. This function cannot be isolated without proper university administration. We need to serve the community at large.
The outcome of higher education need to be beneficial to the community at large and should not cater to the elitism only.
This could mean moving the HR function from a transactional to a more strategic model; enhancing the contribution that the HR function makes to achieve institutional strategic objectives in universities. The institutional framework of every university needs to be strengthened.
Therefore, in order to make universities strong partners in the society university administration need to be strengthened.

Usually, elections held in most countries provide a reason to rejoice. We recently held elections for 341 local authorities (24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils, 276 divisional councils). The total number of members in local government has been increased from 4,486 to around 8,356 members. The voter, this time around, cast a single vote for his or her party of choice at the ward level and was not required to choose a candidate of choice. What followed was unrelated to local government, local governance and local issues. We dont even know yet the identities of those named to local bodies.
The SLPP came out in front with the UNP, SLFP, UPFA, ITAK etc. following thereon. We thereafter saw political turmoil at the centre. A large of majority of our populace likely has contempt and is sickened by what transpired. This is in a context where the UNP has 106 seats in the Parliament, while the combined strength of the two groups of the UPFA led by the President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa totals 95. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) led by Opposition Leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan holds the balance.
The number of votes collectively received by the two main parties in the Government at the local election exceeded that received by the SLPP, while the UNP losing its vote bank by 1.5 million compared to what they had polled in 2015. The UNP was attacked from within as has the ITAK in the North!
Economic challenges
This government has a shade under two years left in office. It has had to contend with extremely serious economic challenges. Whilst the 2015 mandate was for reforms there were significant achievements combined now with ever increasing delays.
Its this writers view that we are over-governed by layer upon layer of elected bodies. Holding them to account is no small feat. More often than not the thread is lost in terms of accountability. The ultimate sufferers are citizens. They vent their frustrations for example at elections.
The bigger picture requires leaders keeping an eye on what matters most and working on those issues cutting across party lines.
I will give an example.
The Auditor Generals report on Public Debt management states -- It is such a mess that, if we start to clear the mess now, maybe in about ten years we will be able to get a proper idea, he said.- Some loans we dont even know if they have been paid in full or not, as we have been paying instalments and interest but proper records have been kept. This is all we can say now, there are loans totalling to trillions, which we will uncover as we go on. The main one is the bond. The Finance Ministry does not record the face value of the bond issued, but when it matures we have to pay the amount. But this is not in our records now, and it is difficult to rectify this immediately, he said.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) estimates that about 4.7 million people of the 21 million population of Sri Lanka, or over one-fourth of the population, do not have sufficient food to sustain a healthy life.
Plants are the fundamental backbone of the worlds ecosystems. They nourish the atmosphere with oxygen produced via photosynthesis, and are crucial to maintaining the balance of the hydrological cycle.
AGs report
The AGs report is mind-boggling. Part of the problem is why if any was needed, action not taken for close on a decade on a matter of National Debt We have had innumerable COPE reports. Are we bereft of laws and institutions which are mandated to act if the law is violated The Central Bank Governor calmed the waters a bit in an interview where he seemed to imply all was not that bad. Do we need an endless stream of Commissions to look into these matters
The second and third set of issues highlighted is interrelated affecting farmers, people and the population as a whole at the mercy of climate change. Its not merely a matter of fertilizer subsidies. While farmers are indebted our crops may not survive in the searing heat. It requires deep thought. Cape Town is scheduled to run out of water very soon. Can we escape such vagaries of the weather
Over in the North the monolithic hold, the TNA/ITAK had on the electorate is no longer true. There are winds of change. The investment, commitments and the will to continue to focus on former conflict-affected areas will wane due political necessities in the rest of the country. Have the two PCs made full use of the offices they hold There is one caveat. Recognising and dealing with human losses and the manner in which it occurred cannot be erased. The longer it remains unanswered there will be discontent, unhappiness and grief. It's though becoming harder to sustain the early promise around issues of reconciliation etc.
Issues of justice and accountability are spoken in terms of action prevented from being taken etc. Can we plausibly say that law and order and justice are all determined by political masters and the Police, AG and Courts are at their beck and call It's nonsensical. We then enter the realm of a despot dictators banana republic.
Passive sufferers
When corruption is discussed the reality nowadays is all contracts have commissions built into the cost/price. There are layers of beneficiaries and interestingly not all are politicians. The truth is corruption is endemic.
An unfortunate insight this writer had most recently was to the pure and simple individual ambitions of scores of politicians. It's primarily about trappings of power, earning potential and an occasional look in the direction what matters most and best for the country. However, the manner in which voters turned out recently is a sign that citizens are not inclined to be passive sufferers. Leadership though is sorely needed at all levels and not merely in government. This country has potential to do better. It also has the capacity to lose a whole lot more if politics continues to destabilize us.

Tissa Attanayake case to be taken up on July 24
The Colombo High Court yesterday re-issued summons on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to appear before Colombo High Court on July 24 to testify in the case filed against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday sought a further date to testify in the case filed against former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake.
When the case came up before High Court judge Vikum Kaluarachchi, the court was informed that the President and Prime Minister, the key witnesses in the case, had notified the fact that they are unable to appear in courts since they have to perform their official duties.
Thereby, the case against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake, for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media, during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena was fixed for a long date by the Colombo High Court.
Former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake had been arrested and held in remand custody for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election aimed at inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities. He is currently out on bail.
The accused had been charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused had been indicted in the High Court, by the Attorney General, over an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake had publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Attorney General alleged Tissa Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility, or, violence.
The AG further alleged that Tissa Attanayake had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character, or, conduct of any candidate.
The AG has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim as witnesses in the case. Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for Tissa Attanayake. Counsel Niroshan Perera appeared for UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim.

A true  all-rounder
School isnt just about academics. You need to have a well-balanced school life that includes academics, sports and extracurricular activities coupled with the joy of being surrounded by friends. So believes, Yashodha Dilesh Lakranda, the Deputy Head Prefect of Isipathana College.
It is important to have a well-rounded sense of life that doesnt revolve around books alone, said Lakranda.
Lakranda is an all-rounder at school with strong academic merits and a list of extracurricular and sports achievements that are a testament to the young gentleman that he is.
Having specialized in the commerce stream, his A/L subjects included Business Studies, Economics and Accounts. In the future, he hopes to secure a good occupation in Human Resource Management as his interest lies in working with people in a business oriented environment.
Having participated in the National Cadets Crop Assessment Camp 2016 and being a young man who believes in keeping his options open, he is also considering the possibility of being an Air Force Cadet and serving his country.
Extracurricular Excellence
Lakranda is clearly a force to be reckoned with. His achievements are many and his perseverance is strong, motivating him to excel at everything he puts his mind to. The Deputy Head Prefect of Isipathana College (2017  2018) and the Games Vice Captain (2017  2018), he was within the Top 10 Leaders of College (2016) and the Top 10 Students for Extra-Curricular Activities (2016).
In spite of his green belt in Karate, Lakranda is more than just brawn. Mind over might, he was the President of the Isipathana College Debating Society (2017), Vice President of the Drama Club (2016), Treasurer of the Isipathana College Aeronautical Society (2017), Treasurer of the Buddhist Society (2018) and the Chief Organizer of the Commerce Society (2016).
During his younger years, he was a Primary School Prefect (2008), the Junior Western Band Leader (2007 - 2008) and even the Volleyball Captain for the Under 13 and Under 15 categories. He also participated in the Island-wide Interschool Hockey Tournament for the Under 13 and Under 15 categories.
He tried his hand at a variety of sports that included Karate, Swimming, Hockey, Volleyball, Athletics and Army Cadetting.
Daily Life of a DHP
As the Deputy Head Prefect (DHP) of Isipathana College, Lakranda is always on the go. With Big Match season on the horizon, his life will undoubtedly be a blur of activity. Helping to plan and organize the matches is a duty of the DHP. He helps to co-ordinate school activities with the rest of the prefects as well. The 55th Battle of the Brothers encounter between Isipathana College and Thurstan is definitely a key item on his agenda as these schools kick-start what is referred to as March Madness (Big Match Season).
However, even when there are no looming Big Matches, the life of a Deputy Head Prefect is never easy-going. He has to help maintain discipline in school, during the intervals, at assemblies and even after school ensuring that everyone maintains decorum and upholds the image of his alma mater.
Strong Support System
Like all strong leaders, Lakranda too has a strong support system on which he can depend. A loving family who are proud of his every achievement and his every venture are at the core of this support system.
My inspiration and support is my family. They are always ready to assist me and words can never express my gratitude towards them. I also have my school principal, the prefects board and all my teachers to thank for all their support said Lakranda.
Not Just Books!
Lakranda believes that purely academic achievements are not the key to a success. He believes in building a well-rounded character and learning through experiences.
His message to his peers and the youth is to ensure that they do not rely solely on what is dictated in textbooks and the theory that is learnt but to also learn via the experiences through which one lives in the world.
It is not just books that make one successful. A person must understand the importance of sports, extracurricular activities, teamwork and interdependence in order to truly learn. Learning occurs through experience, concluded Lakranda.

Tunes from the tropics
Everything happens for the best and you need to keep soldiering on because the best is yet to come, says singer Randhir Yasendra Witana. Melodies features Witana who believes the key to success is anticipation and proper planning and getting organized.
Witanas music is a fusion of Hip-Hop, R&B, EDM and Sinhalese Folk, having developed a love for music at the age 13.
He has released two albums - Namal Mitak (2008) and Pem Wasanthaya (2010).
His singles are: Namal Mitak, Ojaye (Remix), Kelilola Balmen, Mal Madahasa and Sihiwatana.
He has got three more singles coming out this year.
In 1993, I watched a live broadcast of the legendary Hip-Hop group Kris Kross performing at that year's American Music Awards. I was so awe-struck by their performance, I think that's when I realized I wanted to be performer. I later formed a Hip-Hop group with two school friends called Brown Boogie Nation - one of the first Hip-Hop groups in the country. We recorded a few songs and music videos.
Our music was very topical - our songs 'Lions & Tigers' focused on the civil war that was tearing the country apart at the time. I crossed paths with Bathiya & Santhush when they recorded their remix of John de Silva's 'Sirisangabodhi Maligawedi'. I've been working very closely with them ever since, said Witana.
Foresight is Witanas strength and his key to success. He also believes the choices one makes have a huge impact on ones life.
I attribute my success to proper planning - mostly planning ahead. It's important to make the right business and marketing decisions regarding your music career. The Sri Lankan music industry is highly unregulated in terms of royalties and copyrights. The industry is also highly competitive so the shelf life of an artiste only gets shorter. This is my tenth year in the field, and I've had to recalculate my position a few times to stay relevant and maintain demand for my brand as an artiste. I came into the industry as a Hip-Hop artiste, later re-branded as a singer/songwriter. I try to keep a close watch on emerging trends and competitions as well. All the glamour aside, the music business is exactly that - a business. If you can make peace with that, you'll increase your chances of survival, explained Witana.
Witana has created his identity in the music industry and advises others to do so as well. Clear cut goals are important in life, points our Witana. You may have the talent but you need to be ready to handle things that come your way. We see so many child stars who have gone off track having tasted fame. You need to be able to handle the fame and what comes with it.
Define what you want out of your music career. A music career can take many forms from playing in a bar every weekend to touring countries and selling out stadiums. Define your aspirations clearly and define how you will realize them. Crafting a career out of talent needs careful planning, stated Witana.
Witanas favorites in the music industry have done just that. They have achieved fame and then gone onto create careers that are managed well with good business acumen. Being strong in life is very important as well in addition to having talent.
I admire the work of artiste/entrepreneurs like Sean Combs (Puff Daddy) and Sean Carter (Jay-Z) who have used their music careers to form business empires, said Witana
Witana is well grounded and has been inculcated with the right values that have allowed him to be consistent and stable.
I want to thank my mom and dad for the values and the work-ethic I've been instilled with. The founding members of Brown Boogie Nation, Nishan Dias Weerasinghe and Subodha Pilimatalawa for their friendship and support. Bathiya Jayakody and Santhush Weeraman for their career guidance. Sachith Peiris for my first hit song. Ken Lappen of Ken Lappen Studios for crafting some of the most memorable songs I'll ever have. Imran Saibo of Classic Funtime for pushing me outside my comfort zone and helping me discover new avenues as a performing artiste. My fans for sustaining my career over the last decade, added Witana.
Faith too no doubt plays a part in Witanas life. His determination and resilience have served him well in this unpredictable industry. Like many people who are successful, he understands that the best is yet to come and the happiness we experience now, is just a taste of what is yet to come.
What strengthens and sustains me when I face adversity is just a general belief that everything happens for the best and to keep soldiering on because the best is yet to come, said Witana

WADA says Russia still not compliant on anti-doping
Los Angeles, Monday: The World Anti-Doping Agency stopped short on Sunday of endorsing the International Olympic Committee's decision to lift Russia's suspension if no new positive drug tests come to light from the Pyeonchang Winter Olympics.
In a statement issued Sunday night, WADA said it "acknowledges" the IOC's latest move but pointed out that Russia is still not adhering to the World Anti-Doping Code.
"It should be clarified that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) remains non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code as it has not yet met the necessary criteria of RUSADA's Roadmap to Compliance, following Russia's proven systemic manipulation of the doping control process," WADA said in a statement.The agency said it is continuing to work with "RUSADA to assist them in rebuilding a credible and sustainable anti-doping program." The IOC voted unanimously to keep Russia's ban for mass doping, meaning Russian athletes were not able to march behind their flag at the Pyeongchang Olympics closing ceremonies on Sunday.
But the IOC said the suspension would be lifted -- in "a few days or a few weeks" -- if no new doping cases come out of the Games, where two Russians tested positive for doping.
The vote to maintain the ban for the time being followed a recommendation from the IOC's executive board, which met Saturday and early Sunday over Russia's fate.The IOC "could have considered lifting the suspension given that the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) had respected the IOC's decision of December 5," IOC president Thomas Bach said.
"However, two Russian athletes tested positive for doping here in Pyeongchang." The IOC decision was slammed by the lawyer for Russian whistleblower and former Moscow drug lab director Grigory Rodchenkov.
"Thomas Bach was a drowning man," lawyer Jim Walden said on the weekend.
"But finally cooler heads within the IOC threw him a life preserver. Yet in the decision, the IOC had the gall to claim Russia 'respected' its decision on December 5th to institute the suspension.
"This, despite Russia's continued retaliation against the IOC's main witness, Dr. Rodchenkov, and Russia's litany of further transgressions, including denial and obstruction toward the IOC and WADA. The acrimony caused by Bach's mismanagement should be his undoing."Russia was formally banned in December from taking part in the 2018 Olympics following revelations of widespread drug-cheating, but 168 athletes deemed "clean" were allowed to compete as neutrals.They were representing "Olympic Athletes from Russia" under strict guidelines including a ban on Russia's flag, national colours and the national anthem.

Agreement signed to re-establish Peace Corps program in Sri Lanka
Acting Director of the US Peace Corps Sheila Crowley and Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana signed a new bilateral agreement to re-establish a Peace Corps program in Sri Lanka. US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe witnessed the signing at Temple Trees.
The announcement coincides with the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and Sri Lanka and underscores the long history of partnership and mutual support between the two countries.
Peace Corps efforts in Sri Lanka will focus on English language education. Once in Sri Lanka, volunteers will undergo three months of comprehensive cultural, language and technical training before they are given their assignments to serve for two years. The first peace Corps volunteers are scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka in September 2019.
I am delighted that Peace Corps is returning to Sri Lanka. Our volunteers embody and promote the ideals of equality, shared prosperity and a common interest in a peaceful, stable world, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap said.
When signing the Executive Order that created the Peace Corps, President John F. Kennedy said, Our peace Corps is not designed as an instrument of diplomacy or propaganda or ideological conflict. It is designed to permit our people to exercise more fully their responsibilities in the great common cause of world development.
From 1962 to 1998, more than 370 Peace Corps volunteers served in Sri Lanka, working in education, health and youth development.
The program was closed in 1998 due to political instability. Peace Corps Crisis Corps, now Peace Corps Response, returned to Sri Lanka to support relief efforts in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
In 2016, the Government of Sri Lanka invited Peace Corps to return to work and assist in furthering the countrys development goals.
The return of Peace Corps to Sri Lanka is an opportunity to deepen the enduring friendship that has grown between our two countries over the past 70 years, Acting Peace Corps Director Sheila Crowley said.
We are grateful to the Government and people of Sri Lanka for their invitation to, once again, have Peace Corps volunteers serve side-by-side with Sri Lankans in their beautiful country.

## Title: The button is   forgotten   while the zip   remains hip!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, February 27, 2018 - 01:00
The button is   forgotten   while the zip   remains hip!
It was somewhere in the sixties, if my memory holds right, that the zipper beat the button in the Battle of the Fly. The new-fangled accessory created a revolution in Sri Lanka couture although it had caught up in Europe some three decades earlier.
That was when French fashion designers raved over zippers in mens trousers in 1937. Esquiremagazine declared the zipper, The newest tailoring idea for men. And among the zippered flys many virtues was that it would exclude the possibility of unintentional and embarrassing disarray. Obviously, the new zippered trouser owners had not yet discovered the experience of forgetting to zip-up.
Before zippers, clothing was held together with buttons and buttonholes, hooks and eyes, laces and, buckles. They all took an irritatingly long time to do up, not exactly a convenient way to dress. Because zippers are so commonplace, it is easy to forget their technical wizardry and hard to imagine a world sans zippers. The fastener, whose name is derived from the sound, or zip the slider makes when being closed, took over 20 years of determination and many great minds to create.
Today, except for a few traditionalists, the button has been forgotten while the zip is still hip. Some old conformists warn about the dangers of the zipper becoming a ripper in careless, hurried hands. But this could only happen to those free-wheeling males who go shockers over jockers and hold no brief for restricting underwear. Many years ago I used to have my clothes designed by a master cutter, a European tailor named Mayer. Mr. Mayers suits were elegantly stunning.
His tailoring establishment was located in Canal Row in the Fort on the first floor of the old Mathew building in the heart of Colombos bustling business district. Mr. Mayer a middle-aged, burly man with a shock of greying hair spoke flawless English with an east European accent. He had an impish sense of humour and loved pulling practical jokes on his clients.
His skills required to give impeccable structure and refinement to mens garments were astoundingly stylish. In addition, good-natured witty one-liners were his strong suit as well. Besides, his sewing jokes were strung seamlessly together. Whenever a client politely inquired how his business was doing he would say: Its sew-sew!
His creations were pure magic! Every stitch in the outfits was so neat and true and the cut was exquisite! The suits were authentic masterpieces of sartorial splendour. This self-effacing master tailor ran his business with boundless energy, greeting clients, overseeing his staff, doing some of the intricate detail work himself. Yes, Mr. Mayer had incredible pride of accomplishment and could measure you to perfection. You had the suit hanging on your body as naturally as if you had been born wearing it.
But he too was enamoured by the zipper as opposed to trouser buttons because as he rightly surmised they give you an elegant flat front without the slightest hint of a bulge. I heard him once sounding a warning to a habitual knickerless male: Its always better to safeguard Solomon Grundy by always slipping on an undie. As one die-hard, anti-underwear chappie said, about zippered slacks: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth.
That is because one slip of the zip could give incurable males with an anathema for underwear a painful nip on the pip or even worse, an excruciating rip.
For as long as I can remember people have been debating whether zippers are superior to buttons as a method of keeping the fly shut. But still the zipper has won a lot more people over. But they both have pros and cons. The zipper is effective in that you can pretty much operate it with only one hand. On the other hand you run a risk of the zipper getting stuck, and snagging a vital part of your anatomy. Zipper-dee-doo-dah!
For the preferred method of closure, its a battle fought between two camps, button believers and zipper zealots, with each side insisting their accoutrement superior. Buttons are easy to undo, but youre going to need two hands to shut them, which might be too much effort for some people.
But again a button almost never breaks, and if it does you only sew in a new one. The closure debate goes beyond just a question of old school versus new wave. It is also one of function. In terms of the technical adeptness required, most concur that the more efficient zipper wins out, with an undeniable convenience that keeps pace with our modern high-speed world. Besides as I see it zipper has a certain panache to it and sounds way cooler than button.
Apart from the occasional male model who, we are assured, is making some sort of gaping statement on the catwalk, an open fly is a little lighthouse that beams out to the world not only that youve had a wardrobe malfunction, but also that you are still unaware.
During the old button-up era an open fly was brought to the attention of the unsuspecting wearer quietly with the abbreviation TBO, meaning Trouser Button Open. Cousin Arlens warning on the same issue was far more mischievous and intriguing when he laughingly whispered to the unwary victim: Hey man, Tiny Baby Out!My brother Denis goes entirely the other way around and takes a leaf from the common book of prayer: We have left undone those things which we ought to have done!
But the times certainly are a-changing. And so are the kids who have become more precocious than the older generations have their own zip codes. Many kids I know deal with this issue in a matter-of-fact way. A zipper is open. The kid walks up to its owner and resorts to acronym : XYZPDQ. Unsure the guy exclaims: Huh What does that mean The kid replies: Examine Your Zipper Pretty Darn Quick! He looks down, surprised. Zips it up. End of issue.
When the subject came up for debate whether to tell someone about the embarrassing gap in his pants or not our computer whiz grandson Rex Tharindu said: I would tell him he has windows on his laptop.
But his kid brother Kingsley took a leaf, not from old Father Adams underwear, but from his newly learned kindergarten song and dance routine to steal the thunder. With a mischievous glint in his eye he took a lyrical excerpt from Thats the way the money goes. He said with brevity: I would tell him. Pop goes the weasel!

Cabinet reshuffle: Farce to hoodwink people: Prof. G.L.
The National Unity Governments Cabinet reshuffle is a farce designed to hoodwink the people, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L.Peiris said yesterday
Addressing a press conference at SLPP head office at Nelum Mawatha, Battaramulla, Peiris said that although the Government promised a complete Cabinet overhaul, only a few individuals had swapped portfolios.
Peiris noted that the failure of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance Ministers to take oaths was a clear sign of the divisions which exists between the two parties in the so-called unity government.
The former minister charged that appointing more ministers only meant that the cost of living burden on the people will be further increased.
He said the SLPP would launch a protest campaign demanding the government to hold a general election as the ruling party had been rejected by the people at the recent LG polls.

Two similar cannons were unearthed from the site earlier and this warranted archaeological excavations at the site, said Assistant Director of Archaeology W.H.A. Sumanadasa.

CB Governor urges collateral-free loans for young entrepreneurs
Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaswamy urged the management of commercial banks to consider granting collateral-free loans to young entrepreneurs with National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ).
The Governor had made this request at a meeting with the CEOs of the commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka, recently.
Dr Coomaraswamy drew the attention of the CEOs to the difficulties faced by potential young entrepreneurs in obtaining loans from formal banking institutions to begin or improve their businesses due to their inability to meet collateral requirement.
He requested the CEOs to find some way of granting small loans without collateral to those who have NVQ qualifications, so that they can purchase machinery and equipment and begin or improve their businesses.
The Governors request was based on a research finding that a large number of young entrepreneurs with professional NVQ qualifications have recently started businesses in the services sector in Sri Lanka. Hair dressing, beauty culture, bridal dressing, event organization, catering and delivery of goods and services, etc, have become popular among young entrepreneurs.
The study was carried out by the Policy Development Office of the Prime Ministers Office together with the Small Scale Enterprise Development Division of the National Policy and Economic Affairs Ministry and the Census and Statistics Department.
We understand the difficulty in releasing a loan without having a security against it. Although the CBSL provides 100 percent refinance facilities for some of the concessionary loan schemes targeting the micro, small and medium scale enterprises, the credit risk is with the participating financial Institutions. However, we have a collective responsibility to help these young entrepreneurs to begin or improve their businesses making them financially inclusive. They will be your future customers, the Governor said.
The Policy Development Office issuing a press communiqu yesterday pointed out that these young entrepreneurs have been brave and venturesome enough to start enterprises without any state handouts or tax concessions. The release pointed out that the first few years of such a business are challenging and need commitment and innovation for survival.
They now need access to funds to expand and consolidate their businesses to get to the next level. They are Sri Lankas potential future tycoons, the Upali Wijewardenas, the Harry Jayawardenas, the Ken Balendras, the Dhammika Pereras, the Nawalokas, the Gnanams, the N.L. Mubaraks, the Amaleans, the Omars, and the Captains, of tomorrow. They must be nurtured. They need to access funds now. Financial service providers must respond, the release stated.

Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) leader and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday demanded an urgent political solution to the burning issues of the country.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the JHU office in Battaramulla.
Demanding clear and powerful government reforms, the Minister stressed the importance of working on a political plan for the burning issues of the country, including the SAITM issue, public servants salaries, drought, fertilizer issue and drinking water issue.
He said that the government should identify the key priorities that needed attention within the next 18 months, before implementing this plan.
That plan should be implemented with the agreement of both parties of the government. It is also necessary to involve 50 young MPs of the UNP and 36 young MPs of SLFP in this plan, he added. The JHU leader further stressed the necessity of uniting all member parties of the yahapalana government to fulfill the pledges made to the public during the 2018 election campaign, without boasting about their parties.
The Minister stressed the importance of identifying the weaknesses of the good governance government and taking immediate measures to correct them, since the people of this country are disillusioned by the weaknesses of the government.
Minister Ranawaka further said that the local government election results clearly proved peoples dissatisfaction with the government.
JHU Co-Chairman Hedigalle Wimalasara, Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana, Deputy Chairman Nirosha Athukorala and National Organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe also participated at the occasion.

Is there a yardstick to measure crossovers
The political crossovers have been prohibited, I read in media. Well, the politicians should be prohibited from many things such as crossing over from the right to the wrong. This, the politicians of this blessed land have never put in force. Myriads of wrong decisions have been dancing around the ruling parties since 1948, as a result of unholy crossovers.
It should be a cumbersome  and time-consuming as well  exercise to elucidate the consequences of such crossovers in detail.
One thing is certain. This country is in a deadlocked situation. The naming and shaming are now the order of the day. In such a backdrop, are we well positioned to define  or perhaps redefine  this much hackneyed term, crossover Can the politicians define it themselves, in the first place
As an ordinary citizen, I observe this as just another ploy, following the previous regimes, in order to strengthen the party leadership, keep being elected and cringing on bended knees.
The possibilities of a crossover could be numerous. A physical cross over, for one, happens with the persons who hold different or opposite views. Sitting on the opposite side but agreeing or voting in favour of the ruling party is another occurrence. It is a selective crossover with no physical movement involved. We can observe a number of consensual crossovers as well. For instance, a section of the SLFP has joined ranks with the UNP.
Legally and physically, this could be also termed as a crossover. It takes place between one defined party and another. Only God in heaven knows how these parties, which beak up and sell their rights, have gained entry to the August Assembly.
The President is left without much option on these matters. As a neutral personality, he could have executed the wisest move by summoning the UNP  the party that commands the majority of the incumbent parliament - to form the Government.

Colombo Port expenditure cut by 8.6 percent
The expenditure of the Colombo Port has been reduced by 8.6 percent in 2017 in comparison to 2016, said Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday.
He also added that the Colombo Port has increased its income by 3.5 percent as well, in comparison to the previous year, making a total profit of Rs 13 billion in 2017.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Ports and Shipping Ministry auditorium.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Dr Parakrama Dissanayake said the expenditure of the Ports Authority was Rs. 33,005 million in 2016 and dropped to Rs 30,180 million in 2017. He said nearly Rs. 3,000 million has been saved in 2017.
He pointed out that the reduction of the expenditure is a challenge even for a private company. This target could be achieved by stern control implemented by the Ports Authority as well as the employees' commitment to make it a success. Areas such as use of electricity in particular, had been focused on for reduction of expenditure.
Minister Samarasinghe further stated that the Sri Lanka Ports Authority's profit had been increased to Rs 13.2 billion as it was rid of the loan taken for the construction of the Hambantota Port.
The Eastern Terminal is to be developed with the funds of the Ports Authority. The Eastern Terminal requires only equipment to bring it up to standard, he said.

Court orders gang leaders body to be given to wife
The Wattala Magistrates Court had issued an order that the body of underworld figure Dadalle Manju who was shot and killed by the STF last week during a raid, be handed over to his wife.
The Wattala Police had sought court assistance with regard to the handing over of his body, as his wife and mother were each demanding the body.
Therefore, the body was kept at the Ragama hospital mortuary, pending the court verdict.
Meanwhile, due to hostility between the two parties, the mother and sister of the gang leader had reportedly assaulted his wife when she had tried to take custody of his body.
Manjus mother had told police that the woman claiming her sons body is not his legal wife and the marriage certificate produced by her is fake.
However, Manjus wife had told police that she was legally married to him and has a six-year-old child by him.
The underworld drug leader, Dadallage Manju, was shot and killed in a confrontation with the STF last Thursday in Wattala. STF personnel had engaged in a search operation based on a tip-off and while they tried to search a van, the occupants of the van had opened fire on them. In retaliation, the STF had shot back killing Manju.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 17: Test of exemplary leader is whether he can set an example and build commitment
In any organization, the team members will get highly frustrated when their team leader says one thing at their meeting and then does something quite different later. It is quite natural. When you think about leadership the words: trust, credibility, relationships, communication, and consistency come to mind to name a few. The importance of connecting your words with action is critical in developing into a respected leader.
We were talking about Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner last week. We have learnt last week that James Kouzes and Barry Posner, authors of The Leadership Challenge, identified modeling the way as one of five practices of exemplary leadership. In fact, it is said to be the most critical leadership practice.
What does it really mean It means, the leader doing what he or she expects the followers to do. If you expect people to speak respectfully to each other, speak respectfully to them. If you expect people to be on time for meetings, as the leader, always be there a few minutes ahead and begin exactly on time, every time, no exceptions.
Leaders model the way
Modeling the way means leaders go first. Transformational leaders set an example and build commitment through daily acts that create progress and momentum. They create a program of excellence and then set the example for others to follow.
To model the way, leaders need to have a philosophy, a set of high standards by which the organization is measured, a set of principles concerning the way people should be treated, and the way goals should be pursued that make the organization unique and distinctive.
These leaders show by example that they live by the values they advocate. They believe that consistency between words and deeds builds their credibility as transformational leaders
Leaders set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with their organizations shared values. They accomplish this by:
Clarifying their own personal values. People expect their leaders to stand for something, and to have the courage of their convictions. Leaders who lack core values are likely to change their position with every fad, and will be judged eventually as inconsistent and political in their behavior. Values are the standards that help us determine what we will and will not do. They influence every aspect of our lives: our moral judgments, our responses to others, our commitments to personal and organizational goals.
Building a consensus of shared values. Leaders represent groups. For the people to be mobilized in unity, they must all share the same values. Thus the leaders must gain consensus on a common cause and a common set of principles, thereby building a community of shared values that will form the solid bedrock of an organizations vitality and effectiveness. This takes time since the people must truly own the values; unity is forged, not forced.
Auditing their actions. People pay more attention to the values their leaders actually use than to those the leaders say they believe in. Effective leaders must set good examples, establish high standards for themselves, and personally practice what they preach. A profitable exercise in this regard is to list the values you preach and then systematically compare them with those values actually reflected by your calendar for the last month.
Seizing opportunities to teach. Critical incidents present opportunities for leaders to teach important lessons about appropriate norms of behavior. Leaders will watch for these opportunities, and use them to illuminate and reinforce the organizations values.
Lived values
We do what our leaders do. Consciously and unconsciously, we commit when our leaders commit. We walk the talk when we observe those we deem credible walking the talk. We risk our personal investment when they risk and personally invest.
So, what does this mean If you are a leader, if you have the right values statement, you will be giving hundreds of opportunities to your subordinates every day to model the way. For example, if you say: If I am accountable for successes and for mistakes, others around me will do the same. If I am open to receiving feedback, and acting on the feedback I receive, it will be easier for those around me to be open to feedback. If I communicate in honest and direct ways, I will likely receive the same, in return. Values on the wall are nice to have and they sound impressive. 
Lived values, values in-use are what will really change culture, one person at a time. Personal credibility is one of the most critical personal traits of a leader. Leaders promote two principles in this practice: find your voice to clarify values and set the example.
Find your voice to clarify values
What do guiding principles look like How do you clarify your personal values into guiding principles and shared values with your team As an emerging leader, what would comprise a personal credo
Often, guiding principles revolve around how you will act in term of: accountability, coaching, collaboration, commitment, communication, compassion, competence, expertise, humility, mentoring, passion, respect, responsibility, or trust. The process of discerning your personal values and guiding principles is the foundation for your moral compass.
Personal credo
A personal credo is a simple outline of your personal and professional beliefs, (credo is Latin for I believe). The beliefs you identify and describe are the beliefs others should respect and follow because of what you stand for. I have a personal credo that I shared with my staff when I was a corporate executive, and I now share with my subordinates.
* I believe I must be fiercely passionate about my work.
* I believe in the rigorous use of methods and techniques to achieve efficiency and effectiveness.
* I believe that being organized in my work habits, which frees my mind for higher achievements.
* I believe that disciplined written and verbal communications creates a framework for concise and precise communications with my team and colleagues.
* I believe in Excellence in the delivery of my and my teams work.
* I believe my choices are made through a highly focused and directed personal will to achieve only the very best possible results.
Exemplary leaders lead the charge. You do this by setting the example. On a daily basis, you must be committed and engaged in action that demonstrates your beliefs are worthwhile living. Your first action is a collaborative approach where you build a consensus around the shared values of your team and organization. As Kouzes and Posner have said The leader's belief in and commitment to the vision were the sparks that ignited the flame of inspiration.
Setting the example
Itemize the challenges you face in leading each project. Is it budget and funding Is it the consultants who are domineering or the staff who are resistant to change Is it the inability to share and collaborate, i.e., break down the silos Is it an institutional history that says the last initiative was a failure, so this one will likely be so as well Is it the lack of executive sponsorship
Now take an inventory of your current team members. Are there other significant stakeholders you should include How will each team member and stakeholder measure success What are the critical success factors (CSFs) Are you dreading this project, or are you enthused and emotionally charged Outline why you think the project is important to you, the stakeholders, and your organization.
Find a method to log your values and other team members values. Are there common, clear, shared values you could use to help the team converge on a goal Discuss your values with those of the team. Locate shared values that can be articulated. If you find there are none, I suggest finding some way to get yourself off the team, since it is a train wreck waiting to happen.
Communicate the shared values outside of the team. Create a team credo that suggests guiding principles for the project. As the leader, make sure you daily act in congruence with the values identified for the team. A team with visible values and principles is a team that works and plays together well, and will have a higher probability of success.
Summary
We will summarize what we discussed above. Leaders establish principles concerning the way people (subordinates, peers, colleagues, and customers alike) should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow. Because the prospect of complex change can overwhelm people and stifle action, they set interim goals so that people can achieve small wins as they work toward larger objectives. They unravel bureaucracy when it impedes action; they put up signposts when people are not sure of where to go or how to get there; and they create opportunities for victory
The most important personal quality people look for and admire in a leader is personal credibility. Credibility is the foundation of leadership. If people dont believe in the messenger, they wont believe the message.
Leaders are supposed to stand up for their beliefs, so you should have beliefs to stand up for. Leaders must be clear about their guiding principles. They must find their own voices, and then they must clearly and authentically give voice to their values.
Modeling the Way begins with the clarification of personal values and involves building and affirming shared values that all can embrace.
Next week we will discuss the practice and principle: inspire a shared vision by envisioning an uplifting future.

Cyrus criticised for hanging out with White
Miley Cyrus has faced criticism online after befriending Olympic gold medallist Shaun White, despite the snowboarder and rocker facing allegations of sexual misconduct.
The Wrecking Ball hitmaker took to Instagram on February 20 to share a photo of herself hanging out with the sportsman, a week after he took home gold in the men's halfpipe at the Winter Olympics in South Korea.
In the snap, Miley pulled a face as she wore his latest medal around her neck, holding up his dog, Leroy, in one hand, and a prayer candle featuring an image of Shaun in the other.
"Chillin' with an American legend... and I mean @leroythegoodboy," she joked. "Kidding @shaunwhite, you are the s**t! So bada**! Proud of you!"
Fans were quick to share their congratulatory messages for Shaun online, but some people were left unimpressed by Miley's snap with the snowboarder, who recently apologised for dismissing claims of sexual harassment made against him as "gossip" in a TV interview after his big win at the Olympics.
"I love you @mileycyrus but Shaun is an alleged abuser who hasn't dealt with the accusations tastefully, calling them gossip. Stay aware," posted one follower, while a second Instagram user asked, "Why everyone ignored the abuse allegations against Shaun White (sic)".
"Disappointed you're associating with him, especially as a feminist," read another comment. "still love you doe (sic)."
The misconduct allegations originally hit headlines in a 2016 lawsuit filed against Shaun by his former Bad Things drummer Lena Zawaideh. They settled the case last summer, but when the sports ace was quizzed about the accusations shortly after his halfpipe victory, he brushed them off by telling reporters, "I'm here to talk about the Olympics, not gossip and stuff."
White, 31, subsequently expressed his regret at his "poor choice of words", insisting he is a changed man.
Miley has yet to respond to the backlash online, but she has previously voiced her backing of the Time's Up and #MeToo anti-harassment movements, even holding a white rose on the red carpet at the Grammy Awards last month to show her support to victims of sexual misconduct.

Delayed reshuffle due to some UPFA ministers going abroad - Duminda
The Cabinet reshuffle for those representing the UPFA was delayed due to several ministers having flown overseas, SLFP General Secretary Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said. The delayed reshuffle will take place within the next two weeks, he also said.
Minister Dissanayake also said if the reshuffle took place at the same time it would have been proper and methodical.
However, a delay of the reshuffle would have caused unnecessary troubles since President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to reshuffle the Cabinet at the earliest possible date.
The date was set for last Sunday. However, several ministers had to go abroad for official and otherwise reasons. We couldnt reshuffle half the UPFA ministers. So we postponed it for another two weeks and did the changes only to the UNP representatives, Minister Dissanayake pointed out.
Asked if the SLFP is happy with the Cabinet reshuffle, Minister Dissanayake explained that they forwarded several proposals prior to the Cabinet reshuffle and most of them were accepted. Thus, he said the SLFP is relatively happy with the reshuffle.
Asked if Sri Lanka Freedom Party and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna are to reach an understanding, SLFP General Secretary Minister Dissanayake said they could always come to an understanding following a discussion. The problem here is that there are several persons who are accused of corruption in the SLPP. We cannot avoid these corruption allegations just because we are getting back together. We need to come to an agreement about these persons. Otherwise we have no issue receiving the SLPP supporters back into our party, he said.

Education Ministry to resume tablet distribution
Narrow-minded criticism by various groups led to the temporary halt of the programme to distribute tablets to Advanced Level students, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
We stopped giving tablets for Advanced Level students and we hope to resume the programme this year, he said.
He made this comment at an event to hand over teaching appointment letters to 71 National Colleges of Education diploma holders at the Education Ministry auditorium yesterday.
These appointments were given according to available vacancies at national schools in the provinces. The appointments have been offered to Sinhala and Tamil medium teachers.
The minister said the school uniform material currently distributed was of good quality, but the previous government gave low-quality material for school uniforms. Reports indicate that about 30 percent of children did not receive uniforms during the previous regime.
We also gave appointments to 4,000 principals and we expect to add IT as a compulsory subject, the minister said.
He said the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) manages the insurance programme Suraksha Sisu Rakshanaya, for students between the ages of 5-19 in government schools, non-aided or aided private schools, pirivena schools and international schools.

Fisheries Ministry takes steps to cut post-harvest losses
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to reduce post-harvest losses to provide high-quality fish for exports with the intention of making the fisheries sector the third largest contributor to the GDP by 2020.
According to the Ministry statistics, the present contribution of the fisheries sector to the GDP is 1.4 percent and the sector is at the 11th place.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that according to NARA, the country loses around 40-60 percent fish harvest due to post-harvest losses.
Around 40-60 percent of the fish caught by fishermen is not suitable for human consumption, not even to make dried fish. This stock of fish is destroyed without any benefit, said the minister.
The fisheries sector contribution to the GDP can be increased up to 5 percent with the prevention of post-harvest losses, he said.
Considering this situation, Minister Amaraweera has instructed Ministry officials to implement programmes to minimize post-harvest losses.
The Ministry has taken a number of measures in this regard, including the improvement of fishermens knowledge, modernization of fishing vessels, introduction of new hi-tech fishing vessels, the use of quality ice and water, the introduction of new technology for fishing, regularizing the fish harvest unloading process and improving refrigeration facilities at fisheries harbours.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based conglomerate Richard Pieris & Company PLCs (RICH) National Long-Term rating at A(lka) with a stable outlook. Fitch has also affirmed the National rating on RICHs outstanding senior unsecured debentures at A (lka).
The affirmation of RICHs ratings reflects our view that the improvement in the groups adjusted net leverage was offset by the underperformance in its tyre business and some segments in the plastics sector over the last 18 months, and the risks around their recovery prospects over the medium term, limiting any positive rating action. RICHs rating also reflects the groups diversified cash flows, market leadership in several of its segments, and the companys well-established operating history. Fitch Ratings also expects the company to increase capex in the next two years in a bid to expand production capacity in the retail, rubber and palm oil segments.
We expect store expansion and a shift in consumer preference towards hypermarkets and supermarkets to lead to double-digit revenue growth for the companys retail segment in the medium term.

Fitness  with a twist
Just treadmills and ellipticals wont do. Fitness lovers today want more intense, goal-based workouts coupled with fun. Predictable gym routines are boring while yoga is just not enough. This is where the new breed of fitness lovers come in. Movement, strength and agility are what they focus on and there is hardly a dull moment during their workouts.
USA certified Zumba instructor Shara Weralavithana of Fitness Routine will hold FR Concert 2018 giving female fitness enthusiasts a taste of Zumba. The event will be held at the Town Hall in Wattala on March 4 at 5 pm. Shara and 12 USA certified Zumba instructors in the country will get together to train the participants on the Zumba session.
Shara has five years of experience in the Zumba field and she has been in the fitness arena for many years. She says that Zumba has become popular throughout the years and more and more people are looking to take it on as a means of keeping in shape.
There is a lot of variety in movements and dancing styles. We can choose the music and routine we like and engage in the fitness program. It is suitable for people of all ages and walks of life, Shara said.
She says that a session normally is about one hour. FR Concert 2018 will go for 90 minutes. They will be able to get some knowledge from the workshop that they will conduct on that day.
Speaking about the health benefits that are involved with Zumba Shara said that she has lost around 20 kilos by doing Zumba.
Normally you watch the clock when you engage in excercises because it is a tedious process for you. Since a person enjoys doing Zumba and since a session is only for a short span, you cannot feel the time passing by, she explained.
A person can enjoy a full body workout, burn calories and fat as well as boost their mood when they engage in Zumba. It is also a place where you can socialize since there will be many other participants. Workouts dont have to be a chore anymore. In fact, workouts dont have to feel like workouts at all. With Zumba, a workout isnt even a workout: its a fun, social dance party with exercise being the biggest perk!

Kavindu Dushan Mudalige riding in the Group SM Supermotard on a Honda CRF 250cc had the best timing for the day clocking an impressive 38.850 seconds to win the event in style and also the Best Riders Award on offer.
The only major incident reported on the track was Yasith Gamages vehicle which went off the track crashing onto a tree causing heavy damage but Yasith was lucky to escape sans injuries.
Due to intermittent rains that came down the drivers riders were not able to touch their maximum possible on their machines with the expectation of setting up new records. Full credit should go to the organizers who managed to complete the events on a high note under difficult conditions due to the unexpected rains.

Four dead in Leicester explosion; terrorism ruled out
UK: Four people have died after a suspected explosion and subsequent fire destroyed a shop in Leicester, England, Police said.
Leicestershire police said another four people remained in hospital following the incident in the west of the city on Sunday night, one with serious injuries. Meanwhile, British police said Sunday there was no indication that the reported explosion and building collapse in Leicester was linked to terrorism.
The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service, local police said in a statement.
We would ask that the media and public do not speculate about the circumstances surrounding the incident, but at this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related.
The apparent explosion occurred Sunday evening on a stretch of road containing commercial and residential properties close to the city centre.
There are four confirmed fatalities at this stage and a number of people still undergoing treatment in hospital, said Supt Shane ONeill. The building consisted of a shop premises on the ground level and a two-storey flat above it.
We believe there may be people who have not yet been accounted for and rescue efforts continue in order to locate any further casualties. - AFP
The blaze ripped through a row of shops on Hinckley Road on the outskirts of Leicester.

Getting the act together
President Maithripala Sirisena has certainly taken stock of the adverse message conveyed to the government by the voters at the LG election and has declared his intention to put the house in order. Speaking, after swearing in six new ministers, and, three state ministers, at yesterday's mini Cabinet reshuffle, at the Presidential Secretariat, the President said; we all accept the need to act according to the message received from the recent Local Government elections and implement a new programme of work, with new ideas, and proposals, by effecting reforms, and, changes, relating to government activities. The President said, the verdict of the people shows the need to correct our wrongs, remedy the shortcomings, and, introduce required political reforms, by changing state policies and activities. He said, the reforms that are being contemplated, in keeping with the results, are not something peculiar to Sri Lanka, but a common feature in all countries, in the world.
The President, perhaps, has assessed the situation dispassionately unlike some of his Cabinet ministers, in the SLFP, who have called for the dismissal of the Unity Government, and, also, the Prime Minister. This, after its own poor showing at the election, where it came a distant third after the UNP, in most councils, and, in a couple of LG bodies in the deep south, was beaten by the JVP, to fourth place. The SLFP ministers and MPs cannot go on blaming the UNP's economic policies for their own debacle. The party held powerful ministries in the Unity Government, and were able to act independently of the UNP, in serving the public. For example, the Agriculture portfolio was held by a SLFP minister, who was also the party General Secretary. An analysis of the results would show that the SLFP received a severe thrashing in the agricultural heartland in the raja rata, represented by this minister. Even the President's own home base, where cultivation is the main livelihood, suffered a setback. It all cannot be debited to Ranil Wickremesinghe.
As the President said, what matters now is to place the defeat in its proper perspective, and, get back to the drawing boards, once again, to map out a comprehensive strategy after identifying the shortcomings and device measures to win back the hearts of the voters, who have drifted away from the government. It is certainly not too late to effect the reforms, and, garner the results. There is a full two and half years still left for the Unity Government to complete its term. However, to achieve success, unity is vital. The bickering, and, the name calling, within the alliance, no doubt, took its toll, as we have been repeatedly saying, in these columns.
True, by their very nature, the UNP and SLFP are, ideologically, and, outlook wise, different to each other, and there are bound to be policy clashes. But these differences should be overcome, when working as a single unit. A show of unity would go a long way in restoring public confidence, in the government.
This is why the swearing-in of Ministers on two separate occasions, the first for the UNP, and, the other, the SLFP/UPFA, two weeks hence, is deemed unfortunate, in many quarters. This, no doubt, would serve to exacerbate the feeling that all is still not well within the Unity Government, and, the reshuffle was, but a cosmetics exercise, to dupe the masses.
Hence, it is the President, alone, who could be the binding glue that would bring the two disparate forces together, to sue for peace. The demand made by some SLFP ministers for the ouster of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is also untenable. They will have to live with this reality, however unpalatable it may be, to them. Hence, whining for his removal could only lead to further instability, and, do considerable damage to the government, and, the own electoral prospects of the gripers.
Its just not on
The uncalled for remarks made by certain UNP MPs and a state minister, who should know better, outside the Presidential Secretariat, on Sunday, following the swearing of new ministers by President Maithripala Sirisena, was unfortunate, to say the least. True, they genuinely voiced the people's resentment towards the government, for the raw deal received from Yahapalanaya, as reflected in the LG poll results. But, disparaging the leadership for the setback, particularly, by the scion of a leading political family in the country, was certainly not on. He and his ilk were only providing ammunition to the Opposition, by their conduct. What those attacking the Premier should realize is that what was being implemented were collective Cabinet decisions and not the decisions by a single individual. Midterm election reversals were also the norm, during the Premiership of a forebear of this state minister, in the mid sixties, but there were no demands from within the party that he steps down, as a result.
With personages such as this, who do much damage, to the Grand Old Party, fostered and nurtured by the ancestors of this selfsame State Minister, the Blues need not to break into any sweat.

Gotas Avant Garde case re-fixed for March 26
A corruption case filed against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government when giving permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury was yesterday re-fixed for trial on March 26 by the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, several defence counsel that appeared for the defence party moved Court that the trial be fixed for another date since they have to appear before the Supreme Court. Taking into consideration facts, the Chief Magistrate decided to fix the trial for another date and witness number three of the case was advised to appear in court on the next trial date.
Meanwhile, the Court was informed that first accused Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had filed a revision petition in the Court of Appeal challenging Chief Magistrates Court and Colombo High Courts decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
At a previous occasion, the Chief Magistrate decided to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabaya Rajapaksa citing that the Director General of Bribery Commission is vested with power to file cases in the Magistrates Court in accordance with the Bribery Commission Act. The defence had raised preliminary objections alleging that the Bribery Commission Director General had filed this case without the written sanction of the Bribery Commission.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Bribery Commission. Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva with Ali Sabry PC appeared for the former Defence Secretary.
When the matter came up before the Chief Magistrate, seven accused, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Avant Garde Chairman Major Nissanka Senadhipathi, former Navy Commanders Somatilleke Dissanayake, Jayanath Kolambage and Jayantha Perera, Rtd. Major General Palitha Piyasiri Fernando and Banda Adhikari were present in Court. The charge sheets comprising 19 counts were served on the accused before Chief Magistrate.
Meanwhile, the Chief Magistrate had at a previous occasion allowed to proceed with the case in absentia of second accused Sujatha Damayanthi, former Additional Secretary of the Defence Ministry. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against eight accused under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had given permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury between August 7, 2012 and January 8, 2015 in violation of laws by providing unlawful income to this private company, amounting to Rs.11.4 billion.

LETS MEET UP SATURDAY MORNING UNDER THE TAMARIND TREES AND PLAY CRICKET!
THE GREATEST CRICKET MATCH EVER
Its the big match season. The Thurstan-Isipathana game is already done. The older big matches will follow and there will be dozens more which were inaugurated more recently in the coming weeks. The Sri Lanka cricket team performed well and theres hope that better times are ahead, especially under the new coach Chandika Hathurusinghe. We can talk about other things of course, but lets doff our caps to King Cricket for a moment.
Im not sure how it is now, but back in the day come big-match time kids in boys schools were inevitably asked to write essays that could be headlined The best cricket match ever. We had to write one almost every year. One year stands out. 1979. The cricket match most talked about that year in our school was the Centenary Battle of the Blues. That was what everyone who picked that particular essay topic wrote about.
There were two exceptions. Laksiri Chandana Kurukulasuriya wrote about the Finals of that years Exide Trophy in which Royal, led by Ranjan Madugalle, defeated Nalanda College, a keenly fought encounter. I wrote about the famous and first tie in test cricket, between Australia and the West Indies played in Brisbane in 1960, about which I had read. I focused on the epic final over bowled by Wesley Hall. I still remember the commentary: Wes Hall began his run up, as always, from the boundary line. Kurukulasuriya had figured out that best was subjective while I realized that it need not be a match I had seen. I am sure we both entertained our English teacher.
Cricket, however, was not only about big matches or famous encounters. Sure, they were great and we had a lot of fun. That, however came once a year. Looked forward to, experienced, and talked about for a few days thereafter.
Cricket though was almost an everyday thing. Cricket or French Cricket before schools began, during the interval and sometimes after schoo and of course book-cricket, to help pass the intervening hours.
There were classic matches where there were no impartial umpires or scorers with epic bowling, fielding and batting efforts which were forgotten the moment the bell rang. Looking back, one of the most memorable matches was one played when we were in Grade 6. I cant remember the scores. It was not a match, but a series. Three matches played over an entire term during the interval; just 20 minutes or so of intensely fought cricket.
It was an unfair match-up. It was the Tamil Medium boys going against their Sinhala Medium counterparts. Unfair, because there was one Tamil Medium class and six Sinhala Medium classes. Nalliah Devarajan, who later played for Royal and his teammates didnt seem to mind. The match was played in the corner of a rectangular space bordered by the Grade 6 block, an old building with wooden floors and corridors with railings that allowed birds eye views to the spectators. There was a lot of cheering. No jeers. Good cricket. Good sportsmanship. Good memories.
Today, I am imagining that the editor has asked me to write about the greatest cricket match youve seen. It happened a little over two years ago.
It was a Saturday. That evening those who entered Royal Junior School in 1971 or Royal College in 1976 at Grade 6 or joined that particular class at different times were to have a grand reunion. All reunions become that much more special as the years go by, but this was particularly special since most of the boys had turned or were to turn 50 that year.
What was special about this particular instance was not the landmark of it was years, but the presence of around 25 boys from the Tamil Medium class. It was, pertinently, the batch that sat for the A/Ls in 1983, that terrible year. Most of the Tamil Medium boys suffered. I am not even sure how many managed to sit the exam. All I know is that most of them migrated.
As they turned fifty, we learned, they had wanted a special reunion. Some said North America but others wanted it Down Under, the preferences largely based on residence. Someone suggested a neutral venue, such as Bali, but one had said lets celebrate in the land of our birth. So they came. A few had never visited Sri Lanka after they left. Many had, but only sporadically.
On a whim, someone posted a suggestion: lets meet up Saturday morning under the Tamarind Trees and play cricket! Royalists would know, others would understand. The Tamarind Trees are iconic just as other trees or buildings or spaces in other schools are probably iconic to the particular students.
And so we met. There was food. And drink. More than a dozen boys from the Tamil Medium turned up. Everyone recognised everyone else. The years collapsed. They were all schoolboys once again, doing schoolboy things. It was not a Tamil-Sinhala match. The teams were randomly picked. There were boys from all three mediums in both teams. A couple of kids were also recruited to make the numbers since many just wanted to enjoy the show, as is the usual case.
I dont remember the scores. Someone must have kept count of the runs but no one was interested in the result. That match sucked out bellies, turned grey into black, wigged bald heads, made limps disappear and turned men into boys. It was, in a sense, one of the most special embraces Ive ever seen. It was the greatest match ever. By quite a margin.

Green helps spice up Spurs offence in win over Cavs
Los Angeles, Monday: LaMarcus Aldridge led the offensive attack in the paint and Danny Green shot the lights out from long distance as the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 110-94 on Sunday.
Aldridge finished with 27 points and Green chipped in 22 as the Spurs snapped a four-game losing skid.
Green missed Friday's loss to Denver with food poisoning but on Sunday he delivered the perfect side dish to Aldridge's dynamic inside game with his five three-pointers.
"Every win is a big one for us," Green said. "But this month we've had some ups and downs. This is a really good team, especially with the best player in the world over there."
Indeed, Cavs' superstar LeBron James flirted with a triple double by finishing with 33 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists but that's not what James wanted to talk about after the loss.
The reigning All-Star Game MVP slammed officials after the game, saying they are not calling enough fouls on him.
"There's no reason I should be going to the line four times in a game when I drive 100 times to the paint and I'm getting hit and slapped and grabbed and whatever and what not," James said.
James thinks the officials are protecting players that shoot a lot of three-point shots and not calling enough fouls on players like him who like to drive to the basket.
'Chicks dig long ball'
"Chicks dig the long ball and that's what it's about," James said.
San Antonio was called for 12 personal fouls -- only three in the second half -- and shot 32 free throws compared to 14 for Cleveland.
Cleveland dropped to 3-2 since overhauling their roster before the all-star break with three trades.
Dejounte Murray added 13 points and nine rebounds for San Antonio, who are playing without injured star Kawhi Leonard. Elsewhere, Jrue Holiday scored 28 of his 36 points after halftime to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 123-121 overtime victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.
Holiday chipped in nine rebounds and six assists for New Orleans, who won their season-high fifth straight game.
Milwaukee's Jason Terry tossed up a potential game-winning three-pointer but the officials ruled it was after the buzzer.Anthony Davis added 27 points and 13 rebounds for the Pelicans, who trailed by 18 early in the second half but outscored Milwaukee 38-19 in the third quarter.
James Harden scores 27 of his 41 points in the first half as the Houston Rockets held on to beat the Denver Nuggets 119-114. AFP

Household debt increases in many advanced economies-Moodys
Moodys Investor Services notes that household debt has increased in many advanced economies over the past decade.
The increase in and diversification of household income sources as a result of increased female integration into the labor market should act as a buffer to higher individual debt levels and consequently reduce the risk of broader financial instability.
Moodys Investors Service also says that policies to promote greater female labor market participation in high-income countries will, if they are successful, boost sovereign creditworthiness.
In particular, sovereign creditworthiness will improve through three main channels: economic growth by partly offsetting shrinking labor forces, government balance sheets by widening the tax base and easing pension pressure, and, potentially, financial stability by shoring up household finances.
Moodys conclusions are contained in its just-released report titled Sovereigns  Advanced Economies: Higher female labor force participation mitigates demographic pressures.
Among high-income economies in member countries forming the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Moodys sees the greatest scope for positive credit impacts in countries where populations are ageing fastest and where governments have highlighted female participation as a key priority, particularly Japan (A1 stable) and Korea (Aa2 stable).
Moodys report identifies three main advantages to sovereigns of higher female employment: 1) a higher number of workers and higher productivity growth would partly offset the growth impact of shrinking of working-age populations, 2) a broader tax revenue base would enhance public finances, and 3) a higher share of two-income households would likely support greater financial stability.

Huawei unveils first car to be driven by AI-powered smartphone
Huawei, the global technology leader, has become the first mobile device manufacturer in the world to use an AI-powered smartphone to drive a car.
The RoadReader project pushes the boundaries of Huaweis object recognition technology and puts the learning capabilities, speed and performance of its AI-powered devices to the test.
Unlike other driverless cars, which simply detect obstacles, Huawei has transformed a Porsche Panamera into a driverless vehicle that doesnt just see, but crucially, understands its surroundings. This means it can distinguish between 1,000s of different objects including a cat and a dog, a ball or a bike and learn to take the most appropriate course of action.
Most autonomous cars currently being developed rely on the computing power of purpose-built chips developed by third party technology providers.
However, as part of its ongoing mission to make the impossible possible, Huawei has used technology already available in its smartphones, demonstrating its superior functionality and ability to stand up to even the most advanced technology developed for use in self-driving cars.
Andrew Garrihy, Chief Marketing Officer of Huawei Western Europe stated Our smartphone is already outstanding at object recognition. We wanted to see if in a short space of time we could teach it to not only drive a car, but to use its AI capabilities to see certain objects, and be taught to avoid them. If our technology is intelligent enough to achieve this in just 5 weeks  what else can it make possible
Huawei will be showcasing the RoadReader project and the vehicles capabilities at a two-day event at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona (MWC) from February 26-27.

I will take responsibility of defeat at LG polls: SLFP Gen. Sec.
General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said that he is ready to take the responsibility of the SLFP's defeat at the Local Government Election held recently.
He pointed out that the SLFP election campaing was a collective effort. There were several committees appointed to overlook the SLFP election campaign, Minister Dissanayake said. All those committees overlooking the campaign should share the responsibility of the setback recorded by the SLFP.
Minister Dissanayake said the post of General Secretary of a political party is like a chopping-block and said If I am expected to sacrifice my head at the chopping board, I am more than willing to.
Minister Dissanayake said that if there is any discussions on his role as the General Secretary of SLFP, those should be aired at the Central Committee meeting. "If someone is discussing such matters outside the Central Committee, that is uncustomary. This is a moment we should get together and motivate out voters, he said.
Minister Dissanayake, pointing out that he gave up his position, power and security when he walked out from the previous regime, said that he can dedicate anything to secure the mandate of the Yahapalana government elected in 2015.
The only challenge I have is to fulfill the mandate we pledge in 2015, he said.

Janashakthi posts Rs 15.11 bn GWP for 2017
Registering steady double digit growth in premiums through FY 2017, Janashakthi Insurance PLC (Janashakthi) posted a consolidated Gross Written Premium (GWP) of Rs. 15.115 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, a commendable year on year (YoY) growth of 11%.
The Non-Life or General Insurance business grew by 14% to end the year with a GWP of Rs. 12.212 billion, while the Life Insurance business remained flat, recording a GWP of Rs. 2.903 billion.
Paying out claims to the total of Rs. 7.317 billion during the period under review, Janashakthi continued to uphold its commitment to standing by its policyholders during times of distress. The more than 9% YoY increase in claims settlements was a result of the rise in the number of flood-related fire and engineering claims, as well as a spike in medical claims due to the dengue epidemic. Stringent cost management practices allowed the insurer to keep overhead expenses under control, which reduced by 1% YoY.
Janashakthi Insurance PLC reported its consolidated full year results for the final time, as the Company recently entered into an agreement with Allianz SE to sell 100% of its fully owned subsidiary Janashakthi General Insurance Limited. Speaking on the Companys performance, Managing Director, Prakash Schaffter said, I am delighted to report that we have ended FY 2017 on a high note, with premium inflows continuing to grow through the year. We have been able to maintain our steady growth momentum despite a considerable rise in claim settlements thanks to our strong fundamentals and prudent reinsurance structure. The year 2018 will be a year of change resulting from the divestment of the Non-Life business. We are optimistic that the opportunities arising from a singular focus on theLife Insurance business, coupled with the opportunity of rebuilding an efficient distribution system, will strengthen our presence in the Sri Lankan Life Insurance industry.
The total Consolidated Assets of the company grew by 15% YoY, standing at Rs. 36.848 billion at the end of the period under review with the investment portfolio accounting for Rs. 25.523 billion of this value.

Lipa and Stormzy win big at 2018 Brit Awards
Dua Lipa and Stormzy were the big winners at the 2018 Brit Awards in London on February 21, landing two awards apiece.
The New Rules singer picked up the Best British Female Solo Artist honour, while she also walked away with the British Breakthrough Act award, while the rapper beat out Ed Sheeran for the British Male Solo Artist prize, and then scored the British Album of the Year for Gang Signs & Prayer.
After accepting the Best Female award, Dua Lipa delivered a strong feminist speech, telling the crowd, "I want to thank every single female that has been on this stage before me and has given girls like me a place to be inspired by and (someone to) look up to and allow us to dream.
"Here's to more women on these stages, winning these awards and taking over the world."
Her bold message was in keeping with one of the themes the night, as many stars arrived at the ceremony wearing white roses in solidarity with victims of sexual harassment and abuse.
Dua then brought her younger brother and sister up onstage to share her joy at winning her second prize.
Despite missing out in the major categories, Ed Sheeran was honoured with the Global Success Award by Elton John, who praised him in a video message, and Ronnie Wood, who presented him with his trophy at the O2 Arena.
Meanwhile, Rag'N'Bone man took home his third Brit Awards honour in two years after his smash hit Human was named Best British Single, while the male, female and group prizes reserved for international acts went to Kendrick Lamar, Lorde and Foo Fighters, respectively.
The most poignant moment of the night came when Liam Gallagher performed Oasis anthem Live Forever in tribute to the 22 people who lost their lives in a terror attack at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester, England last year.
Justin Timberlake opened the ceremony by performing two tracks from his new album Man of the Woods, while other stars who took to the stage for sets included Lamar, Sheeran, Sam Smith, the Foo Fighters, and Rita Ora and Liam Payne, who teamed up for their For You duet from the Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack.

Peter Rabbit
Long ears and fluffy tales
G et ready to meet the mischief maker who can be on par with Dennis the Menace in Colombia Pictures Peter Rabbit. Directed by Will Gluck the movie provides the perfect distraction for children.
Adapted from Beatrix Potters well loved tale Peter Rabbit provides a new take on the beloved bunny. The story unfolds with a mixture of animation and live action.
The action starts with the mischievous and adventurous heros feud with Mr. McGregor escalates to greater heights. The event results in his death. Enter his nephew Thomas McGregor who does not having a liking for the wilderness. He kicks Peter and his friends out of the house but is forced to be kind to them later since he develops an affection for his next door neighbor, Bea, who is a painter and nature lover.
Things take a rough patch with both Peter and Thomas competing for Beas affection. When Thomas seem to be taking the lead Peter makes a comeback which costs the rabbits not only their home but also tears Thomas and Beas liaison apart.
James Corden voices the character of Peter with playful spirit and wild charm. Margot Robbie, Elizabeth Debicki, and Daisy Ridley have rendered their voices to the triplets: Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail.
The animations are superbly crafted. The rabbits are adorable, the pig is funny and all the rest of the animals who take a back bench are entertaining and detailed. The background settings are a feast for the eyes.
The downside of Peter Rabbit is that its greatest strength also happens to be its greatest weakness. The adult audience might find the action boring at most times. Most of the jokes will go down well with the kids but not with those past their teens.
It is a family friendly movie but it squanders its potential wider appeal. You get a lot of slapstick comedy but only a little depth in this tale.

Mangala Samaraweera: developing countries must tackle debt together

At the opening meeting of the G-24 in Colombo, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera warned that with advanced economies rebounding, developing countries must prepare for tightening global market conditions.
It is clear that Sri Lanka, like many developing nations, (faces) refinancing risks in the coming years, Minister Samaraweera said at BMICH, today.
This warrants a concerted and coordinated policy response to mitigate such risks.
The G-24 meets every year to coordinate the development strategies of its member countries and make sure their interests are represented in international financial monetary matters.
It is comprised of developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Minister Samaraweera is chairing the group this year on behalf of Sri Lanka.
The theme of this years meetings is debt management and sustainability.
(Its) a very timely theme, Samaraweera said. With economic rebound leading to increasing interest rates, the International Monetary Funds latest global outlook predicts that economies with high gross debt refinancing needs and un-hedged dollar liabilities (would be) particularly exposed to financial distress, he said.
Samaraweera said that according to the IMFs Fiscal Monitor over 90 percent of low-income developing countries had debt levels over 30 percent of their GDP at end 2016. Sri Lankas debt to GDP ratio stands at about 80 percent.
He said the countries must work together to develop policy frameworks to reduce their financial exposure.
You would, I am certain, ensure that our common interests are fairly and adequately addressed at the forthcoming Bretton Woods meetings in Washington D.C., he said.
The G-24 is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday in Colombo ahead of a conference of representatives of global financial leaders like the IMF and World Bank in April.

A matter of opinion - Merv Hughes
One of the things he most enjoyed about sport was that people who liked to call themselves experts were frequently proved wrong. Forming views and making judgements on sporting performance would be great fun, but it could be fraught with danger. No one could predict it with absolute certainty the outcome of any game or race. He now found himself in the unenviable position of being asked his opinion on all sorts of matters relating to cricket. His experience and knowledge was limited because he had only played Test cricket for a short time. He did not pretend to be an authority on the game but there were a number of questions that he was asked at Sportsmans nights and dinners and he hoped to answer these questions as best as he could states Merv Hughes in his book Merv My Life and Other Funny Stories---
WHO WAS THE HARDEST HITTING BATSMAN HE EVER PLAYED WITH AND AGAINST
He considered himself a bit of a specialist in that area as his bowling suffered more than most from some big hitting. Ian Botham and Vivian Richards were probably the two most powerful batsmen he ever played against recalled Hughes .
Hughes first met Ian Botham when, as a young boy he attended a coaching camp at Benalla in Victoria. Botham had just begun his cricket career and was spending the English winter in Melbourne playing district cricket for University. Hughes asked for some advice and Botham told him, in a friendly way, to give up cricket and concentrate on tennis or golf because that was where the real money was.
Hughes ignored his advice and didnt see him again till the first Test in Brisbane in 1986. Hughes noted that he was not quite as amiable that time. When Bothams turn to bat came, he started slowly to get his eye in, however Hughes first ball to him - a good one just short of length outside off stump was deliberately sliced over third man for six. He couldnt let him get away with that, he thought. Not wanting to be taken lightly, he let him have another bouncer next ball. Botham hooked it for another massive six.
Twelve off two balls. Not good for the figures. Stay cool and whatever you did, and dont bowl another short one, he muttered to himself. He bowled a bouncer. Botham pulled it through mid-wicket for four. The ball struck with such a force that it bounced most of the way to the middle.
Well done, Merv, nice thinking, he screamed silently to himself. For Gods sake pitch the next one up. So he did. Botham crashed it through the covers for four.
Botham had an enormous heave at the next ball and missed (thank heavens) and scrambled a two off the last. Twenty-two off the over. Well bowled Merv have a rest. Good game cricket.
After the days play he had a chat to Botham and mentioned the advice he gave to him years before. Hughes recalled that Bothams only comment was, Well, I was right, wasnt I Hughes was dropped from the team for the next Test.
WHICH BATSMAN IS THE HARDEST TO GET OUT
Although he had not bowled a great deal against him (bowling to him in the nets was bad enough), Allan Borders record speaks for itself and is a testament to the high price he puts on his wicket.
To have survived for so long in such a demanding sport and to have performed so consistently proved that he was one of the toughest batsmen ever to play cricket, added Hughes.
Javed Miandad was another who had a phenomenal Test average recalled Hughes, he was particularly hard to dismiss in Pakistan! Javed was not the most popular of cricketers, and a back injury restricted his performance, although he was a great competitor and a gifted batsman.
In the Test series in Australia in 1990, Hughes bowled to him on several occasions. It is usually the case that the bowler attempts to intimidate the batsman by having a few words in his ear, but with Javed, it was the other way around. He was always speaking to Hughes. On more than one occasion he let one of his deliveries go past, looked up at him with contempt and said, Hughes, you are not good enough for this - you should be off driving buses. There have been times when he would agree with him.
The other batsman was Sunil Gavaskar. In his first Test match he spent a great deal of time bowling to Gavaskar and never once looked like getting him out. He scored 160 not out, and that Test was almost Hughes last. He is not sorry that he has retired and he wont have to entertain him with his bowling, concluded Hughes.
SRI LANKANS ON THE RAMPAGE
Its heartening to note that with the advent of Chandika Hathurusingha things have turned a full circle in the recent past, lets hope that it will not be a flash in the pan. We fervently hope that Hathuru can call the shots all the time, without a big brother looking over his shoulder.
During our latest series with Bangladesh every one came to the party, Kusal Mendis, Danushka Gunathilake,Thisara Perera and Upul Tharanga. In my book it was Dasun Shanaka who outdid the rest, his timing was sublime and his placements were inch perfect and if he could improve his bowling he could be a real asset in our T20 outfit. Unfortunately Dinesh Chandimal although he gave excellent leadership to the team was somewhat disappointing in his batting, he found it difficult to pick the gaps especially in the mid off and cover region. The selectors might find it difficult to slot in Angelo Mathews (fit or otherwise), since every Tom Dick and Harry are in form with the bat.

MR cannot be Opposition Leader based on LG poll results - Amaraweera
The recent success at the Local Government Election does not qualify former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to become the Opposition Leader, Fisheries and Aquatic Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
He also pointed out that there is no legal provision for such an appointment. The minister was speaking at a press brief held at the SLFP headquarters, last afternoon.
The minster explaining the legal position behind such a situation pointed out that all MPs representing the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are members of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
The UPFA and the SLFP Central Committee decided to join the unity government in 2015, which means we are a part of this government. We cannot request the position of Opposition Leader while being a part of the Government, he explained.
When we decided to support a National Government, a group of SLFP/UPFA MPs requested us to allow them to sit in the Opposition. Our leader President Maithripala Sirisena allowed them to do so, because he wanted to ensure the democratic rights of everybody. If the SLFP Central Committee decided against it, most of these MPs would not be in Parliament anymore, Minister Amaraweera further pointed out.
He also said the same group is misusing this opportunity by establishing another political party and promoting it.
Just because they have formed another political party, it does not mean that they could get the Opposition Leader post, he added.
Asked if former President Mahinda Rajapaksa still holds the position of Adviser to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Minister Amaraweera said he does. He should reflect on whether what he is doing is correct or not.
Asked if SLFP is to continue allowing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to stay as a SLFP member while forming and supporting another political party, Minister Amaraweera said the Central Committee is currently discussing the matter at length.
Meanwhile, Minister Duminda Dissanayake speaking on the SLFP votes received at the LG polls, said that during the previous regime, personal propaganda was given priority than promoting the political party.
For the last 10 years we promoted the brand name of Mahinda Rajapaksa for all the things done by the previous government. We kept chanting his name for all the good work done, Minister Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanayake also said the SLPP exploited former President Mahinda Rajapaksas image to succeed in the recent Local Government Election. Nobody knew who their representatives were. Now, in Maharagama there are several candidates who dont even have residency in the area.
All they did was to promote Rajapaksas image. They mislead the people saying that they can make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister of this country by this election result. This is not politics but cheap moves. They are striving for their personal gains. It is time people understand this, Minister Dissanayake pointed out.
He also said if someone is trying to compare the Local Government Election to a referendum, it is a futile exercise to mislead people.
Now, imagine if another political party wins at the Provincial Council Election, should it ask the government to give up its office and request the SLPP to hand over the Local Governments to them as well. Where is the logic there What the SLPP should be doing right now is to start working for the people who voted for them at the grass root level. If they want to come to power, they will have to win the next General Election. So dont play with the democracy of this country, Minister Dissanayake also said.

Parents hand over letter to Presidents Secretary
The parents union of State Medical Students handed over a letter to the Presidential Secretariat yesterday, demanding that the government inform the official stand on SAITM to the Sri Lanka Medical Council and the Attorney General's Department, Union Media Spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
According to Alwis, the letter requested the President's Secretary to inform the SLMC and the Attorney General's Department immediately about enrolling qualified SAITM students in Kotelawala Defence Universitys Medical Faculty.
Any delay of informing the decision to those two institutions will have a negative impact on the Supreme Court judgement to be given soon on the SAITM issue and there will be a conflict between the government's decision to enroll qualified SAITM students in KDU and the judgement given by the Supreme Court, he said.
If there is a conflict between the government's decision and the Supreme Court judgement, the decision taken by the President to enroll qualified SAITM students in KDU will be useless and meaningless, he added.
Meanwhile a group of SAITM students held a press briefing in Colombo yesterday and demanded that the government send all SAITM medical students to KDU without performing any selection.

He pointed out that the majority is 50.1 percent and not 44 percent and no other party has gained a majority at the election. "So the mandate is there with the UNP and the SLFP and not with any other party," Minister Samaraweera said.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Ports and Shipping Ministry auditorium, while responding to queries on the results of the last local government election, from media personnel. He also pointed out that the election was not a general election, but some had attempted to topple the government. He added that there was no interruption to the running of the government. Questioned on an alleged attempt to take over the position of Opposition Leader in Parliament by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Samarasinghe said that it was impossible. "There is an Opposition Leader in Parliament. He is TNA leader R Sampanthan. The Speaker has identified only five political parties in Parliament. The position of Opposition leader cannot be given to any other party other than those five."
The Minister further said that MP Dinesh Gunawardena had raised the matter at the Party Leader's meeting on several occasions, but the Speaker maintains the same standard. Questioned of a rumor that there would not be elections within two years, the Minister asserted that it was baseless. He assured that three Provincial Council elections would be held in five months time. He added that President Maithripala Sirisena wants the elections to be held on time. "He doesn't even dream of delaying elections," Minister Samarasinghe said.

PIONEERS OF CINNAMON INDUSTRY IN THE SOUTH
The owner of Dasanayaka Walawwa Plantations at Kosgoda and the late accountant under the British Colonial Administration, A. D. Sarojith and K. de Zoysa respectively were two of the pioneers of the cinnamon industry in Sri Lanka.
Those who were trained under the estate management of late Sarojith K. de Zoysa were also among those who took great pains to uplift cinnamon industry later on.
A. D. Vijith K. de Zoysa who carries the legacy of his ancestor is a fourth generation owner of Dasanayaka Walawwa Plantation and he dedicated his life to improve the quality of cinnamon products by introducing numerous innovations in every aspect of cinnamon growing, preparing cinnamon nurseries, planting and hygienic methods of preparing cinnamon products.
He hails from Kosgoda and has 37 years of experience compiled in a book which highlights every stage of the cinnamon industry.
In the past, traditional practice was peeling cinnamon bark on a gunny and this system is still in practice in certain rural areas of the country. But the system at present has been modernised and now at every stage of cinnamon production including peeling, is done on especially made tables in order to maintain the hygienic quality of the products.
In Sri Lanka, traditionally cinnamon has been identified to belong to five varieties such as Pani Miris Kurundu, Panirasa Kurundu, Sewala Kurundu, Kahata Kurundu and Thitta Kurundu.
The credit of transforming and introducing this novel method goes to Vijith De Zoysa who had undertaken many years of painstaking research to get to this stage.
Compared to tea, coconut and rubber cultivators, cinnamon cultivators he said have not their work certified.
In 2005, the Dasanayaka Walawwa Cinnamon processing factory obtained GMP International Certificate for standardization in 2006 HACCP, an ISO standard in 2011 and FSSC 22000 in 2014.
He further said maintaining a cinnamon factory of similar nature as Dasanayaka Walawwa was very expensive but at the moment there were nearly 10 - 12 certified factories of International standard in the Southern province. Another issue was that the prices for cinnamon produced to international standard and the price of cinnamon products made on traditional gunny bag were the same.
Further, some workers employed in cinnamon factories, he said were reluctant to work in certified factories because the wages paid were also the same. Some of the factory owners due to these reasons have found it difficult to maintain their factories. So far the relevant authorities such as the Export Development Board have not taken effective measures to improve this condition.
The major cinnamon growing districts in the country are in Galle, Matara and Kalatura. In addition, Ambangoda, Karandeniya, Uragaha, Batapola, and Meetiyagoda in the Galle district are known to produce the best quality cinnamon.
According to the latest statistics, there are 10,644 hectares in the Galle district, 7,926 hectares in the Matara district, 2,313 hectares in the Hambantota district, and 2,633 hectares in Kalutara district which are under cinnamon cultivation.
Cinnamon in the past was always considered a cottage industry and less attention was paid to the improvement in quality and uniformity by those who are engaged in the cinnamon industry.
But now they want it to be finally recognised as a legitimate industry which needs the support of the government to continue to produce the worlds best cinnamon.

## Title: Polythene ban: is it on track

Polythene ban: is it on track
The ban on polythene that is equal to or less than 20 microns, in September 2017, was a point of debate, of course, at the time it was implemented by the government. Besides the question of its efficacious enforcement, one can contemplate as to whether it has at least managed to reach the territories of the contemporary socio-political debates. However, the current polythene legislation is not completely new to the island. In fact its predecessor, which was an order made in 2006 by the then Environment Minister and current President, Maithripala Sirisena, under the National Environmental Act of 1980, banned the manufacture of polythene or any polythene product of 20 microns or below in thickness. Having to legislate a similar ban a decade later, underpins the failure of the 2006 legislation, pinpointing the fundamental problem that lies today, in mastering the means and methods of successfully implementing a polythene ban, so that it does not meet the predicament of its predecessor.
Polythene, once used for an average of 10 to 12 minutes, accumulates in landfills, oceans and waterways for a thousand years. Today, the use of polythene has become hard a practice to give up, as it is for irresponsibly dumped polythene to degrade. Successful enforcement of the legislation may even prove to be harder, if the polythene laws continue to entangle in the web of the Sri Lankan political game, fluctuating as election promises and inoperative policies transposing along regimes.
Enforcing the ban
The ban in September covered a wide array of polythene and plastic products ranging from plastic decorations, polythene lunch sheets and cooked food packaging to all polythene equal and less than 20 microns in thickness. It even went on to prohibit the open burning of refuse or other combustible matter inclusive of plastics. Upon the issuance of this ban, plastic manufacturers recoiled at the inadequate notice of implementation, which resulted in a Cabinet-appointed committee to look into the ban and make recommendations before January 2018. Accordingly, the ban came into full force from the January 1, 2018.
Almost a month into the ban, it is evident that for the polythene ban to work, there are many other pieces of the puzzle that should fall into place. After all, prohibition is often easy to legislate; although enforcement and temperance are not necessarily as smooth. The term temperance is employed here to understand the use of polythene as a part of human psychology in ascribing the quotidian use of polythene as a human necessity.
According to the Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL), 15 million plastic shopping bags alone are added to the environment daily in Sri Lanka; and thus, temperance undoubtedly becomes a road block which requires the mediation of the administrative authorities, particularly by the consistent enforcement of the law.
The EFL notes that, in countries like Bangladesh, masses have resorted to polythene with the decline of raids and fines, which has made the 2002 ban on polythene inefficacious. Thus, consistency in enforcement is at the crux of affixing all pieces of the puzzle together.
Missing important pieces of the puzzle
The moment the ban on polythene is brought into the forefront today, it attracts public stigma against the impotency of the current government to successfully implement a polythene ban. Yet, it should be reiterated that imposing a polythene ban takes a lot of work, especially in line with the analogy of affixing all the pieces of the puzzle together. Polythene industrialists proclaimed last week that the government has failed to grant the promised concessions to the importation of raw materials and manufacturing costs of high-density polythene.
In addition, there are also persisting issues in terms of discarding polythene due to the lack of a system that enables responsible disposal of polythene waste. Hence, the fundamental difficulty is whether the government has missed the important bits and pieces of a successful enforcement plan. The inadequate time of notice given to the ban, the unresponsiveness in addressing the constraints faced by people within the transition period and the inadequate means of educating the public has led to this presumption.
Importantly, the enforcement of the polythene ban requires an inter-agency collaboration moving beyond the reach of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA): inter-linking government agencies as well as government and private agencies from the beginning. For example, even the transition to alternatives such as the use of glass bottles at a micro level in each agency does go a long way. The EFL highlighted the importance of collaboration with public health Inspectors and the police in eliminating the unceasing use of lunch sheets by a number of eateries.
Further, there has been debate over the resort to eco-friendly food coverings such as banana leaves, which has been the traditional Sri Lankan food cover preceding the era of polythene. However, the banana cultivation industry in Sri Lanka itself is not thriving enough to subsist such an alternative. Intervention of the administration in uplifting such eco-friendly alternatives is crucial in reviving the traditional environmentally friendly practices amongst the population.
Educating the public, from school children to the rest of the population, is pivotal in this regard, especially, in terms of advocating that the use of polythene is a negative externality in the long run. Unfortunately, the lack of apathy for recycling waste has now become a dangerous problem to the entire Sri Lankan population, although only a few eyes have been opened after the Meethotamulla tragedy last year. With only 40 percent of plastic waste being recycled, the government still lacks recycling facilities.
Role of governments made of men and women
Alas, it should be understood that laws are system-sensitive. According to Garett Hardin (see The Tragedy of the Commons, Science, New Series, Vol. 162, No. 3859, 1968), since God-made laws are poorly suited to govern a complex, crowded and changeable world, the epicyclical solution is augmenting statutory law with administrative law.
The administrative body thus, is responsible in the enforcement, evaluation and punishment of deviance within the total system, which renders it singularly liable to corruption, inconsistency and inefficiency primarily because governments are made of men and women, and not laws.
Hence, much of the current ban, irrespective of the number of recommendations one can make, lies in the practical aspect of agency-based legal enforcement of the ban. System sensitivity of the law demands the focus of these agencies in tackling consumer patterns regarding usage of polythene and public education.
As noted by Taylor and Villas-Boas (see Bans vs. Fees: Disposable Carryout Bag Policies and Bag Usage, Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy, Volume 38, Issue 2, June 1, 2016), sustainable compliance to a plastic ban involves twofold behavioral changes: firstly, giving up plastic bags; and secondly, adoption of reusable bags.
Given the mindset of Sri Lankans using a polythene bag for an average of 10 to 12 minutes, the importation of plastic resins increases with the current ban since the HDPE bag requires more resins, resulting in a completely adverse situation. Hence, the sustainability of the polythene ban itself, cardinally relies upon the inculcation of the notions of reducing, reusing and recycling polythene in all policy frameworks, besides singularly ingraining these notions in the heads of all consumers.

President will be SLFP candidate at 2020 Presidential Election: Duminda
President Maithripala Sirisena will be our candidate for the 2020 Presidential Election, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday said.
The General Secretary was speaking at a press briefing held at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
He urged all SLFP supporters to stand with President Maithripala Sirisena to revive the country and form a SLFP government and invited all others to join President Sirisena to revitalize the country discarding party politics.
Minister Dissanayake said President Sirisena always puts the country first before the political party he represents.
The recent setback in the Local Government Election is a challenge that Yahapalana government needs to overcome and that it should not be the downfall, Minister Dissanayake said.
We should come back stronger with an expedite plan to turn the tide and bring victory again to this government. We resurrect the country in 2015. Now the time has come again to revive the changes it achieved in 2015, he said.
What is in jeopardy is our childrens future. We must not allow power hungry politicians to destroy this country once again. I urge this country and its people to stand strong and continue with this Yahapalana government. People should realise the difference between personal aims and common goals in the politics, Minister Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanayake assured that the government will learn from its errors. He requested the SLFP candidates at the LG polls to work with the government to develop the villages.
Minister Dissanayake said the government will produce the accused before law and the rest is in the hands of judiciary of the country.
We cannot bring accused persons to book. We can only produce them before courts. We as a Yahapalana government cannot manipulate the legal system of the country. If we do so, it would be that the government misusing its powers, he said.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera pointed out that the SLFP/UPFA has secured the remote controller to decide on which political party would come into power in 167 councils. While highlighting that SLFP has received 1.7 million votes at the LG Polls, Minister Amaraweera said they will work with the political party who would allow them most power in the council.
He said they have already started acquiring power in these councils through discussions.
Minister Amaraweera said that they would introduce a special development project to all the Councils to secure power.
He said the Delimitation Committee on the Provincial Council election has handed over its report.
Minister Amaraweera said there is a need for amendments to the new system before going to another election.

PSG coach optimistic injured Neymar will recover to face Real
Paris, Sunday: Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery remains optimistic that superstar Neymar will be fit to face Real Madrid in their do-or-die Champions League clash despite suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's 3-0 victory over Marseille.
Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer, was stretchered off 10 minutes from time at the Parc des Princes as PSG opened up a 14-point lead in Ligue 1.
The 26-year-old was on his own when he innocuously rolled his ankle and flopped to the ground in pain.
"The first examination in the locker room revealed that it was a twist to the ankle. Now we will do a medical examination to find out what this twist is," said Emery, whose team face Real at home on March 6 in the Champions League last 16 where they need to overturn a 3-1 deficit.
"We will wait for the examination, we will be optimistic. If I had to say today (whether or not he will face Real) I would rather say yes to being optimistic."
PSG skipper Thiago Silva told Canal+ added: "Neymar already had a swollen ankle. I'm not a doctor, but I don't think he'll be available on Wednesday (when PSG face Marseille again in the French Cup). He has to rest."
It was an otherwise easy night for the big-spending Parisians as teenager Kylian Mbappe became the youngest scorer in the French 'Classique'.
Uruguayan goal-machine Edinson Cavani was also on the scoresheet while Neymar had a hand in PSG's other goal.
With Monaco drawing 3-3 at Toulouse on Saturday and Lyon held 1-1 at home to local rivals Saint-Etienne earlier on Sunday, it meant none of PSG's three nearest challengers managed to win.
Monaco remain second with Marseille third, two points behind, and Lyon a further five adrift.
This result was never in doubt and Emery even had the luxury of bringing off Mbappe, 19, after an hour to give Argentine international Angel Di Maria a half-hour run out.
PSG were off to a flying start through Mbappe but Marseille were in part the architects of their own downfall.
France midfielder Adrien Rabiot tried to thread a through ball on 10 minutes to Mbappe, cutting in from the right.
Former Aston Villa full-back Jordan Amavi was in place to intercept the ball but he slipped and succeeded only helping it onto teenage star Mbappe, who jinked inside onto his left foot and dragged a low shot inside Yohann Pele's near post.
As expected, the hosts were dictating the tempo and dominating the ball, but Neymar was off target with a header from a Dani Alves cross.
The second came before the half hour mark, though, and again it owed much to poor Marseille defending.
Layvin Kurzawa slipped Rabiot into the inside left channel in the visitors' box and he picked out Brazilian Neymar with a cut-back.
The forward's poked finish was heading off target until his compatriot and Marseille centre-back Rolando thrust out a boot and inadvertently directed the ball into the goal. AFP

Risen from ruins
Once a verdant land, it has now become a ground scattered with battle-hardened corpses. Blood oozing from lethal wounds, these lifeless bodies feed the videographer. The videographer is surrounded by men in amber green uniforms with light green stripes treading the ruins.
With that masterful visual portrayal of postwar Sri Lanka, Prasanna Vithanage begins the countrys latest cinematic experiment: an anthology film by Prasanna Vithanage, Vimukthi Jayasundara and Ashoka Handagama with their relatively shorter films titled as Her, Him and The Other.
Surrounded by men in striped uniforms, Keshavarajans job was videoing the dead bodies of Sinhala soldiers to produce propaganda films. Kesa himself was present when the filmed version of his story was shown before a sect of the Colombo crowd. Vithanage, Jayasundara and Handagama are known for their controversial manipulation of the Sri Lankan war in their cinematic works. Roaming in different paths of imagination, the trio assembled in one place to formulate the cinematic anthology.
War is over. But does that mean that every worry is over as well
Not quite so, as Prasanna Vithanage believes.
Isolated humans
We have to admit that the ethnic problem has not been solved yet in this country. We have not been able to build one Sri Lankan nation. No, we have not reached that level as yet. Guns are silent. But mistrust among each other still prevails. The political leaders did spread this mistrust in order to establish their own power in their territories. That drove me to make this film, Vithanage mused.
A Sinhalese sees a Muslim or a Tamil as an other, and vice versa. That should never be the case, Vithanage believes. You need to look closely into the other to find out yourself. Prasanna Vithanage had the common man in his mind when he made the first film of the anthology, Her. The film has a simple outline. Anyone can delve into deep readings if necessary. Vithanage has chosen an alternative route as well. The speed is much faster than the rest of his films. The shutter speed is also relatively slower.
Her introduces two real-life persons as leading actors: Keshavarajan a propaganda videographer pouring his heart out to Ashoka Handagama in the outskirts of Jaffna. Already burdened with no suitable actress who doesnt mind being touched by an actor, Handagama nevertheless settles down to lend an ear to the stranger.
Why Ashoka Handagama
My story is based on a true event, though some events are dramatised. This is Kesas story. He met me following the war and related the whole story. He burst into tears while narrating the story.
Perpetuity of humanity
Kesha has seen wounds in the war. He has seen death. He has seen violence. How can he be so emotional then This dilemma has made a splash on Vithanage. War can amputate and even annihilate one whole ethnic race, but it cannot destroy humanity.
I wanted Ashoka Handagama in the cast to build up the story. He has been to Jaffna and produced films such as Ini Avan. Plus, Kesa has met him before. Handagama actually had to face a problem of finding an actress who would not mind being touched by an actor. I merged these events to breathe in drama.
Suppose it was a commercial film director and Kesa would not have been able to be much honest. Sri Lankas commercial film directors have made no connection with the northern hemisphere. Hardly speaking a word, Handagama opts to be a listener attentive to details. In the end, Kesas story influences Handagama. He decides that Kesa is the best person to make the film. Handagama accepts that the Tamil filmmakers should be given a chance to make their voice heard.
What we have right now is a Sinhala cinema. That should become the local cinema. The Tamil-speaking people should be given chance to express cinema in their language. We should absorb them into the local cinema.
Creative comfort
Every film has been a challenge for Vithanage. Yet this particular film has been a good opportunity for him to visit Jaffna and share Kesas story with the aspiring scriptwriters and filmmakers. Her is an offshoot of a workshop held with them in Jaffna.
That is what I see as the biggest achievement. We built up this story. This was not something planted from above. We had a discourse with them as to how this could happen. We didnt recruit a single actor from Colombo. Every actor was from Jaffna.
Following the end of war, Prasanna Vithanage held numerous workshops in areas such as Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee. As a result, the northern hemisphere has now become a breeding ground for budding filmmakers. Short films are the trending phenomenon like in any other area. Quantity is increasing, though the quality is always a question.
When I sit on a jury of short films, I grow frustrated. We have to watch about 50 films. Most of the films are closer to teledramas. They are not creatively rich. But we come across one or two best productions. Really, we get to see about 25 in the great cinema. Only two or three films are better. And those few are a cut above the rest.
Whenever he is into making a film, Vithanages concerns lie with the probable outcasts of the society. The outcasts have to grapple with the social influences and various other vices. Wannihami of much noted Purahanda Kaluwara is such an outcast who had an eternal struggle. Vithanage claims to have never been driven by the urge to make money out of films. Sitting before a blank piece of paper, he takes time to reflect on the feelings of a particular character.
For instance, how would someone feel when seeing a picture of a recently deceased beloved one
I have never thought of making a blockbuster movie through such situations. I am concentrating on the human feelings. I believe that I genuinely try to understand their feelings. My aesthetics are based on the visual expression of that concentration. It should be a cinematic expression. The aesthetics are formed by a coherence and clarity.
If Lester James Peries wanted to make a blockbuster when he made Gamperaliya, Delovak Athara and Nidanaya, Vithanage elaborates, we would not be able to see characters similar to Jinadasa and Kaisaruwatte in our surrounding. Vithanages aim is to empathise with the character. The beat of the character and the beat of the audience will then coalesce.
That curiosity of searching for truth leads me. For instance the external elements of this conversation of ours matter much lesser than the truth that comes out of it. Every artiste creates from his subjective truth and that leads to the objective reality. The subjective reality I see becomes an objective reality. The human nature doesnt come out simply when people talk sitting. But it comes to the fore when people behave. Thats what I call arts.
Opportunities misused
The younger generation has ample opportunities to make films thanks to the sophisticated digital environment. But the doors of the traditional entertainment are not open to most of them. Even though a young filmmaker wins an award, the private sector is reluctant to offer sponsorship because films do not generate much money in this country. On the contrary, the younger generation has other avenues open in YouTube, Netflix and Amazon for online streaming.
The people go to theatres only to watch blockbusters. Even there you see lights blink with people constantly checking the updates on their smartphones. To enter this region, you need to have good stories and experiences which should be expressed in a novel manner. This is the challenge before us now.
That is where the script matters.
Adds Vithanage: When we read scripts, we come to realise that these writers have distanced themselves from both English and Sinhala. As a tip to budding filmmakers, Akira Kurasowa instructed to read widely. A filmmaker should be well read. Kurasowa used to say how he was influenced rereading Leo Tolstoy. Every time you reread, you see something you had not seen before.
So learn from the masters, Prasanna Vithanage offers advice to any would-be filmmaker. Literary masters offer lessons on how to express a rounded experience. Without literature, we cannot look forward to good cinematic works.
Most young filmmakers tend to be lazy because now everyone can make a film and somehow upload it to the Youtube. Uploading is not what matters. How far can you address the audience For that, you need to build the trust. How do you maintain the story There are people who do not go the cinema. You need to win them. If not, then the foreign films will take that place. The audience does not care whether it is a foreign film or not, Vithanage elaborated.

SAITM students call for direct enrollment in KDU
The Students Action Committee of SAITM demands that the government enroll all students who are currently at SAITM in the Kotelawela Defence University (KDU) without performing any selection.
All SAITM students need a permanent and legal solution for the issue and SAITM should not be closed down before solving the issue, Convener of the Committee Shanaka De Saram said.
Addressing a press conference held at the CSR in Colombo yesterday, he said that the committee wishes to thank the President, GMOA and others for coming up with a joint solution and for deciding to enroll SAITM students in KDU. All SAITM students met the required criteria when entering SAITM set by the UGC and Higher Education Ministry.
The committee has sent a letter to the President and all other relevant parties requesting that they come up with the necessary legislative changes before enrolling SAITM students in KDU. No SAITM student should be subjected to any further payment.
No one should influence the Supreme Court judgement to be given for the SAITM issue, De Saram said. Dilshan Sampath, a fourth-year medical student, said that the committee has no conflict with the minimum standards of medical education and it does not matter whether it becomes three B passes (3 Bs) or two C passes (2 Cs) and one S pass.
All SAITM students had been selected to be enrolled in SAITM by the UGC and the Higher Education Ministry after being interviewed individually. Therefore, all of them are qualified.
The committee members said that they had spent 10 years of their youth in SAITM without being able to become qualified and registered doctors in Sri Lanka.

SF, Law and Order Minister in two weeks - Rajitha
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the Ministry of Law and Order for a short period of two weeks only.
After that he will hand over the Ministry to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Co-Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing an event in Colombo yesterday morning Dr. Senaratne said certain higher officers in the Police Department disliked Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka but those in the lower ranks in the Police service liked him very much.
What the country needed today were efficient people who could take split decisions, Minister Senaratne said.
Those who make a hue and cry about war heroes should realize that Field Marshal Fonseka is also a war hero. The government ought to take a fair and just decision he said.
Ministry posts were not everlasting. Decisions should not be taken by only looking at a person, Minister Senaratne said.
The President and the Prime Minister should take decisions after discussions between them, because what matters was their collective decision rather than a viewpoint of the UNP or the SLFP, Minister Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Seneratne said a Cabinet could not be appointed according to the whims and fancies of Ministers and MPs. Some had criticised the recent cabinet reshuffle.
During the past regime Cabinet reshuffles were made according to other compulsions, mainly to bring Ministers critical of the government to heel, the Minister said.
A government should move forward with the people. The most significant feature of the recent Cabinet reshuffle was the rewarding of Ravindra Samaraweera with a Ministry portfolio. Ravindra Samaraweera who entered Parliament during the period of terror in 1989 had stood by the party for the last 30 years.
It was quite usual for elected MPs to clamour for Ministry posts after an election. Ravindra Samaraweera was rewarded with a Ministry because he had remained with patience all this time, the Minister said.
Dr. Senaratne said that even though people had issued a warning to the government at the last local government election, the government would be able to control a majority of local government institutions by setting up an administration, through a UNP-SLFP coalition he said.
Meanwhile, at the United Freedom Alliance media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the Law and Order Cabinet Minister portfolio was taken by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe only for a short period of time,.
He also said that another parliamentarian will be sworn-in as the Minister of Law and Order soon.
Minister Amaraweera said that the Law and Order portfolio may be given to a member of the United National Party. He said that there was an ongoing discussion about the matter.
He also did not rule out an SLFP MP being selected for the Law and Order portfolio.
Amaraweera replying to a question said even a SLFP member could be appointed pending the outcome of current discussions.

Shakib to lead in Nidahas tri-series; Walsh acting head coach
After a lot of speculation, drama and an attempt to convince ODI skipper Mashrafe Mortaza to reconsider his T20 retirement, Shakib Al Hasan has been named captain for the tri-series that also involves Sri Lanka and India starting on March 6 in Sri Lanka.
Shakibs inclusion comes with a rider though - the BCB medical board has made it clear that he wont be available for the opening two games of the tournament as he is still struggling with a sore finger.
With the uncertainty surrounding Shakib and Mashrafes unwillingness to come back, the team announcement got delayed. Shakib sustained an injury to his left hand during the tri-nation ODI series final in January and later had to receive stitches. The 30-year-old, who was named the Test and T20I skipper of the national team for the Sri Lanka series in February, was subsequently ruled out of the two-match Test series with Mahmudullah leading in his place.
Shakib missed the following 2-match T20 series as well, preferring to rest so that he could be available for the Nidahas Trophy. Mahmudullah led the T20I side as well.
It is reliably learnt that Shakib wasnt too keen to play on with the injury but BCB president Nazmul Hasan seems to have convinced him. Nazmul said that there is no guarantee when he will be available but had to include him taking everything into consideration. He might be available for one or two matches, he said.
There is no problem when he bowls but the finger get sore when he bats and probably he will not be available for the opening matches.
There were five changes to the side that last played the 2-match T20 series against Sri Lanka. Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Nurul Hasan and Mehidy Hasan come in while Mohammad Saifuddin, Zakir Hasan, Atif Hossain and Mohammad Mithun who were a part of the T20I series against Sri Lanka find themselves out of favor.
Speaking on team selection, chief selector Minhajul Abedin asserted that they picked players suited for the pitches and conditions in Sri Lanka. We have included some experienced campaigners, he said.
As it is expected pacers will play a part so we picked Imrul [Kayes] considering his international experience. As the matches will be played in Premadasa we needed someone who can bowl fast and Taskin [Ahmed] returned fulfilling the criterion, he added.
Meanwhile current bowling coach Courtney Walsh will act as head coach for the tri-series. Walsh takes over from Zimbabwe-born Richard Halsall - who was appointed interim head coach after Chandika Hathurasingha took over Sri Lankas national team. Halsall had acted as Bangladeshs fielding and assistant coach since mid-2014. He was appointed as head coach after the board failed to find a replacement for Hathurasingha before the ODI tri-series in January.
While the reason for Halsalls unavailability for the tournament remains unclear, Walsh takes over on an interim basis. Khaled Mahmud - the former Bangladesh all-rounder, who performed the role of technical director returns back to his usual post of team manager.
Bangladesh Squad for Nidahas trophy:
Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Mahmudullah, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mushfiqur Rahim, Sabbir Rahman, Mustafizur Rahman, Rubel Hossain, Abu Jayed, Taskin Ahmed, Imrul Kayes, Nurul Hasan, Mehidy Hasan, Ariful Haque, Nazmul Islam, Abu Haider Rony
