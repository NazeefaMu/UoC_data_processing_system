Japanese STEM group spurs 19+ Career Guidance, Trade expo
The Ministry of Education organized the 19+, Educational, Vocational, Career Guidance and Trade Exhibition 2018 from October 3 to7 at the Kuliyapititya Central College.
This exhibition was specifically targeted towards students of grade 9 and above but was open to all. A dedicated Japanese Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), group lead by Renaya Kikuchi of SCCIP Japan participated to provide invaluable insights into Robotics, STEM related technologies and teaching techniques.
SCCIP has been providing STEM educational know how for the last 20 years and as of October 2018, has successfully deployed its services to over 50 schools in India, and 16 schools in Thailand.
It is successfully engaged in over 22 after-school classroom programs in Japan and 26 in the United States of America. A characteristic attribute of SCCIP is its emphasis on Hands-on authentic learning, project based learning and context based learning methods.
The SCCIP stall and its workshop on Robotics and STEM has been well received by the public and witnessed the attendance of a large number of students. Upon completion of the workshop the student received an internationally recognized certificate offered by SCCIP.
This was a rare and valuable opportunity for Sri Lankan students to obtain an internationally recognized certificate at no cost. Malcom X once said, Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today. As a country, let us procrastinate no further, and hasten to equip ourselves with the tools to face the challenges and demands of the modern world through STEM.
Since the launch of Sputnik in 1952, world leaders and individual states have been on a fierce competition, to be the front runners in the quest for human ingenuity and technological superiority, through the advancement of Science and Technology.
The countries that had invested in this cause are now reaping the rewards of their investments. The acronym STEM was coined in 2001 by the National Science foundation of the USA. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It represents an integrated system of applying the individual elements of STEM to various subjects and fields of study.
STEM emphasizes the practical applications of its individual elements through critical and analytical thinking, problem solving and innovative thinking. Sri Lankas Science and technological sector is in dire need. Our country is currently ranked 88 on the Global Innovation Index and the GDP share for the industry sector has only increased by 3.9% from 2010 to 2018.
This is a worrying situation as 60% of the Global job market is expected to be comprised of STEM related jobs by 2030. To face this reality and the entire education system of our country needs to be rethought, re-valuated and completely overhauled.

Judiciary independent now - Former President
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, jubilant after MP Johnston Fernandos acquittal, said he never doubted the independence of the Judiciary in the country.
He was speaking at a media briefing held at his home in Wijerama Mawatha, joined by JO MPs, Johnston Fernando, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Wimal Weerawansa, Prof G.L. Peiris and Namal Rajapaksa.
The former President insisted that they had always maintained that the Judiciary was independent and it was only certain institutions which were launching a witch-hunt against political opponents of the government.
Fernando following his statement piled on allegations against the FCID, Attorney Generals Department and the Prisons Department for entrapping him under false charges. He added that even though the Speaker had promised to ask the AG to not oppose bail as he was an MP, the AGs Department had refused to comply, The whole department has been politicised,Fernando said.
The Kurunegala High Court on Wednesday acquitted Fernando of all charges in the case of misappropriating Sathosa funds worth Rs 5.2 million.
Prof. Peiris said the High Court had not even entertained evidence from the Defence as there was no substantial evidence to file a case.
And yet who will take responsibility for the 74 days MP Johnston Fernando languished in prison We will be pursuing compensation from all responsible for the mental anguish and physical deprivation of freedom suffered by him.
As Fernando called the FCID a group of handpicked police officers who have become a branch of the UNP, Prof. Peiris said they were liable to be sued on charges of perjury, intimidating witnesses and averting the course of justice under the Penal Code.
The Joint Opposition in its victory went on to stress that the incumbent government was destroying the justice system, arresting public officers (former Secretary to the President, Lalith Weeratunga was arrested for misappropriating Rs 600 million of public funds), arresting the Sangha for a small mistake (Ven Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was arrested on contempt of court charges) and for destroying a vibrant economy their regime had built (the economy scored a GDP growth rate of 4.96 percent by the end of 2014).
Relating his experiences in prison, Fernando said a special team of FCID officers from Colombo had been sent to harass him and the two others who were also accused in prison, They wanted to plant drugs in prison and frame me for that. They also strip searched my associates in front of everyone, violating their human rights.
When a journalist questioned the treatment meted out to the former Chief Justice, Shirani Bandaranayake under the Rajapaksa regime, a visibly annoyed former President said he did it Constitutionally and never violated the law, We had a Parliamentary Committee appointed, a hearing and followed all the rules were followed.
As Fernando declared that they would not be pressured into defeat thus, the former President concluded the press briefing and walked out in a huff in the face of uncomfortable questions.

Knitted ear replacements
Mimi the tiny bunny is completely deaf and has only three legs. But thanks to a loving owner, neither of these things hold her back.
Mimis owner is Rodajia Welch, 22, who decided that shed make her rabbit some woolen ears to stand in for her missing ones.
The charity worker brought home Mimi, her mother, and the rest of the litter after their elderly breeder became too ill to care for them.
Mimi looks a little different to her brothers and sisters. Not wanting her to feel left out, Rodajia set to work knitting her a set of ears. On an average day the bunny will wear white knitted ears with a pink middle, but she sometimes experiments with knitted flower crowns and rounded mouse ears.
Deciding to make the ears all started with finding her a name  it obviously had to be ear-related, said Rodajia.
So while doing some research my boyfriend Josh came across Kemonomimi, which is a form of cosplay where the characters have animal ears. It was perfect because she didnt have any ears and she could be whatever she wanted to be. I got super excited and decided to make her her own pair of bunny ears.
Rodajia adopted Mimi after the 77-year-old who bred the litter was forced to give up the rabbits after falling ill.
Rodajia will take care of all the bunnies until theyre old enough to be separated, then will keep Mimi as her pet.
Mimi is the runt of the litter and was born with no ears and three legs  shes missing a front one, she said.
Shes the runt and a lot smaller than the others so I believe that it was maybe a lack of oxygen or not enough nutrition for development. She only wears the ears after Ive just made them for pictures, or when shes sitting with me. She lets me put them on her but for safety reasons I dont tie them in a knot so if she wanted to, she could just knock them off pretty easy. She doesnt act like shes bothered by them  usually shes eating so she doesnt pay much attention. Sometimes she will try to eat the ribbon but then I take them off or move it so she cant get it. The other bunnies arent around when I put them on, they would probably try to chew on them.

Manufacturing activities dip - CBSL
The Manufacturing Sector PMI decreased to 54.1 index points in September 2018 from 58.2 index points recorded in August 2018. The slowdown observed in manufacturing activities in September was mainly driven by the slowdown in new orders and production, especially in manufacturing of food and beverages activities.
Respondents highlighted that they had to increase their prices during the period due to increase in input cost of imported raw materials with rupee depreciation. This led to a decline in demand for their products, which in turn resulted in a decrease in new orders and production.
Overall employment and stock of purchases also slowed down.
Meanwhile, lengthening of suppliers delivery time usually indicates that economy is booming with expanding activities in the short run. However, in this instance, lengthening of suppliers delivery time was due to manufacturers intentional increase of the lead time with the expectation of rupee stabilization. Thus, it does not indicate an expansion in economic activities.
Overall, all the sub-indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50.0 threshold signalling an overall expansion in September yet at a slower pace compared to August.
Meanwhile the Services Sector PMI declined to 53.0 index points in September 2018 from 57.0 index points recorded in August 2018.
This indicates that the Services sector expanded at a slower pace in September 2018, recording the lowest index value since survey began in May 2015.

Alleged assassination plot against President :
Matter should not be trivialised - Presidents Coordinating secretary
President Maithripala Sirisenas Advisor and Coordinating Secretary Shiral Lakthilaka convening a special media briefing in the wake of claims that there was a hidden hand in the assassination plot against the President, requested that the matter not be trivialised and that the government was confident that the Police and other law enforcement agencies would conduct a thorough probe.
The matter deserves a thorough investigation and any attempt to sweep the matter under the carpet or call it a superficial story implicates that there is a political tone in this saga, he said. We ask that this issue not be trivialised and affirm the governments stance that we are confident the police and judiciary would do justice to a claim as grave as this.
He added that he too had seen reports in the media of political factions referring to the story as bogus or cooked up. It may be true but it is not up to us to decide. It is the role of the police and the CID who are investigating the matter to get to the bottom of it, he said. He cited that the matter was serious, otherwise it would not warrant the Minister of Law and Order to call for the interdiction of the Director of the Terrorist Investigation Division DIG Nalaka Silva.
There is also a non-Sri Lankan national who remains in custody over the matter, lets not undermine the process, he said. If someone is trying to undermine it, we believe that it indicates a political tone.
He added that the government was satisfied that investigation although slow was proceeding steadily, adding that the seriousness of the matter is unravelling itself as the days goes on.
Meanwhile, Sarath Kongahage, senior advisor to the President who was also present said that there was a concentrated effort on the part of politicians and officials to trivialize the issue.
There were allegations of a plan to involve underworld kingpin Makandare Madush who is overseas in this ploy, he said. The other individual an MP from the Eastern Province had sought approval to travel overseas. If this ploy is a bluff then why leave the country.
Both officials referred to the many assissination attempts on the countrys leaders in the past saying that it had been instigated by the LTTE. But that in this instance was different and deserved a full fledged investigation. Both officials who were there on their personal capacity said that they were confident that under the perpetrators would be dealt with justly.

Mayweather says Nurmagomedov fight will happen
LOS ANGELES : Former world welterweight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather insisted Wednesday he plans to fight mixed martial arts star Khabib Nurmagomedov following the Russian's victory over Conor McGregor.
In comments to the TMZ Sports website, Mayweather was adamant that a fight with Nurmagomedov was happening provided it took place in the boxing ring.
Asked by a TMZ if a fight with Nurmagomedov would take place, the 41-year-old replied: Oh, we're fighting. I'm my own boss. I can't say what's going on on Khabib's end, but on my end we can make it happen, Mayweather said.
Mayweather, who came out of retirement to defeat McGregor in a money-spinning fight in Las Vegas last year, stressed though that any fight with Nurmagomedov would take place under boxing rules.
Who's the A-side He called me out, so he have to come to my world, Mayweather said.
Mayweather, who boasts a perfect 50-0 record and the unbeaten Nurmagomedov (27-0) would be certain to generate another bumper payday if they do fight.
When I face Khabib, I'm getting a nine-figure payday, Mayweather said. More than the McGregor fight. Probably $100 million more, guaranteed. It could be somewhere upwards of $110m to $200m guaranteed. Nurmagomedov is facing possible disciplinary action in Nevada following the stormy end to his victory over McGregor.
The Russian fighter jumped into the crowd immediately after the win to trade blows with members of McGregor's entourage while other members of Nurmagomedov's support leapt into the octagon at T-Mobile Arena to attack the beaten Irish fighter. Nurmagomedov has also spoken enthusiastically about facing Mayweather.
Let's go Floyd. We have to fight now: 50-0 versus 27-0. We are two guys who never lose. In the jungle there is only one king. Of course, I am the king because he cannot drop McGregor but I drop him easily. Let's go. - AFP

MPs allowances cost Rs.652 million last year
Parliament had spent Rs.652 million to pay the allowances of MPs last year, a senior Parliament official said.
He told the Daily News that Parliament had spent Rs.118 million to pay the MPs salaries and sittings allowance, Rs. 115 million to pay for the MPs fuel allowance, Rs.135 million to pay for the MPs postal and telecommunication allowance, Rs.259 million to pay for MPs rental and Rs 25 million to pay for the MPs transport allowance.
The ministers salaries are not included above as those are paid by the respective ministries, but ministers too are entitled to the above mentioned fuel, postal and telecommunication, rental and sittings allowances.
He said the total expenditure of Parliament in 2017 stood at Rs 2,443 million, but out of that sum Rs.939 million was spent to pay for the salaries and allowances of nearly 900 Parliamentary staff.
If you divide the total expenditure by 365, you get Rs 6.6 million as an average for a days expenditure in Parliament. Parliament sits about 100 days per year on an average. On each Parliament sitting day, we spend Rs.300,000 to prepare meals for about 150 MPs, and additional cost for electricity, water and members sittings allowance. There is no mechanism to calculate a sitting days expenditure separately. If you divide the total expenditure by the average number of sitting days you get about Rs.24 million, he explained.

No privatisation of Colombo Port Eastern Terminal-Minister
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port will not be privatised as the governments stance is to run it as a government entity.
The Minister was addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters yesterday.
the Minister added that the Government has no intention of privatising the Eastern Terminal (ET) of the Colombo port.
Minister Samarasinghe said that no Cabinet Paper was submitted to the Cabinet by the Prime Minister to privatise the ET or to enter into a Public Private Partnership (PPP) aiming to privatise it.
Three is no truth in that as the Prime Minister did not forward such a Cabinet Paper seeking Cabinet approval to privatise the ET he added.
However, the Minister noted that he (Minister Samarasinghe) submitted a Cabinet Paper seeking Cabinet approval for further development of the ET.
With the Cabinet Paper submitted by me, seek the approval for calling for international tenders to supply necessary cranes to the ET yesterday. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has invested US 80 million to develop the Eastern Terminal and another US $ 80 million will have to be allocated to install necessary equipment including cranes the Minister said.
According to the Minister the SLPA is economically strong to allocate the sum of US $ 80 million needed to install the required equipment.
Asked whether there is any truth in the news circulating that discussions are being carried out between Sri Lanka and India to hand over the Eastern Terminal to India, the Minister said that the Presidents stance is to manage the ET as a state own entity under the government. The ET should be 100 per cent owned by the Government.
The President while participating in the BIMSTEC summit has told the Indian Prime Minister that the ET would run as a state entity he said.
He added that only deep terminals can handle modern big vessels, which carried a large number of containers. According to the Minister,the Eastern Terminal is the only government own container terminal, which can accommodate and handle such big vessels as the other SLPA terminals are not deep enough to handle such big vessels. The Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), which was privatised during the Mahinda Rajapaksas regime to China for 35 year period can also handle big vessels. If the ET is privatised SLPA will not be able to handle big vessels.
However Minister Samarasinghe said that the Government has no objection to provide India with the Western terminal, which is needed a development.
A large sum of money should be invested to develop the Western terminal the government has no objection if India develop the Western terminal, he said.

Game being reduced to 21 overs favoured us but....
Not executing plans in the middle a big concern  Dickwella
PALLEKELE, Thursday  Sri Lankas dashing wicket-keeper batsman Niroshan Dickwella said that the team not executing plans in the middle was a big concern after they were defeated by seven wickets in the third ODI by England in a rain-restricted match played under lights at the Pallekele International Stadium on Wednesday.
Sri Lanka trail England 2-0 in the five-match series with two more matches remaining.
Weve done the training that we need. What remains to be done is on the field. On the preparation front, weve done 100 percent. Even before the series started, wed been doing that training, and formulating our plans against their bowlers and batsmen, said Dickwella at the post-match press conference. We know a lot about them. But the issue is whether its a 20-over game or a 50-over one, the players arent executing in certain areas. I dont think the rain was a major hindrance.
England romped home easy winners scoring 153-3 in 18.3 overs. Sri Lanka managed to score only 150-9 in 21 overs after being 55 for no loss in five overs at one stage.
We got a good start but we were 20-25 runs short. After being 92 for 2, it was 92 for 4 suddenly. That was the main turning point. If Thisara (Perera) could have batted five overs at that time, we would have ended up with a score closer to 190, said Dickwella.
The shortened game helped us definitely because every batter we have are hitters. It was in our favour the game being reduced to 21 overs. I dont think the composition of the squad played a big impact in the match being lost.
Our collapse was the main reason. You cant win a 21-over match with only 150 on the board. Its a day/nighter as well, and the ball was wet because of the rain. Its not the bowling but the batting that let us down, even though we had a good start, he said.
Dickwella and Sadeera Samarawickrama who replaced Upul Tharanga in the line-up gave Sri Lanka a flying start posting 57 off 33 balls with Dickwella making the most of it by contributing 36 off 20 balls before skying a catch to mid-off.
I cant be satisfied with my performance. A lot of times I get 30 or 40, but only about one in five games do I go onto get 70 or 80. I cant be happy with that. Today was a shortened game so its different, said Dickwella.
Once I got to 30 I tried to keep going at the same tempo, because we had wickets in hand. But overall when you look at my one-day cricket, even though Ive got starts, I havent capitalised and turned them into big innings. Im working with Thilan (Samaraweera) and (Chandika) Hathurusingha on that.
From the teams perspective we didnt get a big partnership from the top order. This time we got that, but the middle order failed. Those things happen. To get the optimal score, we need to click together.
When the top order plays well, the middle order doesnt and vice versa. So we are trying to play well together and get that big score. Its the players who are in the middle who know whats happening. Those outside can say anything, he said.

Outdoor exercises are just as effective as indoor ones
There is no debating the health benefits of physical fitness. Getting regular exercisehelps prevent heart disease and other chronic illness, improves mood, reduces stress, improves sleep, and more. In order for adults to reap those benefits, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week.
That time commitment may seem like a tall order in your busy life. But the good news is that you dont have to book sessions in a gym to get in shape. Outdoor exercises are just as effective as indoor ones, can be more fun, and have some other appealing advantages.
Working Out Outside Comes With Perks for the Body and Mind
Outdoor fitness can be a structured exercise program that takes advantage of natural terrain to get you in shape, or it can be as simple as a brisk walk around the block. Outdoor fitness comes in many forms: Light gardening or other yard work, for example, is considered moderate physical activity, and a 154-pound man can burn approximately 330 calories in an hour doing it, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Whichever way you choose to exercise outside, there are numerous benefits:
l A harder workout When youre active outdoors  whether youre running on the beach or hiking up a mountain  your body is encountering a constantly changing environment. To keep up the activity at a consistent pace, you need to adapt to all those minute changes in your surroundings (such as slight inclines, bumps, or obstacles you may need to dodge), which means your body works harder than if you were running on a treadmill or using a stair machine, according to the American Council on Exercise.
l No membership fees The outdoors belongs to all of us. You dont need any special equipment  the outdoors is available wherever you are, just outside your door, says Tina Vindum, a faculty member of the American Council on Exercise and the author of Tina Vindums Outdoor Fitness: Step Out of the Gym Into the Best Shape of Your Life.
l Cleaner air According to the Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air can be more polluted than outdoor air even in large cities and metropolitan areas.
l A free daily dose of D Outdoor exercise is a way to get your vitamin D through sunlight. This is especially important if you are overweight, as research suggests that people who are overweight are more likely to be deficient in vitamin D.
l Exercise for your mind When you exercise outdoors, your mind is aware of the changing terrain. Whether you use the hills, the sand on a beach, or a winding path, your mind has to focus differently than it would on a flat gym floor, notes Vindum. And research suggests the effect of exercise on the mind tends to favor a positive direction. Several studies, including one published in Environmental Science and Technology in 2011, suggest exercise outdoors benefited mental well-being more than the same type of exercise inside.
Heres how to get started if you want to take your exercise routine outside
If you have any health issues, talk to your doctor before starting an outdoor fitness program, and ask any questions you have about upping the intensity of your fitness routine or jumping back into fitness if youve been inactive for a while.
And then ease into it, Vindum says. I tell people to have a goal in mind, start slowly, and work up to their potential. Outdoor exercise can be adapted to anyones level of fitness. Here are some tips to get you going.
l Exercise early. People can always find more excuses to avoid exercising outdoors at the end of the day, says Vindum. In the morning your energy is higher, the air is generally cleaner, the temperature tends to be lower, and youll get to feel the post-workout benefits (less stress and a better mood) all day long.
l Avoid temperature extremes. Although your body can adapt to colder or warmer weather, you should avoid exercising outside in extreme heat or cold. And in warmer temps, watch for signs of overheating, including headache, dizziness, nausea, faintness, cramping, or palpitations, according to information from Harvard Medical School.
l Dont get burned. Although some sun is good for you, too much sun is not. Always protect yourself with a good sunscreen, and wear sunglasses and a hat with a brim, advises Vindum.
l Drink enough water. If you drink about 8 to 10 ounces of water 30 minutes before exercising outdoors, it should hydrate you sufficiently for a 30-minute workout. You dont need water with electrolytes in most cases, says Vindum. Remember that you can lose water through sweating, though  even in cooler weather. And you may start to get dehydrated before you feel thirsty.
l Get some good gear. Take advantage of the new technology in waterproof, breathable clothing material, advises Vindum. The right gear lets you feel good in any type of weather.
l Make outdoor exercises part of your lifestyle. You can learn exercises that use only body weight and gravity and do them while you are walking to the post office, Vindum says. Think about walking instead of driving. Plan outdoor activities with your family. Go for a hike instead of a drive.

## Title: Pakistans Kaneria admits fixing guilt at last - report

Pakistans Kaneria admits fixing guilt at last - report
London, Thursday: Pakistans Danish Kaneria has finally admitted his role in a fixing scandal that led to the imprisonment of former Essex team-mate Mervyn Westfield after six years of denials, Britains Daily Mail reported late Wednesday.
Kaneria, who was given a life ban by English cricket chiefs that effectively applied worldwide, said in an interview for an Al Jazeera television documentary quoted by the Mail: My name is Danish Kaneria and I admit that I was guilty of the two charges brought against me by the England and Wales Cricket Board in 2012.
Leg-spinner Kaneria, who insisted he was repentant as he called for his life ban to be overturned, added: I want to apologise to Mervyn Westfield, my Essex team-mates, my Essex cricket club, my Essex cricket fans. I say sorry to Pakistan.
Westfield spent two months at Belmarsh prison in south-east London after pleading guilty to accepting 6,000 ($7,862) from an illegal bookmaker, Anu Bhatt, to concede 12 runs in his first over of an English county 40-over game against Durham in 2009. He conceded only 10, but still took the money.
Kaneria was the middle-man in the scam, having introduced Westfield to Bhatt, but avoided criminal charges when English legal authorities decided they lacked the evidence for a conviction.
Now 37, Kaneria remains Pakistans leading spinner with 261 Test wickets. He last played for Pakistan in the Trent Bridge Test of 2010, and has not appeared in any first-class game since March 2012, with all major boards upholding the ECB ban under International Cricket Council guidance.
I want to ask peoples forgiveness, said Kaneria.
Cricket has given me so much in my life and I want to give something back.
If the ECB and ICC and other bodies would give me a second chance I can help to educate young people in cricket, teach them that if you do wrong you are finished like me.
Kaneria said the fear of embarrassing his father, who died in 2013 and had been suffering from cancer, explained part of the reason behind his repeated denials of wrongdoing.
His health was getting worse and worse, he recalled.
I didnt have the courage to face him and tell him that I was wrong. He was a very, very proud guy. Very, very proud of me and what I did, representing Pakistan, representing my country.
I want to apologise to my father, who has always been a role model for me.
Meanwhile Westfield told the Mail he accepted Kanerias apology, saying: This whole chapter of spot-fixing changed my life, but I have never blamed anyone for the terrible mistake I made.
However, opening up about my wrongdoing and telling the truth allowed me to move on, added Westfield, now 30, who was banned from professional cricket for five years after being released from jail but has since played club and minor county matches.
I hope that Danish finds peace and closure by doing this, and I wish him all the best for the future. AFP

Prime Minister reaches New Delhi for three-day visit
New Delhi: Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reached New Delhi yesterday on a three-day visit in a bid to boost ties in a range of areas including trade and investment and maritime security.
Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold wide-ranging talks on Saturday.
You are aware of close friendship between India and Sri Lanka. Development cooperation will be one of the agenda items, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said at a media briefing.
He said, All shades of political opinion in Sri Lanka are for close relationship with India. We do enjoy very strong bonds of friendship.
The two sides are also likely to review the status of the India-assisted housing projects in Jaffna during Wickremesinghes visit.
They are also likely to deliberate on the Tamil issue -the reconciliation process and devolution of powers in Tamil-dominated areas.
Sources said both sides are expected to discuss modalities of India taking charge of operating Sri Lankas loss-making Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in Hambantota.
The $210 million facility, 241 km south-east of Colombo, is dubbed the worlds emptiest airport due to a lack of flights. India is likely to operate the airport under a joint venture with the island nation.

A prudent move
The escalating prices of fuel has caused consternation all over the world, as Governments scramble to find ways to give fuel at a reasonable price to consumers without seriously impacting on their coffers. Sri Lanka is no exception. Fuel prices saw a hike on a couple of occasions during the last few months, but still our fuel prices are below those of many Asian nations in Rupee terms.
There are a few factors that have caused the fuel price hike. The US sanctions on Iran, which will come into effect on November 5, have already caused a constriction in the global oil market, Iran being one of the biggest producers of oil. The situation with regard to Saudi oil output could also change due to the ongoing concerns over the Jamal Khashoggi disappearance case. Moreover, the depreciation of many currencies against the US Dollar has made oil imports more expensive. Net oil importers such as Sri Lanka have been adversely affected by all these factors.
Asian Governments including Sri Lanka which traditionally subsidize fuel used for public transport have been exploring options that would not upset the status quo. The Government raised petrol prices on a number of occasions but it has been careful to avoid a substantial rise in normal diesel prices used by trucks and buses (the super diesel variety is generally used for luxury diesel vehicles). Any rise in normal diesel prices tends to have a ripple effect on passenger and goods transport costs, which is generally passed on to the hapless consumer. In fact, when fuel prices were raised a week ago, normal diesel prices remained unchanged. The same applies to kerosene, which many households still use for cooking and lighting purposes.
There is a notion that any hike in Petrol 92 and Petrol 95 prices will not affect the economy so much, since petrol is mostly used for private passenger cars. This is true to some extent  the passenger car user must pay for the privilege and he or she has the choice not to use the car for non-essential journeys. Other options such as public transport and ride hailing services are available in case they give up the car.
But this is not a complete picture. One cannot forget motorcyclists and three wheeler operators, drawn mostly from the lower middle class. An increase of a litre of petrol by even 5-6 rupees means a lot to them as they have to juggle among the high Cost of Living and the leasing and fuel costs. There are only around 700,000 private cars in circulation whereas there are around 1.2 million three wheelers, out of which around one million are used for passenger hire. One cannot dismiss the immense service they render for last-mile transport (say, from the train station to the passengers home), the school and hospital run in remote areas and to the SME sector. We have discussed their somewhat miserable road safety record in these columns, but that does not diminish their importance to the economy in both rural and urban areas.
Hence the idea of introducing a cheaper, low octane variety of petrol especially and specifically for three wheelers, as announced by Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga. This petrol variety can apparently be priced Rs.8 lower than Petrol 92 if duties and taxes remain at present levels. However, if these too can be reduced by even a few rupees, there could be an even greater saving at the pump.
This is a welcome move, given that the petrol price hike hit the three wheeler industry hard. Tests are also reported to be underway to determine whether this petrol variety can be used for some of the older motorcycles in use. (Most modern motorcycles have highly advanced engines which will not take kindly to lower Octane fuel and the cheaper fuel is a strict no-no for passenger cars, despite their age).
However, there are a few concerns that must be addressed by the authorities and the three wheeler industry. Three wheeler associations have already increased the fares by at least Rs.10 per kilometre. It will be very difficult to get them to come down from this figure, even if petrol is issued at a lower price. Besides, they can always tell a passenger that regular petrol is being used even if the cheaper variety is actually in the tank.
Moreover, the authorities should clarify the effect of the new fuel variety on the environment. Some of the older three wheelers have sputtering two-stroke engines which will make the emissions even worse with a lower quality petrol. They must also clarify where this fuel will be available  just 100 filling stations for the entire country, at least in the initial stages, will not be able to fill the demand. As an aside, three wheeler drivers should not be allowed to fill up if they have passengers inside, which could be highly dangerous. This rule already applies to passenger buses. The Government must also expedite preparatory work on a three wheeler regulatory authority to give a better deal to both operators and passengers.

Royal enter pre-quarters of Under 15 Division two tourney
Royal College Colombo entered the pre quarters of the all island under 15 division two cricket tournament organised by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for the Singer Trophy. Their hopes were shattered when they lost to St. Sebastian's College Moratuwa in the pre quarters.
The left arm orthodox Spinner Abishak Iddawela of Royal College, played a major role in their achievement. Out of the eight matches he was able to take part in seven matches and in the morning of the pre quarter match his leg was injured and he could not take part which was a heavy blow to Royalists.

Scuba divers compete in underwater pumpkin carving
Scuba divers in the Florida Keys took their Halloween spirit 30 feet below the surface for an underwater pumpkin carving contest.
The contest, organized by the Amoray Dive Resort, saw the divers going 30 feet below the surface at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary to carve sub-aquatic jack-o-lanterns.
Participants said the task was complicated by the fact that their buoyant pumpkins kept trying to float away mid-carve.
Brothers Sebastian and Gabriel Gimeno, ages 16 and 14, were declared the winners with their pumpkin carving, which portrayed a dolphin and a half moon.
The Gimeno brothers were awarded a return dive trip with Amoray Dive Resort.

Spare the rod!
New age lifestyle comes with its load of tensions and anxieties. Children are at the receiving end of modern living as many parents vent their frustrations by shouting at or punishing their children for even trivial matters.
Frustrations caused by pressures at work, broken home conditions, financial and domestic worries, marital discord and alcoholic problems are some of the reasons for parents to lose their temper on children. According to UNICEF Sri Lanka around 73.4 percent of children aged one to 14 years experience corporal punishment at home by parents in Sri Lanka.
Children in Sri Lanka are at risk of entering adulthood at a disadvantage to their peers, because they have not benefited from the good nutrition, stimulation and protection - known as eat, play and love - that enable a brain to grow to its full capacity by the age of five years. A childs brain grows and develops to 85 percent of its full capacity by the age of five. In these early years brain development depends on good nutrition, play and stimulation in the home environment and in preschools and love and protection from harm including violence, abuse and neglect. These can be provided by parents through simple actions, and can make a lasting, positive difference to a childs development, UNICEF Sri Lankas statement said.
This has also been an issue that has been escalating steadily in schools across the island. More and more reports of teachers inflicting punishments of students have raised controversy in recent years.
Severe punishment of children in whatever nature it is given is detrimental to the child's physical and mental development. Though the efficacy of punishment is over-emphasised particularly by those who hold fast to the theory that punishments are done with the best of intentions is quite controversial and questionable.
Child behaviour problems
A child cannot learn discipline in an atmosphere of fear. Spanking children as an effective form of discipline could lead to short and long term child behaviour problems.
Beating, as a punishment, is no answer to disciplining a child. However it is considered as one of the easiest ways to make a child obedient on a short term basis. The beating also does not explain to him or her why he or she is being punished. Persistent punishment, scolding, criticising and beating may prove to be an impediment in the natural and all round development of the child's personality. Moreover, beating and severe scolding are negative devises to correct or reform them, says National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Founding Chairperson, Professor Emeritus of Paediatrics, former Presidential Task Force on Child Protection Member Professor Harendra de Silva.
He notes that children engage in certain acts to get attention. Though a beating means that the child has gotten attention but a spank or a slap does not mean that the problem that has been bothering the parent or the teacher has been solved.
The belief that strict discipline has beneficial effects for growing children seems to rest on a seriously faulty assumption. The assumption is that children are by nature problematic and therefore need strict disciplining. Unless such disciplining is exercised, the child is sure to be spoiled.
Professor de Silva adds that children are not born stubborn. It is the environments which shapes their character and personality. Parents, the society as well as the input provided by the media contribute to the childs mental development.
Crying is a weapon that a child uses to get whatever he or she wants. If the parents give in and let the child have his or her way in the matter, the child will realize that the strategy works and use it again, he said.
Jaffna Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Surgery, Visiting Lecturer, Dr. D. C. Ambalavanar said there is mounting evidence that harsh discipline (physical, verbal and psychological) is harmful to children and damaging to society.
There was a time when the saying spare the rod and spoil the child was accepted as common wisdom. The practice of corporal punishment (physical violence) is widespread in our schools and homes to the extent that many think it is part of our culture and that without it children cannot be disciplined. While on the one hand as a society we would not accept violence against adults we are somehow blind to the harmful consequences of corporal punishment to the child and the wider community, Dr. Ambalavanar said.
He adds that the impact of violence against children in our schools and other educational institutions goes beyond the risk of just physical injury.
Children who suffer physical and emotional violence experience long term effects that can continue into adulthood, such as impaired brain development and mental and physical health problems, including heart disease, substance abuse and depression. The younger the brain the more severe is the effects of toxic stress. Violence also affects childrens learning and performance in school, creates difficulties in developing empathy, controlling aggression and interacting with others, and damages parent-child relationships. This has been found in studies carried out in Sri Lanka as well, he explained.
Physical violence
Witnessing and experiencing violence is closely related to a persons tendency to perpetrate violence. Many children who have suffered serious physical violence can themselves perpetrate violence against their own children and spouses when they become adults. In many of the bigger boys schools in northern Sri Lanka prefects have been allowed to hit fellow students in the course of carrying out their duties. This problem exists in schools in other parts of the country too, Dr. Ambalavanar added.
He questioned whether it is then surprising that we see the serious problem of ragging in our universities when our children have been made to feel that violence is acceptable and when they have been exposed to violence for most of their lives
Adults tend to believe that it is their right to hit a child for purposes of correction or to obtain obedience. The truth is that no one has the right to hit another person and this right is a great wrong.
There is a profoundly influential social and policy discourse in our culture which has conveniently chosen to either ignore or make childrens voices invisible from the public domain. Though there is no dearth of events such as childrens summits, childrens festivals or youth parliaments which are self-indulgently claiming to represent childrens voices, the realistic picture is that children still belong to the voiceless category.
Former NCPA Chairperson, Former UNICEF Director, and Former Presidential Task Force on Child Protection Member Dr. Hiranthi Wijemanne said that the biggest obstacle to overcome in preventing the use of corporal punishment is the continued and widespread tolerance of this heinous and cruel practice, in the name of discipline.
A confidential reporting system for children is essential. A multi-sectoral and well-coordinated approach is needed when such an initiative is developed. Raising awareness is essential for parents, families, communities, schools and alternative care institutions for children, including all those working for and with children, she reiterated.
Former Presidential Task Force on Child Protection Member, Presidential Advisor, and Former Education Ministry Secretary Dr. Tara de Mel noted that the brutal and barbaric practices seen in universities in the guise of ragging today, are symptomatic of the negative emotions and psychological issues in certain undergraduates.
Research studies conducted on victims of corporal punishment have clearly shown how their behaviour in later life is affected by childhood trauma. Therefore this issue has to be resolved immediately for the future generation of Sri Lanka to have healthy mindsets, she pointed out.
Traumatized childhood experience
Elaborating further on this topic Clinical Psychology Professor Piyanjali De Zoyza noted that children imitate adults and learn that aggression is ok.
So when you go to university and dont like somebody you use the same tactic on that person and dub it as ragging. Later in your workplace when you find that you dont like your employee or your subordinate, you use verbal violence, she explained the chained of processes which follow a traumatized childhood experience.
Todays abused is tomorrows abuser, notes Professor de Silva.
Those who have been beaten in childhood or those who have been scolded and degraded and those who have been sexually abused in childhood reciprocate that in adult self.
Another alarming factor to consider in relation to corporal punishment is the lowered academic performance. Last year an islandwide survey revealed that the three main reasons corporal punishment is meted out in Sri Lankan schools are: failure to do homework, having love affairs with the opposite sex and not dressing in proper clothes. Children are mostly unable to do homework because they are overload of homework by the teachers. Love affairs and dressing differently is part of the normal psycho-sexual development. If our teachers hit children in this manner, how would you expect children to grow up to be wholesome adults with proper values Professor De Zoyza questioned.
Dr. de Mel points out that there are many ways to instill discipline in children without resorting to physical violence and emotional abuse. Experts in the field have repeatedly shown how even the most mischievous children can be disciplined without using such drastic measures.
Negative consequences
Rewarding good behaviour appropriately, showing the ill effects of mischievous behaviour firmly but with kindness, and using other skilful methods may be a slow process, but will have sustainable results with no negative consequences, she said.
Stop Child Cruelty Chairperson Dr. Tush Wickramanayakan says, There are many ways in which discipline can be maintained without the recourse to physical or harsh verbal punishment as has been well established around the world. First of all children should be treated with respect and understanding. Teachers have to focus on a childs good behaviour and not the bad. Get the child work for a reward. The introduction of the star chart is one such way. Teachers are not supposed to give black stars to children rather they have to be given red stars for their good behaviour. There is another called Rainbow system where a group of students have to work towards a reward. There the stronger child pulls along the weaker one which develops camaraderie.
Realising that she must make it a public concern to prevent such negative incidents in schools after her own daughter faced such an issue, Dr. Wickramanayaka embarked on a mission to help many others who had experienced similar circumstances. Her ultimate vision is to enforce a complete ban on corporal punishment in the island.
There needs to be an entire strategy in training teachers to become child protection officers, who will take responsibility and action in case of an incident. We are not against the teachers. We understand that there are many pressures on teachers and whenever a negative incident happen the teacher regrets. If they are expelled from school it impacts their lives as well. We must not forget that teachers too are often a victim in such cases and not just the child, she elaborates.
It should be possible for teachers to discuss with their students the disciplinary codes for the classroom and involve the children in the process. Each school can set up codes of practise after discussion with teachers, parents and students. It should also be stressed that those teachers and parents who are against corporal punishment are not against discipline, she adds.
Dr. Wickramanayaka points out that there is a huge number of international schools in the country that are not governed or regulated by anyone. There is no protection of law for the students in international schools. An authority has to be set up to own each and every child in the country. Teachers need to be trained and equipped effectively to teach and deal with children. Already teacher training includes an understanding of basic child psychology and positive classroom management techniques but these should be taught in a practical manner and seen to be implemented. When teachers receive their appointment it should be required of them to have such a practical refresher course before they start work, she explained.
Through some of these measures she believes that it will be possible to eradicate the scourge of corporal punishment from our schools and make the classroom a friendlier learning environment and thus produce a healthier society.
National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Chairman, H. M. Abeyarathne approves that corporal punishment is prevalent in schools, home and orphanages in Sri Lanka.
In a research conducted by NCPA it was revealed that 86 per cent schools have corporal punishment. Verbal and physical abuse of the student is used mainly because the students have not completed their homework. The curricular or the subject matter is vast and both teachers and students are stressed in trying to complete it which leads to negative incidents, he said.
Some teachers have the attitude that students should be corrected by corporal punishment which is wrong. Parents think it is their right to hit children. It is high time to change our attitudes. We have to implement laws further to tackle this issue. Corporal punishment will never develop the personality of a child instead will make children search for comfort in using drugs and other harmful methods, Abeyarathne pointed out.
NCPA Chairman also stressed the competition in the education system and the burden of exams also pressurizes the child.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr.Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe says that corporal punishment is a factor that has been rejected by all the developing countries.
Discipline cannot be achieved through punishment. Rather it is these individuals who have had traumatic childhood experiences who inflict violence on others during their youth and adulthood. Ragging in universities is a result of corporal punishment. We need to make all the relevant parties aware about this aspect and develop awareness programmes through the media and other means, he noted.
According to Circular No. 12 of 2016 - Safeguarding Discipline in Schools, physical punishment in schools has been banned. The circular also lists alternative measures to replace corporal punishment. Corporal punishment for adults was included in the countrys law act during the period that the British ruled the island.
Sending a man to the gallows too is a form of corporal punishment but there are laws to ban that action. There is a particular inquiry system to look into an employees misconduct but nobody takes measures to find out why a child has misbehaved. If the employer had been drunk, under the influence of drugs or under stress and becomes abusive towards the employee, then the employee can challenge him but a child is not given that opportunity with his or her parents. The child becomes a voiceless victim, Professor de Silva pointed adding that it is a violation of the rights of an undefended person.

Sprint king Bolt rejects Malta football offer
Sydney, Thursday: Sprint superstar Usain Bolt has turned down a contract from Maltese champions Valletta and will remain in Australia to pursue his dream of becoming a professional footballer, his agent said Thursday.
The eight-time Olympic champion has been on trial with A-League club the Central Coast Mariners since arriving Down Under in August. He scored two goals in a pre-season friendly last Friday but is yet to be offered a deal, with cashed-up Valletta dangling a two-year trial-free contract to entice him away earlier this week.
But Bolts agent Ricky Simms said he had opted against a move to the Maltese Premier League team, which is backed by a group of investors from the Sanban Group in the United Arab Emirates.
There is a lot of interest in Usain playing football, he told ESPN.
We regularly receive similar approaches. I can confirm Usain does not wish to pursue this opportunity in Malta.
Valletta chief executive Ghasston Slimen told the broadcaster: We wish Usain Bolt all the best with his football career. The Valletta FC offer is always on the table.
Australias domestic A-League season starts this weekend, with the Mariners in action on Sunday away to Brisbane Roar. With no contract, Bolt is not eligible for selection.
Club chief executive Shaun Mielekamp said this week the Jamaican will continue his indefinite training period ... until any further notice.
Reports suggest the Mariners are waiting for governing body Football Federation Australia to decide whether it will contribute to a potential Aus$3 million (US$2.1 million) offer to the 100m world record holder.
Sydneys Daily Telegraph on Thursday reported Bolt and Mielekamp sat down for a coffee in the wake of the Malta offer for clarity on his future.
It said the 32-year-old, who regards Australia as a second home, might consider accepting less money if it means locking in a contract.
Coach Mike Mulvey was reluctant Thursday to talk about Bolt, saying he was not involved in contract negotiations.
Im really not interested in it (contract speculation) to tell you the truth, he told reporters.
Hes been great among the guys and I was very happy for him last week with the two goals he scored, but we move on.
Mariners captain Matt Simon dismissed suggestions the chronicles of Bolt were distracting the squad ahead of their A-League opener.
Hes been here for a couple of months now, so everywhere we go with Usain, everyones talking about him, Simon said.
Weve just been down to business, concentrating on the season and putting into practice what weve been doing at training for the last 12 weeks.
Bolt, who retired from athletics last year, has previously tried out with clubs in Germany, South Africa and Norway to no avail. AFP

Surado Campus opens job opportunities for Sri Lankans
Surado Campus of Business Management, one of Sri Lankas foremost privately led vocational training institutions for foreign employment is driving a wave of new global job opportunities for Sri Lankans based on the worldwide caregiving market boom.
The campus, completing six years in operation as a leading provider of foreign employment opportunities based on a strong educational foundation and internationally accepted qualifications, has introduced caregiving to their curriculum, ensuring that Sri Lankans will be professionally qualified to penetrate into the highly promising and demanding global caregiver market.
Caregiving entails assisting another person who is ill, disabled, or needs help with daily activities, and has thus far been a somewhat understated profession among Sri Lankans.
Those looking to earn on foreign soil are still venturing into stereotypical job roles as domestic maids/workers under harsh conditions due to the lack of awareness of newer, better opportunities such as caregiving,whichhas shown far greater potential for rapid income generation and less physical and emotional trauma. Having personally trained and qualified as a caregiver while I read for my Masters in Australia, I came to respect and recommend this highly rewarding job role, stated Rachitha Buddika, Chief Executive Officer of the Surado Campus of Business Management.
It requires you to pay attention to the physical, emotional, social and psychological needs of another human being, and you are responsible for them. So its not something you can learn on the go, but something that you need to study and understand before putting it to practice.
It is the perfect investment not only by foreign and local job seekers, but also young adults flying overseas on student visa with onlypart time job opportunities.
It is also a highly beneficial, practical and even life-saving course for those who wish to take care of ailing family members right here at home in Sri Lanka.
With the global caregiving market poised to grow manifold within the next few years, its not only home healthcare jobs that are open opportunities for job creation and income generation.
There are plenty more job openings being created across multiple avenues that are related to the ageing population and caregiving, such as technology-based assistance, special catering.
The only Campus in Sri Lanka providing foreign placement for caregivers, Surado Campus of Business Management offers a specialized 6-month Diploma in Healthcare inclusive of practical first aid courses, ultramodern physical therapy treatment initiations and specialized lectures by an eminent panel of lecturers.
Surado is an ISO 9001:2008 and SLS IWA2 2007 quality certified vocational training institution in Sri Lanka offering the UK Approval for their caregiver program.

Teachers pet, is that you
An adorable dog loves helping primary school pupils to read, and even has his own school uniform and backpack.
Rescue dog Russell, aged 13, visits Coalsnaughton Primary School, Alloa, Clackmannanshire every Friday afternoon. The elderly dog is the family pet of school worker Kelsie McAlpine, 25, who came up with the idea of bringing him in to meet the children.
Kelsie researched the benefits of children having contact with animals, and said she has seen pupils confidence soar since Russell first visited the classroom in February. There are only 64 pupils at the school, and they all adore Russell. When Russell attends class, he gets to wear a teeny uniform matching the childrens, and a backpack which contains a packet of dog food and Gravy Bones  his favourite treat.
Kelsie, who works on the early interventions team, said, A lot of parents ask about when he is coming in. Some of the kids arent that confident and I have seen in reading groups where there are four children and they have all been really quiet, that you can hear them getting louder as they read. Dogs do not judge, they just listen. You can see it from the childrens faces.
Russell, a collie-Alsatian cross, also takes part in the daily mile walk which the children go on each day. His proud owner said, Somebody in the class gets nominated by the teacher for the responsibility of having his lead. The children are so empathetic and so loving. They ask me how many sleeps until Russell comes.
When he visits the classrooms, Russell is greeted with applause by the pupils, but often lies down to sleep on the floor. Kelsie added, The morale is up a wee bit, the whole atmosphere just lifts when Russell is in the room.
For children who do not have pets at home, Russells visits provide a chance for them to take responsibility for caring for a dog.
Head teacher Colleen Clark Burns is convinced that Russells visits teach pupils compassion and responsibility  as well as boosting their confidence. She said, We have a couple of really shy kids, and try to use Russell to build their social skills, so they can get an audience with him. The staff members all love him.
The idea has already caught the attention of other schools in the area. Kelsie added, Im really passionate about doing it, I love animals and I love my job. Metro

Top-ranked Halep  out of WTA finals with back injury
Singapore, Thursday: World number one Simona Halep withdrew from the WTA Finals in Singapore with a back injury on Thursday, bringing her season to a premature end.
The French Open champion pulled out of last months China Open after just 31 minutes, and withdrew from this weeks Kremlin Cup because of the persistent problem.
Halep, 27, said she had hoped to compete at the season finale in Singapore, which starts on Sunday, but that she had taken the tough decision to put her health first.
Its always difficult to withdraw from a big tournament, said the Romanian, who sustained the injury in Wuhan last month.
My back is not okay. I didnt practise for the last four weeks. Im not ready to compete at this level and Im still sore.
Her withdrawal means that Kiki Bertens from the Netherlands moves into the eighth and final qualifying spot in the WTA Finals.
It has been a disappointing end to a spectacular season for Halep, which saw her secure the year-end number one ranking in the WTA standings for the second year running.
She spent 40 weeks at number one in 2018, and won three titles from a tour-leading six final appearances, amassing a 46-11 win-loss record.
This year Halep has won the Shenzhen Open, the Rogers Cup and her debut Grand Slam crown at Roland Garros.
In addition, she reached the title match at the Australian Open, in Rome and Cincinnati. AFP

Tourism accepted as Export industry - PM
Tourism marketing tag lineSo Sri Lanka
The much awaited tourism marketing campaign has finally been awarded to JWT.
So Sri Lanka is the marketing tagline that has been proposed, the industry sources said. Some of the taglines promoted by other Asian destinations include, Visit Malaysia by Malaysia, Amazing Thailand by Thailand and Gods Own Country by the Indian state of Kerala.
The Government will have to seriously rethink of SriLankan Airlines and create a PPP for the airline, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL), 53rd Annual General Meeting at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo.
Prime Minister said that the Government cannot be pumping Rs. 200 to 300 million regularly to up keep the SriLankan Airlines. It would have been more productive to have given this to the travel sector for their destination promotions, he said.
Prime Minister said that to develop tourism in Sri Lanka, they need to fly in tourists for lower airfare and also have more domestic airports. We have now developed Batticalore, Trincomalee and Palali.
Premier said that the Mattala Airport would be once again made an international airport by leasing it out to Airport Authority of India which will bring in more tourists to India.
Premier said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also indicated to have more promotions in India to woo additional Indian tourists to Sri Lanka.
Premier said that the Government is keen on export oriented economy and soon tourism industry would be considered an Export Industry which in turn would help to obtain more benefits.
Premier also said that assistance would be also provided for hotel schools as the industry needs more employees. Prime Minister also disclosed that the much awaited and long overdue funds for the Tourism destination Marketing Campaign too was approved by the Cabinet. We must all sit and plan out a strategy not to attract 20 million tourists but to get five million guests, out of which three million would be high spenders.
We have to re think and plan out campaigns where the tourists who stay in a guest house or with Airbnb come back again to Sri Lanka with his family and stay at an up market hotel.
Plans should also be drawn to extend the stay of tourists in Sri Lanka where the guest nights in Anuradhapura should be extended to three. Dont sell rooms but sell experiences, he advised.
When I visited Hanoi in Vietnam I saw luxury hostels where there were fewer beds in a dometry and more luxury been offered and the local industry too must come out with innovative ideas. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe finally said that the first Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew told him that Tourism must be like a pick pocket and take money out of tourists without being noticed!.
Over 200 industry leaders, business leaders and the diplomatic community participated for the event.

Tourism industry laments over additional taxes
Tourism industry representatives lament they have been asked to pay up to 1 percent municipal or Provincial Council tax depending on the location, in addition to high taxes they are already paying.
This was highlighted by President THASL, Sanath Ukwatte at the annual general meeting at Shangri-La Hotel Colombo on Wednesday. We have been singled out by this unfair levy, he added.
In addition to this, the informal sector and global players like Airbnb who do not pay any taxes also eat into our business and there is no level playing field, he claimed.
In the past one year we have held five meetings with the Minister of Tourism, to address beach boy issues, selling of liquor by unlicensed establishments in key areas where our member hotels are located, to address the threats faced by us from the informal sector.
Unfortunately, this too has become a very political issue as the Minister is supporting us on this issue, he said.
With regards to the informal sector, subsidized loans for refurbishment of hotels and lowering of indirect taxes are some of the main issues we have taken up with the Minister of Finance and we are hopeful that some sort of relief will come out in the forthcoming budget.
I am sure most of us are very concerned about our industrys positioning in the international markets and our representatives of SLTPB have made great progress in bringing our concerns to the attention of the minister and the decision makers and they have made some progress in this field. The SLTPB has ensured that the digital marketing drive will come into action early next year and we are making every effort to put pressure on the Government to roll out this campaign as fast as possible.
Another important issue we decided to address is the issue of human resources. With 6500 new rooms coming into the market in the next couple of years and 22,000 rooms already in operation. We need at least 250,000 trained employees by 2020.
THASL is accounting for around 11.5% of Sri Lankas GDP, is the second largest net foreign exchange earner to the country.
However, a successful tourism industry cannot be achieved by any single organisation. It needs a collective vision and the support of all stakeholders, especially the Government and the general public, said Ukwatte, who has been unanimously elected to serve a third term in office.

UNP for holding PC elections under old electoral system
The UNPs official stance is that the next Provincial Council Elections must be held under the preferential votes system, UNP backbench MP S. M. Marikkar said.
The MP, addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, said the main reason for opting for the old electoral system was the mess experienced during the recently concluded Local Government Elections.
If the Joint Opposition genuinely wants the PC elections to be held soon, it can bring in a motion in Parliament to hold them under the old system till the loopholes of the new system are rectified. We will raise both our hands to vote in favour of it. But I doubt that they will do it, because they know it very well that they cannot obtain at least 50 percent of the votes in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and in the rest of six Provinces for which the elections are due. It is the SLFP that wants to delay the elections, he commented.
The MP, with reference to national level elections, said that his party is not for holding snap elections.
We got a mandate for five years and a lot more work is to be completed within the remaining period of our Government. We saw how the former President inviting trouble by calling for snap elections two years ahead of time, Marikkar replied.
Responding to a question by journalists on the court verdict on the case of former Minister Johnston Fernando, the MP said that the FCID was a clear loser in that case.
What we can construe is that either the way the FCID handled the evidence of the case was faulty or former Minister Fernando had not commited the said offence. We cannot speak on court verdicts as we have an independent judiciary now. Had we followed a method similar to the previous regime, one needs not necessarily commit any wrong doing to be taken in. How the previous Government treated former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka was a fine example, he noted.
He also expressed his displeasure that the incumbent Government took so long to initiate the special high courts to try the large scale corruption charges. Now the rogues have become heroes. We should have initiated the special courts at the very beginning of our term, he added.
Replying to the questions on the IGP, the MP stated that the IGP should be conscious about the majority of peoples impression about him.
We cannot remove the IGP. It is a long process that requires the President to present a motion carrying six counts in Parliament.
The motion has to be endorsed by Parliament and the Supreme Court must appoint a committee to investigate. He can only be removed if the charges were proven. But he can be sent on compulsory leave. The other option is that he can resign, bowing down to the peoples majority view. When the time is ripe for you to leave you must accept it. For example, former President Chandrika Kumaratunga clung to the Executive Presidency for so long that she lost the peoples respect. She could not earn it back, he remarked.

A team of UNP representatives met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday to discuss the Presidents decision to dissolve the Boards of Directors appointed by relevant Ministers to three institutions functioning under two UNP Ministers of the Yahapalana Government, states a press release issued by the UNP Central Media unit yesterday.
The Boards of Directors of the Bank of Ceylon (BOC), Peoples Bank and the Board of Investment (BoI) of Sri Lanka have been dissolved by President Maithripala Sirisena with effect from October 17 midnight.
The Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank function under Minister Lakshman Kiriella while the BOI functions under Minister Malik Samarawickrema
The Director Boards of the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank will not be immediately dissolved, but will continue to function normally until the new members to them are finalised, Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the President has instructed Minister Lakshman Kiriella to reconstitute the Director Boards of the State Banks.
This will be done, but there is no immediate dissolution. There must not be negative impact on the bank affairs. The current Board members will continue till the new appointments are made, he stressed.
He also denied the claim that the Presidents directive came in the light of fraud and corruption allegations.
The three-year term of the Director Boards has lapsed and it is normal to reconstitute the Boards, he replied.
He said the new appointments of the Boards would be done with the agreement between Minister Kiriella and President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Kiriella met President Sirisena on Wednesday night to discuss the restructure measures of the State Banks. The Minister had received the Presidents instructions in that regard in writing.

U.S. requests for Kashoggi murder tape
US: The US has asked Turkey for a recording said to provide strong evidence that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed at Istanbuls Saudi consulate.
We have asked for it, if it exists, President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House.
Khashoggi has not been seen since entering the building on 2 October. Saudi Arabia denies killing him.
Meanwhile, the Washington Post has published the last column Mr Khashoggi wrote before his disappearance.
In the column he talks about the importance of a free press in the Middle East.
The newspapers Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah said its release had been delayed in the hope that Khashoggi would return safely.
Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen. This is the last piece of his I will edit for The Post, she wrote. This column perfectly captures his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world. A freedom he apparently gave his life for.
Khashoggi presented a strong criticism of the state of press freedoms in the Arab world: The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power.
The Arab world needs a modern version of the old transnational media so citizens can be informed about global events. More important, we need to provide a platform for Arab voices.
He mentioned the case of his fellow Saudi writer, Saleh al-Shehi, who he said is now serving an unwarranted five-year prison sentence for supposed comments contrary to the Saudi establishment.
Such actions no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community, he wrote. Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence.

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said measures were taken to cultivate more lands in parallel to the festival as the area received sufficient rainfall in the recent past.
Abandoned paddy lands will be cultivated from this year. We have planned to cultivate them again with the support of CSD personnel, he said.
We will grow many verities of vegetables and fruits imported to the country. Reasonable prices will be provided for the products while protecting farmers with an insurance cover.
The Minister said post harvest loses stand at Rs.10,500 million annually. We have to reduce this and crop damage caused by animals, he said.
The Minister said dried red chilies are imported from India. The imported dried red chilies contain toxin. We spend around Rs.9,300 million to import dried red chilies and it will be doubled this year as prices have already gone up in India. We will increase taxes on the imports crops and grow them here, he said.
Fertilize prices were increased in the world market but we will not curtail the fertilizer subsidy. The pricr of a metric tonne of fertilizer was increased from US$ 330 to US$ 385 in the world market.
But we will not burden farmers by increasing fertilizer prices. We are educating farmers about how to refrain from using chemical fertilizer and using organic manures, the Minister said.
The UN food and agriculture programme has found that use of fertilizer has increased 30 per cent in low land areas and 50 per cent in upcountry areas. If we do not act by now, there will be a bigger repercussion as our harvest will decrease, the Minister said.

At a time when the Army was functioning as a pioneer of the effort to usher in sustainable development in the country, its close association with civil society was a vital need. It was vital and timely to maintain that link with foresight in order to strengthen public confidence in the Armed Forces.
Lt. Gen.

I request your active contribution to protect the international prestige of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces as a dedicated and sincere fighting force, the Army Commander said.

A league of our own - T20 tournament  adds glamour to Afghan cricket
Sharjah, Thursday: Afghanistan defied decades of conflict to join crickets elite club of Test nations, but now they have added a dash of glamour with their inaugural Twenty20 league in the United Arab Emirates.
Ten years after Indias IPL changed the face of cricket with music, fireworks and cheerleaders, the Afghanistan Premier League has joined the growing list of T20 tournaments worldwide.
The pyrotechnics werent long coming, as 20-year-old Hazratullah Zazais extraordinary six sixes in one over, part of a record-equalling 12-ball half-century, immediately drew attention from around the globe.
Its a very proud moment for the entire nation to have a league of our own which gives our players chance to showcase their talent and rub the shoulders with some foreign stars, Afghanistan Cricket Board chief executive Shafiq Stanikzai told AFP.
Despite its turbulent history, with most players learning cricket in refugee camps in Pakistan, Afghanistan rose to become one of only 12 Test nations earlier this year.
Stanikzai knows the dangers of Afghan cricket more than most: his playing career was flourishing until it was cut short by a Taliban bullet in his right shoulder.
In September last year, a suicide attack outside Kabuls main cricket stadium left three people dead, while eight were killed and several injured in an attack at a cricket match in Jalalabad.
Such conditions made it impossible to hold the APL in Afghanistan, but Stanikzai said: I am sure this league, like in other countries, will further lift standards of our players and our overall cricket.
He added: There were challenges aplenty, they still exist but we have overcome those, received tremendous support from our government, the people of Afghanistan and from the International Cricket Council.
West Indies big-hitter Chris Gayle and Indias Yuvraj Singh are among the headliners, along with New Zealands Brendon McCullum and Shahid Afridi of Pakistan.
But the APL also provides a stage for Afghanistans own stars including Rashid Khan, teenage spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman and all-rounder Mohammad Nabi, who all featured in this years IPL.
Rashid, 20, is the worlds top-ranked bowler for T20 internationals, and this year he became the fastest player to reach 100 ODI wickets, in 44 games.
Now is the time for the youngsters from Afghanistan to come forward and show their ability, like players have done in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Australia, said Rashid.
Rashid took 10 wickets at last months Asia Cup in UAE, making him the joint most successful bowler as Afghanistan upset Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and tied a match with India, the tournaments eventual winners.
The performances suggest that Afghanistan could prove a handful at next years one-day World Cup in England and Wales, after they made their debut in the competition in 2015.
We dont believe in fragmentation, said Stanikzai.
We want to send a message of unity and love and cricket has been a tool through which we send this message. AFP

The government should give special incentives to the garment and fisheries industries to boost exports, UNP backbench MP S.M. Marikkar said, at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.
He proposed the above measures observing that boosting exports is vital to ease the current economic pressures faced by the country.
Curtailing non-essential imports is necessary, but that alone would not help us to come out of the current situation we are in. We need to strengthen our exports sector and we must earn dollars in all possible ways, he said.
We have an import economy. Our export revenue is 20 percent whereas import expenditure is 80 percent. This import economy was created by successive SLFP governments which ruled since 1994. All countries with import economies have faced difficulties, while the countries with export economies have been able to resist the global economic crisis, he said.

When the facility is complete, it will process 50 metric tonnes of garbage per day while also manufacturing organic fertiliser.
An awareness seminar on the matter was recently held at the Dambulla Municipal Councils auditorium, where Mayor Jaliya Opatha said that the garbage accumulation had been on the rise in Matale.

RAW plot: Minister refutes news reports
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinhe refuted media reports that President Maithripla Sirisena had made reference to the involvement of Indian intelligence agency RAW in the alleged plot to kill him and the former defence secretary.
The Minister was speaking at a media conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
He added that the President did not utter a word relating to the alleged plot to assassinate him or accuse RAW in this connection at the recent Cabinet meeting.
Asked why such news appeared in the local and foreign media, the Minister said that it may be a result of certain persons who want to create a clash between Sri Lanka and India.
This can be an action taken purposely by a certain group aiming to create unrest between the two countries. Sri Lanka and India have long been friends and certain persons may want to harm the relationship, the Minister said.
The Minister said that an investigation should be done to ascertain who is behind the spreading of such news. This matter will definitely be discussed at the next Cabinet meeting.
He added that the Cabinet Secretary, Presidents Media Division and the Foreign Affairs Ministry issuing three separate statements have vehemently refuted the news that such a statement was made by the President during the Cabinet meeting. The Minister said at the National Economic Council meeting President paid attention to the non-essential items imported to the country. The President asked for a report on the imports and highlighted the need to increase local production rather than importing.
Speaking on the reorganisation of the SLFP, the Minister said that the report produced by the committee appointed to furnish proposals to reorganise the party was unanimously approved by all members of the Central Committee. According to those proposals there is a suggestion to appoint a politburo in addition to the Central Committee. The President then noted that there should be an amendment to the party constitution to appoint a politburo to the party.

SL should be transshipment hub in Indian Ocean
We should learn from our history centred on Anuradhapura and transform the country into a transhipment hub in the Indian Ocean, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
According to ancient chronicles, the largest ships which arrived in China in ancient times were from Sri Lanka.
The reason why Sri Lanka was able to build such large ships was the economic strength it had gained by serving as a leading trade centre in the world, the Prime Minister said when he participated in the enshrinement of Sacred Relics in an ancient dagoba restored at the Uhana Rajagala archaeological site in Ampara on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said in ancient times, ships from China arrived in Eastern Ports such as Thiriyaya and Gokanna, while ships from Arabia arrived in ports such as Mantota and Chilaw.
Anuradhapura was the hub where all trade was centred. At that time, Sri Lanka traded in cereals, pulses, gems, elephants and tuskers. Goods arriving from China were transshipped to Arabia and Europe. The country had such a strong economy based on this trade that it was able to build historic edifices like Rajagala.
We should go back to that tradition again and build an export economy because it was our heritage. We should try to profit from our heritage and understand the manner in which Sri Lanka became the trading hub of the Indian Ocean, he said.
A book published by the London University recently mentioned Sri Lanka. It had referred to Sri Lanka as a trade, education and religious (Buddhist) hub. A book published by Sahalya Fernando, a former employee of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, too had referred to Sri Lanka as a maritime hub, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said the subject of archaeology came under his wing briefly during the 100-day interim government formed after 2015. At that time, a team led by Ven. Dambara Amila Thera and Mandawala met him and asked for resources to restore Rajagala and he responded by giving the necessary funds because it was of historic significance.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe acknowledged the contribution of the US Embassy and the Central Cultural Fund to the project. The government took the responsibility of the restoration work by utilising these funds, he said.
Counsellor for Public Affairs at the US Embassy in Colombo, David McGuire said he was delighted to have joined the Prime Minister in inaugurating the stupa that has been restored with funding from the US Department of State. Rajagalas heritage is an important reminder of the breadth of the human experience in Sri Lanka, he said.

PCoI on SLA:
TEC made urgent decision on supplier
A Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) appointed by the SriLankan Airlines (SLA) made an urgent decision on selecting a supplier of a Hanger Door to the SLA, it was revealed before the PCoI on SLA yesterday.
The commission came to know that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) had involved in making the final decision on the supplier while there was an independent TEC appointed for the purpose.
The door of the 747 hanger of the airlines was a major requirement to the SLA to regain the EASA certificate on Base Maintenance, which was surrendered in 2017. The surrendering of this internationally recognized certificate limited the heavy aircraft maintenance.
Considering the requirement, the SLA called for Requests for Proposals from bidders. Of the eight proposals presented by three bidders, two by the Penthouse (Pvt.) Ltd. were shortlisted. These proposals were from the Assa Abloy Manufacturing Company from Sweden and the IKS Company from Turkey. The shortlisted companies were mentioned in the second report of the TEC presented on July 10, 2017.
Before the third and the final report of the TEC is issued, Christy Fernando, Manager Properties and Facilities of the SLA, had convened a meeting with the TEC members, CEO, Chief Technical Official (CTO), and the Chief Financial Officer on August 30. At the meeting, the CEO had asked the participants not to delay the process and had also questioned about the previous experience of the IKS Company. On the following day, the CEO had sent an email to several officials pointing out several weaknesses with the IKS including that it had no anti-drop feature certificate.
Ajith Sugathapala, Project and Development Manager of the SLA told the Commission he received two telephone calls from then CTO on August 30 and 31 asking him to provide some details immediately for them to be presented at the Board Meeting to be held on August 31. The Board at this meeting had recommended the proposal by the Assa Abloy Company over the IKSs proposal considering their suitability despite a higher price negotiated by them.
The final report of the TEC came out on September 13, after about two weeks from the board meeting. The witness told that the TEC compiled an additional report citing the justifications to select the Assa Abloy on October 19, after about one month from the final report.
The Commission questioned the witness whether the TEC would be in a position to make an independent decision when there is an involvement by officials such as the CEO and the CTO in making the decision. The witness told that the TEC just followed the guidance they gave.

Among Rock Ruins
Juliet Coombe explores the heady heights of Dambadeniya, Sri Lankas Third Kingdom, dating back 800 years and during a half day climb discovers a fascinating fortified rock fortress with plenty of fascinating things to see.
A waterfall of rain suddenly erupted from a peaceful tropical sunny sky, forcing us to take cover at the kade village snack shop at the foot of the royal rock palace stairway of Dambadeniya, Sri Lankas Third Kingdom, dating back 800 years. The shop was owned by Jayerathphne, who treated us to the traditional, pre-colonial tea called Bellimal (fruit flower), a surprisingly delicious and energising local brew. As the water cascaded, like Niagara falls, locking us inside his shop, we learnt how his father, on preparing the site for their current house at the base of the rock palace, discovered a moonstone covered in copper, or so he thought, and a pot of coins, which had squares cut out of their centres. The grapevine has it that around the area other discoveries have been made including hairpins, earrings and other types of jewellery.
My naturalist guide Hemantha brought with him a passionate local expert Chinthaka, who has been exploring this area since his early teens, to tell us all about this fascinating little known site. He made us laugh as with the biggest twinkle in his eyes he said that the objects found by the surrounding villages might explain how some of the people have suddenly acquired four-wheel drive vehicles! Jayerathphnes father innocently went on to sell the moonstone in the 1930s to a dealer whilst keeping a small section of the metal, which they later made into a lotus flower to donate to the temple. It was then that they discovered from the jewellery maker that the copper was in fact gold and later were told that the moonstone ended up in a British collection.
With these stories in mind, we started to climb the 298 steps of this ancient rock fortress and were incredibly surprised and impressed by how the rampart walls, made of granite blocks, blend with this natural edifice by both protecting against invasion and erosion, and maintaining the status of the king. At a point near the top, the steps are deliberately steep and short to slow you down so that the king could decide whether he wished to have an audience with you or not. It was also a method used to force respect on the people whether in a temple or palace. Take a closer look at the granite steps you are climbing as they are a fascinating insight into an extraordinarily clever method of breaking the vast granite rocks into five foot square lintel-like steps. Imagine the painstaking process of using a square, hollow, and probably easily blunted, chisel or punch to chip out one inch square holes an inch apart into the parent rock, then filled with a specific dry wood, which when water was added made the wood swell and split the brittle granite.
Three quarters of the way up we come to the palace ruins, built on a flat area with the most amazing views of the surrounding countryside, neighbouring vast rocks, paddy fields and coconut plantations for as far as the eye can see. Dont forget to place another stick for good luck, alongside all the other visitors sticks that look like an amusing attempt to stop the giant rock rolling over in its sleep. It was here an incredible clay map of the country was found in the 1970s excavations and sent, along with other valuable artifacts, to the Colombo museum.
Climbing to the top, we reach a stunning lookout point that once supported a watchtower, with incredible 360-degree views of the surrounding countryside. Look across to the west and you will see Dambadeniyas sister rock where the kings architect was incarcerated, to prevent him from escaping to other lands with knowledge of the palace and secret tunnels that might enable an enemy to overcome the kingdom. Chinthaka explains, If you abseil over the lookout point half way down this shear face you will find a large tunnel entrance, big enough for an elephant, This might have been a platform that one of the four kings, perhaps Parakramabahu, might have addressed the masses below. From the watchtower you can also see, on a clear day, Adams Peak to the north, Kurunegala to the south-west and Kegalle to the east. Chinthaka points out a tree, in the middle distance, explaining that the visible white flowers, which must be huge close up, are from the Thallanala tree that flowers only once in its lifetime, attracting huge numbers of bees, after which it promptly dies.
With this in mind we carefully start our descent, passing a water reservoir probably for royal bathing, hewn out of the rock, which you can see once had a wall across it that tied neatly into each end of the rock. Further down we observed excavations activity and saw how ancient small red grooved tiles that had been exposed, had been beautifully stacked into the shape of a stupa. Then, over to one side we came upon a wavy ornamental garden wall that overlooked a huge pool, probably secluded away for the royal family as well as maybe being a water reservoir for the community. Then the last of the ruins, the assembly house on a prominent outcropping rock with stairs hewn into it, affords a slightly closer look at the plantations and paddy fields below.
Everywhere was evidence of natures beauty and power to reclaim. Butterflies, with six-inch velvet wings and amazing purple spots the size of pennies, flit around us, occasionally alighting to see if the colours of our clothes promise any sustenance while twisting trees attempt to swallow rocks whole with their root systems and drape vines the size of my wrist along the paths, and yet others cover stones with a mass of maggoty roots while their neighbours grow in and out of each other or die, to be consumed by anthills, in this once diverse and manicured forest around the rock; home also to many songs and sounds from diverse birds such as hill swallows, blue-faced Malcohas, grey hornbills and rosewing parrots.
As I take one last look at another tunnel entrance now collapsed and then across the flat land to the jailhouse rock, I remember the story of how the architects wife smuggled his tools to him in his lunch packets so that he could carve out steps to escape. When you look at the rock you can see the steps coming down the face only to stop suddenly and this is where his wife arranged a crash mat of paddy straw for him to drop quietly onto in the dead of night on pain of death. I wonder if, like the ancient Egyptians, the secret of the tunnels must be kept at all cost and this is the price you pay for being the Kings architect. What divine justice, then, that he should escape with his wife in such a fashion.

BMW to take control  of China venture  Brilliance Automotive
Carmaking giant BMW wants to take control of its joint venture in China and is set to pump billions more into its production capacity in the country.
The German firm will spend 3.6bn ($4.16bn; 3.14bn) to up its stake in Brilliance Automotive from 50% to 75%.
The Mini maker will also invest more than 3bn to expand its existing production capacity in China.
The move comes amid Chinas plans to relax rules for foreign car companies operating in its enormous market.
Currently, foreign firms that want to make cars in China must have a joint venture with a local firm, but they are not permitted to own more than a 50% stake in that firm.
This rule has been in place since 1994 and has left many foreign firms frustrated. It has also restricted big global brands from gaining full access to the worlds biggest car market.
BMW said the deal with Brilliance Automotive, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, would not close until 2022. That is when the 50:50 joint venture requirement for car manufacturing in China ends.
The total yearly production capacity of the BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) plants [in China] will be gradually increased to more than 650,000 units in total from the early 2020s, BMWs chairman Harald Krger said in a speech on Wednesday in China.
He said BBA was the cornerstone of BMWs ongoing success in China - its largest single market - and that with the increased investment the German firm wanted to make, it would be able to produce up to 100% electric vehicles.
The Chinese government has said it wants 20% of cars sold to be electric or rechargeable-hybrid vehicles by 2025.
In February, BMW said it would build electric-powered Mini cars in China with another firm, Great Wall Motor. Cars made under than partnership are aimed at the Chinese market.
Brilliance China Automotive Holdings are the whole owners of BMW Brilliance Automotive. (Daily Sun)

Instagram isnt short of stunning pictures; whether its travel, food, or just really attractive people having fun.
People also love showing off what books theyre reading, but perhaps no one is as enthusiastic about reading than bookworm Elizabeth Sagan. She has over thousands of books and creates stunning pictures with them, posing as some of the characters and worlds shes reading about.
Her 90,000-strong followers tune in to see what creations she makes on her account as her ideas have become more complex and intricate over the years. Elizabeth is also best friends with James Trevino who has also become an Instagram sensation thanks to his artwork created out of his favourite books. When it comes to creating their bookstagram the pair help each other assemble the books and take the photographs. Elizabeth tells Metro.co.uk that some of the books are borrowed from James and donated by people such as her dad.
I have so many that after giving away 28 bags of 10 kg each I can barely see the difference, she says.
I have no idea how many exactly there are, but Im sure there are thousands. And if you count the ebooks too, the numbers are even bigger. But not all of them are my cup of tea  in my collection you can find a lot of old science textbooks or other books that are outdated, for example, old computer science books thanks to my father. Ive not read even half, they are so many! But Im reading as much as I can.
"A picture can take from half an hour (the fortunate case) to a few hours (the unfortunate case) to create. After that comes the editing, which can also take from 15 minutes (the fortunate case) to more than an hour (the unfortunate case).
The good part is that Im taking my pics in batches, and a batch usually translates to 16 to 20 pics that last for a month or so.

Then the Cambrians were confined to cricket and cadeting. There was no possibility for the other games to function at college. In 1957 when a Hockey Player C Jayasooriya of Matale joined the College Staff and Rodrego commenced Hockey with the help of Jayasooriya.
Unfortunately Jayasooriya was transferred in 1959 to another school and Rodrigo went on retirement in 1959. When H L B Gomes was at the helm of the school, Hockey was re-started again in 1990 and from there the game of Hockey blossomed at College.
President's College, Maharagama are also having a name in cricket and they also started hockey at their school. The present Principal Wasantha Kumara is extending his fullest support to this game with the help of the Master in Charge W D Nelson and the Coach C K Rupasinghe. The past hockey players of the school have formed a Hockey Association and they are the live wire of Hockey at school.

## Title: Cat Care: Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, October 19, 2018 - 01:00
Cat Care: Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
This is a common cat disease often misdiagnosed by veterinarians. Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial infection occurred. Although the virus is slow-acting, a cats immune system is severely weakened once the disease takes hold. This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats receiving supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free, indoor environment can live relatively comfortable lives for months to years before the disease reaches its chronic stages.
Clinical signs
An FIV-infected cat may not show any symptoms for years. Once symptoms do develop, however, they may continually progress or a cat may show signs of sickness interspersed with health for years. If your cat is demonstrating any of the following symptoms, please have examined by your veterinarian. They are enlarged lymph nodes, fever, anemia, weight loss, disheveled coat, poor appetite, diarrhea, abnormal appearance or inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis), inflammation of the gums (gingivitis), inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis), dental disease, skin redness or hair loss, wounds that dont heal, sneezing, discharge from eyes or nose, frequent urination, straining to urinate or urinating outside of litter box and behavior change.
FIV Transmission
FIV is mainly passed from cat to cat through deep bite wounds, the kind that usually occur outdoors during aggressive fights and territorial disputes a perfect reason to keep your cat inside.
Another, less common mode of transmission is from an FIV infected mother cat to her kitten. FIV does not seem to be commonly spread through sharing food bowls and litter boxes, social grooming, sneezing and other casual modes of contact.
Although any feline is susceptible, free-roaming, outdoor intact male cats who fight most frequently contract the disease. Cats who live indoors are the least likely to be infected. Please note: FIV cannot be transmitted from cat to human, only from cat to cat.
Preventing FIV
The best way to prevent your cat from contracting the virus is to keep him indoors, avoiding any chance of contact with infected felines. If you walk your cat, keep him on a leash when outdoors.
If your cat is going to be spending any time in a cattery or in a home with other felines, make sure all cats have tested negative for FIV. Any recently adopted cat should be tested for FIV prior to entering your home. You may also want to speak to your veterinarian about the FIV vaccine and if it is appropriate for your cat.
When to Consult Your Veterinarian
If you suspect your cat has FIV, have him examined and tested by your veterinarian right away. During your visit, be ready to describe any symptoms that you have detected, no matter how minute they seem. Also make sure to keep your cat indoors, away from other felines who might possibly be infected or whom he could infect, until you have a diagnosis.
Without proper treatment, the secondary infections that can occur as a consequence of FIV can progress to life-threatening conditions. Additionally, cats with FIV can develop various forms of cancer, blood diseases or kidney failure, which will ultimately claim the cats life.
Diagnosing FIV
FIV infection is routinely diagnosed by blood testing. The FIV status of every cat should be known. The most common type of test looks for the presence of antibodies to the virus in the blood. No test is 100% accurate all of the time, and your veterinarian will interpret the test result and determine whether further testing is needed to confirm either a positive or negative test result. Once a cat is determined to be FIV-positive, that cat is capable of transmitting the disease to other cats.
Since it is possible for an infected mother cat to transfer FIV antibodies to her kittens, these kittens may test positive from their mothers antibodies until they have cleared them from their systems, which happens by six months of age. Kittens who test positive for FIV antibodies when theyre younger than six months should undergo antibody tests again at a later date to see if they are infected.
FIV Treatment
Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral treatment for FIV. Cats can carry the virus for a long time before symptoms appear. Therefore, treatment focuses mainly on extending the asymptomatic period or, if symptoms have set in, on easing the secondary effects of the virus. Your veterinarian may prescribe some of the following treatments:
Medication for secondary infections
Healthy, palatable diet to encourage good nutrition, fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, immune-enhancing drugs, parasite control are very essential for an infected cat.
Caring for an FIV-Infected Cat
Keep your cat indoors. This will protect him from contact with disease-causing agents to which he may be susceptible. By bringing your cat indoors, youre also protecting the uninfected cats in your community. Watch for changes even seemingly minor in your cats health and behavior. Immediately report any health concerns to your vet. Bring your cat to your vet at least twice per year for a wellness checkup, blood count and urine analysis. Feed your cat nutritionally balanced food no raw food diets, please, as bacteria and parasites in uncooked meat and eggs can be dangerous to immune compromised pets. Be sure your cat is spayed or neutered in order to reduce fighting. (Continue with Cat Care  5 Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV))

Citizens' Mail
How NM handled strike situations
Strikes are of different actions. There is the token strike, the politically motivated strike, religiously provoked strike, community aimed strike, the genuine strike and the like. Amongst all the strikes there is the sudden wild strike of the private buses which should be condemned totally. The genuine strike should have reasonable remands and could organise it in the event all discussions have failed. Such a genuine strike should be arranged in a manner that will not push the people into great difficulties.
As of a private bus strike, if a bus crew is slapped by a passenger for the formers aggressive behaviour or a policeman charges for his reckless driving or if the public thrash him or some other trivial reason the most despicable strike is promptly done. Thereby, the people undergoing inconvenience and hardship cannot be put in black and white.
There is a remedy for this deplorable situation for which following is my suggestion.
1. Let them launch a strike and seek the support of the other bus crew too if necessary.
2. If the strike is not reasonable the government need not care it.
3. The government should put out all the state buses, especially concentrating on the required areas.
4. One hour grace period should be given to the state employees both for their arrival and departure to their workplaces. The private sector should be requested to follow suit.
5. If these things are done, they will drop their strike and return to work.
6. Because the financial burden of the family is there, then the paying of finance for the bus is there and of other commitments as well.
We have seen how loaded buses are stopped just to pick up a passenger while speeding too to have added 10 or 15 rupees. When such is the greed for money how could the crew keep off from their services They will also lose their playing out from the bus owners exact earnings.
The late Dr. N. M. Perera, while he was a union leader, forwarded 21 demands to the then UNP government and staged several unsuccessful strikes. Amongst those 21 demands, many appeared to be quite unreasonable which were matters relating to salaries.
The government, therefore, did not respond to their demands and the hope of the working class was lost. However, when the jumbled ULF government was formed in the 1970s the Union Leader (NM) became the Minister of Finance having a golden opportunity of handling one of the powerful ministries. The anticipation of the working class once again boomed with greater satisfaction and hope that their leader turned Minister would heal their wounds.
But what happened was history. He not only refused the demands but also did order the kicking out of strikers from their workplaces. Even those who worked in banks, which were under his portfolios, were also surprisingly dismissed. This lesson was picked up by President JR and he did it to the July strikers.
Lastly, the recent railway strike has given a nasty experience to its commuters. Therefore, the government should train either locally or abroad members of the security forces to drive trains, handle the control room and other relevant sections to confront sudden inhuman strikes.

Contempt of court action against Dr. Padeniya fixed for inquiry
The contempt of court case filed against Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement delivered regarding the SAITM issue was yesterday fixed for inquiry.
Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara fixed the matter for inquiry on February 22 next year.
On December 6, 2017, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Dr. Padeniya.
The Court of Appeal had observed that there are sufficient materials to issue a rule against Dr. Padeniya in respect of a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements. On a previous occasion, a charge sheet was served on Dr. Padeniya by the Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the courts judgement dated January 31, 2017, which compelled the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
However, Dr. Padeniya through his lawyers had informed the Court of Appeal that he was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the court stenographer.
The Court of Appeal had also issued an Interim Order (IO) preventing the GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements or articles scandalising the court until the final determination of this contempt of court action.
Two civil society activists, National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) Convenor Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya and Puravesi Balaya Social Movement Co-convenor Gamini Viyangoda had filed this contempt of court action naming GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgement by the Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticised the judgement demanding annulment or setting aside of the judgement.
The petitioners said against this backdrop, the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following the court decision ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017, the GMOA had organised islandwide trade union action against SAITM, halting all health services including private practice and private health services to force the government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice, especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several media and has been uttered by the respondent at a public meeting held under topic Abolish SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged with the offence of contempt of the Court of Appeal under Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing the GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements or articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge imposition of a sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appeared for the petitioners. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the respondent.

THE BODY SHOP AND CRUELTY FREE INTERNATIONAL BRING A RECORD-BREAKING 8.3 MILLION SIGNATURES TO THE UNITED NATIONS
Detemined to end cosmetic animal testing globally
On October 4, World Animal Day, The Body Shop and Cruelty Free International brought 8.3 million signatures against cosmetic animal testing to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City to create a global framework to end animal testing while advancing the United Nations sustainable development agenda.
The celebration of these signatures is a culmination of more than 30 years of advocacy between The Body Shop, the first international beauty brand to campaign against animal testing in cosmetics, and its long-time campaign partner Cruelty Free International, the first global, non-profit organization dedicated to ending cosmetic product and ingredient testing on animals. The joint effort is the most ambitious campaign ever against cosmetic animal testing and serves as a model to inspire action from businesses, governments and citizens to advance Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG12): Responsible Consumption and Production and other key responsible production and consumption issues. Lise Kingo, Executive Director of the UN Global Compact, joined The Body Shop at the UN to discuss how businesses can do more to engage and mobilise consumers in support of the SDGs.
The petition signatures, collected from supporters around the world in just 15 months, call on the countries of the UN to formalize an international framework to end cosmetic animal testing, everywhere and forever.
Cosmetic animal testing is cruel, old-fashioned, expensive and inefficient. Today, there are more reliable alternatives. The Body Shop and many other cruelty-free companies use innovative and effective cruelty-free ingredients in all their products, all tested through innovative non-animal methods.
Although there has been sizable progress, including the European Union prohibiting all cosmetic animal testing in 2013 as well as the sale of products tested elsewhere, 80 percent of countries still have not made it illegal to test cosmetics on animals. Cruelty Free International estimates that more than 500,000 animals each year are used in cosmetics testing.
A global framework is the only way to eliminate animal suffering and create a level playing field around the world.
Harmonizing safety testing requirements globally would allow companies to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and test duplication when accessing international markets to fill the consumer demand for safe and humane cosmetics. Not only would a global framework give confidence to companies that they are producing safe and effective cosmetics while meeting consumer demand for truly cruelty-free products, but also, the global framework would align with the United Nations vision of a world in which, humanity lives in harmony with nature and in which wildlife and other species are protected.
In just 15 months more than 8 million people signed their names in recognition that cosmetic animal testing is outdated, cruel and unnecessary, said David Boynton, CEO of The Body Shop. We are determined to finish what Dame Anita Roddick, our founder, started back in 1989, and today we are hosting a special event at the United Nations to call for collaboration among the cosmetic industry, civil society and governments finally to end cosmetic animal testing everywhere.
Together with the activist spirit of our store teams and customers around the world, we have reached more consumers with this campaign than we ever have before. said Jessie Macneil-Brown, Global Head of Activism at The Body Shop. The support of so many people around the world demonstrates that corporate activism can make a positive impact on a global scale.
People are misinformed about cosmetic animal testing, said Michelle Thew, CEO of Cruelty Free International. The Forever Against Animal Testing petition demonstrates that across the globe, people want this cruel practice to end. A global framework is the only way to truly eliminate animal suffering.
This initiative shows the potential for brands to engage and mobilise consumers at scale in support of the SDGs, and how, by combining business innovation, enabling policies and consumer power, real change can be achieved. The SDGs are everybodys business and we look forward to working with The Body Shop to build and share industry knowledge and insights on how to harness consumers and drive collective action in support of more responsible production and consumption patterns, said Lise Kingo, CEO and Executive Director of the UN Global Compact.
The Body Shop India made definitive progress towards FAAT, advancing the United Nations vision of a world where humanity lives in harmony with nature. The brand has received tremendous response from across the world with maximum signatures from UK, followed by Canada and third from India. Infact India produced maximum support in Asia by garnering maximum number of signatures in Asia towards supporting the cause. Actress, Philanthropist and Brand Ambassador, The Body Shop India, Jacqueline Fernandez, was also present along with the global team and spoke at United Nations, where the signature campaign was submitted. She said, Its been a most fulfilling journey being associated with The Body Shop as the Brand Ambassador for India for the last five years and champion Cruelty free, 100% vegetarian beauty. I personally believe that real beauty cannot be achieved at the cost of harming anyone, especially animals. The concept of animal testing for cosmetics and its ingredients is outdated, cruel and unnecessary and should be banned forever. A socially responsible world cannot continue testing measures that prove hazardous to anyones health. Today, as we stand vindicated, proud that the campaign has touched a chord with so many across the world, inspired & ignited men & women, customers and fans, young & old, believers and cynics; it is time to take this to its logical conclusion. Its time to ban Animal Testing Forever and everywhere.
Consumers can get involved with the campaign by joining the online rally at-

Dialog first to launch Voice  over WiFi calling in Sri Lanka
Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider, launched Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWiFi or WiFi Calling) service, that will enable users to make callsusing a Wi-Fi network. The first to launch the technology in Sri Lanka, Dialog, will enable subscribers with VoWiFi supported handsets to connect to a Wi-Fi network, and make or receive calls from mobile numbers and landlines at standard local call rates.
The VoWiFi service does not require any third-party app to be installed and the recipient of the call will receive it as a standard incoming call unlike Over-The-Top (OTT) apps (WhatsApp, Viber, Skype and IMO) where the recipient requires the same app to be installed and to be connected to the internet.
All customers with a VoWiFi /WiFI Calling enabled smartphone can now take advantage of the technology. Currently, the Huawei P20 Pro, P20, P20 Lite, Nova 3 and Nova 3i support the technology, whilst the service will be extended to other VoWiFi supported handsets including Apple and Samsung in the near future.
Pradeep De Almeida, Group Chief Technology Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC said, Dialog is committed to delivering the latest in technology and connectivity to all Sri Lankans, and VoWiFi is another key step in offering next generation solutions to our customers.
We started this journey by enhancing the infrastructure in our network and migrating to a new state-of-the-art core network. For our customers, this means a better experience through greater agility and flexibility.

Divron Bioventures Recognised for  Contribution to Inland Fisheries, Aquaculture
The nations leading seafood exporter, Divron Bioventures (Pvt.) Ltd. was honoured for its significant contribution towards developing and uplifting Sri Lankas inland fisheries and aquaculture sector recently.
The company received this award from President Maithripala Sirisena of Sri Lanka at the MiridiyaVaruna 2018 awards ceremony organised by the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka. The ceremony was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in early October.
The award recognises the companys commitment to develop and grow export markets for sustainable seafood from Sri Lanka characterised by its exceptional quality and high value.
Receiving the award on behalf of the organization were Dr. Tim Dejager and Shan Meemanage, Directors, Divron Bioventures. Gracing the occasion was Minister VijithVijayamuni De Zoysa, Minister, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, Dileepa Wedaarachchi, State Minister, Ameer Ali, Deputy Minister, Nuwan Prasanna Madavanarachchi, Chairman, National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA), Nimal Chandrarathne, Director General and other officials of NAQDA.
Divron was founded in 2015 with local and international expertise by Lankan Shan Meemanage and Canadian-Belgium Dr. Tim DeJager, who together have a cumulative four decades of experience in aquaculture, live and fresh fish and shellfish sales, and in research and development.
Today Divron is based in Pamunugama, and has a strong team of over 50 employees in breeding, grow-out, logistics, packing, and marketing.
Built in Sri Lanka, Divrons successful value chain involves direct participation and benefit to thousands of inland fishers who manage and harvest giant freshwater prawns (scampi) and other fish from the countrys inland reservoirs.
The company understands the importance of these reservoirs, and the fisher communities whose livelihoods depend on them, as an important resource for the future growth of aquaculture and fisheries in Sri Lanka.
As its future roadmap, Divron intends to extend this model of development to coastal fisheries and aquaculture utilising lagoons and coastal areas for sustainable production and harvesting of additional products such as crabs, oysters, clams and other crustaceans.
Additionally Divron has also developed a value chain model that has enhanced the capacity of rural communities and integrated it together towards the commercial and technical advancement of sustainable aquaculture.
Collaborating with NAQDA through a Public-Private Memorandum of Understanding, Divron receives the services of the institution and its extension officers in facilitating the development of the value chain.
The development potential of Divrons value chain model has also been recognised by the Australian Government who has supported further enhancements through a contribution from its Market Development Facility programme through Australian aid.

Dominant Pakistan close on series victory over Australia
Abu Dhabi, Thursday: Pakistan grabbed an early wicket after Babar Azam struck a fluent 99 to edge closer to claiming a series victory over Australia in the second Test at Abu Dhabi on Thursday.
Azam narrowly missed out on a hundred after an aggressive innings, while skipper Sarfraz Ahmed followed up his first-innings 94 with 81 as Pakistan declared their second innings at 400-9, setting a daunting 538-run target for the tourists.
By the close on the third day, Pakistan had Shaun Marsh dismissed for four -- bowled by left-arm paceman Mir Hamza for his first Test wicket -- to boost their chances of victory after Australia clung on for a thrilling draw in the first Test in Dubai last week.
Aaron Finch (24) and Travis Head (17) were at the crease with Australia, who are 47-1 and need another 491 for an unlikely win or to bat out two full days on a weary and spinning Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch.
No team has ever chased more than 418-7 to win a Test, made by the West Indies against Australia at Antigua in 2003.
Pakistan piled on the runs with Azam, Sarfraz and Azhar Ali -- who was the casualty of a bizarre run out -- all making half-centuries to build on the hosts 137-run first-innings lead.
But none of them could go on to score a ton, with Azam falling agonisingly close to his maiden hundred, trapped leg-before by medium pacer Mitchell Marsh.
Azam, who hit three sixes and six fours, improved on his previous best Test score of 90 not out he made in New Zealand two years ago.
He and Sarfraz added 135 runs for the sixth wicket to end any hopes Australia had of a fightback after taking the second new ball at 273-5.
Sarfaz struck five fours and a six and delayed the declaration in hope of a century, but fell leg-before to leg-spinner Marnus Labuschagne who finished with 2-74.
But the pick of the bowlers was off-spinner Nathan Lyon who followed his first-innings four wickets with 3-135 in a marathon 43-over vigil.
After a dull opening period, the embarrassing dismissal of Azhar brought the day to life. The batsman edged a Peter Siddle delivery towards the third-man boundary and, thinking the ball had crossed the rope, halted in the middle of the pitch to talk to fellow batsman Asad Shafiq.
But Mitchell Starc picked up the ball less than a yard from the boundary and threw it back to wicketkeeper Tim Paine, who ran Azhar out, leaving the Pakistani duo -- who have combined experience of 130 Tests and over 9,000 runs -- stranded and looking bewildered.
Azhar fell for a well-played 64, including four boundaries. Pakistan had earlier lost Haris Sohail for 17, stumped by Paine off Nathan Lyon after resuming at 144-2.
The teams will play three Twenty20 internationals after the Tests, with the first in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. AFP

Early warning systems a must to achieve zero hunger
Sri Lanka is one of the signatories of the UN mandate on Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture is the second sustainable development goal.
Working for zero hunger and achieving this goal was the theme of World Food Day 2018. Wasting less, eating better and adopting a sustainable lifestyle are key aspects in building a world free of hunger. Simple actions of achieving this goal are reducing food waste, producing more through productive ways, adopting healthier and sustainable diets and working together through partnerships.
Sri Lanka has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the past decade. The national poverty headcount ratio (HCR) declined from 22.7 percent in 2002 to 4.1 percent in 2016, with the majority of districts in the country showing a substantial decline in their poverty levels. The country also achieved the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1 target of halving the poverty level, well before 2015.
However, malnutrition is an issue in Sri Lanka; 17 percent of children under the age of five are stunted, 15 percent are wasted, and 21 percent are underweight and in districts like Nuwara Eliya, 29.6 percent are underweight.
The domestic agriculture sector in Sri Lanka is characterised by small-scale farming. Agricultural productivity suffers severe losses because of high temperature, severe drought, flooding, the rising sea level and soil degradation. This article describes the importance of food security information and early warning systems to ensure food security in the country.
Present situation of food security
Agriculture plays a central and strategic role in Sri Lankas development. Today, 27.1 percent of the labour force in the country is engaged in the agricultural sector. Indeed, it is the key to economic growth, increased incomes, improved living standards, poverty eradication, and enhanced food security. In fact, most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have direct or indirect linkages to the agricultural sector in the country. The goal number two is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The theme of World Food Day which fell on October 16 was Our actions are our future. A zero hunger world by 2030 is possible.
The ratio of expenditure on food and drink to total expenditure is called the food ratio. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of the Census and Statistics Department (DCS) 2012/13, the average food ratio is 38 percent and this means an average household in Sri Lanka spends 38 percent for food of the total monthly expenditure.
When considering food ratio by sector, in the estate sector it is the highest  at 49.8 percent, in the rural sector  39.2 percent, and in the urban sector  32.1 percent. This implies that a household in the estate sector spends nearly 50 percent of its expenditure on food.
The climate changed rapidly and the country faced extreme weather frequently during the last few years than ever before. In 2014, both Maha and Yala seasons were affected by severe drought which prevailed throughout the year. Thereafter, 2015 was a very satisfactory cropping year and both seasons performed well and the highest ever paddy production of 4.8 million MT was recorded and a bumper harvest reached the markets.
However, once again, at the beginning of the 2015/16 Maha season, flood damage was recorded. The 2016 Yala season also was not quite satisfactory due to the floods which prevailed at the beginning of the season.
In 2017, the drought took its toll during both Maha and Yala seasons. In the recent past, the lowest paddy production of 2.5 Million MT was recorded in 2017. The production of most other food crops also declined sharply. The delay and insufficient monsoon rains severely affected paddy and other field crop cultivations in most of the major producing areas in the country in both seasons in 2017. As a result, domestic prices of essential food commodities, especially rice, increased rapidly in the market.
The price behaviour of most food commodities in 2017 was volatile and reflected an increasing trend throughout the year. The weekly rice price behaviour of nadu Grade II rice (parboiled long grain white) is shown in Figure 1. The price of local nadu rice in the last week of September increased by 33 percent and 43 percent compared to the same period in 2016 and 2015 respectively.
The rate of food inflation calculated by the DCS (Year to Year) recorded in January 2017 was 4.5 and reached 10.4 in September and this was mainly due to the price pressure from rice, coconut, vegetables and onions. In 2017, to stabilise increasing food prices, the government intervened in various ways like promoting imports, import tax reductions, introducing food price ceilings, releasing government stocks to the markets and distributing food items at subsidised prices through government trading institutes like the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment. However, in 2018, food production was moderately satisfactory and food inflation has at present reduced.
Impacts on food security
The above situation affects the four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation and food system stability. Effects have already been felt in food markets, and are likely to be particularly significant in specific rural locations where crops fail and yields decline and in urban locations where supply chains are disrupted and market prices increase. The most vulnerable in this situation are low-income consumers and small- scale farmers.
Importance of food security information
The availability of reliable data, statistics and information related to the four dimensions of food security and the adequate capacity to analyse the available information and good communication skills to inform decision-makers are the major determinants of food and nutritional security in a country.
The data and information related to food availability include domestic production, import capacity, food stocks and food aid. The domestic production data comprises the cultivated land extent of major crops in each cropping season at the divisional secretarys (DS) level, crop damages, average yield, total production, marketable surplus, major surplus and deficit areas. This needs an efficient data collection and a monitoring system at village level, especially as the calculation of food surplus or deficit depends on such data.
Next, data on domestic and commercial stocks by District or DS level and government buffer stocks are important. Domestic stocks available with farmers and commercial stocks available with major manufacturers like rice millers and traders by district level need to be monitored frequently. Another is availability of imported stocks and food aid given by various local and international agencies at provincial or district level.
Food access refers to the way in which different people obtain available food. Normally, food is accessed through a combination of home production, stocks, purchase, barter, borrowing, sharing, gifts from relatives, and provisions by welfare systems or food aid. Food access is ensured when communities and households and all individuals within them have adequate resources, such as the money to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet. Access mainly depends on income available to the household and the price of food.
Market prices reflect the supplydemand situation of food commodities and therefore, accurate prices are the most important. Market margins and value chain analysis of food commodities are other related types of information. The Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI) is a well-known organisation for collection and dissemination of food commodity prices in all major markets in the country.
HARTI provides a detailed description of weekly commodity price behaviour in the country and disseminate daily vegetable prices in all dedicated economic centres through a mobile service provider, Mobitel, on the hotline 6666 as a publicprivate partnership. Such price information is valuable for farmers for increasing their bargaining power with traders and also finding better markets.
In this process, there is also a need to monitor the commodity prices by divisional secretariat level mainly to identify the food security situation in isolated rural areas like estate areas especially during food shortage periods. Therefore, the collection, monitoring, analysing and presenting of food prices at the grassroots is an essential part of food security. This information is helpful in predicting the situation, to identify vulnerable areas, and to plan intervention programmes.
Stability of supply and access: this explains the variation of weather during the main seasons, commodity price fluctuations, and economic and political factors which lead to stability of supply and access to food.
Weather-related data are an important part and that valuable primary information is entirely collected by the Meteorological Department of Sri Lanka. Commodity price data is mainly collected by the Census and Statistics Department, HARTI and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka
Food utilisation mainly consists of food safety, hygiene and manufacturing practices applied in primary agricultural production, harvesting and storage, food processing, transportation, and retail. Diet quality and diversity, meeting needs in terms of energy, macro- and micronutrients are the major concerns in food utilisation. In this category, post-harvest losses, practices of all actors from farmers to retail in food supply chains, and factors contributing to quality deterioration are important. Food nutrition data are an integral part of food security and such data should be collected through research and demographic health and household surveys. This type of data and information is compiled by the Health Ministry, Medical Research Institute, DCS and universities.
When considering our country, many actors hold information about the food and nutrition security situation. The integration of those actors and holistic approaches through this information need to be strengthened. Therefore, now is the most suitable time to establish a common framework to ensure coherence.
Common framework
A common framework will be helpful to identify information gaps, areas of repetition, to make predictions through the analysis of weather, production, consumption, prices and income-related data, and to issue early warnings. Furthermore, a broad variety of methods and tools for food security and nutrition monitoring and analysis should be better harmonised for greater efficiency.
The scope of a common and harmonised framework of information for food and nutrition security necessitates ensuring that high quality data and availability of statistics and information is easily accessible across sectors for monitoring and analysis of the food security and nutrition situation.
A common and harmonised framework also necessitates ensuring that available food and nutrition security data, statistics, and information are well-analysed to meet the needs of a variety of decision-makers in a timely and credible manner for policy formulation and investment decisions aimed at hunger eradication and towards strengthening institutional structures for easy exchange and coordination of information for consensus building and harmonised approaches.
This type of integration is really helpful to policymakers to cope successfully during disasters and long-term planning. Therefore, establishment of a fully integrated food security information and early warning centre will ensure food security in the country.

Experts discuss transformation faces in retail sector
Abheek Singhi -Senior Partner and Director at Boston Consulting Group, stressed that retail sector in order to stay relevant and to successfully face emerging trends in the retail space has to come up with different set of capabilities especially investing money in activities relating to digitization process.
In the future, retail sector will be more digital and much of the growth of the retail sector will be coming from countries in the Eastern world, he told the Sri Lanka Retail Forum 2018 under the theme Towards a Dynamic and Evolving Retail Sector in Colombo yesterday.
He also noted that existing retailers will need to reinvest themselves to cater to the diverse requirements of people.
According to him, act of buying commodities will become less of a chore. Players like Amazon and subscription businesses will make this part of retail easier.
Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera- Managing Director, Stax INC speaking at the event said modern consumers are placing a lot more value on experiences over physical items or commodities.
As many consumers embrace instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Messenger, we can expect retailers to use these platforms to talk to customers and streamline communication, he said.
He said majority of Sri Lankan based companies revenues come from our 20 million people. Our forefathers havent really invested in going out of Sri Lanka. In 10-15 years time, we really hope that 60% of revenues of Sri Lankan companies would come outside Sri Lanka.
Today, data and technology barriers have come down, he said adding that all players in the Sri Lankan retail sector should think hard and take truly Sri Lankan made brands and products to overseas markets.
Thats the only way Sri Lanka can grow, he said.
Sandra De Zoysa -Group Chief Customer Officer, Dialog Axiata speaking at the event said Sri Lanka is at a very interesting point as far as retail industry is concerned and local retailers need to come up with innovative initiatives to stay relevant in the market and to offer customers a value added and customer centric products to enrich consumers lives.
She also noted that retailers need to understand how to leverage on data to enhance the customer experience by mapping out the value chains and indentifying business strategies to influence behavior. Teeradet Dumrongbhalasitr -Senior Director at Dunnhumby also said that Sri Lanka has the potential to become a leading player in the retail space.
To this end, Sri Lanka needs to adopt measures to get it basic economic fundamentals right, she said.

Facebooks #SheMeansBusiness  partners #Suhuruliya
Jaffna recently saw Facebook teaming up with the #Suhuruliya initiative to promote economic empowerment of women in Sri Lanka. As part of this partnership, Facebooks globally renowned #SheMeansBusiness programme will partner with the #Suhuruliya programme to train rural Sri Lankan women in digital skills and promote entrepreneurial activities in the island nation. The #Suhuruliya programme, under the aegis of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MCWA), seeks to create economic opportunities for women through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The ICTA is incorporating #Suhuruliya in its Smart Social Circles, a national programme for empowering citizens through ICT. As part of this partnership, Facebooks #SheMeansBusiness programme will train Women Development Officers from the MCWA, who will subsequently function as trainers, as well as women entrepreneurs.
In a ceremony marking the launch of this initiative, 10 women and knowledge agents from Smart Social Circles from the Jaffna region were felicitated. The days events also included a #SheMeansBusiness workshop attended by over 500 participants. The participants also went through an #Online Safety workshop to help them safely navigate the online economy. Both workshops were presented in Tamil.
We are committed to capacity building in ICT to deliver economic growth throughout Sri Lanka. Suhuruliya is a key element in our plans to introduce Sri Lankan women to entrepreneurship and this partnership with Facebook will greatly help in taking digital skills to rural Sri Lankan women entrepreneurs, said Prof. Rohan Samarajiva, Chairman, ICTA.
Its only when women participate in economies, do nations grow. For women in Sri Lanka, as elsewhere, its important to be a part of the digital economy as thats where the future points to.

Fitch Affirms Standard Chartered Bank,  SL at AAA(lka); Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka Branchs (SCBSL) National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
SCBSLs rating is at the highest end on the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka and reflects the credit profile and financial strength of its head office - Standard Chartered Bank (SCB: A+/Stable/a). It also reflects Fitchs expectation of continued strong parental support, if required, as SCBSL is a branch of SCB and forms part of the same legal entity. The relatively small size of the branch (less than 0.2% of the total assets of SCB) implies that support, if needed, would not be material to the head office.
SCBs Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is higher than Sri Lankas Long-Term Local- and Foreign-Currency IDRs of B+/Stable and as a result SCBSLs rating on the National Rating scale is mapped to AAA(lka).

Fuel pricing formula released
The government released the much awaited pricing formula system of auto fuels at the Finance Ministry yesterday.
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the formula pricing system of Auto Fuels was MRP = V1 + V2 + V3+ V4 and added that internationally there is a decrease in the fuel price and if it continues there will be a decrease in the price next month.
He said that at present the price of fuel per barrel has been decreased by USD 5.
This is the simplest formula that all were asking for and here it is, said the Minister showing the price formula written on a board.
The Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for implementation of a cost reflective formula based pricing system of Auto Fuels effective from May 11, 2018.
Minister Samaraweera said that they form the pricing according to the formula every month based on four values.
The pricing formula was constructed by a Technical based following components of the supply of auto fuels, Landed Cost, Processing Cost, Administrative Cost and Taxation.
Accordingly, the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the auto fuels was established as follows: MRP = V1 + V2 + V3+ V4 where MRP is Maximum Retail Price of Auto Fuel.
Minister Samaraweera said that V1 is the Landed Cost (Rs/ Litre), which included Singapore Platts Price per Barrel, weighted Average Premium per Barrel, Loss due to the Evaporation and Exchange Rate (US$/ LKR) are applied, V2 is the Processing cost which includes local port charges, Transport Cost, Dealers Margin including losses due to Evaporation to dealers and stock holding cost, V3 is the Administrative expenses including Personnel Cost, Depreciation and other cost elements, if any and V4 is the Taxation which includes Customs Import Duty, Excise Duty, Ports and Airports Development Levy and National Building Tax.
He said that even in Saudi Arabia where fuel is produced, there is a tax and one way of providing several benefits are based on the taxes levied.
He said that the tax levied in Sri Lanka is comparatively low compared to the other countries in the region.
Tax levied on Petrol in India was SL Rs.82.14 and Diesel SL Rs. 47.52 but in Sri Lanka it was Rs. 53.68 for Petrol and Rs. 25.48 for Diesel. In England Rs.178.70 for Petrol and Rs.180.27 for Diesel, the Minister said.
He further said that none of the previous governments changed the pricing formula when there was a decrease in the international pricing of fuels and added that the government was sensitive towards the issues faced by the public.
State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne said that the Ministry decided to release the formula as they do not have anything to hide from public.
Before the system was only one sided. Now when the international fuel goes up and down, the price formula differs and that is the better side of it, he said.
He further said taking the Maximum Retail Price into consideration, in India they charge 33 percent tax for Diesel, 58 percent in Pakistan, 19 percent in Sri Lanka, 12 percent in Singapore and 60 percent in Britain.

Govt takes safeguards to face economic challenges  Mangala
Sri Lankas potential remains as bright as ever despite some of the dark clouds gathering in the horizon globally, Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera said.
While the country is facing a couple of challenging years, the government has managed to build the necessary safeguards to face these challenges in a successive manner, he told the Sri Lanka Retail Forum 2018 under the theme Towards a Dynamic and Evolving Retail Sector in Colombo yesterday.
The Minister added, the future holds tremendous potential as Sri Lanka is at the heart of the fastest growing south East Asian region and the government is putting in place necessary policies to leverage the greater external orientation of the economy. The forum was organized by Sri Lanka Retailers Association.
He also reiterated the governments intention to extend its support to the retail sector and to collaborate with all the stakeholders to make Sri Lanka a major retail destination in the Indian Ocean.
He said last couple of years have been challenging for the retail sector, as the economy was subject to exogenous props as well as successive years of drought, persisted during the 2016-17 period had a debilitating effect on the agricultural sector, directly affecting the incomes of the 35% of countrys labour force. The rising fuel prices have further exaggerated the every governments expenditure both home and abroad. In spite of these challenges, the government has made a significant progress in stabilizing the economy, Minister said: By end of last year, the government achieved a primary surplus for the first time since 1950. This trend was witnessed in the first half of this year and we hope to increase this surplus at the end of this year.
Minister also said Sri Lankas reserves are being improved and the monetary sector has also shown signs of stabilising.
Despite all these challenges, results of stabilization of the economy are being seen and felt. Citing examples to prove his statement, he said Inflation has fallen to 2.5 in September 2018, compared to 8.6% recorded during the corresponding month in the previous year.
The government economic policy has been to reorient Sri Lanka towards a greater external force, taking on international competition to drive competiveness in the local economy. In 2017, Sri Lanka achieved a record US $ 1.9 Billion in FDI while in the first seven months of 2018 alone; Sri Lankas total FDI reached US $ 1.35 billion, indicating a 138% increase year on year.
There is also a positive outlook for exports and FDI in the economy as there are several new projects in the pipeline with investments amounting to billions of dollars.
While the external sector is showing signs of progress, he said that the government is equally focused on driving economic activities on the domestic front.
Minister also said that the economic growth in 2017 was below potential due to some of the external shocks.
The government has a clear strategy to provide stimulus for the economic growth in a sustainable manner and is providing an impetus to growth through various investment channels.
Recovery in growth that began on the second quarter this year will gather momentum in the coming months and these developments will no doubt have a positive impact on consumption in the economy and on the retail sector in particular, he said.
He noted further that recent depreciation of Sri Lankan rupee was largely due to external factors and US interest rates hikes, trade wars and rising oil prices have resulted in global investors taking capital out of emerging markets like Sri Lanka.
From a policy perspective, the government has taken all the necessary measures to address these factors within our control, he noted.
He added further that government was compelled to take certain measures to stem the importation of small cars under 1000 CC category and said the government has no plans to restrict imports of vehicles in a permanent manner and to go back to the closed economy of 1970.
These are temporarily measures which have been taken and these measures will be reviewed regularly. The government remains committed to rapid liberalization of Sri Lankan economy, he said.
Commenting on the Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya initiatives, Minister Samaraweera said over Rs. 53 billion has been disbursed as Enterprise Sri Lanka loans during the last five months alone, in keeping with the governments objective of creating 100,000 entrepreneurs during the next year. Minister said Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative would create jobs and provide long term productive capital for aspiring entrepreneurs to set up their own businesses. Accordingly, significant amount of money has been deployed in multiple sectors including Agricultural, Fisheries, Manufacturing, Renewable Energy, IT and tourism and so on.
The government expects to expand this scheme even further, the minister said. Under the Gamperaliya Program, another rapid village development scheme, launched to accelerate the rural development, the government has already started work on 45,000 new projects across the country and the government has been providing nearly Rs 20 billion for the work of these projects to be completed by November 30. According to the Minister, Gamperaliya program will also be expanded for the next year and it will generate economic activities in rural geographies, particularly areas badly ravished by the drought, over the last two decades.
The government is confident that these programs will provide necessary stimulus to spur growth in rural and urban economies alike, Minister said.

Help Your Dog Live Longer
Dogs who eat less live longer. According to a 2011 study, dogs who were raised on a restricted-calorie dietabout 25% less than normal recommended amounts of foodlived an average of two years longer than dogs who were fed more.
Of course, you shouldnt drastically reduce your dogs caloric intake without consulting a vet, but this information supports the common-sense knowledge that a dog with a healthy weight is a dog with a longer life. Obese dogs are more likely to develop heart disease and debilitating joint problems, too.
The quality of the food you feed your dog matters as well. Research labels. Avoid generic meat byproducts, sugars, excess sodium, and unnecessary fillers. Look for whole ingredients and responsible sourcing practices from your dog food to help extend your dogs health. 2. Exercise enables a healthy body
Diet isnt the only way to help your dog stay in shape. Exercise is a key component to prolonging your dogs life, and as an added bonus, itll help you live longer, too!
Exercise is proven to lower stress, increase endorphins, and balance mood and emotions in people and dogs alike. In addition to helping your dog maintain a healthy weight and muscle mass, and keeping her cardiovascular system in shape, regular physical activity will help keep her happy.
If you want to prolong her life, consider prolonging those evening walks, and maybe even kick it up to a jog. Better yet, let your dog romp off-leash with a canine friend or two: socialization with other dogs is another way to reduce her stress and improve her overall quality of life. 3. Keep her mind in shape, too
Like people, dogs thrive on mental stimulation to keep them happy. A bored dog can become depressed, anxious, and even ill. You can extend your dogs life by keeping her busy.
As she ages, keep her mind active with training, socialization, games, one-on-one attention, and other enrichment activities.
Its never too late to teach an old dog new tricks: sign up for advanced obedience lessons, or try a dog sport like agility or lure coursing. Your dog will thrive with the added stimulation, and your bond will strengthen as you learn new skills together. 4. Dont forget to brush those teeth
Dental hygiene is an often-overlooked aspect of pet care. Many of us, myself included, simply forget to brush our dogs teeth on a regular basis. Unfortunately, poor oral hygiene can lead to plaque, gingivitis, and eventually periodontal disease, a bacterial infection of the mouth that has been linked to heart disease and organ damage in dogs.
The good news is, its not hard to keep your dogs chompers in shape. Simply brush her teeth regularly, provide safe chew toys and dental treats, and have the vet check her teeth at annual visits. Learn more about dog dental health in our posts, How to Brush Your Dogs Teeth (and Keep All Your Fingers) and Help! My Dog Has Bad Breath. 5. Follow your doctors orders
Even if your dog is the picture of health, she should visit the vet at least once a year for a general check-up, and twice a year as she enters old age.
Wellness exams are meant to maintain optimal health, and they provide a concrete record of your dogs health history as she ages.
They also give your vet the chance to spot potential problems early on, and a problem detected in its early stages is more likely to be treated and resolved successfully. Sticking to a regular preventative care routine will give your dog the best shot at a long, healthy life. 6. Remember to enjoy every moment
The sad fact of dog parenthood is that people outlive pets, and there are no miracle products that will extend your dogs life far beyond the natural lifespan of her breed.
But with conscientious care, enrichment, and regular veterinary attention, you may be able to give her a few extra years.
Your time together is precious, so maintain healthy habits, keep your dog active in body and mind, and savor every minute.

Her speed was a lightning Rod
In the 1970s she was the QUEEN of the track in the countrys athletic world. Wherever or whenever she got under starters orders or on the blocks as it were, she would burn the track with her lightning like speed that left her opponents dumbfounded.
She was the cynosure of all eyes and she seldom let herself or her supporters down, winning her events with consummate ease, setting up records and then automatically earning national representation.
We refer to KAHANDA GAMAGE BADRA one of the finest and eye catching athlete produced by the country who we are proud to include in our Hall of Fame of SPORTS LEGENDS today.
Prowess in running
It was on the old Sugathadasa Stadium track that she put on show her prowess in the running game. Being on the track also saw her falling in love and it was not long when the brilliant runner said I DO to another speed gun on the track SUNIL GONEWARDENE and are still loving partners in the all important lives track.
First to BADRA who was the youngest in a family of five born to K.G.Francis Appuhamy and Cicilian Munasinghe on January 17 in Madawalamulla, Galle. Her father was a leading businessman in Galle. BADRA had her earlier education at Sangamitta Balika MV in Galle and
later switched to Buddhist Ladies Colombo. As a student she loved to do Science. But it was as an athlete was in what she shone in and being a champion in school and District level and then where ever she faced the starters orders that she began her career on the track that finally culminated in her being crowned the QUEEN of the track.
Bundle of energy
With her career blossoming she was a bundle of energy as she took to the track at every meet setting up records that took the local athletic world by storm. Her talent improved beyond recognition after she joined Holy Family Convent thanks to that great games mistress Trixie Jayasuriya. Many were the anecdotes on Txirie Jayasuriya that Marianne Decker who was Sports Sub Editor on the Daily News and a past Familian and a good raconteur would relate to me to break the monotony on the Desk and ease tension and together we would enjoy a laugh. I knew Trixie Jayasuriya well because I used to cover netball for the TIMES and at times relate these
stories told by Marianne to her. She would retort by saying You mean that Marianne Double Decker And would smile.
Trixie Jayasuriya who had the knack of spotting talent and turning them into champions was a dedicated and disciplined coach in all sports in the convent and many were the champions she turned out in athletics and netball. That was the golden era when there were many outstanding games mistresses in Kusuma George, Nancy de Siva, Cynthia Rasquingho and the pretty Nessi Nalliah.
The famous Pubs
In an earlier era when the famous Public Schools Athletic Championships was eagerly awaited and the cynosure of all eyes there were talented athletes who drew interest and attracted crowds in their numbers to the Oval where the meet was held. Women athletes of that era who come to mind are Rukmani Vethanayagam, Shrahi Bongso, Jilska Flamer Caldera and the Van Heers. The men were Sarath Wijesinghe, Nagalingam Ethiriveerasingham, Winslow, Adolph Silva, Vijitha
Wijesekera, T.D.S.A. Dissanayake and Ranjit Weerasena.
The Tarbat trophy awarded at that meet belonged every year to the Josephians who dominated the track and Field events shown the way by that unforgettable coach Anthony Abeysinghe.
Champion at school
Back to BADRA and she was a champion at school, District and All Island level. She was a flyer always off to a dream start along with the starters gun. She was the QUEEN in the 100m, 200m and 400m.
In 1969 she was All Island Champion and qualified to represent the country at the Thailand International meet in all three events. It was her father who sponsored her to Thailand where she got the first taste of what international competition is all about.
BADRAS immense talent earned her reward when she was selected for a three month training course at the Munich Sports University in 1979. This training further helped improve her running which saw her as an automatic selection for the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.
Once in a lifetime
BADRA treasures most the once in a lifetime opportunity she got to dine with another Queen - QUEEN ELIZABETH at Queens Palace in Scotland after the Commonwealth Games because she was the only competitor from the country. BADRA remained unassuming with records under her belt in the 100m with 11.9 secs running in a meet at the Munich University in Germany in 1970. At the Asian Games in 1971 she had good timings of 24.9 secs in the 200 metres
and she had another impressive timing of 56.8 secs in the 400 metres. What was great was that these records remained untouched for 20 years. AMAZING. With no other female athlete to challenge or break her records, she quit the track that she dominated with dash and daring and saying enough is enough she left open the track for up and coming young other athletes to
show their skill and if possible emulate her deeds that would remain ever printed for posterity in the record books.
Sports officer
BADRA was first invited to join the Ceylon Transport Board by her husband to be SUNIL GUNEWARDANE another gazelle on the track. But had to turn down that offer as she preferred to join the Sports Ministry as Sports Officer where she was confident that she could train and impart her knowledge to the budding athletes getting on the track.
It was not long before her hard work was recognized and it was not long when she was made Project Officer and capping it all by ending up as Assistant Director. Her hard work in spending her time showing the young athletes how was amply rewarded when she was awarded a one year Sports Diploma in the Minz Sports University in Germany in 1986.
She was also selected for a six month training course at the Munich Sports University in Germany in 1971.The writer visited this University when being the guest of the West German Government for the 1972 Olympic Games and can vouch for the wonderful training facilities that this University offers.
Part to perfection
Having played her part to perfection producing many national champions this dashing QUEEN and tagged the GALLE EXPRESS hung up her spikes leaving the track that she dominated open for other athletes to follow and if possible erase her phenomenal records. BADRA still sports that winsome smile. She is married to SUNIL GUNEWARDANE.

Its still a mystery to me why I was not selected for Colombo Asian 7s :
I am not injured, says Lanka Sevens skipper Muthuthanthri
Sudarshana Muthuthanthri, is a huge influence on the rugby field as national captain to transform the short format of the game in which Sri Lanka has always had the talent but presently lacked even an acceptable structure and professionalism to compete successfully in the world sevens arena.
An old boy of S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia, Muthuthanthri had remarkable success as the only Sri Lankan player to represent Auckland a top New Zealand team at the highest level as well as captaining Sri Lanka in the Asian sevens series, Borneo sevens, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games. In an interview with the Daily News Muthu as he is affectionately known expresses his thoughts.
Q: Who has helped you to become what you are today
A: God has guided me throughout.
Q: Any other sports you indulged in as a schoolboy
A: Basketball
Q: Is there anything special in your sporting career
A: When I wore the Sri Lankan national jersey for the first time it was with pride and honour. I had the same feeling when I wore the New Zealand Auckland sevens jersey as the first Sri Lankan to do so in our countrys rugby history.
Q: In what way did you help the Sri Lankan national Sevens team to achieve success
A: By using all my experience locally and overseas by bringing up a winning culture to improve as a team.
Q: How would you describe playing club rugby for Auckland and being the only Sri Lankan to do so
A: It was a very special moment in my life. I really wanted to give my best and learn more. Also to justify my selection to the team, I gave my 100% and in the end I achieved what I wanted.
Q: After that stint in New Zealand how is the hype coming and playing in Sri Lanka
A: After you play in New Zealand you get in to a very high level by their standards but in Sri Lanka, you cant maintain the same level right throughout due to lack of a proper structure in place and gradually your level comes down.
Q: How is the injury recovery system in Sri Lanka
A: At present we dont have a proper basic injury recovery system in place in the country.
Q: Whats the difference between New Zealand rugby and Sri Lanka rugby
A: What the New Zealand trainers do in New Zealand is not suitable and applicable to Sri Lanka. We dont have proper nutrition and basic recovery systems in place. Also we definitely need a high performance centre. Even without these basic requirements and the limited resources that we have, I personally believe that our boys are performing more than the expected level.
Q: The present national Sevens team is really poor and down in speed and contact. What are your thoughts
A: This happens because we are not doing the proper training. We have the natural speed but lack the strength in contact situations. We have to first improve our strength levels. To counter this and move forward Sri Lanka rugby definitely has to contract 25-30 players and the national trainer should have them right throughout the season.
Q: How many training sessions do you carry out for a day
A: Two.
Q: Are you satisfied on the session by session breaks to rest and the meals you get
A: Rest is ok but when it comes to nutrition, the quality and quantity is very poor so the performance levels becomes mediocre and does not reach the desired stage.
Q: Why do we fail in our seven a side games restarts and line outs time and time again
A: Restarts are always 50-50 ball game. We have to give 100% effort to get 50-50 chance. What we do is we lift our players to match the opposition foreign players natural heights of 6 ft 2in, 6 ft 4in; so it can work against us.
Q: We were outplayed in the rucks your thoughts
A: It is something to do with our technique, because when it comes to the game of 7s rugby all seven players should have the ability to play as forwards as well as three quarters.
Q: We still miss one on one tackles, why
A: That is because we are very poor in our conditioning levels.
Q: Are you injured
A: Definitely not and I have also in no way verbally or in writing informed the Sri Lanka Rugby authorities that I am injured or not available for national duty as captain or player for the just concluded Asian sevens series 3rd leg in Colombo.
Q: In that case what happened and why didnt you play
A: I honestly dont know. Only thing I knew was that, I was told by the chairman of selectors prior to the announcement of the team that I wont be selected because I need an operation on my wrist. I was shocked. Also what really baffled me was that this same people have cleared me to play as the Sri Lanka national 7s captain in the 2nd leg in South Korea and I didn't get any injury nor was I injured in Korea. Hence after two weeks down the line suddenly why do I need to have an operation To-date it is really a mystery to me. Please find out from the authorities concerned, since I still dont know the real reasons as to why I was not selected for the 3rd leg in Colombo.
Q: Our present rugby standards in the Asian Games and the Asian sevens series three legs have dropped dramatically when compared to previous years, especially in 2016 Asian Sevens Series your views
A: There were many things the former Sri Lanka rugby chairman Asanga Seneviratne did right by bringing in High Performance Director Inthi Marikkar. That way they created a culture that all players have to go through fitness test and achieve the internationally accepted standards. I personally feel that it was really good because all the players finally need to strive hard to achieve the set of standards of fitness to be selected to the national team. Inthi is also a very experienced person and knows both New Zealand rugby as well as Sri Lankan rugby; hence he brought in rugby systems and structures which are suitable for Sri Lankan rugby.
Q: In which area do you think that we have to improve our standards in Sevens rugby
A: Strengthening and Conditioning and Nutrition are very vital.
Q: We are playing Sri Lanka rugby and by going to play New Zealand rugby are we missing a trick and thereby our performances have declined
A: Thats the main problem why we are going through a bad patch now, because in New Zealand they are equipped with proper systems and structures, but in Sri Lanka we are not.
Q: What will be your ultimate goal for your present club CH & FC
A: Definitely to win this years league title as well as the Clifford Cup knockout.

India attracted $22 bn of FDI flows  in first half of 2018 - UN report
India attracted $22 billion of (Foreign Direct Investment) FDI flows in the first half of 2018, according to a UN report which states that the global foreign direct investment dropped by 41 per cent in the same period due to tax reforms carried out by the Trump administration.
The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said on Monday in its Investment Trends Monitor report that in South Asia, India attracted $22 billion of FDI (foreign direct investment) flows, contributing to the subregions 13 per cent rise in FDI in the first half of the year.
The report, however, said that with the $22 billion FDI, India just about managed to make it to the top 10 host economies receiving the most FDI during the period.
China was the largest recipient of FDI, attracting an estimated $70 billion in inflows in the first half of the year, followed by the UK with $65.5 billion, the US with $46.5 billion, The Netherlands at $44.8 billion, Australia with $36.1 billion, Singapore got $34.7 billion and Brazil received $25.5 billion, it said. Global foreign direct investment fell by 41 per cent in the first half of 2018, to an estimated $470 billion from $794 billion in the same period of 2017, mainly due to large repatriations by the US parent companies of accumulated foreign earnings from their affiliates aboard following tax reforms, the report said.
Overall, the global financial picture is gloomy, said James Zhan, UNCTADs Director, Division on Investment and Enterprise. The decline in global FDI is mainly owing to recent tax reforms implemented by US President Donald Trumps administration that led to big firms in the US to bring home earnings from abroad  principally from Western European countries.
Other factors have contributed to this years huge difference in repatriation of overseas profits by US multinationals, Zhan said. These include uncertainty about the detail and impact of tax reform and the potential impact of unresolved international trade disputes; such as the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the US and China, Zhan added. In contrast to the overall decline in foreign investment, the report highlights a 42 per cent increase in so-called greenfield projects to $454 billion.
These initiatives can involve building operations in a foreign country from scratch and they are seen an indicator of future trends, Zhan said, adding that investment in this sector had been at relatively low levels in the same period last year.
The report noted that while the fall in foreign direct investment had happened mainly in richer nations, including Ireland (down $81 billion) and Switzerland (down $77 billion), developing economies saw FDI flows declining only slightly in the first half of the year by four per cent to $310 billion compared with 2017.
This includes developing Asia - down four per cent - to $220 billion - in the same period, driven mostly by a 16 per cent decline in investment in East Asia.
Latin America and the Caribbean saw a six per cent drop in investment, amid uncertainty over upcoming elections that were offset by higher commodity prices, the report said.
