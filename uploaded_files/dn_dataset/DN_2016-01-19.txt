Because OSCAR
Once again, it is the AWARDS season. Despite how wonderful the summer was, this is the movie-goers favourite season! The Golden Globes was held a few days back and we all were able to catch a glimpse of how these years Academy Awards, or "Oscars" will be like.
Yes, it is time to call those bets, grab your popcorn, download pirated DVD screeners, and of course argue with your movie buddies. Because the hype is back!
Cinephiles all over the world tune in gripping their hair, gritting their teeth rooting for their favourites and hoping they would take the Award home tonight! So here is a little trivia your way as you sit down for Oscar night on February 28.
The Oscar award is a replica of the actor Emilio Fernandez who posed nude for the creation of the statuette. It was the art director Cedric Gibbons who supervised the design of the statuette in 1929.
Oscars are officially known as the "Academy Award of Merit", yet it is better known as "Oscars", a nickname given by the Academy Librarian on behalf of the statue that resembles her uncle. The statue being nude, it is a little disturbing.
The statuette is 13 1/2 inches in height, and weighs 8 1/2 pounds- which is almost the size of a Barbie doll.
Being made of Metal, the statuette is unbreakable.
The original statuettes were gold plated bronze, but later they resorted to a pewter like alloy, plated with 24 karat gold.
During the World War II, due to metal shortage the Academy presented awards made of Painted plaster for three years, yet after the war the winners were allowed to redeem new gold plated metal statuettes.
In the year 2000, a shipment of 50 Oscars was stolen from the dock. Since then, they are delivered by a special Flight.
The Statuettes are made one year in advance, and flown to LA with maximum security, and stored in the Academy vault until the Oscar season arrives.
All the nominees' names are engraved on metal plates, and after the ceremony the winners can get their plate mounted on the award.
Oscar is the man who was lucky enough to be kissed by all of the Hollywood's heart throbs. Except he was made out of metal and gold.
Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and several others keep their Oscars in their bathrooms in order to remind themselves of who they truly are.
Over the course of time several winners have refused to accept Oscars. Marlon Brando from "The Godfather" refused his award due to the discrimination of Native American communities during film making. A certain Native American Ms. Littlefeather was allowed to speak on behalf of him.
It is illegal to sell an Oscar, unless the Academy refuses to purchase it back at the prize of 1 USD. This happened after Michael Jackson bought and Oscar for 1 Million.
When an Oscar is handed to a lucky winner, the presenter is not allowed to say, "And the winner is ..." They must say, "And the Oscar goes to ..."
Walt Disney has won the most Oscars: which is 26.
The most awards won by a movie in all time is 11 awards. Three movies managed to bag the title: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Titanic (1997), and Ben Hur (1959).
The youngest ever Oscar winner was Tatum O'Neal, 10, for Paper Moon (1973); the oldest was Christopher Plummer, 82, Beginners (2011).

'Bhikkhu Kathikawatha' Bill will be debated in Parliament'
President Maithripala Sirisena says the 'Bhikkhu Kathikawatha' Bill will be presented to Parliament, is not the ultimate Bill and the acceptance, rejection or amendments to it will be prepared with the consent of the Nayaka Theras of the Tri Nikayas.
He made these remarks addressing a felicitation ceremony to honour Bhikkhus and lay people of Amarapura Chapter as well as the Remembrance of Pioneers of the Amarapura Chapter, held at the BMICH, yesterday (18).
The President further said that the drafting of this Bill did not take place following the establishment of the new government and it has been drafted according to a request made by the Maha Sangha 25 years ago.
He also said that every government that came to the power had taken certain steps in this regard and the present government is also engaged in a similar task with the advice and guidance of the Maha Sangha.
President Sirisena said that after completing the drafting of the Bill, and before the Bill is presented to Parliament, it will be sent to the Maha Sangha.
He has given instructions to the Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Buddha Sasana to present the Bill to the Tri Nikayas' Sanga Nayaka Theras to seek their consent in this regard.
"While further strengthening the existing provisions regarding Buddhism in the Constitution, the government will take every possible step to develop the Buddha Sasanaya," he added.
Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya, the Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Anunayaka Thero, Ven. Professor Kandegoda Wimaladhamma Thera, were felicitated at this ceremony for their immense contribution in developing the Amarapura Nikaya and the Buddha Sasanaya. Prof. M. U. de Silva and L. H Piyasena were also felicitated at this ceremony for rendering a great service to the Amarapura Nikaya.
More than 1000 bhikkus, Ministers Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Patali Champaka Ranawaka and others participated in this event.

Bill of Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath challenged in SC
A Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015 was filed before Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
This Special Determination petition was filed by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Shasanika Secretary Biyagama Suseela Thero of the Sri Bodhi Vihara Pirivena in Udahamulla, Nugegoda.
The petitioner stated that a Bill titled Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015 was published by way of a Gazette Notification on December 14, 2015, on the orders of the Buddha Sasana Minister.He stated that on January 12, 2016, the said Bill was placed on the order paper of Parliament.
The petitioner stated that clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are in violation of Articles 3, 4 (c) and (d), 9, 10, 11, 12 (1), 12 (2), 14(1)(b), 14(1)(c), 14(1)(e), 27 and 28 of the Constitution.
The petitioner said the Bill applies only to Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition and thereby draws a distinction between Bhikkus of the Mahayana tradition and the Theravada tradition.
He further maintained that the Bill seeks to restrict the rights and freedoms of Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition in the exercise of their freedom of religion and their freedom of association whilst no such restriction is placed on any Bhikku of the Mahayana tradition or the clergy of the Christian or Catholic communities in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner is of the view that the Bill was seeking to restrict the rights of Bhikkus who do not belong to the Shyamopali, Ramagna and Amarapura Maha Nikayas or chapters established under any of the said Nikayas.
Accordingly, the rights of a Bhikku belonging to a chapter or a Nikaya which is not recognised by or not part of any of the said Maha Nikayas are affected by the provisions of the said Bill.
The petitioner maintained that the distinction is drawn in violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners enshrined in Articles 12 (1) and 12 (2),
(1). Stipulating matters mandatorily need to be included in a kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Thought and Religion.
(2). Appointment of a panel to examine and decide the legality of a kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
(3). Powers vested in the said panel is an exercise of Judicial Power.
(4). Compelling a Nikaya or Chapter to conduct an inquiry for every violation of the provisions of a registered kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
(5). Converting every violation of a decision of the Karaka Sanga Sabava of a chapter or religion to a criminal offence, is a violation of Equality before Law and Freedom of Religion.
(6). Empowering the Minister to frame registration with regard to matters hitherto exercised by the Sangha, is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.

Burning of Kenyan Elephant Tusks (Ivory) at Galle Face Green
It is with due respect and honour, I as a peace loving citizen of Sri Lanka presently living temporarily in Bremen City, Germany make an appeal to immediately stop the proposed burning of Kenyan elephant tusks by Sri Lanka Customs Department on 29.1.2016.
The reasons I place before you are as follows:
1. Sri Lanka is a country with majority Buddhist population who highly respect the elephants and Ivory in religious and national ceremony.
2. It is by burning tons of elephant tusks in a Bon Fire we are not achieving anything expect an air pollution and a curse to the nation.
3. Sri Lanka is proud of Kandyan Esala Perahera where good number of elephants take part to make the festival colourful and tourist attraction from foreigners.
4. Even the "Sacred Tooth Relic" is carried by the famous Tusker the so called "Rajah" - elephant to make the Esala Perahera most fascinating and glorious.
5. Elephants are well honoured animals for religious purposes and the burning of the tusks might bring an outbreak of elephant infectious diseases and many elephants might die in a country where the Ivory is treated as a waste product.
6. Usually customs banned contraband articles are sold in auction except drugs. Here in this case above mentioned tusks could be sold in international auction and lot of Foreign Exchange could be earned, a certain percentage could be given to customs as an incentive and the rest could be utilized for the Department of Wild Life, Dehiwela Zoological Gardens, Kandy Esala Perahera and on elephants welfare in Temples, Viharas and Dagobas.
7. Even the Supreme Deity "Ganadeviyo" is depicted as a symbol of elephant with tusk may abstain from offering the blessing to the nation.
I am unable to imagine as to how could be this suggestion came to the minds of Customs authorities. This idea would have been given by negative thinkers I suppose.
The same advice is given in Dhammapada as follows:
"Asevavanacha Bhalanang
Pandithanachcha Sevenang
Poojacha Poojaneyaanang
Ettam Mangala Uththanang"
Thurunuwan Saranai!

Daddy makes an entrance
Daddy's Home has a pretty crummy title. Who's the Daddy would have suited it perfectly, with the sense of macho oneupmanship already built into the premise: Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg as duelling dads, one cool and biological, the other vastly embarrassing and a stepdad.
Roughly the same idea, with women, was done as a drama - 1998's Stepmom, with Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon. But you can be guaranteed the approach with these stars, and Sex Drive's Sean Anders in the director's chair, is to take it a lot less seriously - basically to have Ferrell in his most flummoxed, ineffectual and resolutely lame mode as Not Mark Wahlberg.
Lame Ferrell, through some weird freak of his talent, tends to be the best Ferrell, and despite the film's general mediocrity in most departments - let us swish briskly over everything about the way it looks - his floundering star turn delivers the goods. It's hard not to enjoy the spectacle of him protruding from an interior wall, after trying to show off on Wahlberg's motorbike, and uttering the pure Ferrellism, "No, I'm not OK! I'm in a wall and I'm scared!". There's plenty more in this vein.
These two stars were paired before as mismatched buddy cops in The Other Guys, but it's a better idea to pit them against one other, and to do so by stealth: it starts out as a passive-aggressive boxing match where neither wants to get caught fighting. Not a vast amount is required of Wahlberg, except to provide a ripped, inscrutable punchline to every scene in which Ferrell's Brad is trying too hard.
Dusty is a rock-hard combat veteran who left his family after being unable to hack the vanilla trivialities of fatherhood, and comes smouldering back in to win his kids back. He tells them underhand bedside stories, overtly bribes them with cash, and does everything he can to make Brad look like even more of a dullard.
The kids' mom (a slightly underused Linda Cardellini) has to be a nag to both parties in this equation, though her chirrupy overexcitement at the idea of having another baby, as a comic note to play, is better than nothing. It's for this reason that we end up at the fertility clinic, where the literal measuring contest happens: Bobby Cannavale cameos as a reproductive endocrinologist with a rather flawed line in client reassurance.
Few would want to be unzipped next to former underwear model Mark Wahlberg, or certainly not the character he played in Boogie Nights, which is somewhere in the back of this film's watchably silly, sniggery mind.
Daddy's Home is screening at Majestic Cienplex's Gold and Empire's Delux.

Djokovic fires warning with easy first-up win
MELBOURNE, MONDAY: Serbian world number one Novak Djokovic eased past Chung Hyeon in straight sets to kick off his quest for a record-equalling sixth Australian Open title on Monday.
Djokovic beat the 19-year-old South Korean 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in 1hr 55mins in blistering heat on Rod Laver Arena which left him reaching for the ice vests and water.
Despite the high temperarures, the top seed sent out a chilling warning to his rivals as he set out to equal Australian Roy Emerson's record of six Australian Open crowns.
Djokovic looked in ominous touch for his rivals, sending the 51st-ranked Chung scurrying around the court chasing after his dazzling array of shots.
"It's an absolute pleasure to come back to Rod Laver Arena, it's the most successful court in my career and there have been many memorable moments in the matches I've played here," Djokovic said.
"Chung is only 19, he's tall and he plays well from the back of the court and he has a big future."
The 28-year-old Serb is yet to drop a set this year and his performance in the Qatar Open final was described as "perfect" by his one of big rivals, Rafael Nadal.
Djokovic unfurled some of his famed leg-split volleys in taking the opening set in 40 minutes.
Chung grabbed his only service break in the opening set, but the Serb top seed powered through.
Djokovic was clinical at the net, winning 15 from 15 points and well as dominating first serve points at 89 percent.
Djokovic broke Chung's first two service games on the way to taking the second set.
He grabbed another early break in the third set to charge away with the match.
The Serbian world number one's bid for a calendar-year Grand Slam fell just short during his brilliant 2015 season. He wore down Andy Murray to win last year's final at Melbourne Park, and won three Grand Slams among 11 tournament victories in a stellar 2015 season, with a win-loss record of 82-6.
The 10-time Grand Slam champion is projected to face Japan's seventh seed Kei Nishikori in the quarters and Switzerland's 17-time major winner Roger Federer in the semi-finals.

Forces should not have civilians in their rugby teams - Viper
It is a sad spectacle to see civilians playing rugby for the forces or Police teams and even foreigners have donned their jerseys in the past said former Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Air Force, CR and FC and Vidyartha College flanker Viper Edwin Gunaratne.
He made these observations before the Kandy Sports Club - Sri Lanka Navy Dialog League rugby tournament match played at Nittawela recently. He was the Match Commissioner at this key match.
Viper Gunaratne Snr as he was known was one of the hardest and fearless tacklers this country has known. He was an automatic choice to the Sri Lanka team at a time the British born ruggerites from the plantations and the Agency Houses were packing their bags to return to 'Old Blighty' with the changes in the plantations and followed by the Land Reforms.
Asked why he was nicknamed as viper which in local parlance is the deadly 'polonga'. He said in one 'A' Division club match he was playing for Sri Lanka Air Force against Dimbula at Radella. The planters team was made up of hulky players who could bulldoze with the ball and the only way to stop them was to tackle the hard. He just did that.
He tackled so hard that five of his opponents had to seek medical assistance immediately and two others limped off probably with contusions. Air Force won the match against this planters side who were invincible at Radella. He over heard the opposing players telling the fellow players "be careful of that Viper". They did not know his name.
Next day the newspapers had the screaming headlines" A viper in the Air Force team sends five to the hospital "It was a catchy headline and caught the immediate attention of the readers as at one glance they thought these players were stung by a 'Polonga' in the field.
He played his entire rugby for Sri Lanka Air Force except for a brief period of one season when the airmen did not field a side due to the 1971 Insurrection. Money could not buy him as there were many lucrative offers but representing a club which was so close to his heart was greater. He signed off his career with the Air Force.
He said that the forces should field a team with home grown stuff as they have enough players at their disposal. They are trained to meet any situation. They are physically fit. They have the build who could be converted into forwards to have a heavy and mobile pack. Then there are the runners who could good three quarters like the case of Sudu Banda of Police who with no rugby back ground played for the national team with distinction.
With the clubs it is a different case as they have a limited membership and most of them come in the evening for a quiet drink or a game of poker or snooker. But forces should field their own men. They should mould ruggerites out of raw material and not depend on civilians to win matches for them.
Police team won many trophies with their own men and Air Force also won likewise. What have they achieved by fielding civilians except for one team.
When asked about women referees he said that they could hardly do anything. Tell one a woman in Sri Lanka who could handle the whistle. How can they do this where the men are struggling like the 'beep test'.
This is all none sense. They are termed as sub officials.

The ideal survival
With "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi," Michael Bay has done for the attack on Benghazi and those who fought and died there what he did for the attack on Pearl Harbor in "Pearl Harbor"-reduce the seriousness of the event and the sacrifices made into another exercise of the kind of slick, soulless excess that is virtually indistinguishable, both stylistically and dramatically, from the rest of his filmography.Based on the best-selling account by Mitchell Zuckoff (with the participation of five of the survivors of the attack), the film begins as former Navy SEAL Jack Silva (John Krasinski) arrives in Benghazi to work as a private consultant on the security detail for a CIA outpost alongside old friend Tyrone "Rone" Woods (James Badge Dale).
The job isn't ideal-Benghazi is one of the most dangerous places in the world; he is separated from his wife and young daughters; and all the official CIA people that he is working under, especially outpost chief Bob (David Costabile), are constantly reminding all the security guys that they are the ones doing the important work. It brings in more money than staying at home and working as a real estate agent.
In early September 2012, U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher) arrives and insists on staying at the diplomatic compound during his visit. While inspecting the premises before the arrival of Ambassador Stevens, Silva, Rone and their fellow security consultants realize instantly that the protection it offers is completely inadequate. They're further appalled when they see that a once-secret meeting has been made into a public affair, alerting everyone in the dangerously unstable region to the presence of Stevens. Nevertheless, the CIA guys and the security patrol at the diplomatic compound poo-poo their warnings and insist that they have everything under control.
On September 11, the compound, with Stevens inside, is attacked by a heavily-armed mob that quickly storms the building and even sets it on fire in an attempt to smoke the ambassador out. From their vantage point at the CIA outpost a mile or so away, Silva, Rone and four other security men on hand-Kris "Tanto" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber), Dave "Boon" Benton (David Denman), John "Tig" Tiegan (Dominic Fumusa) and Mark "Oz" Geist (Max Martini)-can see what is going down and are prepared to rush over and assist, but the main CIA guy gives them a direct order to stand down. He continues to repeat that order until the six of them decide to defy it and head out to the compound without authorization. Although they fend off waves of attackers and manage to pull a couple of people out, they are unable to find Stevens in the burning building before returning to their base. It is then that the CIA base becomes the new focus of attack and the guys, along with a handful of others, are forced to single-handedly defend the compound and those inside while calls for air support are ignored and a potential rescue force is stuck on the tarmac in Tripoli mired in red tape.
In the hands of the right filmmaker, a film about Benghazi might have yielded something like Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down," another chronicle of a mission in an unstable land that went horribly wrong. Scott's film chronicled the horrors of what happened, the heroism of those that fought and the combination of mistakes, misjudgments and plain bad luck that occurred along the way. Alas, Michael Bay has never been known as a director with any sense of nuance, and instead recounts the story in the broadest manner imaginable. The screenplay by Chuck Hogan is about as simplistic and simple-minded as can be-our six heroes are near-gods who can do no wrong while the government operatives on display are cartoonishly dumb, obnoxious and blinkered in their thinking. When he wants viewers to recognize what drives our heroes to put themselves in harm's way, he not only has one of them read aloud from Joseph Campbell's "The Power of Myth" but repeats that moment as a flashback towards the end-which is also pretty much the extent of the character development as well. Frankly, the best writing in the film is featured in a clip from "Tropic Thunder" that is shown and considering what that movie is about-a group of actors going off to film a war story that proves to be not quite as accurate as advertised-its inclusion comes across as either the sickest joke imaginable or a weird bit of meta-commentary that somehow got slipped into the mix.
As for Bay, he treats the material in much the same manner for everything else-like a hyper-violent video game featuring lots of dazzle and precious little else. Thinking back to "Black Hawk Down," you will recall how brilliantly Scott evoked the confusion of what happened while still laying everything out in a manner and allowing viewers to follow along and find order in the chaos. "13 Hours" evokes plenty of confusion, but it is less the fog of war and more the fog of a filmmaker who seems incapable of following the basic rules of film grammar when needed. One could argue that Bay is trying for a "you are there" approach that plunges viewers into the mayhem and keeps them as much in the dark as the character were but he just doesn't have the skills to pull it off. Utilizing his familiar arsenal of rapid edits, slow-motion and showy special effects (including a bit following a mortar as it descends from the skies to hit its target that appears to be Bay's homage to a similar shot in his own "Pearl Harbor"), he does everything he can to get an immediate reaction (including a bit in which the American flag is machine-gunned in slow-motion that feels like the longest sustained shot in the film) but neglects to give viewers anything else to grasp onto that could give them any understanding of what happened. As bad as the action is, the allegedly character-driven bits are even worse-a scene in which Silva gets some news from his wife and kids over a video chat while the family is at a McDonald's drive-thru is so badly handled in every possible way that it makes the scene in Bay's "Armageddon" with Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and some animal crackers seem positively subtle by comparison.
Simply put, "13 Hours" is a pretty dreadful movie and while watching it, I sat there trying to figure out what kind of audience might actually go for it. Those of the liberal persuasion will write it off because it presents elements that have been highly disputed or flat-out denied (such as the stand-down orders) as unquestioned fact. Conservatives may be upset that it doesn't go far enough in tying Hillary Clinton to the events depicted-unless I missed it, she is never once mentioned specifically.
As an action movie and as a historical document, it is a bombastic and wholly inauthentic mess that displays precious little interest in the men whose actions and sacrifices it purports to honor.
There is a good and interesting movie out there to be made about the tragic events at Benghazi and the political aftermath but "13 Hours" is definitely not it.

Indian off-spinner Chandila banned for life over fixing
Mumbai, Monday: Indian off-spinner Ajit Chandila was banned from cricket for life on Monday for his involvement in a spot-fixing scandal while batsman Hiken Shah was suspended for five years over corruption.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) found 32-year-old Chandila, who does not play international cricket, guilty of spot-fixing while playing for the Rajasthan Royals franchise in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2013. Shah, a first-class domestic player from Mumbai, was suspended for approaching another player about fixing ahead of the 2015 IPL, a breach of the BCCI's code of conduct.
"Ajit Chandila is banned for life from playing or representing cricket in any form or to be associated in any way with the activities of the board or its affiliates," BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said in a statement.
"Hiken Shah is banned for five years from playing or representing cricket in any form or to be associated in any way with the activities of the board or its affiliates," Thakur added.
India's scandal-hit IPL has been been rocked by allegations of corruption, match-fixing and crooked umpires since it launched with great fanfare in 2008. Chandila, along with teammate, former Test fast bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, and another player, were acquitted last year of criminal charges over the IPL spot-fixing and betting scandals following a police investigation.
The BCCI has already banned Sreesanth and the other player for life for breaching the code.
They had been arrested in 2013 along with scores of bookies as part of the probe into allegations that players had underperformed in return for cash from bookmakers.

JVP to prod govt. to act against the corrupt
The Police Financial Crimes Division which investigated 198 financial frauds since the Hedging transaction to date has completed investigations into 30 of them and sent the reports to the Attorney General's Department but the department had failed to take any action on them so far, JVP General Secretary Tylvin Silva said.
Addressing a press conference at the JVP Headquarters yesterday, Silva alleged that the government was uttering falsehoods to deceive the masses without taking any action against the people involved in financial crimes.
He said although Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera advised people not to get upset about the lack of action against corrupt individuals adding that they would soon be astounded when such action was taken by the government, nothing had happened so far in this connection.
Silva said the arresting of corrupt individuals were being needlessly delayed by adducing political reasons.
"When the 2016 Budget was introduced the government willfully postponed action against wrong doers by starting a public debate on the budget. Now such action had been again delayed by starting a dialogue on a new constitution. If this tactic continued, the corrupt individuals and other wrong doers would never be hauled before court," he said.
Silva said the 100 days programme of the government which followed the 2015 Presidential Election, also did nothing about fraud and corruption.
"Only Basil Rajapaksa was arrested and subsequently released. At that time, the IGP issued an order saying no arrests should be made without the recommendations of the Attorney General. This denied the Police the power to arrest culprits after completing investigations. The Attorney General was the intervening agent of the government," he said.
"Even though Police completed investigations, the action due on the part of the government had not been taken.
Now action against corruption had completely stalled after the formation of a coalition government. Although an year had passed after defeating the corrupt the Rajapaksa regime, no one responsible for murders and frauds had been arrested or indicted before court," Silva said.
He said if the government failed to take any action in this regard by unnecessarily killing time, the JVP would launch a public protest campaign within the next few days to prod the government towards taking action against fraudulent and corrupt persons.

Lawmakers' role towards welfare of people
As we have our personal matters to be attended to as families or individuals, we have sought to select, elect and employ groups of people or individuals to attend to the common needs of all of us. For this purpose, as a demarche, we have delimitated our land into two hundred and twenty five divisions calling each a constituency with a constituent elected to every such constituency taking into consideration the manifestos submitted by the candidates who wished to represent us in the respective constituencies to undertake and execute the responsibility of 'serving' us.
These people designated as members and ministers have to gather at the centres at provincial or district levels and in the parliament, to discuss and attend to our needs. As we have elected them on the presumption that they are scholarly, respectable and responsible people, there is an obligation resting with them by virtue of the responsibilities vested in them to deputize us with correctness and dignity of behaviour. This little idea came to me when I recalled the boyhood days I learnt 'Civics' by S.F. De Silva, the late Director of Education.
The prospective candidates who come before us with their policy declarations to serve us as alliances or individuals have become 'rulers' and kind of an unapproachable monsters moments after they are elected.
Peacemaking government
The people's anticipation of a peacemaking government with peaceable representatives in it during every election campaign has somersaulted to become a government to keep the voter under control from the time they assumed duties. Controlling, curtailing, and creating unrest among the people casting aspersions against their predecessors posing themselves as saviours and levelling accusations leading to commotions in the parliament, throwing weight about and displaying the machismo have been the practise of a majority of the parliamentarians (except for the statesmen and intelligentsia among them ever since we began for rule our country by ourselves.
Sixty seven years have elapsed, they have not changed this stratagem and their chameleon style or masquerading and machinations of working for a selected category of people angering all others. As a result, the rest out of the 200 million neglected people in anger begin to plot to topple the government. The last such an event took place on January 8, 2015. Now again, macabre protests and violence have erupted, conspiracies are being hatched and sathyagrahas have been contemplated to disrupt and topple this government too. This is the nature of ruling in our country. However, the machiavellian politicians and their stooges and henchmen did prosperously well during every term whilst the deprived and dissatisfied ordinary citizen organized and conducted 'udgoshana' demanding what they are in need of, unsuccessfully.
Opportunistic countries
We had rulers long ago. Lastly, in the eighteenth century, ending is 1815 because of the dishonesty and disunity of the unscrupuious king and his opportunistic countries. Consequently, we became subjects of kings and queens who lived in foreign country. We reanmiated an administration of ours in 1948 after we regained the country ceded to invaders but, subject to conditions.
Annually, on February 4 we celebrate an independence beginning with razzmatazz and pomp and pageant but ending with least recognition sans the pride of place the celebrities who regained the country diplomatically deserved, namely, the Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake, our first Prime Minister honoured affectionately as "Father of the Nation" and the nationalists and patriots representing the five communities fiz., the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers, every public servant and citizen who were part and parcel of that silent victory. There are schoolchildren in the present day who doesn't know the name of the first Prime Minister which is commonplace in Sri Lanka. To that extent we have forgotten our forefathers and our gratitude to them has diminished.
'Welfare State'
What we had in mind upon liberation from colonialism with bitter experiences was to convert our country to a "Welfare State" of our won to ensure the welfare of ail citizens by means of state operated social services. Unfortunately, as an independence was given subject to conditions our leaders were compelled to continue the same way, overseen by those who gave over. Moreover, a majority of Ceylonese leaders too were in favour of Anglicism. Even after we voted to establish a republic, our Anglicized leaders were least interested about finding out a way of our won thus divisions among the communities continued to prevail as divide and rule policy continued remain. Hence, an administration to fulfil the wishes of all communities of this country has still to come their way.
Rulers have failed everywhere on earth. Not only the man but the nature also has risen against the rulers. Protests and terrorism by the man, the typhoons, tornadoes, torrential rains, deadly floods, storms, wildfires, earthquakes and man rising against the man have made all rulers innocent because of their indecency and dishonesty.
President Maithriplaa Sirisena is a person born great among the ordinary citizen. He has demonstrated his greatness at the ripe time to heal an heart. The prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is a person born with a silver spoon in his mouth to respected parents of this country. Both of them prefers simple living and recognizes and respects the cultures, customs, traditions and rule of law of this country. Suchlike persons can undoubtedly convert this administration to a 'Welfare State' beginning with the new constitution in the pipeline to go for a perestroika in close collaboration with the people to concentrate fully on communal facilities and give up "ruling" which has a bitter taste than in aralu.
The people are fed up of listening to dictates and threats. The people are fond of sincerity and faithfulness. The leaders must be friends of all the people. Then they will share and bear with them at all difficult times. Also, they will retain them with them. They will not let the worthy people go.
Functioning as an 'opponent' has become the responsibility of the 'opposition' opposing every presentation in the house. There is no constructive criticism to drive it the right way if in their opinion the ruling side is erroneous. Why cannot these constituents cooperate and join hands with the government in accordance with the will of the majority of citizens in this democracy to render the 'service' they expect of them
Whenever we tune in to the television we see them quarreling like cats and dogs, whenever we switch on the radio we hear them shouting like lunatics, nothing is peacefully settled and, whenever we spread the broadsheets we read the same repeated in writing. What else can they do in the absence of noteworthy newsworthy material forthcoming Prominence is given in every press to reporting murders, kidnappings, abductions, robberies, accidents, committing suicide, rapes, smuggling, drug trafficking like blood curdling happenings, the order of the day. It is an indication that our country is in a disorderly situation as our representatives have become crabs.
Can the followers go straight When are these people expecting to give up this methodology to behave with decorum to become a gentlefolk, to be punctual, to be in their seats punctually, respect each other and their positions and deal with their subjects with due respects to the 'house' where they assemble because it is a venue provided with for a specific purpose by the people and, the exemplary.

Ledecky crushes 800m freestyle world record
LOS ANGELES, MONDAY: Katie Ledecky crushed her own womens 800m freestyle world record on Sunday, clocking a stunning 8min 6.68sec to win at the Pro Swim meeting in Austin, Texas.
The 18-year-old American obliterated the previous record of 8:07.39 that she set at the 2015 World Championships last August 8 in Kazan, Russia.
It was exciting, said Ledecky, who beat the water in triumph when she saw her time. Its always exciting when you can get pushed along by a crowd like this in Austin.
She upstaged superstar Michael Phelps, who blazed to victory in the 200m individual medley to notch his first win over rival Ryan Lochte in the event since the 2012 London Olympics.
Phelps, whose 18 Olympic gold medals include three in the 200m individual medley, powered through the final 25 meters of the closing freestyle leg to win in 1:58.00sec.
Lochte, the current world record-holder in the event, held a narrow lead at every turn but settled for second in 1:58.43.
Ryan and I have had a lot of great swims with one another, Phelps said.
Joking around with him beforehand, I kind of knew we were going to try to battle it out. I knew it would come down to the touch.
Phelps finished the three-day meet with two victories -- including his 100m butterfly win on Friday -- and a fourth place finish in the 200m freestyle.
We have a couple more meets before (Olympic) trials. Hopefully Ill be better than this, said Phelps, adding that the lower-key meetings are a chance to assess not only his speed but also technical details such as turns as he continues a comeback aimed at adding to his Olympic legacy in Rio.
Ledecky, who was the youngest member of the US Olympic delegation in London four years ago, is on course to build her Games legacy as well.
She now owns the eight fastest performances ever in the 800m free and nine of the top 10.
She also holds the world record in the 400m free and the non-Olympic womens event of 1500m free.
In Rio, Ledecky could line up in the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyles -- and perhaps even the 100m free, in which she finished second in Austin this week. I was feeling good going into it, said Ledecky, who romped home with Becca Mann a distant second in 8:24.49.
Whenever I get going like that, I get into a good rhythm with my freestyle. My stroke just feels good the whole weekend once I have one or two really good freestyle swims.
In other finals on the last night of the meet, Hungarys Iron Lady Katinka Hosszu pulled off a tough double, winning the 200m medley in 2:10.69 shortly after triumphing in 100m backstroke in 59.91.
Singapores Quah Zheng Wen won the mens 200m fly in 1:58.07, coming from fifth at the halfway mark to triumph.

Many in joint opposition to join govt: Sajith
Several joint opposition members will soon join the government, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
Speaking at a public event at Hambatota, Premadasa said that the government was assured of a two thirds majority in Parliament to pass the constitutional reforms.
The minister also predicted that the so-called joint opposition will cease to exist in the near future as most of its members have now realised it has no future.
He said even in the Rajapaksa stronghold of Hambantota, UPFA members who earlier backed the so-called joint opposition were now supporting the government.
Premadasa also denied reports that those joining the government were doing so for positions and perks and added, they were doing so to support the governments development drive and serve the country.
We are making them partners in the governments development drive.
We are giving them responsibilities to make them active stakeholders in this process, he added.
Premadasa said the government had already proved it can obtain a two thirds majority in the House when it passed the last budget.

Salt: Bonds female avatar
Phillip Noyces Salt sees woman of action Angelina Jolie in her usual avatar, the action-packed characters she is so good at playing. This time rounds she is meaner than Mrs Smith yet more skilled than Wanteds Fox and has more depth than Tomb Raiders Lara Croft.
The plot involves CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is accused of being a Soviet sleeper agent on a deadly mission by a Russian defector. She is on the run and plots to gun the Russian president in American soil as he attends a public funeral there. The action thriller starts off in Die Another Day fashion when we see a half-dressed Salt being tortured and interrogated in a North Korean prison cell.
Though Salt has hardly any humour it is full of suspense and action. However the audience are kept in the dark on what exactly Salts identity is and what she intends to do right till the end.
Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt
This only heightens the thrill of watching the movie. Not limiting the scenes to action alone we also get a few incidents which speak of humanity as well as internal conflict.
Dark character
This is a good story which wavers between virtue and evil and keeps us guess on where the main characters loyalties lie. Salt may be portrayed as a dark character at first glance but that is only on the surface.
The balance between the tough act and the vulnerable femininity is nicely brought out when Jolie does the act of a panic-stricken wife desperately searching for her missing archeologist husband.
Another drawback in the action thriller is that Salts romance with her husband is hardly brought to the picture except in a few half hearted flashbacks. However these are not sufficient to capture the essence of their bond or the emotional crisis that she undergoes when her husband is murdered before her eyes.
Salt is clearly Jolies vehicle for her character overshadows the rest in every aspect. Bold action combined with feminine physicality makes her character positively atomic. She is thrilling to watch, swift-footed and makes a few super human moves that one cannot imagine a martial arts warrior performing let alone a trained female agent.
Fortunately Noyce who has credentials like Dead Calm and Patriot Games to his name knows how to direct action with a clear eye. Therefore the film does not suffer because of these drawbacks. Salts escape also signifies that a sequel is in the making.
Action heroine
The movie may have been inspired by JJ Abrams Alias and James Camerons Dark Angel which became popular on the small screen during the era. At the same time one cannot help thinking that this is Noyces idea of moulding the female action heroine who can challenge James Bond or Jason Bourne. At the same time she takes on some tried and tested stunts by Tom Cruise but brings on a freshness to the moves as the feisty heroine. Salt is well crafted yet lacks logic. However it is high on its entertainment value so do not hesitate to pick it off the shelf to rent for the weekend.

## Title: Social surplus, public policy and development

Social surplus, public policy and development
Sri Lanka's post independence economic and social policies facilitated the emergence and expansion of the rural lower middle class. Redistribution of state land through progressive land legislation, establishment of new agricultural settlements and village expansion schemes and the creation of a pervasive state sector prepared the ground for the above development. Introduction of free education up to university level through Swabhasha medium enabled the offspring of the expanding class of land owning peasants to aspire for upward social mobility through education.
In the absence of a vibrant private sector, their aspirations were mostly fulfilled by the state sector. As a result, most of these upwardly mobile youth, after completing their education returned to their villages of origin as school teachers, minor state officials, etc. This pattern continued until the demand for such employment opportunities outstripped supply resulting in widespread unrest among educated youth leading to violent revolt since the early 1970's onwards. The rest is well known history.
Economy was liberalized in the late 1970's to bring an end to state monopolies and create employment opportunities outside the state sector. The post-1977 government placed greater emphasis on the private sector but the significance of the state sector remained as important as ever. Public funds had to be allocated to maintain an excessively large state sector and offer various subsidies to the members of the rural lower middle class such as the fertilizer subsidy, income support, free health, education and other services. Given their relatively low incomes, these subsidies were critically important for them to cope with increasing economic and social pressures.
Public funds
Popular democracies can ignore the hardships and aspirations of a large Lower middle class at their own peril. Sri Lanka has enough experience in this regard. On the other hand, sustaining an expanding lower middle class largely at public expense can be counterproductive in a number of ways. Firstly, state cannot invest enough public funds to raise the standards of public services to make them attractive to all classes. This encourages the well to do to have their own private services in such fields as health, transport and education. Secondly, a dependent, low skilled lower middle class could be hardly expected to play a catalytic role in knowledge driven development. And, finally, in a popular democracy, the members of a largely inward oriented, lower middle class can have a decisive influence on the electoral process with significant political implications.
As is well known, increasing incomes of a sizable segment of the population following economic liberalization led to a steady increase in the demand for private education, both local and overseas. The result was a proliferation of private educational institutions at all levels providing educational credentials sought after by employers in the private corporate sector. Meanwhile, the products of the state sector educational institutions by and large had to rely on the state sector for employment. Given the widening gap between public and private sectors in terms of lucrative employment opportunities, the chances of the members of the rural lower middle class achieving rapid upward social mobility became slim. This of course does not mean that there are no exceptions to the above general pattern.
As is well known, the largest share of the social surplus today is generated by the private sector. On the other hand, the state sector controls only a small proportion of the national wealth. As a result, private consumption far outstrips public consumption. This is the main reason why quality of public services remains much to be desired. So, those who depend on such services are often not satisfied with their quality or adequacy. Widespread use of private tuition even by poor students is illustrative of this reality. What is noteworthy however, is that, even with such additional expenditure, their educational attainments and skills do not reach the standards demanded by corporate sector employers when they recruit managerial staff. So, the youth from a rural lower middle class background are compelled to look for employment in the state sector.
This is the main reason why the Sri Lankan state has come under social and political pressure to absorb educated rural youth into the state sector. This practice has become increasingly more difficult in recent years due to increasing numbers of graduates passing out from state universities. There was a serious graduate unemployment problem even in the early 1970's when the number of universities was just six in comparison to sixteen today. Though many talk about the need to accommodate more undergraduates within the public university system, hardly anyone talks about their employment prospects. As is well known, unemployed graduates usually expect the state institutions to absorb them, irrespective of whether they can be given some useful work or not.
Post-liberalization economy
In the post-liberalization economy of Sri Lanka, the state sector became almost exclusively confined to the service sector. Many productive industrial and agricultural ventures that were part of the state sector from the 1950's to the early 1970's were later privatized. Given the increasing participation of private capital even in such service sector activities as education, health, transport and telecommunications, there are no state monopolies even in these areas today. In other words, the role of the state sector has been drastically cut back in the new liberal economic environment, making it difficult for the governments to create productive employment in the state sector. However, when unproductive employment is created due to social and political pressure, without paving the way for a corresponding expansion of productive employment elsewhere through other state interventions, adequate public funds cannot be generated to be used for improving public services and critical income support programmes. In such a situation, it is the low income groups who suffer most. Many of the latter leave the country looking for more lucrative employment elsewhere.
So, the policy choices that the governments have to make against the above background are complex and are certainly not straight forward. Moreover, ideologically driven public discourses do not help focus attention on critical issues. One of these is the widening gap between productive and unproductive sectors of the economy, leading to monetary expansion, inflation and growing income inequality. Another is the highly inequitable access to the social surplus irrespective of one's actual contribution to it. There is an urgent need to find an optimal, just and rational way to allocate and invest the social surplus to achieve the twin objectives of development and social welfare.
There is obviously a major crisis in the local education system today. On the one hand, there are serious inequities within it. As a result, public education does not provide equal opportunities to all. This situation encourages many to leave the system prematurely and find less optimal solutions to their livelihood problems. Since these youth leave school without any useful skills, most of them either end up in the informal sector or leave the country looking for more lucrative employment overseas. Either way, most of them do not have a stable future. On the other hand, those few who reach the tertiary level are also highly deferentially placed.
A large majority of secondary schools do not have facilities to offer all academic streams of education and, as a result many end up in non- professional streams by default. So, those few who offer professionally oriented courses in Medicine, Engineering, etc. secure lucrative employment in state and private sectors. The vast majority of students with non-professional qualifications end up in lower rung positions in state institutions with few opportunities for upward mobility.
Another major drawback of the education system is that it does not develop the full intellectual potential of children and youth. School children are prepared for memory testing examinations and the efforts of everybody are aimed at best examination results, often impeding the achievement of wider goals of education. As a result, many school leavers and university graduates lack essential life skills, much needed soft skills and other attributes that help youth to make the transition from school to work. This situation naturally has very serious implications for the development of the country. In short, education system helps perpetuate the above situation rather than helping the country to break away from it.
Structural problems
Sri Lanka made a significant transition at the beginning of this year from a semi-authoritarian rule to a more liberally oriented regime. The transition is certainly not without problems. There are many challenges that the country is yet to overcome. First is the economic crisis. Structural problems of the economy are serious and these cannot be easily overcome, unless sound policies are formulated and implemented. But vested interests prevent the implementation of such policies. The recent reversal of many budgetary proposals is indicative of this. The media institutions are not well equipped or informed to handle complex issues and facilitate balanced decisions by the government and other institutions. One fundamental question that the media should have raised and discussed was whether public funds should be given to various interest groups such as Medical doctors, government servants and people's representatives to enjoy private transport at public expense.
In the past, public subsidies were given to such groups to encourage them to use public transport. There were no public agitations against duty concessions on imported cars and the government became increasingly isolated forcing it to give in on an important public policy issue. If this is the way the media, political parties, trade unions and others handle public policy issues, it will not be long before we slide back to very poor governance again with serious consequences for the country and the wider public.

Some guidelines for the new constitution
It is in the Sri Lankan Government's agenda to move a resolution in Parliament for converting the House into a Constitutional Assembly, marking the formal inauguration of the process of making a new Constitution in the place of the 1978 Constitution. Most significant truth of the constituting any constitution is, it must contain living provisions. Instead of mere declarative existence, the pragmatically living life must be its central trait. Otherwise, it will be tantamount to be dead in death. But, for the constitution to live, it should be peopalized. It can be peopalized via protecting their rights, by means of the guarantees of constitutional provisions. Then, it is the people, who truly power the competence of the constitution. Therefore, in any constitutional composition or revision, aimed at the culmination into its fruition, an innovative explosion in to the revolution of peoples' rights and their constitutionalization represents a pivotal importance.
The writer of the present text cannot cover all statutory guiding maxims herein, due to the finite space, available to be accessible. Hence, his humble wish is, to be pertained to some of them that are in correspondence with frustrated times. The writer also proposes the Government, not to limit the constitutional revision, only to a confined set of provisions, amending powers of the President, increasing the competence of the Parliament, relinquishing the proportional representation etc, but to espouse a holistic approach to near the proximity of completion and perfection.
Sri Lanka was an exploited colony, with discernible pluses and condemnable minuses of the British rule. Hence, in the context, it comprises its own historical experience and also the circumstances, occurred subsequent to its independence. That is on one side. On the other, when the first constitution of Sri Lanka was framed, its framers brought to their deliberations a coherent philosophy, to manage the means and ends of the governance. This philosophy of governance incorporated several major political doctrines. Among them are: natural rights, republicanism, and constitutionalism. These ideas were part of the common intellectual currency of eighteenth century of the civilized world.
Right to life (R2L)
The constitutional story of Sri Lanka, related to right to life, is not only infelicitous, but tragical. From the very inception, up to now, no provision in any constitution of this resplendent island has been formulated, to guarantee the right to life to our citizens. The only endeavour to include this inalienable right to the constitution of Sri Lanka was made, by the erstwhile President Chandrika Bandaranaike, back in 2000, when she produced before the Parliament, the Sri Lanka Constitution Bill, the act, to repeal and replace the constitution of Sri Lanka, the Chapter 3, Article 8, Paras:1 & 2, of which wrote:"
(1) Every person has an inherent right to life and a person shall not be arbitrarily deprived of life.
(2) Any restriction shall not be placed on the rights declared and recognized by this Article.
Unfortunately, the proposed constitution contained other issues and on the strength of them, the whole Bill was crushed by the politicians of the then Parliament and along with it, the above right too was quashed. The R2L is the most centro-prominent fundamental right of all human beings and animals. The intensity of its eminence and the extraordinary and outstanding depth of its dominance, not only not debatable and indubitable, but absolutely absolute. As the fundamental law is for the country, so is the R2L for the populace.
R2L Judicial theory
The Jurisprudential interpretation of R2L should not be constrained by its general constitutional declaration, to the exclusion of its statutory depth and legitimate versatility. The R2L, envisaged by the above said Constitution Bill, proposed by the former President CBK, certainly is a very progressive stride in the adventurous journey, yet, not variegated enough, as to be diversified, in order to accommodate, if not all, at least, the majority of jurisprudentially debatable issues and rightly address them, in order to administer justice, to the judicially illiterate and innocent people of this country.
Firstly, the present writer wishes to respectfully draw the kind attention of the constitution framers, to the interpretation and determination of the subjects of the provision in question. Who are the subjects covered by the provision Is it the State or any other department or cooperation, acting on its behalf or at the behest of it Or is it both, the state and its operative organs Are normal citizens, as individuals, included in the doctrinal concept Or are they excluded If a violation of a private individual amounts to the encroachment upon deprivation of another's life, would such infraction fall, within the parameters of the stipulated provision
Tribal traditions
There are laws, grounded on brutal tribal traditions of uncivilized nomadic community of the ancient times. For example, chopping fingers of and beheading the believers of other religions or stoning to death etc. Such uncivilized ancestors of the humanity, though very unfortunate, can be pardoned, since, they, materially and intellectually, were not developed. This is the twenty first century with man, reaching the material moon, which some communities worship, in the recognition of its divinity. Sri Lanka is a land of the Buddha, Lord Krishna, Jesus Christ and with some Islamic community. Here, the absolute majority of religions teach love, loving-kindness, compassion and equality. Therefore, the advent of extremist religions and introduction of their animalistic traditions would contaminate the innocent minds of our people and polarize the populace in to conflicting frictions.
It is really amazing that in some communities, there are laws on divorce, according to which, if a man wishes to divorce his wife, all what he has to do is, call two friends or people walking on the road and pronounce a specific word of their language three times, before the wife and two witnesses. The meaning of the word in English is: "divorced, divorced and divorced" and that's all. As a scholar of International Law, back in the university, abroad, while listening to the professor, I and many other friends-students stunned in to speechlessness and could not believe in our own eyes.
Therefore, a provision should be made for the new constitution, disallowing and prohibiting the introduction, teaching and practice of such tribal traditions in this beautiful country, as a device to depolarize all the communities, conditioning their unity, understanding, sharing friendship and cooperation.
Natural rights
Formulating the constitutional provisions, the framers should wish to think seriously about government and, there are certain basic questions, Lankans must pose. For example, we need to figure out, how legitimate governments are established, or to put it in slightly different terms, it should be asked, "What is the foundation of legitimate political authority" The people also will want to determine, what the extent of political authority ought to be. Should political authority extend to all aspects of life or only to certain of our actions This question is closely related to the problem of deciding, why we need a constitution and a government at all. To figure out, why we would prefer to live under a constitution-governed government, than to have no government, is to answer one of the basic questions of governance philosophy and will help us to determine, what constitution type, the people should decide on and what governance, the instituted Government must execute.
Sri Lanka has to make an earnest choice. That is to continue with a strong presidential system or to create a blended model with president and parliament or to design a supreme parliament. As for the presidential system, Sri Lankans had enough of it with differing political leaders. The practice has demonstrated that a strong president is a post, pregnable with the potentiality of danger, which may obliterate the freedoms and democracies of the people, to a perceptible degree. Therefore, a polity, rooted in civilized democratic principles, which would protect inalienable rights of all individuals of the island, is a sine qua non, for any constitution to be framed for Sri Lanka.
There is a reason for it. The individuals possess these rights, not because of politicians, but, simply by virtue of their humanity. They antedate the existence of any constitution, politician or a government. The authority exercised by governments, is exerted, on the basis of the consent of the governed and they consent to the execution of that authority, in order to acquire security for their natural rights to life, liberty and properties.
Hence, the constitution designing legal experts must be theoretically well-armed with the best answers for couple of questions, in order to discard the despotism of dictators.
The example of history cannot be viewed as authoritative. History will show what has been and not what should be. Many rulers have acquired power simply by deceiving the trusting public of innocence. After capturing power, it was used primarily to aggrandize themselves. This, however, generally cannot be regarded as an example of legitimate political authority and its validated use. To determine the difference between legitimate and illegitimate political authority, we must engage in a contemplative philosophical reflection, in which, we attempt to make arguments, supporting our view of the difference, between good and bad governance of Governments, in the plenitudinal spirit of constitutional consistency.
Social contract
It is seen that in some countries, in framing the contents of constitutions, the framers formulate such legal provisions, empowering the Head of the State, not to be subject to the law of the country, violating the principle of all-pervading equality of all, before the law. This unfortunate state of despotism is due to lack of knowledge or by reason of intentional abuse of the power, consented and delegated by the general public. This is just an occasion, no constitution composer could miss. Yet, how this consent is granted It was originally given through the social contract, in which, the individuals give up the natural liberty they enjoyed, in the state of nature, in exchange for the civil liberty, possessed by the citizens of politically democratized and constitutionalized society. The difference between the two is: "The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of Nature for his rule and role. The liberty of man in society is to be under no other legislative power, but to be under that, established by consent of the community. Nor to be under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but, to be ruled, by what the legislative shall enact, according to the trust consciously deposited in it. The freedom of men under a constitutionalized government, is to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it, by the social contract of people's consent. One of the prerogatives, the appointed Sri Lankan team for the revision of the constitution should bear in their minds is, not the elite, comprising the handful, but the general public, constituting the totality of the community. No constitution could be legitimate in the void of the respect to the social contract.
Extent and end
It is really inquisitive to identify the extent and end of government's authority to be constitutionalized. The great and chief end, therefore, of men, uniting into socialized communities, and putting themselves under a constitutionalized government, is the preservation of their rights and property. The power of the society or the legislative, constituted by them, can never be supposed to extend farther than the common good. The exercise of political authority thorough governance, granted by the constitution, ought to be limited to those actions, which are necessary for the accomplishment of those tasks, for which that authority was established. What are those tasks They are: the attainment of security for the lives, liberties, and estates of the citizens.
What this means, of course, is that in addition to believing that political authority, engendered by the constitution, must be based on socio-contractual consent and it has to be organized in such a fashion, that, it could not be exercised in arbitrary ways. Yet, the liberty of a political society consists in being subject, only to the lawfully constituted and exercised authority, to which, people have consented. The problem at this point of framing the constitution of Sri Lanka is, to find a way of organizing the governance of the government, in such a manner, that it will do only those things, which government is supposed to do.
Self-evident articulation
The most important phrase, the depth of the constitutional insight of Sri Lanka, ineluctably must comprise is, "We hold above truths to be self-evident". To be self-evident, the constituting terminology of the constitution must be comprehensible and after the comprehension it should be able to be apprehensible. Now, the comprehensibility and the subsequent apprehensibility demand linguistic simplicity. The much clamoured noise, that the terminology of the fundamental law of the country cannot be articulated in simple linguistics, is an old cry of condemnable boredom, which leads no one to anywhere. Those, who yell thus, are from among those, with vested interest, wishing to seed the innocent people in the ambiguous constitutional obscurity, in order to castrate the power of their individuality, converting them in to spados and impotents. This is one sine qua non, the framers of the Sri Lanka constitution, must be pragmatic about. And the proposal should not be confined only to English, but to all three languages, including Sinhala and Tamil.
